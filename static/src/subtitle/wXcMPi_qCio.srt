1
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,240
Okay, thanks so much for being here first thing in the morning.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,221
I think we're going to get started.

3
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:10,041
We're right at 10.

4
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:12,902
So I am Bonnie Rueberg.

5
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,003
I go by Bo.

6
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,824
I use they, them pronouns.

7
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:20,586
And I'm going to be talking to you about what to do when toxic gamer culture enters the

8
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,267
classroom.

9
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:26,629
A quick note, I'm not going to be talking explicitly about details of violence, but

10
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,030
I will be discussing experiences of harassment.

11
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:33,053
By the way, it's totally fine to tweet this talk.

12
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,114
I am at my own Valeria on Twitter.

13
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,096
I just ask that you please don't use hashtags

14
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:41,498
that are there to alert specific harassment groups.

15
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,419
I think I know, you know what I mean.

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,661
So a little bit about me and where I'm coming from.

17
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,382
I'm currently an assistant professor

18
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,403
at the University of California, Irvine.

19
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,904
Previously, I've worked at the University

20
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:56,105
of Southern California and also at Berkeley.

21
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,402
As an educator, I tend to teach courses that are about games and culture,

22
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:04,424
primarily for undergrad programs where students are learning to become

23
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,306
game designers or game programmers.

24
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:09,008
So I'm thinking about the kind of cultural, social side,

25
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:12,650
but my students are often there for more technical or development skills.

26
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,594
I'm also a queer person and a gender non-binary person.

27
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,996
This is the bumper sticker that's currently on the back of my car.

28
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,218
I'm pretty sure it's the world's best bumper sticker.

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,000
My research is also on LGBT issues in games.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,402
I believe in intersectional feminism and social justice.

31
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,743
So I'm telling you these things because they shape

32
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:36,404
how I approach games education,

33
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:40,086
but also because they shape how students interact with me,

34
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,427
how they react to me.

35
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:46,169
This is a quick, totally shameless plug for my book,

36
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,390
which just came out like two days ago.

37
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,011
It's called Video Games Have Always Been Queer.

38
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:57,398
Thank you, I will take all the applause I can get.

39
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,659
So it is about how video games,

40
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:04,620
even when they don't seem to include LGBT representation,

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
can be understood queerly through interpretation,

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,281
through play, and through design.

43
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,401
If that sounds like something you're into,

44
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,442
or something you think your students might be into,

45
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,442
come say hi, I'd love to tell you more about it.

46
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,403
So here's the big question that I wanna tackle today.

47
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:27,807
How do we, as game educators, teach students who are skeptical, resistant, or even hostile

48
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:28,808
towards diversity?

49
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:34,712
So when I say hostile towards diversity, I mean hostile towards either diverse instructors

50
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,235
or towards learning about diversity issues in the classroom.

51
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:41,117
We all care about our students.

52
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:43,378
I think we're here because we care about education,

53
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:45,658
and we really want to think the best of them.

54
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:48,259
But the reality right now is that,

55
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,939
for many university-level game instructors,

56
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,980
especially folks who have been marginalized

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,260
in games cultures, so people like women,

58
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,701
non-binary folks, queer folks, folks of color,

59
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,502
we're finding ourselves facing identity-based discrimination

60
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,842
and even harassment from our own students.

61
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,163
We all know that games culture can be toxic.

62
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:14,459
But toxic gamer culture isn't just something that exists somewhere out there on the internet.

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,741
It's also in our classrooms.

64
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:22,744
More and more, I find that when I teach new students about discriminatory online culture,

65
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:27,447
I'm also teaching students who are participating in discriminatory online culture.

66
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:33,451
So what do we do when we experience problematic interactions with students around these issues

67
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,973
and how do we thrive as instructors in the face of potential harm?

68
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,569
There's a lot to talk about here.

69
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,650
This is a really big issue.

70
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,851
I'm gonna just talk you through some kind of main points,

71
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:45,852
so here's what I'm gonna cover.

72
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:49,374
I'll give you a quick primer on toxic gamer culture,

73
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,476
which basically boils down to it is totally a thing.

74
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:57,504
I'll talk about what happens when that toxicity intersects

75
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,585
with games education, so how it manifests in the classroom,

76
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,506
but also outside of the classroom.

77
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:06,747
To illustrate some of this in action, I'm going to walk you

78
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,788
through a kind of quick post-mortem of a course

79
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:12,250
that I taught last year where my TAs and I really wrestled

80
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,050
with these issues.

81
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:18,375
I'll talk about some of the particular challenges and potential negative effects of dealing

82
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,919
with toxic gamer students, so these are things that I learned through teaching this course.

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,246
And I'm going to bring us around to actionable steps, what we can do to make sure that being

84
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:34,613
diverse or encouraging students to think about culture in diverse ways isn't grounds to turn

85
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:35,855
a teacher into a target.

86
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,748
And more specifically, those actionable steps

87
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,631
are going to be oriented towards educators

88
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:44,914
who are affecting or who are experiencing

89
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:48,438
this toxic environment, the colleagues

90
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:51,601
of marginalized educators who are affected by this,

91
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:54,665
and then also folks who are in charge of game programs

92
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,747
or even institutions at a sort of higher level.

93
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:04,793
I'm going to be drawing from my experience teaching at three different institutions.

94
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:09,675
I've also had a ton of kind of behind the scenes, off the record, anonymous conversations

95
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:13,756
with colleagues at other institutions, many of the institutions that you may represent

96
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:14,416
here in the room.

97
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,937
So this is not just a me problem.

98
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,438
This is a broader problem.

99
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,531
You may be thinking already, I'm not really a diversity person.

100
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,192
I teach technical classes, and this isn't my thing.

101
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,053
Maybe not, because you're here first thing in the morning

102
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:33,593
to hear about this, which I appreciate.

103
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:37,935
But whoever you are and whatever you teach, this is your thing.

104
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,255
It's everybody's thing.

105
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:43,156
It's a thing for educators on the front lines,

106
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,357
but it's also a thing for the colleagues of those educators,

107
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,978
especially colleagues who think about themselves as allies.

108
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:54,727
So let's get into this first topic, toxic gamer culture.

109
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,928
I'm gonna start with a fun fact.

110
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,031
I am probably going to get harassed for giving this talk.

111
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:06,833
I don't know what form that harassment is gonna take.

112
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,115
It might be a flood of angry social media posts.

113
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:13,236
It might be menacing emails from strangers.

114
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,057
I've been doing this for a long time.

115
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:16,998
I've been working in this area for 14 years,

116
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:18,479
so I have seen it all.

117
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,498
But what's notable is that I'm not just going to get harassed for being a feminist

118
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:27,160
or being a queer activist who works in games,

119
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,204
I'm going to be harassed for being a games educator.

120
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:35,029
I gave a short talk two years ago here in the Educator Summit

121
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:39,133
about how we need to teach our students not just to make games that are technically strong,

122
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,256
but that are socially engaged and politically aware.

123
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,283
And if we think about any other medium, how we would teach it,

124
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:48,585
that's a totally obvious statement.

125
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,208
But because I was talking about games,

126
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,732
and specifically because I was talking about how to teach games,

127
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,795
the internet got pissed.

128
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,039
For a whole bunch of days...

129
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:07,777
Following that talk, my Twitter notifications were just a fire hose of angry people,

130
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:10,638
a number of whom identified themselves as students,

131
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:15,220
raging at this idea that video games could be taught as objects of culture.

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,661
That's toxic gamer culture.

133
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,582
So what do I mean when I say that?

134
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:26,344
I mean this culture that has grown up around video games,

135
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,765
a kind of dominant culture that's grown up around video games.

136
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:32,938
that privileges players who fit this mold of the traditional gamer.

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,062
White, straight, cisgender men and boys who play hardcore games.

138
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:43,387
At the same time, this culture devalues and often actively discriminates against

139
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,229
those of us who are seen as different, who don't fit that mold.

140
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:50,642
Toxic gamer culture insists that video games need protecting

141
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:53,666
from social justice warriors who will spoil them

142
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,110
with cultural analysis and diverse representation.

143
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,895
It also longs for this imagined time past

144
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,260
when men were men and video games were video games.

145
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:07,835
Toxic gamer culture has been around for a really long time.

146
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:08,876
It's not a new thing.

147
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,500
But it's kind of come to the fore and come to a head

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,004
in recent years alongside major online harassment campaigns

149
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:17,887
and the rise of certain affiliated political groups.

150
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:22,093
It's more prominent, prevalent, and insidious now than ever.

151
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,136
If you want to learn more about toxic gamer culture,

152
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,459
or if you're feeling skeptical about what I'm saying to you,

153
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,041
and you want some research to back it up,

154
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,244
there are tons of folks doing work on this area.

155
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:35,567
These are just three recent books that I recommend.

156
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,669
Gaming Masculinity by Megan Condis,

157
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:40,292
Toxic Geek Masculinity by Anastasia Salter

158
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,673
and Bridget Blodgett,

159
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,777
and The Toxic Meritocracy of Video Games by Christopher Paul.

160
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,218
All of them are great.

161
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,286
I also know that there are plenty of you in this audience

162
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:55,150
who don't need to be convinced that toxic gamer culture

163
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,595
is a thing because you're experiencing it firsthand.

164
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,239
And I just want you to know that I see you, right?

165
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,983
I value you and I see that you're having that experience.

166
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,001
For a lot of us, toxic gamer culture,

167
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,163
this kind of looming threat of the potential of harassment,

168
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,945
is the background to making, playing, studying,

169
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,205
or teaching video games.

170
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,406
It's there constantly.

171
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,748
It's like a background radiation almost,

172
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,109
except that sometimes it explodes

173
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,350
and comes into the foreground.

174
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,531
Okay, so let's talk about the relationship between toxic gamer culture and games education.

175
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:37,593
And just a note, my focus here is on the experience that educators have with toxic students, or

176
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,674
students who are behaving in toxic ways.

177
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:43,835
But there are whole other parts of this conversation we could have that are also important.

178
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,537
So peer-to-peer toxicity, student-to-student, or we could also talk about toxicity between

179
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:54,559
colleagues, right, between faculty or admins within a games education program.

180
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,221
So before we dig into this intersection of toxicity

181
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,982
in games education, I want to ask you a couple questions.

182
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,184
You don't have to answer these questions out loud.

183
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,805
I just want to give you a moment to ponder them.

184
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,006
Here's the first one.

185
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,927
Have you ever felt unsafe in the classroom?

186
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,128
So unsafe might mean physically unsafe,

187
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,449
or it might mean that the classroom felt

188
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,331
like an actively hostile, emotional, or social

189
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:25,951
environment.

190
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:34,014
Here's the second one.

191
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:38,578
Has a student ever acted negatively towards you

192
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:40,039
because of your identity?

193
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,440
So not just negatively in general.

194
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,843
I think we all run into students who are feeling grumpy,

195
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,565
or they've got things going on in their lives,

196
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:49,867
but they act negatively towards you because of your identity.

197
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,330
So that would be a negative interaction with a student

198
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,932
that you're pretty sure was motivated in part

199
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:59,916
by your gender, or your race, or your sexuality, or disability,

200
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,597
or body type, things like that.

201
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,248
So, is that something that's happened?

202
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,520
For some of you, the answers to those questions were yes.

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,462
Yes, I felt unsafe.

204
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,344
Yes, I've been discriminated against.

205
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,866
But for some of you, the answer is no.

206
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,409
And for those of you who answered no,

207
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,591
it's particularly important to confront the fact

208
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:29,374
that even if you're not personally experiencing

209
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:32,758
this behavior, there is toxicity in our classrooms.

210
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:34,880
It's happening even if it's not happening to you.

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,462
I know this is uncomfortable to admit.

212
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:40,404
I for one really love teaching.

213
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:44,468
So I think one of the things that I find just emotionally really hard about this issue is

214
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,009
that I love teaching students.

215
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,471
I love teaching undergrads.

216
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:53,357
And when the environment is right, when you have a diverse group in a small enough classroom,

217
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:58,161
you can have a real conversation, you have these awesome, amazing students who are willing

218
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,463
to dig into big issues.

219
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,787
But for a lot of us, we don't teach in these small, intimate classrooms.

220
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:07,188
We teach at large universities like I do.

221
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:12,531
And we often find ourselves teaching these kind of big, faceless rooms of people.

222
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,273
We heard at the HFGA event last night that we're seeing more and more women

223
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,154
come out of games programs. That's awesome.

224
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,935
But the overwhelming majority is still male.

225
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:27,378
So the folks who we're teaching are still often tied to this toxic gamer population.

226
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,439
Many of our students see themselves as technical.

227
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,459
I think that's a big part of this education track as well,

228
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,740
that we're thinking about how to give students

229
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,320
technical or design skills.

230
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,501
But when they see themselves as purely technical,

231
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,301
they often resent the idea of learning

232
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,462
about games and culture.

233
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,842
And I've encountered this firsthand a ton.

234
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:48,942
They feel like those classes are requirements,

235
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:50,103
they have to get out of the way,

236
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,083
and they resent that their time is being wasted

237
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,464
thinking about the cultural implications of games.

238
00:12:57,185 --> 00:13:00,034
So in that environment, when we try to teach these students,

239
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:02,281
we're often met with hostility.

240
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,011
This is true in lots of areas of education today.

241
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,412
It's not just a games thing.

242
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:11,473
So we've seen folks who've been called out by their students

243
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:15,474
and had their information sent off to right-wing news sources.

244
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,695
We've seen professors kind of driven off campus.

245
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:19,816
We've seen bomb threats.

246
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,437
But games are a lightning rod for this.

247
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:25,838
It's not that games aren't tied to larger cultural issues.

248
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,179
It's that games are this kind of microcosm

249
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:31,540
where the larger cultural issues have just exploded.

250
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:38,804
Here's how Emma Vossen, who's a fellow feminist game scholar and an educator, talks about this.

251
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:43,787
And I'm really indebted to Emma because she's been really bold and really brave and really

252
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:49,310
like emotionally open about what she's experienced in the classroom. She says,

253
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,553
I've become more and more nervous around my students.

254
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:59,464
Any one of them could write a Reddit thread about their professor being a social justice warrior,

255
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:04,549
or they could be recording you, waiting for you to give them a bad grade to retaliate against you.

256
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,415
The hate mob that looms around you is like a giant weapon that any of your students could wield.

257
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,117
This is more than just tough students.

258
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:17,379
This is being in the same room with someone who would probably send you death threats

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
if you weren't their teacher.

260
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:23,102
And I think what's important to point out about that beyond just the intensity of that,

261
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:26,704
right, that's very real, is also that this is not just tough students.

262
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:31,125
This is a broader cultural issue that these students are being sucked into and they're

263
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,486
kind of repeating back to us.

264
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:40,650
So I want to make a radical statement, right, which is that teaching games

265
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,211
teaching game students about diversity or teaching game students while being

266
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:49,412
diverse should not be grounds for harassment.

267
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:51,973
And at this point,

268
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:57,615
I love the clap.

269
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,316
Y'all clap for strange things.

270
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,878
At this point you might be thinking of some objections, right?

271
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:09,358
You might be thinking.

272
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:14,148
This sounds rough, right, that sucks for you,

273
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,489
but it's not a problem at my game program.

274
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,169
It's not a problem at my game program, right?

275
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,670
My program is different,

276
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,951
my program doesn't have these issues.

277
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,591
Let me tell you something,

278
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,032
no game program is exempt from this.

279
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:30,613
It is true to some extent of all schools,

280
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,674
and it's true that if you have a larger student body,

281
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:34,155
if you have a more technical student body,

282
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:35,715
if your gender ratio is different,

283
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,235
it may well be different,

284
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:40,336
but no game program is exempt from this.

285
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:47,830
Even if your student body is diverse, right, this is still the air that our students breathe.

286
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,534
So when they go online, this is the culture that they take in, so this is the culture

287
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,875
they have to give back to us.

288
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,680
You may also be thinking.

289
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,512
Isn't this just the same thing as when students speak up

290
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:06,795
because they are offended about something

291
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:07,957
that you assigned to read, right?

292
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,018
They want content warnings.

293
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,199
They want trigger warnings.

294
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,122
They seem to be using these weird they, them pronouns.

295
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:15,325
Aren't you also being oppressed because

296
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,486
of that as an instructor?

297
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:18,468
And the answer is no.

298
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,527
This is about vectors of power, right?

299
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,890
This is about students who hold positions of privilege

300
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,634
trying to be hostile towards or even harass

301
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:32,956
teachers who are in marginalized positions.

302
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,998
So no, when your students speak up,

303
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,260
they want more social justice, they want better readings,

304
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,541
they want better representation,

305
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,683
that is definitely a different thing.

306
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:46,259
To be able to address this, we need to start to see it.

307
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,100
So especially for those of you

308
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,501
this might not be happening to,

309
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,443
you might not be able to see all the ways it's playing out

310
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,703
because it doesn't always look like

311
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:56,125
what you might expect harassment to look like.

312
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:01,267
There are a few places that it plays out primarily.

313
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,908
The first one is in the classroom itself.

314
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,131
I've added cupcakes to these because,

315
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,472
screw it, it sucks, right?

316
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,893
So we might as well have cupcakes.

317
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:13,585
is my feeling.

318
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,946
So the first place that this manifests

319
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,706
is in bad faith questions.

320
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,367
So what I mean is, you may be giving a talk

321
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,847
about the cultural meaning of games,

322
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,647
and you may have a student at the back of the room

323
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,308
who raises their hand and says,

324
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,888
yeah, but aren't games really just for fun?

325
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,649
Do they even mean anything?

326
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,629
And in some ways, that's a valid question,

327
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:34,870
but you can often tell, you develop a sense

328
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,330
when that question is sincere,

329
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,190
when that question is in bad faith,

330
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,051
and it's trying to rouse a fight.

331
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:43,381
Cred checking.

332
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,383
So this most often happens, unsurprisingly,

333
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,463
to women, non-binary folks, folks of color,

334
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:51,825
but the idea here is to challenge you and say,

335
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:56,147
you're my professor, but you don't really look like a gamer,

336
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,048
which is a sentence that gets uttered verbatim

337
00:17:59,148 --> 00:17:59,808
very frequently.

338
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:03,290
Can you prove it, right?

339
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,410
What are you playing right now?

340
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,431
Did you play that game all the way to the end?

341
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:07,812
So that's cred checking.

342
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:10,233
Disruptive behavior.

343
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:15,020
You might have a large room of people and you have students who are sitting there talking

344
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,591
loudly to each other or they're using kind of aggressive body language to try and disrupt

345
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:21,272
the classroom.

346
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,701
Inappropriate comments about the instructor.

347
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:29,143
So this comes from an anecdote that sounds really unpleasant from a colleague who was

348
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:34,106
using one of the pieces of software that allows your students to anonymously respond to questions

349
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,027
that you pose while you're teaching.

350
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:41,709
And when she showed the answers up on the board, they were all comments about her body.

351
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,012
So they said things like, she's too hot to know anything about games.

352
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:49,723
in the middle of the classroom, right?

353
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,025
So what do you do when that's the reality

354
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,226
of the people sitting in front of you

355
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,687
and you didn't even know it

356
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,110
until they start putting those comments up?

357
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,492
Sometimes you get walkouts.

358
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,854
So you'll be talking about something

359
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,596
and a student will sort of in a huff,

360
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,517
stand up and walk out,

361
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,580
which is a kind of physical display of displeasure.

362
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,741
It's a performance.

363
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:14,686
But then this hostility also bleeds outside of the classroom.

364
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:18,121
So we see it, oh, there are dolphins this time.

365
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,184
I also like dolphins.

366
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:26,997
So we see it on essays and tests, anywhere that the students write comments.

367
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:32,482
So I've had a test question that was thinking about intersectional identities and asked

368
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:37,626
about is whiteness part of an intersectional identity, and the answer is yes.

369
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,308
Any identities that intersect we could talk about is intersectional.

370
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:47,154
And the student was very angry, and we got a long screed, me and the TAs, that was cursing

371
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,815
at us about this question.

372
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,617
So it appears places like that.

373
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,362
Disrespecting TAs, so TAs are another big part of this.

374
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,723
If you're teaching large classes,

375
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,644
if you're in an institution with grad students,

376
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:02,045
you may well be responsible for your TAs.

377
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,527
So how to protect them from this hostile behavior.

378
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,183
One-on-one meeting, so sometimes students will come to your office and kind of use physical

379
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,946
hostility, use verbal hostility to try and intimidate you.

380
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:20,749
So this is one where I highly recommend always leaving your office door open.

381
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:26,453
I had a student once come to my office and tell me he was just so angry about all the

382
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,975
LGBT people, he wanted to hurt someone.

383
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:35,280
And what do you do with that as an instructor sitting across, you know, from someone in

384
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,600
a room?

385
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:40,560
Sometimes you get this kind of peer to peer trash talk that's also meant to be performative,

386
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,046
so a student will very vocally go around to their peers and be like, that Professor Rueberg,

387
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:46,948
they're horrible.

388
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,491
And the point is to circulate it within the program.

389
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,195
And then teacher evaluations.

390
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,597
So this is a particularly tricky one,

391
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,899
especially for those of you who rely on these

392
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,561
for like your personnel reviews, for your tenure reviews.

393
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,623
They will leave comments on evaluations

394
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,965
that are things like, and you can hear a lot of my examples

395
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,907
are from LGBT stuff, because that's what I teach,

396
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:08,930
but things like, this professor has a gay agenda.

397
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:12,874
They are a bad professor, because they didn't give

398
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,136
equal weight to the other side of the argument,

399
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,438
which is that gay people are bad.

400
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:24,541
I am just totally unwilling to give equal weight to an argument that gay people are

401
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:24,881
bad.

402
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,483
And that sometimes they post online.

403
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:32,266
So sites like Rate My Professor, they might go on Reddit, like the quote from Emma Vossen

404
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,907
suggested, these public forums.

405
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:38,166
But then there's a place where this hostility

406
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:39,887
in the classroom, out of the classroom,

407
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:41,528
which is always kind of fuzzy, right?

408
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:44,130
Like what constitutes harassment is always kind of fuzzy.

409
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,693
But there are moments when that line gets less blurry

410
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:51,375
and it very clearly transitions into harassment.

411
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:54,462
You get pizza this time.

412
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:55,502
This is the last of them.

413
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,643
You got cupcakes.

414
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,963
Oh, there's like a food thing.

415
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:58,683
Anyway.

416
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,304
So sometimes you end up with threatening messages, right?

417
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:05,786
So direct contact from students, sometimes anonymized,

418
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,086
but very clearly from students.

419
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:14,208
I got one last year that said, I'll try not to curse at you.

420
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,149
You are a communist, and it's disgusting, right?

421
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,450
Am I a communist?

422
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:19,830
I don't know.

423
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,611
That's interesting.

424
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,311
But apparently it's disgusting.

425
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,558
Sometimes you get physical intimidation.

426
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,899
So people very clearly using being in small spaces with you.

427
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,380
I had a student who was very prone to come up to me, stand kind of square, look at me

428
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,801
with like dead eyes and say almost nothing.

429
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,262
And that is clearly an intimidation tactic.

430
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,942
And then things start to blow up from there.

431
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:51,663
So when students start reaching out intentionally to online harassers.

432
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,188
things can very quickly escalate.

433
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,309
So there is a culture of students sending syllabi

434
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,071
to larger harassment campaigns or notifying folks,

435
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,131
you know, there's a day in class

436
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:03,492
where we're gonna talk about feminism.

437
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:04,873
Come and help out.

438
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:09,675
And what happens is they send agents into your classroom.

439
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:13,276
So this is a kind of organized harassment campaign technique.

440
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,402
where folks show up in your classroom who are not enrolled,

441
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,323
and they try to document you and intimidate you,

442
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:22,723
and I'll talk more about that in a sec.

443
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:28,365
So it becomes this whole big muddle of different techniques,

444
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:31,166
and you can see how together they're a broader picture

445
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,346
of toxic behavior, hostile behavior,

446
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,507
even though each one individually

447
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,248
may not seem like such a big deal.

448
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:41,429
So let's see how this played out in this particular course.

449
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,070
I was making this slide yesterday

450
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,331
when I was sitting in another session

451
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,453
and the person behind me like visibly groaned.

452
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:55,179
Which I'm really happy about.

453
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,863
So, my first quarter teaching at my current institution,

454
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:04,706
which was the fall of 2017, I was given this class.

455
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:05,787
It's not a class I designed,

456
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,228
but it's a class that's regularly taught.

457
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:08,689
It's called Games and Society.

458
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,432
So that's a big thing, right?

459
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,395
all of games, all of society.

460
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:18,902
We teach on the quarter system, so all of those things

461
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:20,724
in a 10-week course.

462
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,879
This is kind of the basic information about it.

463
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,299
This is what I knew, right?

464
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,521
We had 260 students, quite a lot of students.

465
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,662
We had three TAs and one reader,

466
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:36,883
so I intentionally picked TAs and a reader

467
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,704
who were women or non-binary folks.

468
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:42,706
I wanted the students to see that the experts in the room

469
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:45,807
were not necessarily cis men, which is great.

470
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,308
They were wonderful, but it opens up

471
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,109
a whole other host of ethical questions.

472
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:56,633
The majority of them were computer science majors, or what we call at UCI, computer game science majors.

473
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:00,735
So they were very technical students.

474
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:05,757
75% of them were freshmen, since it was a fall class, and 90% of them were men.

475
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:08,379
So that's quite a breakdown.

476
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:13,193
But there were other things that I didn't realize were going to affect how the course

477
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,434
worked and things that you might want to think about as well.

478
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,636
So it was a required course.

479
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,317
It's actually their required intro course.

480
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:24,220
So it was their very first introduction to being there and they felt like they were just

481
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,340
forced into it, right?

482
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,861
It started them off on a bad foot.

483
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:32,325
It was also the only course that they were going to take in their entire education in

484
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,406
this major that was about culture.

485
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:39,300
So it was a like, check off the box, get out, get your EZA,

486
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,061
get out the other side.

487
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:47,346
When I was prepping to teach this course, I kind of knew

488
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:48,446
there were going to be problems.

489
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,908
Like I said, I've been doing this for a while.

490
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:53,430
I've always had problem students here or there at

491
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,171
other institutions.

492
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,313
So I started asking around for resources.

493
00:25:57,993 --> 00:26:00,695
What happens if I have a student who's aggressive in

494
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:01,356
the classroom?

495
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,196
What happens?

496
00:26:03,717 --> 00:26:05,598
If the students are generally kind of toxic,

497
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:06,858
like, what are these students like?

498
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:08,999
Right, what should I do with this new group of students

499
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:09,679
I'm getting to know?

500
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,980
And the response I got from my super well-intentioned, super

501
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,921
lovely colleagues, who I am thrilled to work with,

502
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:19,182
was amazingly unhelpful.

503
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:24,383
I had one professor, who I respect a ton, say to me,

504
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:26,464
kind of look at me like, I don't really

505
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,444
know what you're talking about.

506
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:29,945
But just be nice to your students,

507
00:26:30,385 --> 00:26:31,505
and they'll be nice to you.

508
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,522
If anybody has experienced harassment on the internet

509
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:38,403
or in your classroom, you know that this is not correct,

510
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,464
right, it's not about being mean.

511
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,545
Often, actually, when we're nice,

512
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,265
that's when we open ourselves up,

513
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,606
we make ourselves vulnerable,

514
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,087
especially as people who read as women in the classroom.

515
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,088
I was also trying to find resources

516
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:54,810
for what to do with students who were being disruptive,

517
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,251
right, and the university had all these resources

518
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,331
for what to do if your student

519
00:26:58,371 --> 00:26:59,992
is having a mental health crisis.

520
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,908
like one solo student having a mental health crisis.

521
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:06,289
But this is not a mental health crisis.

522
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,750
This is a broader cultural issue.

523
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,251
It's a systemic issue.

524
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,272
And there were no resources in place

525
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,732
for dealing with something like that.

526
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,374
So what it meant is that when I went into the classroom,

527
00:27:17,894 --> 00:27:19,895
I had this experience I've never had before

528
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,076
in about a decade of teaching,

529
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,497
which is that when I looked out at this room,

530
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:26,398
it was just a sea.

531
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,679
It was a sea of dudes.

532
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,642
And it was a sea of hostile faces.

533
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:34,903
And I think that that's probably an overreaction

534
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:36,024
to a certain extent, right?

535
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:39,164
It's a kind of vocal minority,

536
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,905
but a very present minority.

537
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,166
And it's hard when you're standing in front of a room,

538
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:45,066
you wanna be generous, you wanna be present,

539
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:46,267
you're there for them to learn,

540
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,348
to be seeing the faces that are scowling at you

541
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,268
and kind of shooting hate at you.

542
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,037
So we wrestled with that, me and my TAs,

543
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:00,138
until we hit a day where it just felt like

544
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:02,039
this is too much, right?

545
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,560
This has gone beyond.

546
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
And what happened is we had a day on the syllabus

547
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,581
that was the gender day, right?

548
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:10,322
We kind of, in 10 weeks, you can't do a whole lot,

549
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,583
so we just had little smatterings of things, right?

550
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,944
Day on disability, day on race, day on this,

551
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:16,645
and we had one gender day.

552
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,206
I've got lots of radical,

553
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:20,847
pain-in-the-ass feelings about gender,

554
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,665
This class was not about that, right?

555
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,807
This was like the world's tamest gender class.

556
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,090
Designed not to like get me harassed.

557
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:31,851
And yet.

558
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:42,460
When I stood up in front of the podium, something was weird, because I had a policy of not wanting

559
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,303
students to use screens, and I've kind of backed off of that, but that's a separate

560
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:47,084
pedagogical thing.

561
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:53,469
And there were all these people in the audience holding up their phones and clearly actively

562
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,190
recording.

563
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:58,873
And I said something to them from the podium, and I said, like, hey, folks, remember, we

564
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,455
don't have, we have a policy of not doing that.

565
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:01,976
And they just didn't stop.

566
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,295
And it started to feel like the room was fuller

567
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:06,296
than it normally was.

568
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,918
So I had my TAs do a head count.

569
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,122
And it turned out that there were 11 extra people

570
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:13,583
in the room.

571
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:17,046
And we know it was precisely 11 people who weren't enrolled

572
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,908
because they took a pop quiz that day.

573
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,590
And the people who were there filming us

574
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:22,952
took the damn pop quiz.

575
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,548
They took the quiz but they all put pseudonyms on it.

576
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:33,689
So I was able to go through the whole directory for UCI

577
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,850
and figure out that none of those were real names.

578
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,551
So this was a coordinated effort.

579
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:41,812
Somebody had notified a larger system of harassers

580
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:45,034
and they had sent 11 people into the classroom

581
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,534
to be there both to record

582
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,255
so they could share this material online

583
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,276
and also to intimidate.

584
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,598
I gotta be honest, this really messed with me.

585
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:59,114
So I live in a place, and some of you may as well,

586
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:02,857
where our students and our faculty live very close together.

587
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,498
I live on a campus where there's student housing,

588
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,120
there's a whole faculty suburb,

589
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,222
and you go to the supermarket at midnight to buy some milk

590
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,023
and it's like they're all there, right?

591
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:13,324
Your lives are very close.

592
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:16,374
But because it was such a large class,

593
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:18,295
I couldn't get to know them all.

594
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:20,036
I couldn't get to know their faces.

595
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:24,660
So I didn't know who all of my toxic students were.

596
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,982
Some of them who I would call active harassers.

597
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:29,623
So it made me very anxious.

598
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:30,844
It made me kind of paranoid

599
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:33,746
that when I would look around at the sea of students

600
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,008
there at UCI, which is a large campus,

601
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:37,869
it felt like they were everywhere.

602
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,170
And I know that's not true,

603
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,351
but I just point that out to say

604
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,352
that this is not just a logistical problem,

605
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:43,233
this harassment issue.

606
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:43,713
It's also an...

607
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,355
problem of feeling, right?

608
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:47,498
It's a problem of how it kind of eats away at you,

609
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:50,443
this sense that your own students want to do you harm.

610
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:54,048
So from this experience, there were some things

611
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:56,731
that I learned are very specific challenges and effects

612
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:59,455
that come from the combination of toxic gamer culture

613
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,238
and the classroom, and games education.

614
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:07,236
I like to think of these challenges as kind of this bouncy house gauntlet of things that

615
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,178
you have to do to get from one side to the other to deal with it.

616
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:14,142
It's not just one obstacle, it's like a whole obstacle course that you go through.

617
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:19,926
So one thing is that your problems aren't visible to your privileged colleagues.

618
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:24,507
You may have wonderful colleagues who want to be supportive, but they just literally

619
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:28,069
don't see it because they're not in the classrooms where it's happening.

620
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,229
They're not the ones getting those evaluations.

621
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,410
It's just not visible to them.

622
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,171
So not only are you experiencing it, you're always trying to convince your colleagues

623
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:36,852
that it's happening.

624
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,431
People outside of games don't get it.

625
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,433
So you might have other communities.

626
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:44,294
For me, my work is very interdisciplinary.

627
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:46,416
So I'll often be at conferences or things like that

628
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:47,677
that aren't game-specific.

629
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:50,440
And trying to talk to folks, they're just like,

630
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,122
I literally have no idea what you're talking about.

631
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:54,983
When you talk to games people,

632
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,325
especially women and non-binary folks who teach games,

633
00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:00,228
they're like, oh my God, this is my life every day.

634
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:02,990
So it's hard to find support networks outside of games

635
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:05,673
because games are a kind of different environment.

636
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:09,554
you end up in this pedagogy catch-22,

637
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,435
which is that you're there

638
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,435
because you care about diversity, right?

639
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,836
You're there because you live in a body

640
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:16,776
that is seen as diverse,

641
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:18,697
and so you have a stake in changing games

642
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,537
and games education.

643
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:22,198
And if you put that in your teaching,

644
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,079
you're gonna get, at best, hostile responses,

645
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:26,139
at worst, harassed, right?

646
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,859
But if you don't put it in your teaching,

647
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,420
then you've backed off your politics,

648
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,480
and you might not make games better, right?

649
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,241
So do you try and make it better?

650
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:34,845
Or do you back off?

651
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:37,167
And then this is the kind of larger question, right?

652
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,629
Because people will say to you, you're doing such great work.

653
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:42,810
You're converting the next generation.

654
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,672
Thank you.

655
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:49,475
Because there's a balance between converting folks

656
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:51,736
and trying to support your personal well-being.

657
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,619
So given this, there are also some very specific effects.

658
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,302
Some of these are obvious, right?

659
00:32:58,322 --> 00:32:59,184
But they're worth thinking about,

660
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:00,907
especially if you run a games program,

661
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,610
especially if you have this concern in mind,

662
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,794
like I want to make the best games education I can,

663
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,156
how is this affecting me?

664
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:08,380
It has a direct effect on your program

665
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,963
and its efficacy for teaching.

666
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,577
So to start with, you have less happy, less engaged teachers.

667
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:17,419
One way to deal with feeling like your students are hostile

668
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,159
is to check out.

669
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,102
You walk into the room, you give a lecture, you peace.

670
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:24,383
I'm not saying that's a bad way to teach,

671
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,684
but that's a different way to teach than being interactive.

672
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:29,546
Because it shields you, and I understand that.

673
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,074
You get less teaching about culture.

674
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:35,116
I'd like to think that all our games programs

675
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:37,938
are slowly moving towards incorporating more of this,

676
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,581
but if you hire folks who can teach culture and games

677
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,342
and they are facing this issue,

678
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:44,024
they're gonna back off of that too.

679
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,385
That also hurts your program.

680
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,949
You get a less diverse student body.

681
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,970
And this takes a few steps to explain,

682
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,812
but I think this is important to a lot of folks

683
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,114
who run these programs, to have a diverse student body.

684
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:56,355
So the reason is that.

685
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:01,969
If you are getting hostile responses or harassment in the classroom, that means that you are

686
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,154
less likely to keep working there as a marginalized instructor, and also that you're less likely

687
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:11,557
to keep teaching these courses that explicitly engage with culture.

688
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:16,582
Those two things, having diverse instructors, teaching diverse topics, are the things that

689
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:19,084
kind of hail diverse students.

690
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,947
They're the things that show diverse students you care about them.

691
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,748
They show them that they're role models.

692
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,971
that they can see themselves in the program.

693
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,654
So when you start to lose those instructors

694
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,798
or lose those courses, you lose the comfortability

695
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:33,580
that your diverse students started to feel.

696
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:38,213
you end up with all this extra labor

697
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,774
for your marginalized instructors.

698
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,716
So some of that is time, right?

699
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:44,279
You get an email that tells you

700
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,980
that you're a disgusting communist, right?

701
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:47,742
And then you gotta do something, right?

702
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:49,544
You forward it to your chair,

703
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,045
you notify the appropriate person.

704
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,007
There's just work that goes into dealing

705
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:54,028
with this kind of behavior.

706
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,690
But there's also emotional work, right?

707
00:34:57,238 --> 00:34:58,819
If you have been harassed in the past,

708
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:01,920
and you can get harassed and then go home and feel good

709
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,201
and be productive and write a research paper, Godspeed.

710
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:07,922
I know that when this happens to me,

711
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,682
even though it's been a long time

712
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:10,903
that I've been facing things like this,

713
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:13,063
it gets to you, it gets under your skin,

714
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:16,384
and it takes the time away from being productive

715
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,345
to have to deal with that set of feelings.

716
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,531
And then there's this whole promotion thing.

717
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,793
So I come up for my tenure soon, so it's like feeling

718
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,693
super close to home.

719
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:30,014
Which is that when your students leave you these

720
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:34,436
negative bits of feedback on your evaluations, it directly

721
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:35,997
affects your tenure track faculty.

722
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:39,038
Because it can come up in their promotion cases, it can

723
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:44,420
affect their tenure review, and it can actually in a very

724
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,682
real way affect their whole career, just to have these

725
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:48,682
students acting this way.

726
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,894
Okay, so let's jump to actionable steps.

727
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:59,920
So like I said, this falls into three areas, steps for marginalized educators, steps for

728
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,462
colleagues, steps for programs, so let's start with that first one.

729
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:09,567
There are things you can do before you even start a class.

730
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:14,231
So let's say you're starting in a new institution, it's an institution you suspect from getting

731
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:17,974
the kind of temperature of the student body, you suspect this might be an issue, you can

732
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:19,856
do things before the class even begins.

733
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:23,267
You can assemble a toolkit.

734
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:25,348
So like I said, this isn't always easy,

735
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,750
but finding the resources on campus,

736
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,251
what do I do with a disruptive student?

737
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,791
What do I do if I feel unsafe?

738
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:32,512
What's the reporting process?

739
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:33,733
As much as you can assemble,

740
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,615
so that if you're in a moment of crisis, you have it,

741
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:37,955
I recommend it.

742
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:41,724
cultivating the right teaching personality.

743
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,845
So I know this sounds a little like calculated.

744
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,366
I think we all want to think that we get up

745
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,967
in front of our students and we're sincere and we're present,

746
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,588
but for folks who are marginalized,

747
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:52,949
it's worth thinking carefully.

748
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:55,511
So for me, I've always been the kind of teacher

749
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,612
who's like a big smile and is like,

750
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,633
you're all awesome, thank you for being here.

751
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:00,613
I want to hear your thoughts.

752
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,174
And it turns out that backfires a lot of the time

753
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:05,515
for people who are read in the way that I'm read

754
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,736
in these big classrooms where we see this toxicity.

755
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:11,979
So, I would actually recommend if that's your teaching style, thinking about what you can

756
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,741
do to take a step back, right?

757
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,282
It's in how you hold your body.

758
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:17,423
It's in what your students call you, right?

759
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:21,086
Could be doctor something, professor something instead of your first name.

760
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:25,069
And that personality can help shield you from this behavior.

761
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,971
So that's what you can do when you're right at the beginning.

762
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,473
What do you do when you're sort of in the middle of it, in the middle of the course

763
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:32,774
and you're seeing problems?

764
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:36,517
I highly recommend embracing ambivalence.

765
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:38,123
So here's what I mean.

766
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,147
Some days you may wake up and be like,

767
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,950
my mission is to educate the misguided youth.

768
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:48,536
I will make them think differently about games

769
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:51,440
and about the world, and it may take time,

770
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,922
but I'm on a mission, right?

771
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,236
And there are days you may wake up and be like,

772
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:59,597
I am so tired of trying to beat my head against the wall

773
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,057
to educate the misguided youth.

774
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:02,618
Because often it takes time.

775
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:05,979
They may be jerks all the way through your class.

776
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:07,639
And then three years later, wake up and be like,

777
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,679
oh, that was so useful.

778
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,040
But they're long gone.

779
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,240
And you're long gone.

780
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,701
And so you have to, I don't know that there's

781
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,121
one answer or another.

782
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:18,742
But I think sitting with that, sitting with the fact

783
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,523
that it can be both important and it can suck,

784
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:23,183
that's really important.

785
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,971
Giving yourself the permission to do self-care.

786
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,292
So if you need to walk away from a situation,

787
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:32,514
you need to go hang out in your tub

788
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:33,915
and pet your cat or whatever.

789
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:35,436
People don't really pet cats in tubs,

790
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:38,818
but that seemed like two comforting things at once.

791
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:44,462
That it is your right to have that time for self-care.

792
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,303
And I think for those of us who do research

793
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:48,564
as well as teaching, it's really hard to feel like

794
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:50,826
you have the right to take time for yourself.

795
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:55,571
What do you do when things are on fire, right?

796
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:57,718
Not at the beginning, not in the middle,

797
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:59,625
but when there's an active crisis.

798
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,125
Don't keep quiet.

799
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,648
There's a sort of sense of shame and unspeakability

800
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:07,309
around this stuff.

801
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,931
And this is one of the reasons that I wanted to give this talk

802
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:12,213
is that it feels like you can't talk about it.

803
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,456
Because we're supposed to want to support our students,

804
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,799
because we think this is just an issue that's happening to us.

805
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,322
But I highly recommend telling people.

806
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,223
They may not always be receptive,

807
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:25,165
but it's going to go better in the long run for you

808
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:25,926
if they know.

809
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,123
document the hell out of everything.

810
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,324
So if you get an email from a student,

811
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,465
make sure that you've saved it.

812
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,786
If you have an incident in class,

813
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,267
do a little write up of it and send it to your chair.

814
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:39,568
And you can even send it and say,

815
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,349
not asking for any action,

816
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,690
I just want to document this while it's fresh

817
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,651
and let you know this happened.

818
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:46,212
And that creates a paper trail.

819
00:39:46,532 --> 00:39:48,193
So if there's a larger issue.

820
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,536
So let's say you're tenure track and you go up for your tenure review and they say,

821
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,038
all you students hate that you teach feminist and queer stuff.

822
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,441
You can say, let me show you the paper trail that demonstrates that

823
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:01,063
there is systemic discrimination going on here.

824
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:04,025
You may encounter very well-meaning people who say,

825
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,388
don't write that down, let's just chat in my office.

826
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:13,352
Don't do that. I'm sure they mean well,

827
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,895
but it is in your best interest to have a trail.

828
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,896
And then what do you do for the long haul?

829
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:24,197
So you've made it through the trash fire.

830
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:26,637
How do you just keep going?

831
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:30,318
I recommend building a community of folks

832
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:31,898
who know what you're talking about.

833
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:35,079
So it can be amazingly, amazingly helpful

834
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:37,260
just to talk to someone else who's like,

835
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,720
that happens to you, that happens to me.

836
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:42,584
Because again, we feel like we're alone with it.

837
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:44,065
We feel like it's really overwhelming.

838
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,787
And that community may well be outside your institution.

839
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,548
So in moments like this, where we have other educators

840
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:51,189
around us from other institutions,

841
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,711
I recommend just like scooting up next to somebody and be like,

842
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,071
is that happening to you?

843
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:57,893
And then when it happens, text them and be like, what?

844
00:40:58,834 --> 00:40:59,814
What just happened to me?

845
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,235
And it really actually helps.

846
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,598
This is a technique that I learned from Alex Agloro, who

847
00:41:05,658 --> 00:41:07,979
used to teach at WPI and is now at ASU.

848
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,902
I feel mixed about it, but the idea is to teach the students who are there for the right

849
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:16,124
reasons, to teach the students who you want to teach.

850
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:23,829
So that means look out at a room at 260 people and find the five that really care and think

851
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:24,969
about teaching to them.

852
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,472
Now it's tricky, right, because you're not trying to jettison all the other students,

853
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:32,975
you're not saying they don't matter, but it helps you sustain, it helps you survive and

854
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:36,997
thrive if your intended audience is people who want to be there.

855
00:41:39,728 --> 00:41:42,390
So what can you do if you are colleagues of folks going through this?

856
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,671
We're going to do this one as kind of do's and don'ts.

857
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:50,334
And I'm going to ask you again to take a second before we do this and sort of ponder.

858
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:55,516
So, do you think of yourself as an ally?

859
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,821
If you think of yourself as an ally,

860
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:08,283
when was the last time you actively advocated

861
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:11,067
for a marginalized person in your program, right?

862
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:14,232
So not just in private said, oh yeah, that's hard for you,

863
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,676
but actively went to bat for somebody.

864
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,361
That's what we need, right?

865
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,722
This is what we need, is active advocates.

866
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:28,404
This is true in all of diversity issues,

867
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:29,445
not just in education.

868
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:32,027
We don't need just allies, we need advocates.

869
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:35,790
We need your help as our colleagues who have more privilege

870
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:37,992
and who aren't facing these same issues.

871
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,154
So when you're trying to address things, right?

872
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:43,276
Maybe you're like, yes, I'm an advocate now.

873
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:44,336
I'm gonna take a stand.

874
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:46,838
Here's what I recommend not doing.

875
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:51,334
Don't give advice without knowing what you're talking about.

876
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:53,977
And that's going to take some active education.

877
00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:56,320
That might take going online and reading about things.

878
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,203
That might take having conversations with your colleagues,

879
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:00,284
if they're up for it, right?

880
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:01,326
You don't want to be like,

881
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,468
can I pick your brain about how people are mean to you?

882
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:04,789
That sucks too.

883
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:08,233
But before you tell people what to do,

884
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:09,935
make sure you understand the situation.

885
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:13,909
Don't dismiss the concerns by saying,

886
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:15,272
oh, you're making students better.

887
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,796
Yeah, maybe.

888
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:19,884
But that doesn't mean that all these other issues aren't true.

889
00:43:22,022 --> 00:43:24,625
please do not debate us or interrogate us, right?

890
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,467
If someone comes to you and says,

891
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,090
gosh, I could really use your help, I'm being harassed,

892
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,212
or I'm facing a hostile environment.

893
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,895
If you ask us 20 questions to make us prove it,

894
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:37,619
or you try and play devil's advocate, we're done, right?

895
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,461
It doesn't feel like you're there to support us.

896
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:42,224
Like, we live these experiences, you have to trust us.

897
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,699
Don't ask marginalized colleagues for extra labor.

898
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,640
So for example, another very well-intentioned colleague

899
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,700
said to me, gosh, you had such a hard experience

900
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,001
in that games and society class.

901
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:57,121
Wouldn't you like to do a tour of all the other classes

902
00:43:57,361 --> 00:43:59,822
in our department and go and tell all the students

903
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:01,882
about how hurtful it is when you're harassed?

904
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:05,063
And that'll help them realize that you're a person too.

905
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:08,364
Yeah, I bet so.

906
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:11,044
But you know what you don't wanna do

907
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:11,904
when you've just stared?

908
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:14,265
Remember the thing where I'm like really paranoid now?

909
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,670
Like to go and be emotionally vulnerable in that way

910
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,852
is not the best way to support your colleagues.

911
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:22,554
So here's what you can do, the flip side.

912
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,677
Believe your marginalized colleagues.

913
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,760
I can't stress enough how much this is really important.

914
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,343
So seriously, just making us feel like you believe us

915
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:33,605
is a huge step.

916
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:38,080
Teach diversity in your own classrooms.

917
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,302
So there is literally no class you can teach.

918
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:43,423
I mean this absolutely.

919
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,405
Where cultural issues and social issues are not relevant.

920
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,847
That doesn't mean that you have to have half a semester

921
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,049
on those things, but they are always present.

922
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,352
And the more that you normalize teaching them,

923
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:57,595
the more that it doesn't make us the weird ones, right?

924
00:44:57,835 --> 00:44:59,897
They can't be like, oh, that professor,

925
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,519
that's where we did the weird queer stuff.

926
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,282
If it is spread out across your program,

927
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:06,884
if you're modeling for them

928
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:08,925
that privileged people also care about this,

929
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:11,788
it helps tone down the hostility across the board.

930
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,071
Be an advocate, not just an ally.

931
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,285
and show the heck up, right?

932
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:20,887
So let's say there's a diversity event in your department.

933
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:23,028
It's about working with students,

934
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,971
it's about diversifying your faculty, whatever it is.

935
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:29,033
If you do not think of yourself as a diverse person,

936
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,054
or like diversity's not really the thing you work on,

937
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,356
you need to be there, right?

938
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:35,858
Often it's the people who are already working

939
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:37,679
on these issues who show up to those things.

940
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,181
And we need to be on the same page.

941
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:43,223
You need to see these things for any real change to happen.

942
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:49,217
So I'm going to close by thinking about this broader question, programs and institutions.

943
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:52,538
Those of you who are currently running game programs, those of you who are spinning up

944
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:55,799
game programs, I think we know that more and more are popping up all over.

945
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:59,880
So it's actually a really important moment to get these things in on the ground floor.

946
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,121
Hire multiple diverse instructors.

947
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:06,982
So when you have one person.

948
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:10,141
It all falls on them, right?

949
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:12,342
And I know this isn't always easy, right?

950
00:46:12,362 --> 00:46:13,502
You have budget constraints,

951
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,782
you have tenure line constraints.

952
00:46:14,802 --> 00:46:17,083
Like this is easier said than done, I get that.

953
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:20,604
But I came into UCI with a colleague, Aaron Trammell,

954
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:21,984
who was in my position too,

955
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:24,485
that has been amazingly helpful.

956
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,245
Because when these things are happening,

957
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:27,906
someone is there with me.

958
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:32,107
Offer multiple courses that address culture.

959
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,307
So like I said with that Games and Society class,

960
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:36,027
when it's just one class and they take it off

961
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:37,148
and they try and get the heck out,

962
00:46:38,237 --> 00:46:39,897
They don't engage thoroughly.

963
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,858
If you can incorporate these concerns

964
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:45,560
across your curriculum, then it becomes normal for them

965
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,241
and they know they have to confront it.

966
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:52,564
Educate your students about how to act with their faculty,

967
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:54,445
and how to act in the classroom.

968
00:46:54,485 --> 00:46:57,927
This isn't just about me wanting them to be nicer to me.

969
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,507
This is a professionalization skill.

970
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:02,049
This is something that's going to serve them

971
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,809
in their team building, in their teamwork.

972
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,611
Simple things like how to write a polite email.

973
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:09,032
Actually, it goes a long way.

974
00:47:09,332 --> 00:47:11,474
I do a workshop at the beginning of every class

975
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,095
on how to write a polite email.

976
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:15,577
And it gets a breakdown of like, write this sentence,

977
00:47:15,617 --> 00:47:17,258
then write this sentence, then write this sentence.

978
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,740
And oh my god, they get so much nicer after that.

979
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,162
Because you don't get those 3 AM emails.

980
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:24,343
They're like, what's the assignment?

981
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:25,043
I don't know it.

982
00:47:25,123 --> 00:47:26,164
Reply ASAP.

983
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:29,366
I highly recommend it.

984
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,280
If you're working on the program level,

985
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,381
or this is kind of the institution level,

986
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,702
recognize the labor that goes into these issues.

987
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:39,523
So if you're doing a review, for example,

988
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:41,143
of someone who's been facing harassment,

989
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:43,544
recognize that you may need to take into account

990
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:45,905
that they've been able to produce less work

991
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:48,086
because they've been dealing with these issues.

992
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:52,107
And then have your own resources at the ready.

993
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,007
So have a kind of packet for this stuff, right?

994
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:56,768
It shouldn't be professors who have to figure it out

995
00:47:56,808 --> 00:47:57,569
and reinvent the wheel,

996
00:47:57,649 --> 00:48:00,249
especially if you're hiring folks who haven't worked

997
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,550
as professors before, educators before,

998
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,311
or folks who are brand new to the institution, right?

999
00:48:05,391 --> 00:48:06,632
It's hard to navigate that.

1000
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:09,312
So do it once, share it with folks, and it'll be there.

1001
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,434
Tell your instructors that you support them.

1002
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:16,417
and then actually support them.

1003
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:19,619
It's really easy to say, we're here for diversity,

1004
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,580
we're here for you, but you have to actually put your money

1005
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,981
where your mouth is and do it.

1006
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:29,325
So I'll just wrap up by saying that if we are serious

1007
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:31,126
about diversifying games education,

1008
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,887
and I think that's something that does matter

1009
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:35,488
to a lot of us, we need to be serious

1010
00:48:35,588 --> 00:48:37,550
about addressing student toxicity.

1011
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:41,886
We need to create an environment where diverse educators

1012
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:43,808
and culturally engaged education

1013
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:47,571
can not just be part of our community, but can thrive.

1014
00:48:48,912 --> 00:48:49,132
Thanks.

1015
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,221
Thanks very much.

1016
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:06,745
So I think we've got like 10 or 11 minutes for questions

1017
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,749
and I'm told that you should come up to the mic.

1018
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:12,754
And also I totally forgot to tell you at the beginning

1019
00:49:12,774 --> 00:49:13,835
to silence your cell phones.

1020
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:15,558
Little late for that.

1021
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,222
And also to fill out your e-mails.

1022
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:23,694
Hi, my name is Brian. I teach game development at a high school in California.

1023
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:24,215
Yeah.

1024
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:27,396
And it's kind of contextually different high school to college,

1025
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:31,198
but my main interaction with toxic gamer culture is student to student.

1026
00:49:31,658 --> 00:49:31,878
Yeah.

1027
00:49:32,118 --> 00:49:34,939
And invariably my best students are my young ladies.

1028
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,480
Yeah.

1029
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,581
And I'm pretty good being reactionary about issues, you know,

1030
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:43,883
starts cred checking and sometimes ramps all the way up to full-blown sexual harassment.

1031
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:44,083
Yeah.

1032
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:47,284
I feel like I'm good at being reactive to those issues.

1033
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,607
Do you have any tips on kind of proactively

1034
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,529
heading those things off before they show up?

1035
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:53,271
Yeah.

1036
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,599
It kind of depends on the structure of how you're teaching them, but I would go back

1037
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,859
to this thing of setting expectations ahead of time.

1038
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,662
Like, if there's a way to have a workshop about that ahead of time, so that they know

1039
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:08,363
that something is on your mind and something that you expect of them.

1040
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:12,565
I was also just having a conversation about toxicity in eSports the other day.

1041
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:18,267
And this great suggestion that came up is to try and promote the value of sportsmanship.

1042
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:20,408
Right? Like, I'm not a sporty person,

1043
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:22,910
but people who play sports often care about the value

1044
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,351
of being good community members.

1045
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:26,552
So if it's possible to kind of foster that

1046
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:27,753
and get them enthusiastic,

1047
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:30,974
like have a sportsman of the month or something, right?

1048
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:34,196
If there's some reward for being a good community member,

1049
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:35,917
then that might model for them

1050
00:50:36,017 --> 00:50:37,438
that that's something they're striving for.

1051
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,059
Thank you. Yeah, thanks.

1052
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:42,361
Hi. Hey.

1053
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:44,602
I'm Naomi and I teach

1054
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:47,144
and I'm currently running the game program at NYU.

1055
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:55,101
So my question is about the the curriculum aspect and specifically the course that you were teaching which like you said

1056
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,303
It's a required first year course, right?

1057
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:02,728
I'm wondering after having taught that course in the experiences you talked about

1058
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,491
How do you feel about the idea of requiring a games and culture

1059
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:10,172
course as part of the curriculum as opposed

1060
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:12,514
to other approaches, some of which you mentioned, right?

1061
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,875
Like, rather than having a required course,

1062
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:18,417
having these topics spread throughout the curriculum

1063
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:20,959
as a sort of required part of multiple syllabi,

1064
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:24,841
or having an elective that goes deeper into these areas,

1065
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:27,582
or multiple electives, where then you might mostly

1066
00:51:27,642 --> 00:51:30,184
be getting the students who want to be there.

1067
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:31,980
I think it's a great question, right?

1068
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,863
Because the advantage, I mean, the fact that it was required wasn't a mistake, right?

1069
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:40,247
It was a pedagogical decision that all students coming in, and the fact that it was their

1070
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,909
first class also wasn't a mistake.

1071
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:43,310
Someone put real thought into that, right?

1072
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,593
Which is that they come in the door, they're required to think about games and culture

1073
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:47,194
right off the bat.

1074
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:52,178
And when you make it an elective, then the people who opt in, and I've totally seen this

1075
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:55,161
at other institutions, the people who opt in are already on board, right?

1076
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,483
I think it's a kind of both and approach, right?

1077
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,147
That if there's some element where it's required, but also some element where they can opt into

1078
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:09,571
more or even if there's multiple courses that at least address culture in some way that

1079
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:10,392
are required, right?

1080
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:14,996
There's something about it being that one token class that they get out of the way as

1081
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:18,039
opposed to something they are really expected to engage with throughout.

1082
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:24,164
I think that's where that attitude, that dismissive, yeah, that dismissive attitude comes from.

1083
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:27,806
So, I know not every program has a ton of space for new courses, but if there's a way

1084
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:30,028
to bring it in at multiple points, I think it helps.

1085
00:52:30,588 --> 00:52:34,891
So would you favor something like you have to take at least one course within the area

1086
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:39,475
and you have a number of choices, or like take this many credits of this type of course

1087
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:40,175
during your…

1088
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,734
Yeah, I think that's actually a really smart answer, which

1089
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:45,576
is like, let's say you have three different courses that

1090
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:47,397
are games and culture courses, and they have

1091
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,738
to pick one of the three.

1092
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,121
What's nice about that is that they still have to do it,

1093
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:53,982
but they feel like they've made a choice.

1094
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:54,863
And they have made a choice.

1095
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:56,964
But they feel like they've opted in in some way

1096
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:58,065
that they have agency over.

1097
00:52:58,145 --> 00:52:59,526
And I think that would actually really help.

1098
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:00,947
OK, thank you.

1099
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:01,568
Yeah, thanks.

1100
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:03,689
Hey.

1101
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:03,870
Hi.

1102
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:05,658
I'm a game student.

1103
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:11,742
What would be your advice for underrepresented group

1104
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:15,725
students, especially in a class where there's

1105
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:19,567
like no courses about genders or something like that,

1106
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:23,590
where they have to be the teachers for their other

1107
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,312
students, while also being afraid of being judged

1108
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:29,854
by the others because the class just started

1109
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:33,317
and they're here for three years with other game students?

1110
00:53:34,222 --> 00:53:36,224
Yeah, so just to make sure I understand your question,

1111
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:38,667
it's what do you do when you are yourself a marginalized

1112
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:41,270
student in a class where these things aren't being addressed

1113
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,312
and you kind of are in the role of needing to educate your

1114
00:53:43,372 --> 00:53:46,515
peers at the same time, plus you feel nervous about it

1115
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:48,497
because you're worried people will respond badly.

1116
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:48,918
Yeah, that is.

1117
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:51,769
Yeah, I mean I think it's a big issue, right?

1118
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,292
And right now when we don't have these classes

1119
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:56,113
that address things, when it's not on the table,

1120
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:58,176
then it does fall to our marginalized students

1121
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,017
and they get pushed further and further out.

1122
00:54:00,057 --> 00:54:01,759
Like that extra labor falls on them,

1123
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:05,543
but also then they feel like farther marginalized.

1124
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:08,246
So I would say to whatever extent.

1125
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:11,648
those students have the bandwidth to build community,

1126
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:12,268
it helps.

1127
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,290
Like it's sort of like being a professor,

1128
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,351
being an educator and finding other folks

1129
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:17,572
who have similar experiences.

1130
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,374
I have an undergrad who's amazing

1131
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:22,637
and she felt really pushed out of our games major

1132
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:23,517
for just that reason.

1133
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,340
So she switched majors but she built this amazing team

1134
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,422
of like queer women of color who make badass games,

1135
00:54:30,002 --> 00:54:32,024
who don't come out of our games program

1136
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:33,225
and I think it's really helped her.

1137
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:34,486
So that's, I would say one thing is,

1138
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:36,308
I'm not saying exit the games major.

1139
00:54:36,368 --> 00:54:37,268
I'm just saying like.

1140
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:39,650
If you can build community, it helps.

1141
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,594
I would also say identify the faculty who are your allies and your advocates.

1142
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:46,575
That might mean looking to other departments.

1143
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:49,277
That might mean looking for folks who aren't your instructors.

1144
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:54,160
Now on the instructor side, that's extra labor that you take on to work with those students,

1145
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:56,882
but I've seen it be really helpful for students themselves.

1146
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:02,426
Yeah, I've seen situations where there's only one teacher who could be an ally.

1147
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:05,789
It's always going to be an extra labor for them.

1148
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:14,722
The students that are from this group are not going to be checking on them because they

1149
00:55:14,762 --> 00:55:16,164
know that there's going to be extra labor.

1150
00:55:17,005 --> 00:55:17,926
You're absolutely right.

1151
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:20,569
I think it's a big system of problems.

1152
00:55:20,669 --> 00:55:22,632
I guess my feeling is that privilege...

1153
00:55:24,227 --> 00:55:26,109
I'm thinking about these vectors of privilege, right?

1154
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,111
And like, an undergrad isn't gonna solve

1155
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:29,273
the larger systemic problem.

1156
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:31,215
An undergrad has the right to be supported.

1157
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:34,659
So I would rather that an undergrad come to someone like me

1158
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:37,522
and look for assistance, and then I go up the next, right?

1159
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:39,304
But different faculty may feel differently.

1160
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:41,206
I just feel a lot of responsibility to those students

1161
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:43,568
because they don't have the power to change that, you know?

1162
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:45,110
Okay, thanks.

1163
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:45,971
Yeah, thanks.

1164
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,623
Hi, I have a similar question.

1165
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:57,047
My game design program that I'm enrolled in is very small.

1166
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:01,129
We're growing, but we certainly lack diversity in the students

1167
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:02,349
and especially in the faculty.

1168
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,571
I'm not convinced that.

1169
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:09,954
my teachers, my professors, the upper faculty are aware

1170
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:12,836
of this issue and how it's affecting students.

1171
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:16,038
Yeah. I like to think of myself as a leader in my program

1172
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:20,160
and I would like to know how can I personally try to shape

1173
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,482
and change the atmosphere in my program before I graduate.

1174
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:26,685
That's a great question and also thank you for doing that work.

1175
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:28,826
That's really hard to do on the student level.

1176
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:29,806
Thank you.

1177
00:56:31,046 --> 00:56:34,387
Yeah, I think this thing of finding allies who can be an ear,

1178
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:39,469
and sometimes what an ally can do is even if they don't have the power to change things,

1179
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:40,849
they can go up the ladder, right?

1180
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:44,850
They can go to the chair, they can go to somebody like that and be your advocate in that direction.

1181
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:51,694
The other thing I would say is if you feel comfortable talking to someone like whoever runs your program or your chair

1182
00:56:51,735 --> 00:56:57,658
I'm not sure what kind of program you're in and I know that doesn't always feel comfortable the more that you can make your voice heard

1183
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:00,326
it's helpful, at least then they can't say

1184
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:01,767
they didn't know it was happening.

1185
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:03,509
And the third piece of it sounds like

1186
00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:04,369
what you're already doing,

1187
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:06,751
which is organizing your student community,

1188
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:08,993
because then let's say a new student comes in,

1189
00:57:09,013 --> 00:57:11,054
and let's say a woman student, right,

1190
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,975
and she sees you, right?

1191
00:57:13,216 --> 00:57:14,677
She sees you as a role model,

1192
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:16,338
she sees your community as a role model.

1193
00:57:16,578 --> 00:57:17,699
So it's a slow process,

1194
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:19,660
but I think you're doing pieces of it really right.

1195
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,521
All right, thank you for your time, Bo.

1196
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:22,342
Yeah, thanks.

1197
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:26,508
Hi, thank you for your talk.

1198
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:27,408
This is great.

1199
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,530
My name's Price Jones, I'm the MFA director

1200
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,511
at the Academy of Arts School of Game Development.

1201
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:35,333
And my question's more about

1202
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:38,074
how do you address your colleagues?

1203
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:40,075
Do you do it always one-on-one,

1204
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:42,196
or do you ever set up workshops

1205
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:43,617
to have these kind of conversations?

1206
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:46,584
Yeah, that's a super good question because it's touchy.

1207
00:57:47,244 --> 00:57:49,485
I think, again, there are a lot of well-intentioned people

1208
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:52,027
who it can be hard to have these conversations,

1209
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,068
even colleague to colleague.

1210
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:56,310
And academia, especially on the tenure track,

1211
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,730
is super hierarchical.

1212
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,712
We like to think that it's flat, but it's super hierarchical.

1213
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:03,334
So especially if you're coming from a position,

1214
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,555
a more junior position like myself, it can be hard.

1215
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,277
I think having one-on-one conversations, in my experience,

1216
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:10,398
has been the most effective.

1217
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:17,182
Or if there are moments like in a faculty meeting to shout out something small, it kind

1218
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:19,443
of depends what the affordances are in your program.

1219
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:24,146
So where I work right now, the preference of my chair is that we don't do like a big

1220
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:24,786
group workshop.

1221
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:29,709
When I worked at USC, we had opportunities to do stuff for faculty specifically, which

1222
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:30,449
was really nice.

1223
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:36,552
So I would say finding the opportunities that you have and also finding what feels comfortable

1224
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:38,934
to you where it's not going to be, you're not going to then become the...

1225
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:41,875
target of hostility, right?

1226
00:58:42,495 --> 00:58:42,695
Right.

1227
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:43,335
Yeah.

1228
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:44,075
Great.

1229
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:45,516
Yeah, it's kind of dependent on the program.

1230
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:46,476
That makes sense.

1231
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:47,016
Thank you.

1232
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:47,457
Thanks.

1233
00:58:49,017 --> 00:58:51,138
OK, I think we've got time for one more question,

1234
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:51,958
if anybody has one.

1235
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:59,561
Hi, thank you very much for this talk.

1236
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:05,102
I teach in a small games area in a larger interactive media

1237
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:05,522
program.

1238
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:06,843
And my

1239
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,607
This feels like a really problematic question,

1240
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,988
but I've been having it, so I'm kind of curious

1241
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:13,809
to hear how you respond.

1242
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:18,171
We do have a lot of LGBTQ students in our program

1243
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,172
and marginalized students.

1244
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:25,655
And what I'm curious about, because of how our faculty

1245
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:28,196
aren't very diverse, and because of how I present,

1246
00:59:30,597 --> 00:59:32,458
I'm sure there's toxicity in the program,

1247
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,959
but I don't know about it.

1248
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:35,980
So my question is sort of.

1249
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:42,915
how and should I want to surface it in order to address it?

1250
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:44,117
I would say yes.

1251
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:44,457
How?

1252
00:59:46,835 --> 00:59:48,517
Do you have any recommendations for how to approach that?

1253
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:49,498
Yeah, I would say two things.

1254
00:59:49,638 --> 00:59:52,080
One is town halls I found really useful.

1255
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:56,244
So it's where you, at the end of a semester or whatever, you get the students together

1256
00:59:56,325 --> 01:00:01,690
and you just open the floor and say, please feel free to share what your experience is

1257
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,071
like and the faculty just listen.

1258
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:04,193
The faculty don't talk.

1259
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:06,335
And often that stuff will bubble to the surface.

1260
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:10,119
The other thing is identifying students who you think maybe could use some support and

1261
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:10,279
just...

1262
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:12,161
being like, hey, come to office hours.

1263
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:14,384
I'd love to chat with you about what school's like.

1264
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,606
Not to pressure them, not to tokenize them,

1265
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,448
but then sometimes those things will start to come

1266
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,390
to the surface there, too.

1267
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:20,751
OK, thank you.

1268
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:21,112
Thanks.

1269
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:22,193
OK, I think that's time.

1270
01:00:22,313 --> 01:00:23,414
Thanks very much for your questions.

1271
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:24,155
Thanks for listening.
