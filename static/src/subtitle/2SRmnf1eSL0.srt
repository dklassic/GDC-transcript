1
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:15,505
Welcome to my talk about interview questions.

2
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:19,667
And somebody told me if that dies, hopefully it is not going to die.

3
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:23,728
So I'm not going to read you all the text because I am really tight on time, but this

4
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:24,428
is who I am.

5
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:28,750
At the end there will be a QR code if anyone wants to add me on LinkedIn or Twitter or

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,610
any of the things.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,830
I would love to be connected.

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:39,097
And the one thing I do want to tell you off this slide is that, like, my reason for existing in the game industry is that third bullet point.

9
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:46,764
I want to make sure that you all can build the careers that you want, keep yourselves safe, avoid burnout, resist crunch.

10
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:53,130
And if you weren't there, please watch the recording of the talk on occupational burnout. It was absolutely fantastic.

11
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:58,637
And that's what I'm doing here and happy to always help,

12
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:01,301
not just my own students, but anyone else in the industry

13
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,524
who needs an assist with stuff like that.

14
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,686
So today we're gonna talk about soft skills

15
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:07,248
because I really hate that phrase.

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,433
We'll talk a little bit about the anxiety of interviews

17
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:10,853
and...

18
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:15,757
Then we will get right into the different types of questions that you are asked in the interpersonal interviews,

19
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:20,240
which I know everyone, you know, people are like, why, these questions are kind of useless,

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,822
but I promise you they're not. There's really good reason for these questions, we'll get into that.

21
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:28,945
The really scary questions are not traps, they are opportunities, we'll talk about that,

22
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,468
and then we'll talk about how to ask good questions at the end of an interview.

23
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:34,969
We probably won't have good time for questions in here,

24
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,952
but I'm happy to stick around in the wrap-up area across the hall afterwards.

25
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:44,328
So, I hate the phrase soft skills because it feels rather pejorative to me.

26
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:47,631
It's like your hard skills or, you know, your technical skills and whatever.

27
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:52,114
And the soft skills is all the other crap that's kind of, no, that is not the case.

28
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:52,935
That is not true.

29
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,799
Your communication skills, your teamwork skills, all of that is the stuff that is going to

30
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,241
help you build your career, move it forward, succeed.

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,283
Excel, become an amazing leader, all of those good things.

32
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:07,765
So please, if you have a section on your resume that says stuff like,

33
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:12,727
team player, excellent communicator, hard worker, please get rid of that.

34
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,148
You don't need it. It's filler.

35
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,950
There are other ways that you can demonstrate those skills as you go through the interview process.

36
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:28,137
So a lot of you probably have a fair amount of debilitative anxiety around this kind of thing,

37
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:31,122
partly because, you know, you're getting ready to go into an interview,

38
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:34,587
the stakes are high, you are working yourself up really hard.

39
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,489
And that can shut you down completely.

40
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,129
And I don't want that to happen.

41
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,711
And so, ideally, you'll be able to take all of this stress and excess energy

42
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,932
and focus it on the preparation.

43
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:50,753
Because the best way to go into an interview is really thoroughly prepared.

44
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:54,375
I want you to be prepared for questions that you might not even get asked.

45
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:58,116
Because that is the best way to know that you've got this.

46
00:02:58,256 --> 00:02:58,756
You're ready.

47
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:04,601
The other thing I want you to remember going into an interview loop is that you are on a short list.

48
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:10,045
They took those 300 people or 1,200 people and you are one of the last people standing.

49
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,927
So it's not a guarantee that you're going to get the job,

50
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:15,149
but it's actually a really good sign because at this point, you know,

51
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,851
they want to fill this position.

52
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:19,793
They don't want to have to start searching all over again from the beginning.

53
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,776
So you're in a very good place going into a full interview.

54
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,438
Thorough preparation is absolutely the best.

55
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,063
use of your energy. The one more thing I want to remind you on here is that this is now about what

56
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:36,446
you can contribute to the company. It's not like, oh this job would be so great for me. It's here's

57
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:42,791
what I can do for you. Here's what I can bring to your teams and to your organization. So you've

58
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:47,495
already got a blueprint for this. It's your resume. Your achievements are on there. So you're going to

59
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:51,718
make a master document. You're going to go through the bullet points on your resume. Look at your

60
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:52,619
achievements and go.

61
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,442
Okay, these are the things I'm going to talk about in an interview. I mean, what else would you talk about?

62
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:03,006
These are your achievements. So make yourself a document, but don't memorize your little stories.

63
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:09,091
Pick out stories and then have a few keywords or phrases that you can have, you know, on your notes

64
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:12,433
or if you're being interviewed on video, you can have them on another monitor or whatever,

65
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,455
so that you can just look at those keywords.

66
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,981
And you know which experience you're talking about and basically what you want to say about it,

67
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:23,805
all the major points you want to hit. You don't want to memorize a script. That will make you

68
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:29,192
come across as very, very robotic. And so start with the keywords and then you will find that

69
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:33,357
very quickly you will get to, you know, you will be able to get rolling from there. So.

70
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:40,187
Why do these questions exist? Well, they help people understand how you're going to fit in

71
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:45,455
on their team, how you're going to fit in, you know, with the different personalities

72
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:49,180
they've already got in there, with the team that they're trying to build if they're building a team

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,041
from scratch.

74
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,903
And they also give you a great opportunity to be like,

75
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,385
this is the career I'm building for myself.

76
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,526
This is the narrative I'm putting together.

77
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:01,389
And so you will have chances to basically tell them

78
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,871
how you envision your future and hope that that matches up

79
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,953
with what they envision for you.

80
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,334
So these questions also very, very importantly,

81
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,976
give you the chance to demonstrate your values

82
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:12,917
and your priorities.

83
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:15,598
When you are answering things like teamwork questions,

84
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,360
that will tell people a lot about your,

85
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:24,645
your compassion, your empathy, your ability to listen to feedback and to work with other people

86
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:30,770
and come to consensus and all of that. And, you know, also your growth stories. You will be able

87
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,894
to tell a lot of growth stories. The one thing I want you to know is that every question has

88
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:41,899
a question behind it. So when you're asked a question like, you know, tell me about a time when

89
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,901
a project didn't go as planned.

90
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:48,224
Okay, you're going to tell them about a time when a project didn't go as planned,

91
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:53,788
but I think what they're really asking is, how stress reactive are you when everything goes to

92
00:05:53,848 --> 00:06:00,774
hell? Like when the plan falls apart, do you run in circles screaming or do you take a deep breath

93
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:06,779
and figure out a plan to make things better, figure out a new direction? So for every question

94
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,081
you're asked, there's always going to be another one right behind it.

95
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:17,284
Look for those when you get your lists of common interview questions that you can find in a lot of different places or that you can get from me after this.

96
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,686
I'm happy to share that with you and always think about the question behind the question.

97
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:26,607
So you are going to be asked almost certainly about your strengths and weaknesses.

98
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:30,789
And I want you to remember that your strengths are not just the tools you know how to use.

99
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:37,971
You might be able to absolutely, you know, you use ZBrush like no one else or you know program in C++ or whatever.

100
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,933
But those aren't your only strengths.

101
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:48,498
Your strengths are many other things about who you are as a human being and who you are on a team in a group of other people.

102
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:54,621
So come up with some strengths, come up with the words for them, and then come up with a little way to talk about them for a few minutes.

103
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,682
So it's not it's not just like my strength is.

104
00:06:57,343 --> 00:07:03,087
Perseverance, the end. It's, you know, perseverance because this thing happened and here's how I

105
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:06,769
handled it and I just kept going and pushing through and so on. So make sure that you have

106
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:12,913
examples of your strengths. Your weaknesses, please don't do that strength masquerading as

107
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:16,335
a weakness thing where you go, I'm a perfectionist, that's my greatest weakness.

108
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,938
Please don't do that. Come up with a real weakness, but...

109
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,602
You know, reach a little way back, and I'll talk about that in terms of failure questions as well.

110
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:28,724
Reach a little way back so you can say, okay, this is my weakness,

111
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:32,888
and here's how I've been working on it for the past three years. Here's the progress I've made.

112
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:38,533
Here are the, you know, the strategies and processes that I'm using to get through this.

113
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:43,817
And please don't give the deal breaker weaknesses like I only shower once every

114
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:47,720
three weeks whether I need to or not, or, you know, I kind of have.

115
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,025
anger issues, that's not a good way to get a job, so please, you know, avoid that.

116
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,787
One more really important thing.

117
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:57,010
Disabilities are not weaknesses.

118
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:01,454
So please, if you start talking about your disabilities

119
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,637
as weaknesses, that's not gonna be great.

120
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:05,538
You can save those.

121
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,019
You do not have to disclose those

122
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:09,862
until much later in the process if you need to,

123
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,804
unless you, of course, need reasonable accommodations

124
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:13,745
during an interview.

125
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:15,767
So your disabilities aren't weaknesses.

126
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,069
Honestly, in some cases, they may be superpowers.

127
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,730
So please remember that.

128
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:27,241
And so now we're going to talk about goals. These are my goals. Actually, I'm four-fifths of the way there.

129
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,335
So, I have one bottle of wine, but I have four cats, so we're good.

130
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:38,498
And the way you talk about your goals is going to have a couple of things.

131
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,979
It's going to do a couple of things for you.

132
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,303
First of all, it's going to let them know if you actually know what this job is about

133
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:46,564
and what you can do in this position.

134
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,327
Do you understand what this job can do for you and what you can do for it?

135
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,430
It may also show whether this is the right place.

136
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,651
for you because you may have a set of goals that if you are speaking authentically, which

137
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:03,373
I hope you will be, you might not be the greatest match for this position or this studio and

138
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:03,913
that's okay.

139
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:08,014
I would rather you found that out much earlier in the process rather than getting a job and

140
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:11,435
then realizing three weeks in, oh no, I've made a terrible mistake.

141
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:12,936
I don't want you to go there.

142
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,957
So this is where you get to decide, are we a match for each other?

143
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,558
It's not just their decision.

144
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,100
So if you're having trouble narrowing down those goals,

145
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,581
which is sometimes tricky if you're a student,

146
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,742
because it takes a while to figure out, you know,

147
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,863
the different career ladders and how things work,

148
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,245
do some homework, go on LinkedIn,

149
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,286
look for people that you admire,

150
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,847
look up some of the people you've met here.

151
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,208
It's not stalking, I promise.

152
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,469
And, you know, find those people and say,

153
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,290
okay, what was their first job out of college?

154
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,991
And what did they do after that?

155
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,692
And somebody who works for this company.

156
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:46,133
Okay, what was their path?

157
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,493
Did they move up in this company?

158
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:48,594
Did they come from somewhere else?

159
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:52,235
And so on, and then come up with a reasonable set of goals.

160
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,336
Look at it in terms of like,

161
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,257
one to three years out of college,

162
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:56,737
you know, that'll be your getting used

163
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,018
to being a professional period.

164
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,878
Then, you know, you get promoted,

165
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,279
what do you wanna get promoted into?

166
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,440
And then, you know, move forward from there.

167
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,861
So be ambitious, also be realistic,

168
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,662
so that, you know, they have this sense

169
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,282
that you have a balanced understanding

170
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,683
of where you are going from here.

171
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,644
Sometimes you will be asked what your dream job is,

172
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,966
and I want you to be very careful about that.

173
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:30,971
Because this industry traffics in dream jobs and companies know, I also hate the word passion,

174
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,613
they know that you're passionate about what you do and that can sometimes be a really

175
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:40,435
good way to exploit you because they know that you love this enough that you will, you

176
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:40,695
know.

177
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:44,579
Some of you will work for free. Please don't ever work for free. That's a whole other talk.

178
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,101
I'll be pitching that for next year, maybe.

179
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:52,387
But you know, be careful around dream jobs. You have goals, but your first job out of college is not your dream job.

180
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:56,912
It's your first job out of college, and you know, you will get to the other goals later on.

181
00:10:57,732 --> 00:11:02,095
So, a lot of the questions are going to be situational questions, which are the ones

182
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:06,718
that start with, so tell us about a time when this happened, and that often send people

183
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:07,538
into a panic.

184
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:11,881
I was talking to somebody the other day, a friend who has like, oh, I think she's got

185
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:17,044
25 or 30 years in the industry, and she said, yeah, when somebody asks me that, my brain

186
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:17,904
goes blank.

187
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:23,609
So prepare these responses because then it doesn't matter if your brain goes blank.

188
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:24,409
You have notes.

189
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,110
You are ready.

190
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,072
You can go back over the planning that you've done.

191
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:31,895
And so we're going to go through all of these separately, but I want you to have that master

192
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:35,598
document and in there you're going to prepare for strengths, weaknesses, goals.

193
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,481
the accomplishments that you're most proud of, your team experiences that were amazing,

194
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:44,004
your team experiences that give you nightmares still, you know, 17 years later or something,

195
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:50,109
the, you know, conflict resolution stuff with individuals, with teams, and so on. And there

196
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,151
are times when you'll answer a question and you'll realize that your response fell a little flat or

197
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:59,135
maybe didn't give them quite what they were looking for. And so, you know, at that point,

198
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,056
you can go, wait,

199
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,457
I've got another one.

200
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:04,581
And because you have another one, and you'll be totally ready to then go,

201
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:06,684
and then this other time this happened.

202
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:10,169
And you can reinforce the stuff that you've been wanting to talk about.

203
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,310
So.

204
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:17,128
You have a lot of accomplishments. I've seen some of your resumes. I've worked on some of your resumes.

205
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:23,150
And the way, you know, when you're asked what are the achievements of which you are most proud,

206
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,951
that tells people a lot about you when you answer that question. Like, you know,

207
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,212
are you most proud of it because it won an award?

208
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:35,374
Are you most proud of it because you took a team from the brink of disaster and turned

209
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:38,175
it around and actually had a completed project out of it in the end?

210
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,636
You know, there are various reasons that something might be considered an achievement that you're

211
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:43,016
proud of.

212
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:47,618
So think about that carefully because it is going to be important in terms of their understanding

213
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,399
of you, because it's also tied up in your understanding of you.

214
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,280
I know a lot of you work on team projects.

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,341
A lot of you, I have to tell over and over again, please take your team name off your

216
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,382
resume if you're a student.

217
00:12:58,587 --> 00:12:59,668
Because it confuses people.

218
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,271
But I know you love your teams, mostly.

219
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,914
But please don't just shift into a general discussion

220
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,957
of the project because they're not hiring your whole team.

221
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,199
Maybe one day they will, but right now they're

222
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:11,940
just hiring you.

223
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,361
So make sure that you are focusing

224
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,183
on what you contributed through all of this,

225
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:18,105
through this line of questioning.

226
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:23,484
A lot of you, and I know this because I've been teaching in the game industry for 15

227
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:30,245
years, a lot of you are very, very good at tearing yourselves apart and apologizing for

228
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,106
things you don't have to apologize for.

229
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,386
And I don't want you to do that.

230
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:37,267
Don't say, oh, well, this was nothing much.

231
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,447
It was just this little thing.

232
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:39,128
Don't do that.

233
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:42,648
Get out of your own way, please, and let them decide.

234
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,709
They're interviewing you because they looked at your stuff and thought, this person might

235
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:47,170
work out.

236
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:53,934
Let that happen, please. Do not get in your own way for this stuff. Humility's fantastic. I don't

237
00:13:53,954 --> 00:14:00,138
want you to go in all arrogant and stuff, but I also don't want you to be too self-deprecating.

238
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,941
This is tough because for a lot of us, including me, self-deprecating is like our default,

239
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:10,364
especially when we're nervous. So please be careful about this. Make it part of your planning. If

240
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,486
you're running mock interviews with people, have somebody just like

241
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:20,113
And I promise you, it will start to get better after a little while.

242
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,318
So your team experiences are really important.

243
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,701
You are being hired to work as part of a team.

244
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:32,107
And so people will often want to ask you questions about the team experiences that you've had.

245
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,972
Please take responsibility for the good and the bad things that you've done.

246
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,653
We will talk more about failures in like the next slide.

247
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:40,253
Here it comes.

248
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,894
But, but, you know, also give credit where it's due.

249
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,756
If you worked on something and, you know, you managed to turn this project around

250
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:50,277
because you had the best producer ever or because somebody came up with a,

251
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,598
you know, a brilliant idea somewhere in the process.

252
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,019
Give them credit for that.

253
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,220
Employers like to know both that you can take responsibility for your own work

254
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,021
and that you can recognize other people's contributions.

255
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:02,182
That's really, really important.

256
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,706
Also, please don't throw anyone under the bus ever.

257
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,228
I know you all have experience.

258
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:18,517
I'd be very surprised if there isn't someone, you know, if there's anyone in this room who has never had the experience of somebody else completely, like, tanking a project.

259
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:23,021
I want you to think about what you could have done differently.

260
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:29,195
in that situation. Is it something that, you know, earlier communication could have solved? Is it

261
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:33,857
something that if you had tried to, you know, work alongside the person, you could have solved? So

262
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:41,401
please don't ever say, this project failed because Joe screwed up. Unless you're Joe.

263
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:45,383
In that case, even then, I don't want you to really do that. So,

264
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:48,484
you know, make sure that you're focusing on this thing happened.

265
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,701
There were a lot of people involved in this.

266
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:52,042
Here was my part in it.

267
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:53,463
Here's what I could have done differently.

268
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:57,066
And also in terms of the not throwing under the bus thing,

269
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,887
the way you talk to your interviewers

270
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,549
now about your previous boss,

271
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,290
they're like, yeah, what's gonna happen

272
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,371
when they leave this job

273
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,132
and they're talking about us in an interview?

274
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:08,255
So I want you to be really careful about this.

275
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,136
We've all had bad experiences.

276
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,819
Your interview is not the time to air all of this stuff

277
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,620
with a group of people.

278
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:16,522
So let's talk about

279
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:21,986
Failure questions because people say those are terrifying. You want me to be vulnerable?

280
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:26,475
You want you want me to admit that I failed at something? Hell yes, I do.

281
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:32,285
Because one of the strengths that you're going to have to rely on throughout your career

282
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,926
is your ability to come back from failure.

283
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:39,968
To take it, to learn from it, and then to move forward doing things slightly differently.

284
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:44,770
So in your master document, with all of those questions, I want you to have this three-part

285
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,591
setup where it's like, okay, here's the story, here's what happened.

286
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:51,235
Here's what happened at the time, whether it was a good or bad outcome.

287
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:55,620
I mean, if it's a failure, it probably was a mostly bad outcome, which is fine.

288
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,862
And then you say, here's the takeaway.

289
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,324
Here's what I learned from that.

290
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:02,067
Here's how I did it differently on the next project,

291
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,509
because that's what they want to see.

292
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,631
Can you learn from your mistakes?

293
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,635
Do you have enough self-awareness that you can then move forward?

294
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:15,515
and do things differently. So have that three-part thing going for failures, for conflicts, and

295
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:20,758
for weaknesses as well, if you're digging back far enough for that stuff. This is your

296
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,301
redemption arc. Everybody loves a redemption arc. So you're going to reach back a little

297
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:26,702
bit. Your accomplishments

298
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,990
You want to do the recent stuff because you don't want anyone to think you peaked during

299
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,730
your freshman year.

300
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,551
So, you know, for that you want the recent stuff.

301
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:39,113
For your weaknesses, your failures, all of that, reach back a little so you can say,

302
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:43,434
well, a couple of years ago I was on this project and here's what happened and, you

303
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:44,794
know, here's how it all fell apart.

304
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,876
And then here's how we put it back together, or didn't, and here's how I do it differently

305
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,036
now.

306
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:54,197
I make sure that when we put a team together, you know, everyone knows what their part is

307
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,398
and, you know, we have clear communication channels.

308
00:17:57,102 --> 00:18:01,129
All of that. I'm a communications professor. I have to talk about communications constantly.

309
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:06,820
It's in my contract. Actually is in my contract. So when you're talking about conflict,

310
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:11,752
Sometimes you will have stories that like, here was the conflict and here's how we resolved it.

311
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,536
Other stories will be like, here's the conflict and in the end, you know, there wasn't a good

312
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:22,722
outcome. Either way, I want you to make it clear that you do everything possible to resolve

313
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:28,527
conflict effectively in a healthy way without either shouting people down or just rolling

314
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,350
over into that submissive posture and just, you know, letting the other person

315
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:38,113
I would prefer if your stories weren't,

316
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:42,215
that time somebody gave me feedback and their feedback was just totally wrong,

317
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,276
because I know how good I am.

318
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,898
No, that's not the way I want you to go at this either.

319
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,339
I want you to talk about things that, you know,

320
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:50,980
the ways that you have...

321
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,884
approach this stuff. There's a wonderful book by the way called Crucial Conversations if any of you

322
00:18:55,925 --> 00:19:02,010
are interested in that and it really does help a lot in terms of how to approach high conflict or

323
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,975
high stakes conversations. And of course this will also help people see how stress reactive

324
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:10,098
you are and you don't want to be really really stress reactive.

325
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:10,698
So

326
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:17,214
Your problem solving questions, sometimes these will come up where you are given a scenario and

327
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:21,916
you know, well, okay, you have to choose between these two things. Why? They're looking for your

328
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:26,378
thought processes, your, you know, how you approach a problem, how you think through it,

329
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:32,781
how you work through it. And so instead of just going, I would do this, go back to the experiences

330
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:37,263
you've had. Say, well, last year my team actually faced a situation very similar to this.

331
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:41,407
Here's how I handled it. Here's what happened next and so on.

332
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:47,052
And so this will show them how you deal with challenges when, you know,

333
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,836
with other people or without other people, how your brain works,

334
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:55,280
how you decide how to get your way through to the other end of a problem.

335
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:59,407
So then there's the, why do you want to work for us?

336
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,392
Which is much easier, of course, if you've been playing some game

337
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,315
since your parent handed a controller through the bars of your crib

338
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,077
when you were three years old or something.

339
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:12,422
Not so easy if it's like, well, I've never really heard of this company, but.

340
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:17,469
I can go look for them, look for their website and so on.

341
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,111
So do that homework too.

342
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,313
It's not going to take you that long.

343
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,574
It'll be totally worth it.

344
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:26,500
So read through their website, read the press releases, you know, look at any news that

345
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,022
you can find about the company.

346
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:30,485
A lot of companies will have little videos that are like,

347
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:32,406
Here's what it's like to work at our studio.

348
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:33,987
Watch those little videos

349
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,888
because you can learn a lot from them

350
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,730
because you may find that the stuff that you learn

351
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,031
isn't the stuff that they're saying

352
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,632
in the publicity commentary.

353
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:44,093
It's the other stuff about how you see people

354
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,854
working together and so on.

355
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:47,935
So if you're a fan, that's great,

356
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,576
but you don't want to be just a fan.

357
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,317
They're not hiring fans.

358
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:53,478
They're hiring you to be a peer and a colleague,

359
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,379
and that is really, really important.

360
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,263
So at the end you will be asked, do you have any questions for us?

361
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,724
Do not squander this opportunity.

362
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:06,507
It is a fantastic opportunity for you to find out more about the position,

363
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:11,250
for you to assess the way the people in your interview interact with you,

364
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,852
the way they talk about the company, all of those things.

365
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:15,853
Be aware of all the cues that they're giving you.

366
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,956
Please don't ask them to discuss active controversies.

367
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:22,578
Like, if they are in the headlines for big things, don't go like,

368
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,859
so how's that harassment thing going?

369
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,602
Like, please use your whisper networks for that.

370
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:31,864
You will all by this point have your whisper networks or you will be starting to get them.

371
00:21:32,244 --> 00:21:33,365
Ask those questions there.

372
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:36,227
And of course, don't ask them about NDA protective material

373
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:40,050
unless they have already had you sign an NDA before going into the interview

374
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,392
because they want to talk with you about that stuff.

375
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,533
So ask them questions that...

376
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:49,616
Show them that you are actually trying to see yourself doing this job on a day-to-day basis.

377
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:54,098
You know, ask about, you know, so how many people on the team? Who would I be reporting to? All of

378
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:59,241
those questions. If they're in your field, so ask them, so what do you think makes a good designer

379
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,802
or, you know, narrative designer? You know, whatever it is.

380
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:07,106
Another good idea is to show them that you're still willing to learn, that if there are skills

381
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,349
that you don't have yet, you're willing to pick them up. You know, if there was one thing you'd

382
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:17,534
suggest I learn between now and my start date if you hire me, what might that be? And then maybe

383
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:23,880
you will get some information that you can use over weekends to pick up a new tool of some kind.

384
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,250
Here is my favorite question ever.

385
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,432
And I wanna thank Katie Golden for this one.

386
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:33,074
She came in and did a talk in my class a couple years ago.

387
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:34,575
She's with Riot right now

388
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,416
and also SavePoint Industry Gathering,

389
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,337
which is a wonderful organization

390
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,158
for underrepresented game developers.

391
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:42,519
So thank Katie for this one if you ever run into her.

392
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,860
And it is, do you have any concerns

393
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,382
about my suitability for this position?

394
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,943
Or whatever you would say to sound like you.

395
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:54,195
Because what this means is that you get one more chance.

396
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:57,858
They might say, oh, yeah, well, we're not sure if you know how to do this thing.

397
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,820
And you're like, oh, yeah, you know, that's not that's not how I open my resume,

398
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,281
but I actually have worked with that thing.

399
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:06,705
You get another chance to explain what you've done, what you know, who you are

400
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,708
and so on. You might not like the answer you hear, in which case,

401
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:13,830
don't blow everything up. Thank them for their feedback.

402
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,192
And then, you know, you'll go away determined to to.

403
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,473
You know, come in better prepared next time.

404
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,096
But this is my favorite question ever.

405
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:25,463
Sometimes I have students who are like, they'll message me on Discord or something.

406
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:27,207
I'm going back in from a break.

407
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:28,168
I'm going to ask the question.

408
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:34,320
Then an hour later, I asked the question. It was awesome. It worked out so good. So, so, hey,

409
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,162
it's working for a lot of people. I don't know if, you know, please let me know if you ever try it

410
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:44,504
and how it works out for you. So, getting ready to wrap up here. I can't believe that I've been

411
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:50,986
talking for nearly half an hour and I've only had two sips of water. I understand that interviews

412
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:55,868
feel really threatening because it's like these people have my life in their hands. They have

413
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:57,328
my future in their hands.

414
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:01,740
And to a degree, I mean, yes, this is a high stakes situation.

415
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,542
But remember, you're not going to get every job you apply for.

416
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,563
You're not going to get every job you interview for.

417
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,766
So you need to get used to this a little bit and learn to use these things

418
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:16,030
as a way to increase your power going into these situations moving forward.

419
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,112
And if you are going in prepared and you know the things that you want to talk

420
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:22,234
about and you know the good stories that you're going to tell,

421
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:25,937
this actually does shift the balance of power somewhat.

422
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:31,214
So this is an audition and I love that the game industry is so full of theatre kids. I was talking

423
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:36,218
with some people about that at a party the other day. This is an audition but you are auditioning

424
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,884
them too and if you're in a group interview and there's something about the way people

425
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:45,287
are talking to each other or treating certain members of that panel that you don't like,

426
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:49,970
Please listen to your instinct on that. Not every job is a job that you want.

427
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,752
And I know that you have student loans, most of you, and that some of you have

428
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:59,976
hefty student loans, but I still think that it's better to keep looking than to take a job where

429
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:03,538
you can already tell at the interview that you're going to be really unhappy, because

430
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:08,981
being really unhappy is one of those first steps toward burnout, and that's where I don't want you

431
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,062
to end up.

432
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:14,586
So, the other thing I want you to think about is your non-verbals.

433
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:18,390
I'm not asking you to do like the power pose thing, although you certainly can if it will

434
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,835
work for you, but do think about how to make appropriate eye contact with people.

435
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:28,479
Not the I'm staring at you kind of eye contact, but, you know, basically when somebody asks

436
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,601
you a question, answer them directly.

437
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,203
I know a lot of people who say that if they…

438
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:38,008
If they ask a question and the person answers who they perceive as the highest status person

439
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:39,710
in the room, that's a problem.

440
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,851
That's a no-hire for them.

441
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:42,953
So, make sure that you are doing this appropriately.

442
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:48,559
Make sure that you are, you know, going in confident, not all like curled up like a dead

443
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,962
spider, but you know, good, like you're up there.

444
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:56,006
You're ready for this, whether it's in person or whether it's on camera, you know, go in

445
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:57,007
there with some nonverbal.

446
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:05,934
Confidence as well. So the end of this is that your skills are really important, but I know you're

447
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:09,877
getting those skills. I know that you are learning from, you know, whoever you're learning from,

448
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:14,281
how to do the tasks, how to use the software, how to do all of those things.

449
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:20,022
This is also really, really important because you are going to be part of a team.

450
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:23,466
And so this part of the hiring process, you don't want to blow off this part.

451
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:24,868
You don't want to blow off any part.

452
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,831
You want to make sure that you give this equal attention

453
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:31,295
as you do the more technical aspects of your interview.

454
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:36,639
So you know what these questions are. I'll give you a list. There are so many lists, like I said.

455
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,762
So prepare for this as thoroughly as you would prepare for a programming test, an art test,

456
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:48,707
a design test, production, and all of those things. And basically, you're on your own,

457
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,869
but you're not because you have

458
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,874
faculty and you have career services people and you have mentors and you have me if you're

459
00:26:55,894 --> 00:27:02,601
interested and all of those things and I wish you a lot of luck moving on from here into the next

460
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:05,163
amazing thing. Thank you so much.
