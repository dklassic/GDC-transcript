1
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:07,438
Go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,240
Thank you, everybody, for showing up.

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,543
I'm not sure if Troy and Sarah Lynn are here.

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:15,804
I know Donna's not here.

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:18,666
Those are the folks that organize the community summit.

6
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:20,507
So I really want to thank them.

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:23,610
It's really cool that we have this as a resource every year

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,732
to come together and talk about what's going on in community.

9
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,313
I know I look forward to it.

10
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:29,754
So I want to really thank them.

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:35,180
My presentation is called Closing Down Game Communities,

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,182
How to Plan a Dignified Breakup.

13
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:43,112
I thought this was a really important subject to talk about because I found, I work for

14
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:47,773
Lionbridge Game Services and we work with a lot of different games and so of course

15
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:51,954
this comes up more often just by virtue of the fact that we're working on several games,

16
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:54,194
that a game does have to close down.

17
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:59,116
And there really isn't that much written as far as best practices about how to do this.

18
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:03,276
And we've learned a lot over the years doing this and so I thought it would be.

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,158
a good way to share some of that knowledge.

20
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,481
Now, that being said, I realize there are folks in this room

21
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:14,083
who also work in community and who have also been involved

22
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:16,144
in closing down game communities.

23
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,385
In fact, I would love to see a show of hands

24
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,267
if anyone has ever been involved in that process,

25
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,648
actually shutting down a game community.

26
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,009
Excellent.

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,750
And then how about anybody who has played a game

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,392
that has shut down and you've been a part of that community?

29
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:32,208
Yeah, so I mean it happens.

30
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,749
It's a game is a life and it ends.

31
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,210
It is a relationship and it ends.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,971
So it's something that you have to be prepared for.

33
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,732
So it was really important to me to talk about this

34
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,193
and have a discussion.

35
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,814
So I'm gonna try to leave about five to 10 minutes at the end.

36
00:01:49,495 --> 00:01:52,736
So if anybody has anything they wanna contribute,

37
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,437
even from your own personal experience doing this

38
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,058
or any questions, I'd love to have a discussion at that time.

39
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:04,995
So I have this quote up, it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at

40
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:10,238
all because that's what you want your community to feel at the end of this process.

41
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:14,080
You want them to feel like it was important that they were a part of this.

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,782
It's better that it happened and is over than that they were never a part of it in the first

43
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:19,123
place.

44
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,286
And I'm going to touch on this several times

45
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,307
throughout the presentation.

46
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:24,669
But really what you're trying to do

47
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:28,534
is move people from this feeling of just rage and sadness

48
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:29,755
to nostalgia.

49
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,198
That's where you want them to be in the end of this process.

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,361
And I have this first part because I hold it true,

51
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,461
whate'er befall, I feel it when I sorrow most.

52
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,642
That's not always there when you see this quote,

53
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:45,923
but it's important because you want people to feel this way

54
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,623
even when they're at their saddest,

55
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:49,244
even when they're feeling their worst.

56
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,404
You want them to still feel this way.

57
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:58,411
I have an example here from StarCraft.

58
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:04,695
This I think really gives a good example of how you want your fans to feel at the end.

59
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:08,217
You want them to feel like they were a part of something important.

60
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,740
They're glad that they were there, even if they were kind of special, that they were

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,681
and others weren't.

62
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:19,544
And that it's something that they wish that they could explain to other people, that your

63
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:23,087
legacy is going to live on in a positive way.

64
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:28,773
Of course, Asheron's Call is a game that shut down recently.

65
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,074
Landmark's another one.

66
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:33,096
I have this up because I feel like this shows really,

67
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:37,038
there is a personal relationship between people

68
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:39,440
who play your game and the game itself.

69
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,581
People feel like, especially if it's been going on

70
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,223
for a really long time, like they grew up there

71
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:46,805
or like they went through a significant part of their life

72
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:49,707
with that relationship with your game.

73
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,709
And so all the more you really need to be respectful

74
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,210
and thoughtful about how you break up.

75
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,571
And then I just have this up because I have a really good friend in Seattle who is just

76
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:09,373
diehard Seattle Sonics fan and literally to this day he still puts up a happy birthday

77
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,713
to any person who was ever on the team ever.

78
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:16,995
It's been 10 plus years since this game left Seattle and still it's something that is in

79
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:20,156
his heart in which he, there's still a legacy for the memory.

80
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:26,295
So, relationship respect.

81
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:28,378
It's really important to think about the fact

82
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:32,602
that your long-term relationship, reputation is at stake.

83
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:38,146
You may have other games, you may have a brand that's associated with other games,

84
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:41,728
you may even as somebody who works in community as a community professional,

85
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,431
carry this reputation to other jobs that you take for other games.

86
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,012
So you need to think about that.

87
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,673
Now, of course, you wanna do a good job and

88
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,675
be thoughtful because that's the right thing to do.

89
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,416
But also, it will affect your reputation.

90
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,448
They've been feeling it for a while too.

91
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,972
There have probably been lots of rumors

92
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,295
about the fact the game's gonna close down

93
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,079
and you are gonna have to deal with this fact

94
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,561
that some people are gonna feel

95
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,303
they've been made a fool of a little bit.

96
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:09,725
That's something you're gonna have to address.

97
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,441
And get it together before you speak.

98
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,522
I cannot stress that enough.

99
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,604
That's really what is gonna make the difference.

100
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,146
If you're thoughtful in the way that you

101
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,729
conduct this process, it's going to change,

102
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,031
it's gonna make the outcome much more positive.

103
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,413
People are gonna feel that you cared,

104
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:32,055
you cared enough to have things be coordinated

105
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:32,976
in this end phase.

106
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:40,518
So at the beginning of any, when a closure is planned,

107
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:43,180
you need to put together a closure timeline.

108
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,982
So some things to really think about when you're putting that

109
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:49,044
together are that the communication is synced

110
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:49,945
across channels.

111
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:54,888
So that's social media, forums, official, unofficial,

112
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,890
English language, non-English.

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,233
All channels need to have this closure announcement made

114
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,494
in a way that is synced.

115
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:09,110
You also need to make sure that your PR, customer service,

116
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,871
marketing are all on board.

117
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:14,893
Because as you know, as far as your players,

118
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:18,115
your customers are concerned, it doesn't matter who's speaking.

119
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:19,135
It's your game.

120
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,656
Internally, sometimes we start to think, oh, that's PR,

121
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:22,297
that's marketing.

122
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,457
But they don't care.

123
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:25,478
If somebody in marketing is saying one thing

124
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,240
or customer service saying another, it's confusing.

125
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,282
And it gives an impression that you're not

126
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:34,443
being thoughtful about how you get this information out.

127
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:40,408
The other thing is really that everyone knows when and what to say internally at

128
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:44,929
your company, even people who aren't really typically client facing all the time.

129
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:49,011
Everybody, because of social media or just really because of the way that people

130
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:52,492
interact and communicate, they are going to be talking with people about what's

131
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:57,574
going on and you need to have a time when they are given a direct message and

132
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,895
really they know what the company line is as far as what's going on.

133
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:07,175
And one thing really I need to stress, which it can be overlooked, unfortunately,

134
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,857
is that the registration is disabled by the team.

135
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:14,639
So as soon as you make the announcement that the closure is going to happen,

136
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,841
you have to make sure that no more people can join and

137
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:18,561
play your game.

138
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:20,783
That looks really bad if you forget that step.

139
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:29,108
messaging so tailored to the channel and that all of the roads are going to lead to your closure FAQ and I'm going to talk a

140
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:36,375
little bit more about the closure FAQ later, but you need to make sure that your messaging is in line with

141
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:41,720
with your community. So as part of your closure plan, you're also just going to put together something that

142
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:46,271
if you don't already have it, catalogs, who's in charge of,

143
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,932
and what all your channels are.

144
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,914
Again, official and unofficial,

145
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:53,398
because fan sites on Facebook can be just as powerful,

146
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:56,221
or even more powerful, than your own official sites.

147
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,823
And when you tailor the messaging,

148
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,405
The more personal you make it, the more it's going to have an impact.

149
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:07,967
For example, if you have a group of Russian folks that meet up at a bar and

150
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,569
they always meet up at a certain time, drink a certain beer, whatever,

151
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:15,570
you reference that beer when you are making this closure announcement.

152
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,911
Just every little thing that you can do to really show people that it's personal,

153
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:22,273
and it is some big corporate branded messaging,

154
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,533
it's going to make the impact that much better.

155
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:33,230
So some key points to hit in the Closure FAQ are why, when,

156
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,811
what about all my stuff, what now, and can we still talk?

157
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,991
So why?

158
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:40,152
You're going to have to address it.

159
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,232
People are going to ask, why is this happening?

160
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:46,253
Now, you can't always be exactly direct about what's going on.

161
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,513
You can't give them financials.

162
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,074
But it's something you're going to have to address.

163
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:50,374
They want to know why it's happening.

164
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:54,111
When it's going to happen and you want to put time zone,

165
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,431
you want to put exact time.

166
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,913
Again, you want people all around the world to know

167
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,954
that you aren't just thinking about West Coast US

168
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:00,914
when you put this time up.

169
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,435
You are thinking that people need to know

170
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,136
what it is in their own time zone.

171
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,018
What's going to happen to my stuff?

172
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:08,978
Now that's a big one.

173
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,140
There's in-game currency that people have invested,

174
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,980
time and money.

175
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,061
You have to have a plan laid out

176
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,983
as far as what is going to happen and in what time.

177
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:30,831
What now? This is when you have to be a little bit careful with if you have other games you can push people to the other games but you want to not come across as too salesy or marketingy, especially at a time when people are feeling bad.

178
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:33,353
So it's something to be careful about.

179
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:37,817
And then can we still talk? How long can people keep talking with you?

180
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,139
through the channels that they currently are?

181
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,900
When does it switch over to customer service?

182
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,281
Do you even have that option?

183
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:46,283
These are things that you need to outline.

184
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:50,046
This is not a complete version of FAQ,

185
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:53,248
but just minimize so that you can get the gist of it.

186
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,371
So some other things to think about are reasonable questions.

187
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,373
You all play this game too, so what are some things

188
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:00,293
that you would want to know?

189
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:06,376
The tone, I used to work for Lego on the Lego Universe game,

190
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,937
so of course in that game,

191
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,777
when we were closing down that game,

192
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:13,878
we spoke to people from the point of view

193
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:16,619
that they were children, mostly children playing this game.

194
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,359
You have to keep that tone that you had otherwise

195
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,980
in your community and carry it over into the Closure FAQ.

196
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,121
Again, pushing people to other games.

197
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,742
And then disabled comments is really important.

198
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,882
You're gonna have plenty of spaces.

199
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:35,386
online, again, social media, your forums, other forum topics, etc.

200
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,668
Where people can discuss what's going on.

201
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,510
So this is not about stifling conversation.

202
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,493
But you wanna have one place where it is pristine,

203
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,536
where you have exactly the message that is coming from your company.

204
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,658
Which you can change if you need to later on, but

205
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,701
where there's no distracting comments coming in about people.

206
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,347
who are saying what is up there is wrong,

207
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,849
or arguing about it, or whatever.

208
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,431
That can go on in other spaces,

209
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,114
but in your closure FAQ,

210
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,117
you want that to be completely controlled by you.

211
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:10,237
So we've got some examples of what I think are FAQs that are done right, and also this

212
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,558
is still live, the glitch shut down.

213
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:19,142
I thought they did a really good job of, again, keeping the tone of how their game, how they'd

214
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:23,525
spoken with their community otherwise, and addressing all of the major issues in a thoughtful

215
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,346
way and a way that showed they cared.

216
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,161
And then I've got LEGO Universe up here.

217
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,803
Again, I thought we did a good job on that.

218
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,904
Number two, I think it's a really good example

219
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,926
of the tone or thinking about your audience

220
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,988
because why I love LEGO Universe.

221
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,670
For a kid, the world revolves around them.

222
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,472
So they're like, I like this game.

223
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,513
How could it be shutting down if I like it?

224
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,635
So you really just need to make sure

225
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,696
that you're speaking directly to your community

226
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:51,637
as you would otherwise.

227
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,201
Adapting editorial calendar.

228
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,364
So you're going to want to tailor your campaigns in such

229
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:02,166
a way that you're not just going to throw everything out.

230
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:04,388
Once you make the announcement that the closure is happening,

231
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,790
you don't just stop at every fun thing you've ever

232
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,351
done in your community.

233
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,653
But you're going to tailor it so, again,

234
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,977
moving people from this feeling of rage to nostalgia.

235
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,678
So I just have an example.

236
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,380
I got a very simplified active community

237
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,262
for a little game about zoo animals

238
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,369
When you have an active community, you all know what you're doing is you're trying to

239
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:29,672
get people excited about what's going to happen in the future.

240
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,276
You want suggestions for new things.

241
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:36,982
You want them to be showing what's going on right now in the game and inviting people

242
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,544
and having live...

243
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,863
live gameplay with the moderators and all that kind of thing,

244
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,564
map ideas for new worlds.

245
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,224
That's something when things are active,

246
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:52,367
but when you've announced the closure,

247
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,288
you're going to want to change that.

248
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:57,409
But it doesn't mean it just is no fun anymore.

249
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,750
But what you want to do is you want to take people,

250
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,671
take their interests and move them

251
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,592
towards celebrating what they have done.

252
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:05,733
So you can do tribute campaigns.

253
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:06,093
You can.

254
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,935
have perhaps, if you had live play with the moderators,

255
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:13,557
maybe now the moderators put together a topic in the forums

256
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,538
where they talk about their favorite people

257
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:18,260
who they played with and what they did and all that.

258
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,082
Again, just moving it to this place of nostalgia.

259
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:29,026
So, once the closure announcement has been made,

260
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,147
that's when.

261
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:35,430
you need to start ramping up your moderator hours.

262
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,894
So again, this is to the extent that you can do this.

263
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,136
Sometimes that's not possible,

264
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,839
but it's really important at this time,

265
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,682
if you can, to do that because.

266
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:51,987
This is going to be the time when all of these negative comments are just flooding in and

267
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:57,351
you have a lot of people who are not really contributing positively to the conversation.

268
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:02,275
So this is a time when moderators are really, really important to go through and make sure

269
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:06,178
that what's coming in is productive.

270
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:08,323
Support your team.

271
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:11,446
This is something that's really important to me as somebody who manages people who work

272
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:16,510
in community because if you work in community you do really have to have a very thick skin.

273
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:21,035
There's people saying really mean awful things to you all the time and to each other.

274
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,739
And so of course to some extent you have to kind of be built for that if you're working

275
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,239
in community.

276
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:26,800
However,

277
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:34,229
working through this kind of experience can be really more than that and it really can take its toll on people who are

278
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,651
day in day out

279
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:37,013
dealing with

280
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:40,077
talking with people who are just completely

281
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:45,103
enraged so as a manager you really want to make sure that you are

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,342
Reaching out to people one-on-one who are on your team.

283
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,523
If you can, if you work in an office together,

284
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,744
get people together.

285
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:56,347
If you work in a virtual team, which is often the case,

286
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,369
especially these international communities,

287
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,791
have more video chats.

288
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:05,033
Send pictures of kittens with hats on.

289
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,775
I mean, just really try to engage with people

290
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:11,037
and recognize that this is a tough thing

291
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:11,858
to have to work through.

292
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:16,030
The other thing is reaching out directly to positive users.

293
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,411
Now that's something that in community

294
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,512
that we're doing all the time.

295
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,314
We're always reaching out to people

296
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,456
who we see as positive influencers.

297
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:25,018
But in this case, it's another time

298
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,400
to really refocus on that

299
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,402
because you're gonna find people will emerge

300
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,604
and sometimes they're surprisingly people

301
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:32,325
who otherwise haven't been as active.

302
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:37,351
But they're people that really, for whatever reason,

303
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:38,832
this is where they shine.

304
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,595
They shine in helping people through this kind of experience.

305
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:45,219
And you want to focus on those people, contact them directly,

306
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:48,542
but also publicly really give them a lot of attention

307
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:51,265
so that they'll inspire others to do the same.

308
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,387
And then updating the FAQ and messaging as needed.

309
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:57,788
This is really important, too, because you

310
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,870
need to be flexible in your messaging.

311
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,993
Like I said before, the closure FAQ, that is controlled by you.

312
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:07,654
But if nobody is understanding what's

313
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:10,316
going on on a certain subject, that

314
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,957
means that you've written it in a way that's not clear.

315
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:16,700
And so you need to go back there and update that, and even

316
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,441
possibly push out additional messaging

317
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,002
if it really was unclear.

318
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,022
in a way that is just gumming up the community.

319
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,704
So in the final two weeks,

320
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,424
again, this is part of the closure plan.

321
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,105
You wanna have this all really timed out perfectly

322
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,366
and make sure that everybody in your company knows

323
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,047
exactly when all this messaging is going on.

324
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:47,049
You push out additional messaging via all those channels

325
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,690
two weeks prior to the closure.

326
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:56,153
the same in-game messaging and also email, basically any way that you have, any means

327
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:59,773
that you have to contact your community, you're going to do that two weeks ahead of time,

328
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:04,074
one week ahead of time, and one day ahead of time, and then of course at the time of

329
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,055
the closure itself.

330
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:10,116
And your community is going to notice that this is being done in a methodical way.

331
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:15,617
Again, going back to this whole thing about showing that you are thoughtful in the way

332
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:19,818
that you are carrying out this process is going to pay off.

333
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,719
And then this is the end.

334
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,640
I realize I'm going a little bit too fast here,

335
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,941
so we'll have lots of time for questions at the end.

336
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:34,163
But what you wanna do in the end is button up financial.

337
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:37,665
So make sure that all of these, the in-game currency,

338
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:38,945
anything that you've outlined

339
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:40,606
as far as how this should take place.

340
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:48,345
has taken place and things are refunded, any kind of disputes that are going on have been

341
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:54,013
resolved, and then you're going to close down all of your channels and make sure that

342
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:58,398
Although there is some dispute there depending on,

343
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,799
well, it depends on how much ability you have

344
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,820
to keep your channels open,

345
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,880
but usually you're gonna wanna shut down

346
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,741
all of your social media channels,

347
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:09,222
all of your forum except for the FAQ.

348
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,223
If you have the ability to keep it live for a little while,

349
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:14,284
that's just gonna help some people who are confused.

350
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,136
And then look forward.

351
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,719
You can take pride in what went right

352
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,182
and forgive yourself for what went wrong.

353
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,744
There are going to be bumps along the way.

354
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:28,805
That's just how it is.

355
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:32,328
And even, of course, if you do it perfectly,

356
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:34,149
there's always gonna be people that are upset.

357
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,290
That's how it is in community.

358
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,713
But as a person who works in community,

359
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:39,994
you have to be able to take...

360
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:45,919
Take what you learned from this and move on and just be proud of yourself

361
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:49,482
that you've done the best job that you can and shown respect to this community of people.

362
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:55,646
And that's just a little plug because we're having a party.

363
00:18:55,686 --> 00:19:00,830
Lionbridge Game Services is having a party on Thursday, 6 to 9 at the Press Club.

364
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,034
I really wanted to make sure that everybody at the Community Summit knows about this

365
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:09,677
because it's free food and free booze, so I know how community people are.

366
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,157
So come on by and it's just a couple blocks from GDC.

367
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:19,542
And actually I have little tickets up here if anyone wants that as a reminder.

368
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:22,245
But that's really all that I had.

369
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:26,149
I kind of, I wanted to give some time for discussion again,

370
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,833
knowing that people in the room I'm sure have experience.

371
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:36,097
with this kind of thing. So if anybody has any questions. Oh, I'm also supposed to remind people

372
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:41,860
that there is a survey that's going to be sent out to you after this is over. So if you could

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,423
feel, please fill it out. Yeah. And if anybody has any questions or comments or has something

374
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:53,586
that you've had as a personal experience, I would love to hear it. Hi.

375
00:19:55,816 --> 00:20:02,040
I actually work for Total Rock Studios as a community manager at the time when our contract

376
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,461
ended with Evolve Stage 2.

377
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:10,226
I can say before I ask my question, one thing that went over really well was we did a video

378
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:11,747
beforehand.

379
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:17,531
I interviewed all the devs talking about their experience in that nostalgic way and how they

380
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,833
felt and also reassured the community that good things were to come and it seemed to

381
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:22,714
go over really well.

382
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:31,772
We also took a picture of everyone that was close to the community because we had about 60 devs that were constantly communicating with them on the forums and discord and we held up a sign that thanked them.

383
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:32,513
That's awesome.

384
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:33,574
It went over really well.

385
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,095
Yeah.

386
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,138
But my question to you would be.

387
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,140
When you've moved on and you're working on a whole different other project,

388
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:47,646
and you still, every time you post on social media, you get those kind of like upset comments,

389
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:52,790
what's the best way to handle that so it doesn't seem like you're pushing your other content,

390
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:58,636
but you're, you also care about how they're feeling, but you want them to know and understand, like,

391
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:04,000
empathetically, we're still, you know, moving on and we're trying to survive in the studio and do things.

392
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:07,695
that we can to keep doing what we love.

393
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:10,996
It's not that we don't care about the old project.

394
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,277
So I'm going to repeat the question.

395
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:17,119
I think what you're saying is when you have another game that

396
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,302
is active and people continue to go back and complain

397
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:26,043
about the fact the previous game is already over, what can you do?

398
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:28,385
Well, I mean, to some extent, there is just the.

399
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:34,769
I feel for you kind of reaction that you can give.

400
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,230
I mean, if they're saying,

401
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,092
if some of their comment is about the new game,

402
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,575
you can of course speak to that and then say, sorry.

403
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,917
And if you have questions here or in some cases,

404
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,573
Another kind of fan site has sprung up that's not official that you are cool with.

405
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,715
You can push people to that, even for games that have closed.

406
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:59,096
They still live on in these other ways.

407
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,537
But there's not so much you can do.

408
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:06,620
I mean, that does, of course, continue to happen, especially when you are a company

409
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,980
that has several games.

410
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,501
That's just going to continue to happen.

411
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:14,143
But I think the main thing is like what you're saying, is the empathy.

412
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:16,905
Just tell people that you're feeling for them.

413
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,005
Thank them for their...

414
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:21,311
that they loved the game, you know?

415
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:24,935
And eventually that will end.

416
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:27,459
But I do think at that point,

417
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,902
I mean, I guess it depends on the length of time it's been.

418
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:32,885
I think there is a certain point where it is okay

419
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:35,048
to start getting a little bit more pushy

420
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:36,490
about marketing to the new game.

421
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:40,613
I guess, or just, hey, have you seen this?

422
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:44,054
Wow, check it out, in a more overt way.

423
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:49,356
But yeah, I don't know, is that helpful at all?

424
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:52,577
Yeah, no, it's not so much that we're trying to market,

425
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,757
but we just want them to know that it's like,

426
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:58,578
look in our shoes, we're just doing what we love.

427
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,629
Right, well, I guess with that, I wouldn't get too,

428
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,651
even though they will get personal,

429
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:11,255
I wouldn't get too personal in a way that is like,

430
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:16,719
you know, could be perceived at all as defensive, I guess.

431
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,762
Yeah, yeah, I would just say, you're sorry for,

432
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,924
I would put it on them more in that you're sorry

433
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,966
for their experience versus, you know,

434
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,508
we're sorry that it happened,

435
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:29,329
because it had to happen

436
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:30,730
for all the reasons you've outlined.

437
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:34,581
Yeah, it seems to, they've been adapting.

438
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,882
It has slowed down, so it's a tough one.

439
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:37,543
Thank you.

440
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:38,463
Cool, yeah, thanks.

441
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:40,063
Hi.

442
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,085
Hi, I'm Sam Elsbrandt, a student.

443
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:45,766
So, really great presentation.

444
00:23:45,786 --> 00:23:46,046
Thanks.

445
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,547
Throughout all that you showed us

446
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,728
what community managers should do.

447
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,510
My question to you is, what are some of the mistakes

448
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,971
that you see happen often that community managers do

449
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,212
when they close down?

450
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,231
Well, I think the biggest mistake can be eliminated by that closure plan,

451
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,892
which is that things are not coordinated.

452
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:13,133
So one thing that I forgot to mention when I was talking about that is,

453
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:17,734
some of the departments, marketing, customer service,

454
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,394
they might have automatic emails.

455
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:26,339
that go out. If you, for example, don't have that coordinated and they have some sort of

456
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:32,643
auto messaging goes out that is as if the game is still going on, that is still in the movement of

457
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:39,248
acquiring new people, that looks really bad. So that's not necessarily a community manager

458
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:43,391
mistake, but as far as the entire process, that's a mistake that can be made.

459
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:47,994
And then, yeah, I mean, taking it personally

460
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,915
and maybe getting overwhelmed by the situation

461
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:53,337
and getting into this kind of,

462
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,879
can happen in any kind of situation

463
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:56,999
when you have a group of people.

464
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,860
I mean, at a restaurant happens when, you know,

465
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:00,962
if your boss thinks everybody sucks,

466
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,303
then all the waiters think everybody sucks too.

467
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:06,025
You know, like you kind of like get in that kind of feeling

468
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:07,766
where it's like, they're all against us.

469
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:11,608
So I think a mistake that can happen is people can get,

470
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:13,789
they're just getting pounded on by these horrible.

471
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,071
really unreasonable comments all the time,

472
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:17,933
they start to get into the space where they don't,

473
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:22,516
their skin isn't thick enough and they lash out.

474
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,779
So I think those two things really,

475
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,083
again, having things very clearly defined,

476
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:32,725
who's in charge of what in a timeline

477
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,446
and having that predefined,

478
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:38,269
that will eliminate most of the mistakes.

479
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,390
Thank you.

480
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,291
Yeah, you're welcome.

481
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:42,434
Hello.

482
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:42,954
Hi.

483
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,935
So you mentioned that people, you know,

484
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,095
the company creates a world.

485
00:25:48,536 --> 00:25:50,536
And people come in and they develop a lot of sort

486
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:53,397
of emotional investment and even economic assets.

487
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,598
And then the world gets closed down.

488
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:56,978
And so it just made me think.

489
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,779
Suppose I was the governor of Hawaii and a bunch

490
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,920
of people came there and they built buildings

491
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,980
and got to know everyone.

492
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,322
I just decided that it wasn't working for me.

493
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,143
So I kick everyone out of Hawaii and I blow it up

494
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,563
and send it under the ocean.

495
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:19,476
My thought is, why do the game companies close these places down instead of just releasing them into the wild?

496
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:23,339
Why don't you let people sustain their game?

497
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,665
Right, I think in some cases, actually with Glitch,

498
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,927
they did, I think they actually did

499
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:33,991
release it into the wild somewhat.

500
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:37,094
So some companies do do that.

501
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:41,018
It's mostly, I think, has to do with brand,

502
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:42,940
ownership of your own brand.

503
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,944
So, you know, if you release it into the wild and then it turns into some alt-right something,

504
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:53,808
you know what I mean, like then it's associated with your brand, it's a big, big risk.

505
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:59,632
So that is, you know, again, speaking to the thing I was talking about as far as people

506
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:02,114
thinking it's you no matter who you are.

507
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:06,998
It doesn't matter if you would say to somebody, oh, that's actually not my game.

508
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:10,821
They're going to see that mark on there and that character and they're going to think

509
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,121
it's you.

510
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:12,902
So that's really, that's the main reason.

511
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:14,416
Good question.

512
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:16,196
Yeah.

513
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:16,777
I'm Garrett.

514
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:18,818
I'm a producer with the Army Game Studio.

515
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:25,621
And while not entirely shutting down a game, what would you say, with the steps, like,

516
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:28,122
we're seizing development, but the game's still going to be live.

517
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:29,783
It's on the live support, it's bug fixing.

518
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:33,845
How do you message that without everyone going, oh, it's done, bye, and just walking off?

519
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:41,638
Well, I guess it depends on what your intention really is with the game.

520
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:45,761
You know, I mean, if the intention is to keep it going,

521
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,464
I would be transparent about that.

522
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,908
If your intention is not to keep it going, I would.

523
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,850
This gets into the question of your overall business plan,

524
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,931
because there's only so many resources

525
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:02,993
that you can put on any project.

526
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,834
So if you have other games going on,

527
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:10,317
and this one isn't really going to make any more money for you,

528
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:12,258
or it's not going to be a focus, and you're probably

529
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,960
going to want to have fewer campaigns, less moderation,

530
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,321
whatever, anything that costs money,

531
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,942
and put it to your other games.

532
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:24,763
You know, if you're planning on, really are planning on keeping it going long term, I

533
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:30,725
would just, you know, based on what kind of need you need for moderators, community managers

534
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:36,347
for it currently, I would base that plan on that going forward.

535
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:42,328
But if you really are planning on closing it down, I would start to, again, it depends

536
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:42,468
on.

537
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,749
how much you're able to tell people,

538
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,210
but I would start to ramp it down

539
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,090
and save your resources for games

540
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,851
that really are gonna be making money for you.

541
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:54,231
Okay, thank you.

542
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:54,371
Mm-hmm.

543
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,793
I have another question. Sure.

544
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,473
When you close down something or you cease development,

545
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,155
emotions are really high, and sometimes,

546
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:05,995
as you all know, community members

547
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:08,216
have invested so much emotionally in something.

548
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,756
When it goes away,

549
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,556
Is there any advice you can give when they're kind of imploding

550
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:18,039
and people are reaching out to you from the community talking about

551
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,821
even something as serious as suicide based on it

552
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:25,504
or that everything they're like is going wrong and it's just one more thing

553
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:28,126
or I know you mentioned nostalgia.

554
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:30,628
I guess that would probably be the best way to take it,

555
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,529
but I wasn't sure.

556
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,031
Well, when it comes to people talking about suicide,

557
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,694
you should as a community manager have...

558
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:45,768
guidelines in place already how to deal with any threat to one's own self or others.

559
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,313
So I would continue on that same plan that you have.

560
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:59,222
And as far as people imploding otherwise in a way that isn't dangerous, same thing really

561
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:01,985
is to reach out to people and talk about.

562
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:04,674
the good old days, basically.

563
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:06,535
I mean, you should be doing that individually,

564
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,817
but also with the way that you put together

565
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,960
your editorial calendar, that you continue to push people.

566
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,942
If people are just like, so sad,

567
00:30:13,982 --> 00:30:16,644
I don't have the whatever X thing to do anymore.

568
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:19,186
We, you know, hey, we just started a contest

569
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:22,389
that is the best moments from that.

570
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:23,670
Let's take a look at it.

571
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,371
Okay, wonderful, thank you.

572
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:25,732
You're welcome.

573
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:31,208
comes to suicide and most of it was very unfeeling.

574
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,830
So it was almost cold.

575
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,135
So it was hard to, to the point where other community members

576
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:36,996
were reaching out saying,

577
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:38,898
please help this other community member.

578
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,500
I would, I'm happy to talk with you directly about that.

579
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,421
That's actually really very important to me, that subject.

580
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:53,382
And it's something that you have to have in your guidelines,

581
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:59,184
exactly, a phone tree, what are local resources, what people

582
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,345
should do, volunteer community managers and moderators.

583
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:06,166
There should be a very exact plan

584
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:07,126
about how to deal with that.

585
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,487
It shouldn't be left for the community

586
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,087
to help each other out.

587
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,088
It's pretty dangerous.

588
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:11,308
Yeah.

589
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:12,894
Mm-hmm.

590
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:14,877
Hello.

591
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:15,659
Hi.

592
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,420
My name is Alex.

593
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:21,368
I'm working on a game that will close at the end of the year.

594
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:27,017
But for contract reasons, it's actually not doing bad.

595
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:33,474
And the users will be very surprised because of that,

596
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:36,676
because they know it's doing all right.

597
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,637
They know it's the same number of players

598
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:42,418
we had one year ago, or stuff like that.

599
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,500
And we are not quite allowed to tell them

600
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,202
that it's happening for contract reasons.

601
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,223
Do you have any advice in this case?

602
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:52,884
You mean it's like IP?

603
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,084
You're not allowed to renew the IP?

604
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:54,304
Yeah.

605
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:04,381
That's a good question because, yeah, I mean, it is one of the things you have to address that.

606
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:13,106
I guess I would say, you know, kind of the catch-all weird diverting resources to other games kind of thing.

607
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:14,747
I mean, you can always kind of go that way.

608
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:17,268
You can't say that the game isn't doing well.

609
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:22,872
You can say that, you know, even though it's popular, it doesn't make sense for us financially, which is true.

610
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:31,517
It's tough though. It is tough when you have a really active, thriving community where there's no guess that it's coming.

611
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:40,423
But yeah, that is the truth. It doesn't make sense financially if you aren't going to have the contract anymore for that IP.

612
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:46,928
So yeah, you have to be kind of vague, unfortunately, because you can't talk about that directly.

613
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,649
Thank you. And I have another question.

614
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:56,024
being a free to play games, we have the free to play players and the whales.

615
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:58,125
And do you think so?

616
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:07,127
I'm thinking maybe in the last month that everybody should have access to what the

617
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:12,088
whales previously had to the what we could buy on hard currency.

618
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:13,008
Oh, sure.

619
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:19,749
Do you think this is a good idea or maybe it would make the whales even more angry?

620
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:24,119
I don't think so. I mean, no, in fact, that's I didn't include that in here,

621
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:27,842
but that is something that you can do at the end is just pretty much make it like,

622
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,765
all right, everybody can have whatevs. I mean, cause it is the end. I mean,

623
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:35,308
a whale, the whales, they shouldn't be mad. It's like the last month, you know,

624
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,450
I think of course you will, again,

625
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,892
there's always going to be some people who are that way,

626
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,216
but I think generally more people are going to be happy if you do that.

627
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,578
So I would say go for it. Yeah.

628
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,702
And then I think this is prior, oh, the last question.

629
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:51,543
Wrap it up.

630
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,043
Yeah.

631
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:56,427
As you probably know, PR is a little on the abrupt side

632
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,269
when it comes to covering your game while it's live,

633
00:33:58,349 --> 00:33:59,450
and man, they jump on it

634
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,091
as soon as you make the closing announcement.

635
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:01,531
Sure.

636
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:04,174
How do you take steps to control the damage

637
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:09,518
when you have media or gaming media cover closure,

638
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:12,040
especially when it's outside of your control mechanisms,

639
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,462
like within your own communities?

640
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:15,604
What steps have you seen that works?

641
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,061
Not to throw anybody under the rock, paper, shotgun.

642
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:24,084
Some of the more, they make a business out of slandering

643
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,444
some of the game companies and stuff like that

644
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:26,885
when they go down.

645
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:31,747
So the question is really like the folks in the media,

646
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:34,368
what they do with the story that your PR department

647
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:36,809
has put out, like them taking it and?

648
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,290
Whether you put out a PR or not.

649
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,152
Like if they catch wind through game communities

650
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:44,333
that a game goes down, boom, they put you on blast

651
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:44,993
on the front page.

652
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,622
Well, I think part of to prevent that even from happening

653
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:53,184
in the first place is to take control of that message

654
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:57,327
and send out a press release.

655
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:59,168
Because if they're catching wind of it,

656
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:01,710
that would mean your closure plan has kind of gone awry.

657
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,630
You know what I mean?

658
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,032
If they're catching wind of it from your community

659
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:08,794
versus having received a direct announcement

660
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:11,315
or seeing that there's actually a press release,

661
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,337
I didn't mention that here, but there should

662
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:14,497
be a press release live.

663
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:21,483
on your website, then they are going to be kind of making up stories from rumors.

664
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:22,704
So that's the one thing.

665
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:28,269
But of course, again, there's always going to be people who want to sell more banner

666
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:33,193
ads or whatever and kind of make it more sensational than it is.

667
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:37,297
The only way there is, again, to just direct people to the correct.

668
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:42,178
information. If you have your PR folks, depending on the size of your company,

669
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:46,480
should have probably direct relationships with some of the people at those

670
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,781
companies and reach out to them directly, correct if they have information that's

671
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:55,262
wrong. But there's only so much you can do to control that other than just again

672
00:35:55,342 --> 00:36:00,383
have a coordinated messaging in the first place and then also having a place

673
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:04,304
where people can refer to you for the correct, you know, information from your

674
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:04,704
company.

675
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:10,054
So I'm sorry, so you would basically, so even if we make all the announcements

676
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,436
and everything internally, social networking, would you suggest actually

677
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:15,437
