1
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:07,634
All right, so my name is Bruno Velasquez.

2
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:10,556
I'm the Animation Director at Sony Santa Monica.

3
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:14,378
I've been with the studio since 2006,

4
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,560
so I had a long relationship with Kratos,

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,961
about 13 years or so.

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,203
My first game at the studio was God of War II,

7
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,184
and that was a great experience,

8
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:28,246
working with Cory Barlog as Game Director,

9
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:30,147
and for this latest project,

10
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,088
had the opportunity to work with him again,

11
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:32,649
which was great.

12
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,610
This is my first animation bootcamp,

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,771
so this is amazing that I get to be here

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,932
with all of you guys, talk about animation.

15
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,713
It's amazing, I'm so happy to be here.

16
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:43,713
So thank you for having me.

17
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:47,395
And the name of my talk is God of War,

18
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:49,616
Breathing New Life into a Hardened Spartan.

19
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:55,328
So God of War, it's a franchise from Sony.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,551
It's on the eighth game now.

21
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:01,093
The latest one came out last year.

22
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:06,058
And it centers around a Spartan named Kratos.

23
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,820
The first seven games pretty much

24
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,403
delved into Greek mythology.

25
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,325
And the latest one, we decided to take it

26
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,426
into the Norse realm.

27
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:19,606
Now, one of the biggest things when Corey Barlog first

28
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:23,569
set off to give us the mission on how we were going

29
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,191
to make this game, one of the challenges for animation

30
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:28,613
was how we're going to reimagine Kratos.

31
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:30,494
How are we going to present him in a new light?

32
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,977
We kind of wanted to not completely throw everything

33
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,438
away that we did in the past before,

34
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,240
but we want to kind of depict him in a new light,

35
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,443
present him in a new way for new audiences,

36
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,845
and also to please the fans that had been with us for so long.

37
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:50,990
So our first mission was to reimagine Kratos.

38
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:52,672
How were we gonna do that?

39
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:56,476
So most everybody knows Kratos this way.

40
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,439
They remember him from previous games

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,703
in a path of vengeance and rage and destruction.

42
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:08,328
You know, that was his mission, right?

43
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:10,430
It was to get revenge, to get payback from the gods.

44
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,572
So in order to kind of change a little bit

45
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,573
of that perception, we needed to focus on the humanity.

46
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,734
So we need to make a conscious effort

47
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,435
on how we're gonna show more of the human side of Kratos.

48
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,036
So from an animation standpoint,

49
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:30,397
that was a very interesting challenge for us.

50
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:35,719
So when you think of a character like the Hulk,

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,380
I had to make my own drawing just to be safe.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,401
Don't wanna make anybody mad at me.

53
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,440
But when you think of a character like the Hulk,

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,302
you know, there's two sides of him, right?

55
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:50,965
There's the Hulk side, the angry green guy,

56
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,107
and then there's Banner, there's the human side.

57
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,113
So what we needed to do was explore that for Kratos, you know.

58
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,265
Those Kratos, what about Kratos?

59
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,007
Does Kratos have that side?

60
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:03,587
Or is he all just full of rage?

61
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,309
So if you look back into the previous games,

62
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,871
there were little glimpses of that humanity.

63
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,612
We didn't show them very often,

64
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:11,512
but there was a little bit, right?

65
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,854
He at one point wanted to save his brother,

66
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,657
wanted to rescue him once he found out

67
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:19,497
that he was still alive.

68
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,159
His brother Deimos was, fought alongside with him

69
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,680
for a little bit before he lost him again.

70
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:29,505
There was moments where he showed compassion

71
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,446
and care for his family,

72
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,793
even though he ended up tragically by mistake killing them.

73
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,737
But there was glimpses there that he missed them,

74
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,400
he wanted to embrace them and be with them once again.

75
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:47,424
And of course, the moment of regret and remorse

76
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,306
where he pretty much wanted to end it all.

77
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,616
He wanted to move on, he couldn't deal with it.

78
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:57,759
So definitely, as much as we showed moments of power

79
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,980
and strength in Kratos, there was also a little bit

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,582
of the human side kind of sprinkled throughout the games.

81
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,305
You know, it wasn't all about ripping people's heads off.

82
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:11,848
Well, actually, it kind of was, most of the time, right?

83
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,230
But we had to basically ask ourselves,

84
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,412
how are we gonna go from this to something like this?

85
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:23,200
where Curtis is gonna be a teacher, a mentor, a protector.

86
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,144
That was just something that we hadn't done much of before.

87
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:32,706
So one of the first things that we did

88
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,988
is we looked at his proportions.

89
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:40,633
If we wanted to have someone that people can sympathize

90
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:44,936
with more, we need to revisit the way he looked a bit.

91
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,257
This is Kratos from the previous games.

92
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,519
The proportions are a bit wacky, I gotta admit.

93
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,021
He's got super long arms, super long legs, a tiny head.

94
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,723
I mean, look at his hands.

95
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:57,944
He can crush his own head.

96
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,945
Just, it's a little bit off, right?

97
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:05,828
But in the end, for what we needed these proportions for,

98
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,829
it kind of worked out.

99
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:11,056
You know, we were going for more of this comic book

100
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,137
over the top style in the previous games.

101
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:17,298
So those proportions kind of read well

102
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,698
in the poses that we needed him to be.

103
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,100
Not to mention that the perspective of the game

104
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,480
was much farther away.

105
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,181
So he needed to read a lot clearer.

106
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,882
So those proportions worked well.

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,881
Now, one of the first things I did,

108
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,302
once Corey gave me the direction of like,

109
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,264
well, he's gonna be a father figure,

110
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,124
he's gonna have a son,

111
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:42,206
so I just kind of scrambled and looked for some old models,

112
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,487
or just grabbed whatever we had at the time

113
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,628
at the beginning of the project,

114
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,790
started posting cradles out in different situations.

115
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,610
In this case, I just grabbed,

116
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,552
actually, that's his brother Demos as a kid.

117
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,654
So it's a little weird to have his younger brother there.

118
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,877
But that was all we had to represent Atreus at the time.

119
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:04,041
So in these, I kind of just wanted to explore

120
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,464
what it would feel like for Kratos to be a protector.

121
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,727
And also a teacher and a mentor.

122
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:15,109
So here are some early poses of him teaching his son

123
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,030
how to hunt, how to use the bow.

124
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,692
And also a situation which you would never really see

125
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,654
in the previous games, just sitting down and talking,

126
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:25,335
having a conversation, eating and drinking.

127
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,636
When did Kratos ever do that, right?

128
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:29,618
So we wanted to start exploring those things.

129
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:33,200
But as you can see, the proportions, you know,

130
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,782
the old models, yeah, it still was a little bit off.

131
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:41,306
So as the script progressed, there was a couple of scenes

132
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,688
that we found out about where Kratos, you know,

133
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,050
the son was gonna be sick at one point.

134
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,734
Kratos had to put his hand on his son's shoulder

135
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,616
at one point, even though it took him a little bit of time

136
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:53,397
to do that in the game.

137
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,342
He was also meant to carry him at one point in his back

138
00:06:58,603 --> 00:06:59,704
during the climbing sequences.

139
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:03,326
So I started posting this old models.

140
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,987
And as you can see, yes,

141
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,989
the proportions needed some development

142
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,530
in order for him to feel a little bit more human.

143
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,493
So the Concept Art team started working on that.

144
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:16,675
As you can see, this is very, some early concept

145
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:18,376
where he started to,

146
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,458
they started taking inspiration from the previous games

147
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:21,338
and the way that he looked.

148
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:23,872
I started adding the beard,

149
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,792
started adding the Norse motifs to him.

150
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:31,874
And as you can see, he has a bit more of a human proportions,

151
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:36,115
a little bit closer to a more relatable human.

152
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,576
Even his weapon, as you can see, at the early stages,

153
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:43,456
there was no, it wasn't a magical axe.

154
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,297
It was just a simple weapon that he was to use.

155
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:49,958
The direction of the game early on was very grounded.

156
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,198
It was meant to be a lot more realistic.

157
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,482
And in the early beginnings, as I will show you,

158
00:07:57,303 --> 00:08:00,746
some of the early animation was very grounded

159
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:06,232
and more not as sort of over the top as it ended up being.

160
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:10,636
So we had to dial that in to make it work

161
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:11,697
with the direction of the game.

162
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:13,919
Here's a shot of...

163
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,695
The 3D model, as if it was making progress.

164
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:24,737
This is around the time of the E3 reveal in 2016.

165
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,038
The first time that we showed Kratos to the public,

166
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,258
the new Kratos emerging from the shadows.

167
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,339
So as you can see already, he was starting to feel

168
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:38,300
a little more human than how we previously depicted him.

169
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,981
But of course, he needed to, again, interact with his son.

170
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:49,631
So even though he had more human-like proportions now,

171
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,874
he still needed to feel like a giant amongst men.

172
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:57,117
So even the interactions with the son,

173
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:01,360
while they worked in the game, he was still a pretty large man.

174
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,577
The next thing that we needed to look into was posing.

175
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:11,178
How are we gonna create our poses in our animation

176
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,299
to best depict Kratos in this new light?

177
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,881
Older, grounded, sort of more weathered warrior.

178
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,922
So looking back at the previous games,

179
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:28,863
this is some of the poses that we went for more

180
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,024
heavy metal magazine cover.

181
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,184
type of look, comic book over the top.

182
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,325
And many of these poses, what's interesting

183
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,966
about these poses is that many of these poses

184
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,487
were done by the animators.

185
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:47,330
So we did not really want other teams,

186
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,331
like marketing teams working on our poses

187
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,453
as much as possible, because we wanted to maintain

188
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:54,914
the feel of the character throughout, even in marketing.

189
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,336
So I'm sure many of you guys have spent so much time

190
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:01,538
posing, developing base poses for your characters,

191
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:02,719
combat poses.

192
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,100
And then all of a sudden, marketing comes back

193
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,642
with these T-shirts, and you're like, wait, who made that pose?

194
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:09,362
Where did that come from?

195
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,164
And that's pretty horrifying.

196
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,805
So we definitely wanted to maintain that

197
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:19,127
across not only the game, but marketing materials as well.

198
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:23,729
So taking this concept of these over-the-top poses,

199
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,892
we needed to apply those to our older, hardened Spartan.

200
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:33,650
So while we did not push it as far as we did in the previous games,

201
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:35,393
we still had hints of that.

202
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,739
As you can see in his blocking post, still

203
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,844
needed to be dynamic and strong and grounded,

204
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,626
but a little more grounded than before.

205
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:47,210
And even when he interacts with enemies and kills them,

206
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:49,572
yes, it's a bit over the top,

207
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,653
but it's a little bit more grounded

208
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:52,634
than it used to be before.

209
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,376
So we needed to keep that in mind

210
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,618
as we were posing anything that had to do with Kratos,

211
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,781
you know, animation, combat, idols, anything.

212
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,245
He's not quite as hunched down as he used to be overall.

213
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:06,426
That was one of the main things.

214
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,567
We didn't want to get him as slow

215
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,349
as he was in the previous games.

216
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,530
Another aspect of grounding Kratos was Atreus.

217
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,835
So Kratos was there to help his son teach him

218
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,157
how to be a god, how to be a warrior, how to survive.

219
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,100
But at the same time, the importance of Atreus

220
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,782
was there to make Kratos feel more human.

221
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,765
In the previous games, Kratos would walk around

222
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:36,388
and meet people and maybe say a word

223
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,390
and then kill them most of the time.

224
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,236
So we needed to have an emotional anchor.

225
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:46,584
Atreus was basically there to be the eyes

226
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:48,287
and the voice of the player.

227
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,830
Kratos would not...

228
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:58,151
when he would travel in the previous games, he didn't wonder where this statue came from or

229
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:05,176
what it said, what message was written on the wall. So by presenting Atreus and then

230
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,718
partnering him up with Kratos, we were able to, you know...

231
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,182
sort of get conversations actually happening between two characters, which just didn't happen

232
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:20,987
before. And this way, our goal was for the player to get to know Kratos a little more and to get

233
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:25,210
Kratos out of his comfort zone. And by having a young son there that he needed to look after and

234
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,313
interact with, that was, it offered a lot of opportunities for us to do that.

235
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,079
Now, a bit of the studio culture too.

236
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,443
You know, as the studio grew and the team grew, so did we.

237
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,926
And many of the team members became parents,

238
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:43,347
we got married, had kids.

239
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,890
And that kind of changed the way we saw things, you know?

240
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,173
We wanted to tell different types of stories as well.

241
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,954
So this was part of the big influence

242
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:53,975
of why we decided to...

243
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,538
re-imagine creatives and make them more relatable.

244
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,400
Previously it was like the Greek era,

245
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:04,063
it was kind of like the college years, right?

246
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:07,045
You know, having a little more fun.

247
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,687
Well, you know, not that we're not having fun still,

248
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,809
but the Norse era is a bit more like,

249
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:17,253
okay, you know, let's try to tell some different stories

250
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,274
that, you know, perhaps we can share

251
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,217
with our kids someday as well, without being too embarrassed.

252
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,117
Not that the previous games are embarrassing,

253
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,639
but I would definitely wait a while

254
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,141
before I would show my daughters those games,

255
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:29,782
that's for sure.

256
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,603
And I would have to explain a lot of things.

257
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:40,190
So Kratos was also meant to be a father once more.

258
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:43,453
We felt that that was the best way for him

259
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,755
to have an arc of redemption,

260
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:49,518
to have someone that he needed to care for.

261
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,260
And that was the best way to.

262
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,992
for people to sympathize with him.

263
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,739
So speaking about the animation style,

264
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,463
we needed to make a switch in our animation style

265
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:05,987
if we wanted to depict Kratos in a more relatable way.

266
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,110
This is why early on we decided to look into motion capture.

267
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,411
So the previous God of War games were primarily keyframe.

268
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,153
About 90% was all keyframe, 10% motion captured.

269
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,634
And the motion capture was reserved for cinematics mainly.

270
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,534
But everything else, including facial animation,

271
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:30,595
was keyframed, all the bosses, combat, enemies,

272
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:31,496
all the Kratos moves.

273
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,262
And here's some examples of some of the early keyframe animation that we did from the previous games.

274
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:44,604
As you can see, the moves are a little bit more arcadey over the top.

275
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:50,745
Often we, you know, especially with the blades, we could just create massive arcs,

276
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:52,906
where we didn't have to worry about the camera.

277
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:56,767
And often we defied the laws of gravity.

278
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:02,299
But once we moved into motion capture, we learned a lot.

279
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,863
We learned a lot about the process

280
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,148
because we hadn't really used it for combat before.

281
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,393
So here's an example of a move.

282
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:14,977
And this is footage from the motion capture stage.

283
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:15,898
This is the data.

284
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:20,082
As you can see, it got us about 80% of the way, right?

285
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:24,066
And then our animation team would go in and enhance it.

286
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,828
Without the keyframe knowledge and experience,

287
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:27,689
we wouldn't be able to do it.

288
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,051
Now, these moves are, at 60,

289
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,114
they're actually exported with a lot more frames.

290
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,056
Because then, once we get into the game.

291
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:39,927
the fidelity of the chain blades would read a lot better.

292
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,669
That's why we had to export those

293
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,490
with a little bit higher frame rate.

294
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,153
And of course, motion capture gave us the fidelity

295
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:51,495
for scenes like this, where we really needed to

296
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,416
express a little bit more emotion

297
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:57,698
to try to get Kratos to feel more relatable.

298
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,419
So motion capture gave us

299
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,501
a bit of a shortcut to get to that a lot faster.

300
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:08,944
We still had to do a cleanup pass and then keyframe pass

301
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:11,726
and enhance pass on most of our cinematics,

302
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:16,049
but without essentially the amount of,

303
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,752
with the amount of scenes that we had to do,

304
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:21,914
it would have taken a lot longer

305
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,295
to keyframe out everything.

306
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:25,277
It just wouldn't have been possible.

307
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:31,230
So how do we get a team of keyframe animators

308
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,914
to jump on board with this notion of,

309
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:35,997
hey, we're gonna introduce motion capture into this.

310
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:37,459
It was tough at first.

311
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,121
I mean, we as animators,

312
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,486
we love to just keyframe everything as much as we can.

313
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,669
But motion capture is a tool.

314
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:49,886
And the way we convinced them is we bought an accent suit and

315
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:54,309
we gave it to the animators like here, let's let's just try some stuff and

316
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,392
What happens when you give a mocap suit to an animator?

317
00:16:59,413 --> 00:16:59,834
This happens

318
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:18,997
Yes.

319
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:22,420
So HR didn't know a lot of the stuff

320
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,380
was going on upstairs.

321
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,622
We would have had to sign all kinds of waivers.

322
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,303
But yeah, we liked it so much

323
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,804
that we ended up getting a second suit

324
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,926
so that we can do these kind of like paired up moves.

325
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,290
And by involving the animators in this process,

326
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,587
it actually got them to kind of start jumping on board.

327
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,870
It's like, okay, I see how this works.

328
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,255
I get to shoot the data and I drive the performance a bit

329
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,578
and then I get to clean it up

330
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:54,840
and I get to enhance it and push it.

331
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,422
So it's not like I'm eliminating.

332
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,096
my role, my job, I'm actually enhancing it.

333
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:02,478
And then I'm getting a lot of data a lot faster

334
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,379
and getting me about 80% of the way,

335
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,742
and then we would go in, add the extra layer

336
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,063
of awesomeness to it with Keyframe.

337
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,165
So yeah, this is me.

338
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:17,747
Also, I decided to jump in and try this with myself.

339
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,400
But early on, having said that early on,

340
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,741
like I mentioned before, the direction of the game

341
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:26,484
was to be a lot more grittier and grounded

342
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,786
and heavier and slower, so this is some of the first

343
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,509
bit of data, so yeah, this is exclusive,

344
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,530
Kratos killing Kratos.

345
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,454
And yeah, and as you can see, the axe was just a basic axe,

346
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,755
there was nothing fancy about it.

347
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:43,758
It was meant to be just this really gritty game.

348
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,445
So after we had the accent suits.

349
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,276
We decided, okay, well, you know, let's try this for real.

350
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,258
Let's go over to the mocap stage.

351
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,221
But we felt that we needed to try it out ourselves.

352
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,104
So this is Erika Pinto, our lead cinematics animator,

353
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:05,167
and Mehdi Yusef, our lead gameplay animator.

354
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,710
So we decided to go on stage ourselves and shoot a scene.

355
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,092
So the first scene that we collaborated on

356
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:13,474
that we did together was the ogre intro.

357
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,556
There's a moment in the game where this guy

358
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,259
comes through the door and attacks Kratos and Atreus.

359
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,703
So, I was Kratos, Mehdi was the ogre.

360
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:26,406
Erika is Atreus in this case.

361
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,850
And I just realized that Mehdi's actually

362
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,212
holding a cell phone, so I don't know why

363
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:35,695
an ogre would need a cell phone, but yeah.

364
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,958
He's just snuck in there.

365
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,574
So what we did in order to approach this,

366
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:45,037
because another part of the mandate

367
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:48,420
was to do this as a one-take game,

368
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,042
and I'll talk a little bit more about that.

369
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:51,876
in a later slide.

370
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:56,397
We decided to go and shoot this in live action first

371
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:57,878
and rehearse it and really rehearse it

372
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,058
over and over and over and over.

373
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:02,139
And then before we took it to the stage.

374
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:04,259
So I'll just show you this video and walk you through it.

375
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,660
So this is the footage of us rehearsing the whole scene.

376
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,521
Yeah, we had to get creative with the scale,

377
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:14,682
with the sizes to represent the sizes best as possible.

378
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,898
That was definitely fun and challenging.

379
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:21,339
Now, this is the footage, the video footage feed

380
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:22,579
that was on stage.

381
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,881
And this is how you see the scene being shot

382
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,722
in MotionBuilder, the MotionBuilder feed.

383
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,283
Now, the tricky thing about this scene

384
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,304
is that even though everything looks lined up

385
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,385
with the camera, the characters are interacting,

386
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:37,206
they were all different sizes.

387
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,767
So when we got to the stage, we had to deal with it.

388
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,568
We actually had to shoot the scene in separate spaces

389
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:46,449
so that the scale, in relative world space.

390
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,870
and we had to rehearse it in a way

391
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,831
that we were interacting with each other,

392
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:51,972
but apart from each other.

393
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:53,892
Now, as you can see there,

394
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,954
Dory, who's our director of photography,

395
00:20:58,834 --> 00:20:59,975
is holding a marker.

396
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,656
This is before we had a virtual camera,

397
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:07,058
and he was actually walking around pointing the marker

398
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,459
and looking at the screens up on top

399
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,220
to get his framing right, right?

400
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,980
So that he can frame all three of us.

401
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,861
So he was using Kratos as the anchor.

402
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:20,224
for the scene and just in order for us

403
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:23,786
to be able to interact with each other in different scales,

404
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:27,049
we had to do that in our own separate acting spaces.

405
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,832
Now, what that got us was a scene that had all the

406
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,174
characters in a relatively solid timing

407
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,736
with the camera all in one, right?

408
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:39,318
And that is when Mehdi had to come in

409
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,359
and do the key frame pass on top.

410
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:45,804
But without this early sort of rough block out of the scene,

411
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:48,185
it just would have taken a lot longer to do,

412
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:49,686
a lot longer to pull off.

413
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,428
So he had a very solid base to go off of,

414
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,569
and this is what the final scene ended up looking like.

415
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,759
So it was definitely a lot of fun to do that.

416
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,561
And we got to learn a lot.

417
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:35,744
And as leads, if we went through the process,

418
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:36,725
understood the process,

419
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:41,691
then we can better have our animators join in with us

420
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,873
and help us out to get this done.

421
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:49,197
Definitely, you know, it went a little bit up to our heads.

422
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:52,179
But then after doing a full day of shooting,

423
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:55,521
we realized that we can't do this ourselves.

424
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,281
We need experts.

425
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:58,402
We need professionals to help us do this.

426
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:01,704
But it was great to at least go through that process once

427
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:04,606
and figure out how it all works.

428
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,545
So the benefits of motion capture for us,

429
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:11,548
it gave us a solid foundation for our keyframe animators

430
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:12,668
to push things a lot further.

431
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,971
We were able to complete over three hours of cinematics

432
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:16,651
in our game.

433
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,453
Without motion capture, it just would have been really tough.

434
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:22,996
And acquiring motion capture data

435
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:26,018
allowed us to focus on other cool things,

436
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:28,480
like stuff that couldn't be motion captured,

437
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,082
like these scenes that are mostly all keyframes.

438
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,417
So the dragon is all keyframed.

439
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:38,719
Kratos and Atreus is a combination

440
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,059
of keyframe and motion capture.

441
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,182
And of course, there's no way you can mocap this guy.

442
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,604
And Kratos and Atreus flying through the air,

443
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:51,385
definitely keyframe as well.

444
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:52,826
So it just freed us up.

445
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,527
It freed us up to do a lot more of this stuff.

446
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:58,028
So moving a little bit over to the narrative process,

447
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,931
we also needed to revisit our narrative process

448
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:04,813
to see how we're gonna depict Kratos

449
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:07,195
in a more relatable way.

450
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,177
So early on in the project, Corey,

451
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:14,661
he had the idea and the mandate of,

452
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:18,484
I wanna do this entire game as a one-shot, as a one-er.

453
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,606
And the reason for that is he wanted to

454
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:29,056
essentially sell the player on the idea of you're there with Kratos and Atreus

455
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:34,300
every step of the way. There's no like cutting away to meantime and the bad

456
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,124
guy's lair, you know, he's you know making this plan over there. No, no. He wanted

457
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:43,549
you to be there alongside Kratos for the entirety of the trip so that it felt

458
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,191
like you were there taking the trip alongside with them.

459
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:51,708
And this was done to enhance the personal narrative

460
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:53,590
between Kratos and his son.

461
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,193
So early on, we started,

462
00:24:57,494 --> 00:24:59,236
how many of you guys have seen the movie Hard Boiled?

463
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:00,497
Show of hands.

464
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,059
Okay, all right.

465
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,021
Not as many as expected, but that's okay.

466
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:04,922
So,

467
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,074
We looked at a lot of films that had scenes

468
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,116
that had no cuts in them for reference and inspiration.

469
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,198
But there's one particular scene

470
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,579
in the movie called Hard Boil.

471
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,782
It's directed by John Woo, it's a Hong Kong action film.

472
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:23,945
Now, I was unable to secure the rights to show you the scene.

473
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,867
So I'll quickly describe it really quickly

474
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:26,648
just to make my point.

475
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:31,203
So in it, there's two detectives, two police officers.

476
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,464
There's one named Tequila.

477
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,324
I mean, that's his nickname, Tequila.

478
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,605
And the other one's Alan.

479
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:38,526
So they're going through this hospital,

480
00:25:39,347 --> 00:25:41,228
having this intense shootout.

481
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,789
All of a sudden, elevator door opens,

482
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,390
Alan looks over, shoots someone

483
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,571
that's coming out of the elevator,

484
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,332
and then realizes that he's wearing an ID.

485
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:51,732
He's a police officer.

486
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,553
He just shot a police officer.

487
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,834
So he's in shock.

488
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,995
So his partner Tequila grabs him,

489
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,537
drags him into the elevator, the elevator door closes,

490
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:00,898
and he's just sitting there.

491
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:02,659
I can't believe I just shot a police officer.

492
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,360
This is, I can't believe I just did.

493
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,281
Tequila says, don't worry about it,

494
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,502
it wasn't a police officer.

495
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,076
don't worry, we need to get out of this thing,

496
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,096
we need to survive this.

497
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:14,418
You gotta keep focused on keeping us alive.

498
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,539
So the elevator doors open, they go out,

499
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,740
another insane shootout happens,

500
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,941
and soon after, Tequila says,

501
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,082
oh, by the way, the thing that happened

502
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,063
way earlier in the film,

503
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,704
I kinda shot a cop too by mistake,

504
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,985
and I know it feels horrible.

505
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:32,986
I can relate to you.

506
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:35,762
And then Alan says, wait a minute,

507
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,403
so you're saying that the guy I just shot in the elevator

508
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:39,184
was a police officer?

509
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,224
He goes, yeah, yeah, he was.

510
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:43,406
And then they go back to insane shootout.

511
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:46,268
Now everything I just described was all done

512
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:50,050
without any cuts, and all with practical effects

513
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,810
without any cuts.

514
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,572
So can we take that, so we saw that,

515
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,573
and we're like, okay, that's an amazing scene.

516
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,834
It had action, almost like gameplay,

517
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:02,257
and went into a shocking moment for one of the characters.

518
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,223
realizing that he just killed a fellow police officer,

519
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:11,070
he gets, you know, consoled by his friend,

520
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,654
and then his friend reveals to him that,

521
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:14,775
hey, I went through the same thing.

522
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,498
And then back to action.

523
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,827
So we got inspired by that.

524
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:20,967
We were like, that's amazing.

525
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,188
They were able to pull it off just as one scene.

526
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,188
Now how can we do it for the whole game?

527
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:28,069
So this is one of the first scenes early on

528
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,369
in the E3 demo that we showed

529
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:33,870
that kind of has a bit of that going from action

530
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,450
to an emotional moment back to action.

531
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:36,830
Ah!

532
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,050
Ah!

533
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,150
Ah!

534
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,350
Ah!

535
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:37,510
Ah!

536
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,991
Ah!

537
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:42,411
Oh boy!

538
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,392
Ah!

539
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:45,272
Ah!

540
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:46,252
Wait!

541
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:46,352
Wait!

542
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:46,632
What?

543
00:27:52,447 --> 00:28:00,871
Off the ice! Now!

544
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,175
I am so sorry. I...

545
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:14,296
Your deer is getting away.

546
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:17,157
Yes, sir.

547
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:24,706
So without cutting away, we were able to have action,

548
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,128
a moment, a teaching moment,

549
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:28,468
where Kratos is trying to teach the sun

550
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,149
to take out the creature,

551
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,791
to an honest mistake by Atreus,

552
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,552
to a moment of bonding between them, so.

553
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,935
That was definitely something that we wanted to carry on

554
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:39,756
throughout the entire game.

555
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:40,937
So we needed help.

556
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,639
So we brought in Dori Arasi.

557
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,222
He's a director of photography that helped us get

558
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:51,306
everything that was on the script planned out

559
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,028
and laid out in a way that we can actually execute

560
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,550
the one take within the cinematics.

561
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,936
So if you guys have the time to spare,

562
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,696
definitely on Wednesday,

563
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,917
if you have a chance to go see his talk,

564
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:08,238
he's gonna dive a little deeper

565
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:10,879
into the emotional connection

566
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:13,940
through the cinematography in our game.

567
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,401
So please, if you have a chance to go check it out.

568
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:19,882
Because of this...

569
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:22,485
one-take approach, we had to,

570
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:27,430
we basically had to shoot our scenes more like a play.

571
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,753
We had to think of them more of a play than a movie.

572
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:31,775
Everything had to be done,

573
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,218
rehearsed very well and very closely.

574
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,784
Because we wanted you to have the experience of

575
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,971
watching a play that was happening in front of you,

576
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:43,891
being in a play that was happening in front of you,

577
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:47,412
rather than watching a movie, right?

578
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,192
So that was one of the mandates.

579
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:52,233
This is why we had to kind of start thinking about

580
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:55,793
plays rather than film, when we got inspired,

581
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:56,574
our inspirations.

582
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:01,054
And because of this, we had to do a lot of key,

583
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:04,435
a lot of previous, lots and lots and lots of previous.

584
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,076
And we employed all sorts of methods

585
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:08,336
for different situations.

586
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:08,476
So.

587
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:12,909
When we had things that were just impossible to shoot

588
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,870
or where characters had to cover large distances,

589
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:18,352
we used the keyframe method.

590
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:23,094
This is a scene in which Kratos is pushing a large hammer

591
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:26,836
and he and his son are riding it down all the way

592
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:29,077
so they could shatter the ice below.

593
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,938
But yeah, this is no way we could have done this

594
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:35,520
any other way to visualize how we were gonna do it.

595
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,595
The other method was we were fortunate enough

596
00:30:39,615 --> 00:30:42,797
to have a small motion capture space also within our studio

597
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:45,017
where we could do previz.

598
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:49,419
We could do just simple motions before we went over

599
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,620
to the main stage.

600
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,522
So there were situations where we needed to previz characters

601
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,803
interacting with the environment or interacting

602
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:02,325
with certain creatures that we just needed to do it in 3D.

603
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:03,825
So yeah, that's a.

604
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:06,464
We needed to figure out the scale of this bore.

605
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:09,028
We needed to figure out where Freya was gonna be

606
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,109
interacting on the shelves,

607
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,512
where the characters needed to be standing and placed.

608
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:16,196
So this was how we would show this to our director

609
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:17,698
before we would get approval.

610
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:22,245
And then finally, my favorite way of doing previous

611
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,967
was live action, where the animators had an opportunity

612
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:27,787
to have a bit of fun.

613
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:32,268
And this is just one of the previous scenes

614
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,329
that we did out of many, many scenes.

615
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,610
The reason why we use live action

616
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,751
was because we could then go outside, go upstairs,

617
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:43,792
shoot a couple of scenes.

618
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,426
very quickly, show them to the director, get feedback,

619
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:49,148
and within the same day, we can go shoot them again.

620
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,951
And if he had more feedback for that, we can shoot it again.

621
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,434
And then it was just cost effective

622
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,556
and the speed of it was great.

623
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:59,480
And on top of that, we had to have a lot of fun.

624
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,764
That was something that might catch.

625
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:07,193
Well, that was a perfectly good waste of an afternoon.

626
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:09,494
How are you not seeing? There is nowhere to hide up here.

627
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:14,797
It's... it's a trick my people have. A special way of not being seen.

628
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:16,838
You can turn invisible?

629
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,202
More like I can step into the realm... between realms.

630
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:22,662
Huh.

631
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:30,106
And your mind can't understand what it's seeing, so it actually sees nothing at all.

632
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,528
It's how we avoid using the weapons that we actually craft.

633
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:39,333
But it doesn't seem to work on dragons though.

634
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:42,555
Hm, your brother wanted to know if you're eating well.

635
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:43,735
I can tell him that you are.

636
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:48,338
Brock asked about me? Was there meat on his breath?

637
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,761
You let him work on this again?

638
00:32:58,383 --> 00:32:58,803
Come on.

639
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,498
So we have a couple of dwarf characters in our game.

640
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:06,619
So if you're wondering why they're just walking around

641
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,700
on his knees, that's why.

642
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,701
So we can get the scale approximation right.

643
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:14,302
So shameless plug number two.

644
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:18,644
If you have the chance to also go see Erica Pinto's talk,

645
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:20,485
she's the lead narrative animator.

646
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,846
And she will dive a little bit deeper

647
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:26,027
into the process, cinematic process, a lot more

648
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:26,768
than I am doing here.

649
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:31,222
So continuing on with this principle

650
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,523
of shooting everything as a play,

651
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:39,464
because of that, it became very apparent

652
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,525
that we needed to focus on rehearsal a lot more.

653
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:44,305
We couldn't just have actors show up the day of shooting.

654
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,726
So we did a lot of table reads,

655
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:48,726
a rehearsal day would look like in the morning,

656
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,907
get everybody together on the same page,

657
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:54,788
read the script, get everything planned out.

658
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:58,829
And then we would go step by step through each scene,

659
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:05,431
and Dory would film them, live action takes of every scene,

660
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:08,852
and then rehearse with them, the blocking, the staging,

661
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:12,112
the beats connected to their dialogue,

662
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,173
where they needed to be, when they needed to be,

663
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:15,313
at certain positions.

664
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:18,676
And here's a bit of the rehearsal footage

665
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:20,657
that we did for the opening of the game.

666
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:23,780
So some of you guys who may have played the game

667
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,002
will recognize this from the opening.

668
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:28,824
And action.

669
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,593
So this is the opportunity to get notes over to the actors

670
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:48,955
to dial in all the performances.

671
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:59,020
Also to work out where all our props are gonna be.

672
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,481
I want a big one.

673
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:05,904
And block out the timing of the camera.

674
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:11,967
So that rehearsal day became very critical.

675
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:16,709
So on shooting day, we did an all-in-one approach.

676
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:20,690
We captured the body data, the face data, the face cams.

677
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,330
We did audio recording.

678
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,951
So for the final performance,

679
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:27,012
I mean, we did have some ADR sessions,

680
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:30,233
but yeah, we pretty much got most of the dialogue on set.

681
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,473
And also the virtual camera.

682
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:35,054
So by the time a scene was delivered to us,

683
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:38,195
everything was pretty much dialed in

684
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:39,735
with the timing that we wanted.

685
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:45,423
So here's an example of us shooting a scene.

686
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:49,485
Corey's back there with the writers

687
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:52,406
overseeing the scene delivery.

688
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:56,047
And we get to see everything through MotionBuilder

689
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:57,428
as it's being shot.

690
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:01,169
So as you can see, this is a careful rehearse dance

691
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,450
between the actors and Dory

692
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,092
to ensure that we hit the beats accurately.

693
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,233
And our goal is to do it all in one take.

694
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:30,398
So another important part of the process was casting,

695
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:32,300
getting the right chemistry between our actors.

696
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,004
To make Kratos feel more human,

697
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:37,687
the anchor, emotional anchor was gonna be Atreus.

698
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:42,032
Luckily, we were able to find the right people for the job.

699
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:45,116
Christopher Judge as Kratos and Sonny Selgic as Atreus.

700
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:53,018
And once we got them together to do their chemistry test,

701
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:55,601
as I will show you in a second,

702
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,644
once we got that, we knew we had the right people.

703
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:00,866
Also, something that helped us out was,

704
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,368
even though we weren't casting for height,

705
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:07,221
It ended up being that our two-star actors

706
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:10,004
pretty much felt like Kratos and Atreus as it is.

707
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:11,985
They were the right height.

708
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:14,687
And then that made the cleanup process

709
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,770
and adjustment process a lot simpler

710
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,451
once we did the motion capture.

711
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:23,975
Now, one of the things that people like to say

712
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,956
is that, oh, don't work with animals, don't work with kids.

713
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:30,659
But for us, there was no other way to go

714
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,721
than to actually get a child actor.

715
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:38,005
There's no way that I feel that a adult

716
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:42,068
could pretend 100% to be a kid.

717
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:44,710
And it became apparent early on,

718
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,231
after we brought Sonny in.

719
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:49,574
This is one time we were just at the stage,

720
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:50,555
started messing around.

721
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:55,066
I might have said to hit play on the recording, maybe.

722
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,447
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

723
00:37:56,968 --> 00:38:02,191
But yeah, definitely this kind of childlike movement,

724
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,653
you're not gonna get this from an actor,

725
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:05,794
from an adult actor.

726
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:06,935
It'll be a lot tougher.

727
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,576
It'll be a lot tougher for sure.

728
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:11,858
So this is why it was important for us to bring in Sonny

729
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:12,839
and to work with him.

730
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,882
Now, as I mentioned before, the chemistry test,

731
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,364
we actually hired Atreus first.

732
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,125
We found Sonny first,

733
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,727
since he was gonna be the emotional anchor for the game.

734
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,089
And then we brought the actors

735
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,751
that were trying out for the part of Kratos

736
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,993
to do the chemistry test with him

737
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,955
to see if it was gonna work.

738
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,376
I'm not fit to be a father.

739
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,041
Become everything I never wanted you to be.

740
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:52,783
Run.

741
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,444
Run far away from me.

742
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:57,665
But you have changed!

743
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,026
You're not a monster!

744
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,526
That is exactly what I am!

745
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:01,207
Not to me!

746
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:05,048
You will fail.

747
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:07,910
How you deal with it

748
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,311
is what makes you stronger.

749
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:15,193
My father

750
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,243
Yeah, so when we saw this, we knew we had the right people.

751
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:48,787
All right, so moving over to the combat animation process,

752
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,148
I wanna talk a little bit about that.

753
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,253
Early on, one of the things that was thrown out the door

754
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:58,714
was the blaze of chaos.

755
00:39:59,635 --> 00:39:59,775
So,

756
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:02,604
The Blades of Chaos have a lot of history.

757
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,165
They have a lot of baggage with Kratos.

758
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:08,329
So what better way to present the character in a new light

759
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:10,450
than start stripping away some of the things

760
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:12,792
that were present in his past?

761
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,275
So early on, we decided that, and it was very scary.

762
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:19,097
It was like, how do you remove the lightsaber from Luke?

763
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:22,019
Right, like, no, you wanna try to maintain

764
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,380
as much of the character as possible.

765
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,522
But by stripping away these weapons,

766
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:28,164
it made him feel maybe,

767
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,334
a little bit different, more vulnerable in a way.

768
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:35,023
But at the same time, we wanted to replace those weapons

769
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:36,444
with another iconic weapon.

770
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:39,145
So this is why we decided to create an axe,

771
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,886
which is a little bit more,

772
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,767
it fits a little bit better within the Norse mythology

773
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:45,987
that we were moving onto.

774
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:53,110
And it sort of fits the fantasy of Mjolnir in a way,

775
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,891
the Thor's weapon, Thor's hammer,

776
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,371
where you can throw it and summon it.

777
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,332
But it wasn't like that at the beginning.

778
00:40:58,812 --> 00:40:59,653
Like I mentioned before.

779
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:04,015
the moves were supposed to be very grounded and methodical

780
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:07,695
and not very magical at first,

781
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:10,816
because the game direction was to be a lot grittier.

782
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,637
But as we play tested and we moved forward,

783
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:18,558
we discovered that, hey, we need to kind of inject back

784
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,498
a little bit of the old God of War games into it.

785
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,199
So here's another pass, an early animation,

786
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,359
where we started like getting a little bit more

787
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:27,260
of that old Kratos movement back.

788
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:31,533
One of the things you notice is that he's actually throwing the axe as a boomerang.

789
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:35,060
This is when we start introducing some of the magical nature of the moves.

790
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,042
But they were gonna be part of the combo originally.

791
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:42,565
So before there were just gonna be button presses

792
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,186
and the axe would come out and fly out

793
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:45,987
and hit the enemies and come back automatically.

794
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,890
So it wasn't until the breakthrough for the axe

795
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,292
was definitely being able to throw it

796
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:53,913
and being able to summon it back.

797
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:57,016
And I mean that completely ties into the fantasy of Thor,

798
00:41:57,136 --> 00:41:58,517
you know, the Norse myth.

799
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,659
So once we did that,

800
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,601
it definitely was what got us over the top

801
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:04,782
to be able to.

802
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:07,203
to make this into a...

803
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:12,327
a weapon that would stand side to side with the blades.

804
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,308
And in addition to that, the history of the axe

805
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:17,688
was that it was given to him by his wife,

806
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:21,369
rather than being given to him by a god

807
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:24,090
for as a weapon of destruction, right?

808
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,270
So it was more of a weapon of protection,

809
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,871
given to him by his own wife.

810
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:32,592
So already the story behind the weapon was different,

811
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:35,792
to try to make him feel a little more connected to it

812
00:42:35,832 --> 00:42:38,053
in a different way than anger and rage.

813
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:42,432
Also, we had to deal with a new camera, right?

814
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:45,593
So since we needed to be closer in the cinematics

815
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:48,614
and the gameplay, so we had to be closer in the combat.

816
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:53,615
Long were gone the days where we could just do

817
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:56,576
crazy arcs over the top, you know?

818
00:42:56,736 --> 00:42:58,656
And even though the Blades did make it back

819
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:03,237
as part of the story, sorry if, spoilers

820
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:04,798
for those of you who have not played the game.

821
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:06,798
But we couldn't get away with,

822
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:10,499
with doing these wide arcs anymore because of the camera.

823
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:11,739
We had to be up close.

824
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,321
So yes, we still had to animate everything

825
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:16,582
to look good from every angle,

826
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,643
but we particularly had to focus on making it look good

827
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,144
from a new camera perspective.

828
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:25,005
So as you can see, we pulled in the chains way more,

829
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,466
way more than it used to be.

830
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,627
It was meant to just read enough with the camera,

831
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:31,848
but still retain the same feeling from the old games.

832
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,392
And here's some examples of how both the axe and the blades

833
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,653
look from the new camera perspective in-game.

834
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:44,516
And as you can see, we definitely moved away

835
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:46,077
from the grounded feel.

836
00:43:46,678 --> 00:43:49,739
And even though Kratos is jumping up in the air,

837
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,981
but he's not jumping as crazy as he used to

838
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:53,722
in the previous games.

839
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:56,784
So there's a nice blend that we were able to achieve

840
00:43:56,824 --> 00:44:00,826
between the grounded and the previous games.

841
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:07,609
and also to utilize the keyframe animation talent

842
00:44:07,629 --> 00:44:08,850
that we had in our studio.

843
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,451
But having said that, we still needed help

844
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:13,691
to get great motion.

845
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,292
So this is where Eric Jacobus comes in.

846
00:44:17,313 --> 00:44:20,734
Now, he is an amazing stunt performer,

847
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:24,155
but in addition to that, he's a great director,

848
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:25,856
he's a fight choreographer,

849
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:29,379
and stunt coordinator, so he does pretty much everything.

850
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,320
And in addition to that, he has a great understanding

851
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,581
of the motion capture process.

852
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,182
He's one of the few stuntmen that I know, at least,

853
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:40,644
that is interested in motion capture technology

854
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,926
and how it works and how to best use it

855
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:45,267
for all kinds of needs.

856
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:50,089
So I came across a YouTube channel, his YouTube channel,

857
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,890
and I recommend if you guys have time,

858
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,651
take a look into his YouTube channel.

859
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:59,440
He has an amazing array of short films that he's directed

860
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,381
and he's put together with this amazing action.

861
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:04,243
And because of that, I was like, whoa, this is great.

862
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:06,245
This guy can do a bit of everything.

863
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,327
But the thing in his YouTube channel

864
00:45:09,347 --> 00:45:11,308
that really attracted me the most

865
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:14,031
was a series of videos that he created

866
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:18,614
where he was reenacting moves from games,

867
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:19,715
from fighting games.

868
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:21,876
And let me give you an example of that.

869
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:43,309
Yeah, so he's essentially taking something

870
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,530
that was probably mo-capped and heavily worked on

871
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,190
by animators and key framed,

872
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,671
and then he's just recreating it in a live action.

873
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:52,172
So it's pretty amazing.

874
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:54,652
It's almost like he was doing exactly

875
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:55,613
what we needed him to do.

876
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:59,915
And having this direction of trying to make things

877
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:01,215
more relatable and grounded,

878
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,537
what better way than to get him in

879
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:05,798
to try to do the moves for us?

880
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:09,400
So he would lay out, his performance would give us

881
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:13,562
80 to 90% of the way so that we can then take

882
00:46:13,602 --> 00:46:15,002
and push them a lot further.

883
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:17,244
So once I saw this video, I said,

884
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:18,864
please can we contact this guy?

885
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:20,685
Let's get him in our building.

886
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,667
And what happened was,

887
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:25,781
uh... before his

888
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:28,843
actual audition for for kratos all we said is

889
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:31,344
you're auditioning for kratos, he has an ex

890
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:32,764
that's it, that's all we told him

891
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:36,806
and days before uh... he was meant to come in for his audition

892
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,827
he sent us this all on his own

893
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:06,941
So as you can see, without any direction at all,

894
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:10,123
he was already brainstorming all these awesome,

895
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,564
cool ideas that we could use.

896
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:15,728
So at that point as well,

897
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:18,850
what was revealed to us from that footage was that,

898
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,412
okay, yeah, we need to work with this guy,

899
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:22,853
but we need to make him part of our team.

900
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:23,974
We need to bring him in.

901
00:47:24,354 --> 00:47:27,777
So what we did a lot of was we brought him into the studio,

902
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:29,939
we walked him through the entire story,

903
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:33,001
we explained to him all the creator's rules,

904
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:35,323
what he can do, what he cannot do,

905
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:36,664
what kind of character he is,

906
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,886
what kind of personality he has,

907
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,928
what type of movement he does.

908
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:42,989
So we really got him involved

909
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,892
as almost like one of the members of the animation team

910
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:48,134
so that he would truly understand the character.

911
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,775
So that it wasn't just about,

912
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:52,297
okay, come in this day, here's your list,

913
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:55,760
and then just start acting these moves,

914
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,741
just copy what I'm doing.

915
00:47:56,901 --> 00:47:58,643
So that was,

916
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,227
We tried that at first, and we got some good data,

917
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:08,913
but it wasn't quite what we could end up doing.

918
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:11,275
If we practiced with him more,

919
00:48:11,876 --> 00:48:15,459
sort of like how we did with our actors

920
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:16,240
for their cinematics.

921
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:20,424
So here's an example of one of our animators, James Che.

922
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:25,058
recording sort of the motions that we needed to capture.

923
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:27,701
He's just kind of demoing for Eric

924
00:48:28,162 --> 00:48:29,704
ahead of him coming into the studio.

925
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:31,426
And then we brought Eric in

926
00:48:31,526 --> 00:48:33,469
and we just spent an entire day rehearsing,

927
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:35,751
practicing move, just.

928
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:39,553
so that we would have this footage ready to go

929
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:42,075
once we went over to the mocap stage.

930
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,497
And by the time we went to the mocap stage,

931
00:48:44,577 --> 00:48:46,518
we were very efficient because he knew exactly

932
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:48,260
what to do.

933
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,822
We could always bring up the video footage

934
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,883
that he himself shot with us,

935
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,066
and then execute all the moves.

936
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:00,769
So here's an example of a move going through every step.

937
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,011
So this is James Previs.

938
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:05,153
Then we bring Eric in.

939
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:12,105
Then on stage, he knows exactly what to do.

940
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:14,948
And we can be a lot more efficient and focus

941
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:18,070
on the quality of the movement rather than the idea.

942
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:27,378
And this has been polished and enhanced by our animation team.

943
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:32,041
So yeah, keyframe animation is still critical for us

944
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,363
to push this stuff through to the next level.

945
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:39,823
So in conclusion, I see I'm running a little bit out

946
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,770
of time, so I just wanted to, you know.

947
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:48,155
Kind of recap, in order to breathe new life into Kratos,

948
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:50,736
we definitely had to focus more on the human side,

949
00:49:51,036 --> 00:49:52,937
which we tried to do through animation

950
00:49:52,997 --> 00:49:56,378
by getting more subtlety through motion capture,

951
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:59,539
by getting the right performances in.

952
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,120
We needed to evolve our animation team

953
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,101
to embrace the motion capture technology,

954
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:08,862
but also continue to play on the strengths

955
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:09,903
of key frame animation.

956
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:14,387
And because of that, we revamped our approach

957
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:15,248
to combat and narrative.

958
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:18,310
And again, finding the right actors

959
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:23,334
for not only the cinematics, but also for your combat motion

960
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:24,215
is essential.

961
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,277
But having said that, couldn't have done it

962
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:29,259
with an amazing animation team.

963
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,743
They did an amazing job, as well as the rest of the team.

964
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,285
They really pushed through to get this project out the door,

965
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:39,727
and I really appreciate all their help and effort.

966
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:42,013
Thank you very much.

967
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:56,119
So I think we have around eight minutes or so.

968
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,600
If anyone would like to ask any questions,

969
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,602
I would really enjoy answering anything you guys

970
00:51:02,822 --> 00:51:03,802
may want to know about.

971
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:12,827
Oh, I believe there's a microphone in the aisles, right?

972
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:14,769
On each side?

973
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:15,310
Yeah.

974
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:30,635
So I was playing through the game, I'm not gonna spoil anything, but there was this moment where there was like a big reveal and

975
00:51:30,675 --> 00:51:36,418
then Atreus's face got covered by Kratos' armor, and I had to reset and to

976
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:43,581
strip away that armor and see the scene again just because I wanted to feel and I couldn't see Atreus' face in that one.

977
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:48,704
Did the team ever consider like going back or forcing the like...

978
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:55,386
to use default armor on the scenes or maybe even animating the pieces so that they couldn't block

979
00:51:55,766 --> 00:52:01,048
the view during cinematics? So that definitely was a big challenge for us because

980
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:03,889
this is the first time that you can, you know,

981
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:07,717
armor up Kratos, pretty much play dress up with Kratos.

982
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:12,701
And early on, as we were developing the scenes,

983
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,382
we knew that there was gonna be some there,

984
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:17,044
but once we got the concept and actually

985
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:19,146
the armors were made, there was a lot of situations

986
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,187
where we had to deal with that.

987
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,949
Unfortunately, we couldn't deal with every single situation

988
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,451
like the one you encountered, but...

989
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:33,256
we did go through some lengths, especially the most critical scenes that we felt we wanted to

990
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:39,201
not have any distractions. And while I don't want to steal the thunder from Erica's talk,

991
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:44,104
but she definitely goes into that a little more. But there was one particular situation where

992
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:50,509
when Kratos is pulling the boat and the sun is on the boat and he's pulling,

993
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:52,770
there's a rope slung over his shoulder, right?

994
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:59,595
So in that, it was so close there that you could see armor clipping depending on what armor you were using.

995
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:04,599
We actually created on a separate layer variable rope animations.

996
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:10,884
And there was maybe five or six different rope animations that would play specifically with what armor you were wearing.

997
00:53:11,745 --> 00:53:13,186
So that way we could avoid, it would like,

998
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:17,191
okay, play rope animation A with armor sets one through six.

999
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:20,535
So there were situations where we did.

1000
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:22,237
Unfortunately, we couldn't get through all of them.

1001
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:25,000
But if we were to do this all over again,

1002
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,823
we would definitely keep that in mind in the future.

1003
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,705
Yeah, great question, thank you.

1004
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:45,666
Hiya. So how challenging was to do seamless transitions into the cinematics to go from

1005
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:50,569
gameplay into the actual into cutscene to have that awesome transition that you did?

1006
00:53:51,137 --> 00:53:53,460
It was very painful, very painful.

1007
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,723
But over time, we developed a couple of tricks.

1008
00:53:57,104 --> 00:54:01,228
So most, a good percentage of the cinematics

1009
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,131
began with a player interaction, right?

1010
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,554
So at least we would know, you know,

1011
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:10,138
opening a door or pulling a lever or something like that.

1012
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,980
We would know that

1013
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,822
where the player would be and where the camera would be.

1014
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:19,563
So that helped with getting into cinematics.

1015
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:21,664
The ones that were more challenging

1016
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:25,906
were when you were just walking in a certain open area.

1017
00:54:27,026 --> 00:54:29,967
So for those, we had to do some careful planning

1018
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:34,469
of the level layout where you would kind of get funneled

1019
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:38,411
into a certain area by the art as you were walking.

1020
00:54:40,732 --> 00:54:43,474
And we had a bit of tech that would sort of take over

1021
00:54:43,494 --> 00:54:48,199
the character, over the player, without really trying

1022
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,683
to make it as non-intrusive to the player.

1023
00:54:53,063 --> 00:54:55,385
But definitely, there's moments where you can walk backwards

1024
00:54:55,445 --> 00:54:57,667
into a scene, and the game would kind of take over

1025
00:54:57,728 --> 00:55:01,271
and spin you around slowly and walk you into the scene.

1026
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,595
So hopefully people didn't do that too much.

1027
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,076
Probably in the second playthrough,

1028
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,937
when you can anticipate where there's a scene coming,

1029
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,118
you could probably mess with it a bit.

1030
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,619
But yeah, it was just careful planning,

1031
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:17,341
knowing, trying to use the interacts as much as possible,

1032
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:20,102
and kind of limiting those funnel points

1033
00:55:21,183 --> 00:55:22,344
where the tech would take over

1034
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:24,405
and kind of steer the player into the scene.

1035
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:30,165
Did you actually take control of the player to move it into a position?

1036
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:35,212
So basically just seamlessly took control from the player and move it to that point.

1037
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:39,759
So we actually did. Yeah, and we tried to make it as subtle and non-intrusive as possible.

1038
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,806
and within a reasonable radius so that you didn't feel that you were being cheated.

1039
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:48,609
You were like getting pulled when you're like,

1040
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:51,172
oh, what's going on? My controller is not responding anymore.

1041
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:53,875
So we try to make it, that's why the funnel points were very important.

1042
00:55:54,175 --> 00:55:56,037
Where like if you're already walking down a hallway,

1043
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:00,082
the player already felt like, okay, well, that's where I meant to go anyway.

1044
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:02,795
I'm sorry, just one question.

1045
00:56:02,835 --> 00:56:07,641
So how many mocap sessions you ended up recording in this project?

1046
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:08,622
Oh, mocap sessions.

1047
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:09,063
Oh, wow.

1048
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:12,166
I don't have the number right off the top of my head,

1049
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:16,291
but I think we had around 30 shoot days for cinematics alone.

1050
00:56:16,952 --> 00:56:17,673
Yeah, it was quite a bit.

1051
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:18,955
OK.

1052
00:56:26,105 --> 00:56:29,127
Hey, so you mentioned earlier that when characters

1053
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,548
were off the ground that it was keyframed animations.

1054
00:56:31,648 --> 00:56:34,150
So does that mean all the Valkyrie animations,

1055
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,392
which were stellar, were those all hand-keyed then?

1056
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:41,834
Yeah, so a great majority of those were done by Dennis Pena

1057
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:43,315
and yes, they were keyframed.

1058
00:56:43,715 --> 00:56:44,556
Oh, that's awesome.

1059
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:44,796
Yeah.

1060
00:56:44,856 --> 00:56:45,897
Tell him he did a great job.

1061
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:48,078
Oh yeah, I will, I will, for sure.

1062
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,105
I have a quick question on facial animation.

1063
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,087
I hope that's not, that's probably done in another talk,

1064
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:58,969
but I'm just curious about some of the biggest lessons

1065
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:01,191
learned on getting those facial expressions

1066
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:02,231
to read in cinematics.

1067
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:07,676
Yeah, so we work with a really great partner,

1068
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:14,084
Cubic Motion, and we were able to send the RL data with them

1069
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:17,128
to get processed, you know, from the high-res videos.

1070
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:23,014
So what we did is, once we got the actors' performance back,

1071
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,296
We did an enhanced pass where we wanted to push a couple things here and there.

1072
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:30,316
So we did spend a lot of time.

1073
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:34,658
Some scenes were just perfect as is, driven by the actor's performance.

1074
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:40,100
This is why it's really critical to get really good actors to work with you.

1075
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,401
But definitely we wanted to, in certain cases, push it a little more.

1076
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,302
So we did some work to keyframe on top of that as well.

1077
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,968
What made you all decide to go with the staggered

1078
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:55,649
Peter Jackson style shot in that pre-vis mo-cap scene

1079
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:59,010
as opposed to just having you all right next to each other

1080
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,051
and fixing it in post?

1081
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,672
Oh, so that particular one, you're talking about

1082
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:05,933
how it was being cross-dissolved?

1083
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:06,293
Yeah.

1084
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,394
Oh, that was just for, I wanted the talk

1085
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:11,515
to be under an hour, so.

1086
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:15,656
Yeah, but that is actually, that take is actually done

1087
00:58:17,017 --> 00:58:19,157
We did have one transition that we did

1088
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:20,257
while we were doing the previous,

1089
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,838
but most of our takes were done,

1090
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:24,978
like live action takes,

1091
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:26,898
were done like the one that I showed

1092
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:28,959
with the guys on his knees,

1093
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:30,799
were pretty much all in one take.

1094
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:33,539
That particular one with the ogre

1095
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:35,640
was cut down for time,

1096
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,640
but in addition to that,

1097
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,920
that did have a natural cross to solve,

1098
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:42,741
just because we were just learning

1099
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:43,581
how to do the stuff.

1100
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:45,941
Yeah, that was one of the early ones that we shot.

1101
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:46,900
Thank you.

1102
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,721
Yeah, you're welcome.

1103
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:54,590
Any other questions?

1104
00:58:58,624 --> 00:59:00,786
Yes, and then if there's no other questions,

1105
00:59:01,026 --> 00:59:04,228
we are hiring, so please, please apply

1106
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:06,109
if any of you guys are interested.

1107
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,391
But yeah, this is amazing.

1108
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:12,313
I'm really happy to have been part

1109
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,614
of the animation bootcamp finally,

1110
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:16,316
and I'm definitely gonna enjoy the rest of the talks

1111
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:18,317
for the rest of the day, and I hope you guys do as well.

1112
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:20,258
So thank you very much for coming.

1113
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:21,259
I really appreciate it.

1114
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:22,120
Thank you.
