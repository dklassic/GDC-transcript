1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,227
All right, everybody, thank you so much for being here.

2
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:11,748
This panel is Being Black in Game Audio.

3
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:15,889
So despite a public commitment to diversity and inclusivity,

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,729
Black people are very underrepresented

5
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:21,030
in our industry, in our game industry.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,410
And in this panel, we're going to hear from Black audio

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,431
designers of various levels of experience

8
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:29,231
and various disciplines about their experiences,

9
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,172
about their problems, about the struggles,

10
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,392
and about their thoughts on how we can all

11
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:34,132
create a more.

12
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:40,296
diverse and more inclusive and more empathetic industry. So huge thank you to GDC for allowing

13
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:44,299
this to happen because this message does need to get out there. We do need to share these

14
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,283
experiences more and more and huge thank you to each and every one of our panelists. So before

15
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:53,626
we get into this for all of our panelists just when I ask a question feel free to answer wherever

16
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,508
you feel comfortable answering because some of these questions you know will be heavy, some will

17
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:57,969
be lighter.

18
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:03,455
jump in wherever you feel is appropriate for you. I do have some questions specific to each of you.

19
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:08,377
Feel free to jump in though wherever in just general questions. So let's get into some

20
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:17,701
introductions for all of you. First up is John Hamilton Smith V aka Slide20XX. And John Hamilton

21
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:23,903
Smith V or Slide20XX is a composer who's worked on projects such as Calico, the Steven Universe

22
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,484

00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:30,947
The Stars Between Us, and has even written some music for the hit VR game, Rec Room.

24
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:39,373
Next up, we have Wilbert Roger II, composer for Mortal Kombat 11, Star Wars Vader Immortal,

26
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:49,740
and I'm sure so, so many more credits that I am forgetting at this moment.

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,923
Next up is Caleb Epps, who is the audio director at Brass Lion Entertainment,

28
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:59,907
a studio focused on telling stories who are Black, Brown, or traditionally marginalized.

29
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:04,950
He was also the sound design manager at Facebook, senior sound designer at Sledgehammer,

30
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,353
and audio lead and sound designer at Harmonix.

31
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,854
And last up, but not least, is Jasmine Cooper,

32
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,955
who is a multimedia composer running her company,

33
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,857
Perennial Sounds, based out of Vietnam,

34
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:19,599
which offers both bespoke and licensed music

35
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,581
for media projects of all types.

36
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,122
And me, my name is Akash Thakar,

37
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,784
and I'll be moderating this panel.

38
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:28,806
So the first kind of topic that I wanna dive in

39
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:33,089
with all of you is networking while Black.

40
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:39,940
So this industry is so focused on networking, on making friends, on working with people that

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,704
you've met in some capacity before. It's very, very common in this field. So I'm curious,

42
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:51,507
just as a broad starting point, what should Game Audio folks be aware of when it comes to

43
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:54,109
networking, making friends, finding those projects while Black?

44
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:08,344
So I feel like kind of something that I kind of want to start with is actually it's it's a it's

45
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:13,790
kind of an anecdote. So I remember I was in San Francisco and I desperately needed to get a haircut

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,677
which has repeated itself but I digress. I was in San Francisco and I went to this barber shop

47
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:20,938
and it wasn't like...

48
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:24,868
if I'm telling the honest truth, I think it was a barbershop that may have

49
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:27,809
specifically catered to members of the LGBT community.

50
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:30,669
But for whatever reason, they were playing

51
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,791
uncensored hip-hop classics from the 90s that I grew up with.

52
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:40,373
So I was in this barbershop getting this haircut, and I got to experience this

53
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:43,433
sense of feeling like I really belonged in this

54
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:46,715
public's place because it was catering to my own personal interest.

55
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,796
And in general, that is a thing that does not happen.

56
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:56,379
in the spaces that I'm participating in. Like in classical music spaces, in video game music

57
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:02,962
spaces, in tech heavy spaces, right? Like I've learned to navigate these places like in a way

58
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:10,445
that does feel authentic to me, but that authenticity, excuse me, is not like super

59
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:18,109
connected to the more like, I don't know, I'm not, I guess, my blackest self in many of these spaces,

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,030
if that makes any sense.

61
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:24,717
It absolutely does. I mean, I think we can almost all agree

62
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:27,937
that like, you always get a feeling like you have to prove

63
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,558
that you belong there, in a weird sort of way, like, it's

64
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:33,899
almost like an assumption is made of like, what is this

65
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,540
person doing here? And just from my own experience, I mean, not

66
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,520
to whatever, but like, it took me maybe like three different

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,341
multi billion dollar franchises before I felt comfortable just

68
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,482
walking into any game dev meetup.

69
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,251
and not feeling like I had to just constantly prove,

70
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,072
no, no, no, I belong here.

71
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,812
I've done work, please trust me, trust me, trust me.

72
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,294
As compared to someone who looks more like the stereotype

73
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:01,614
of, oh yes, this person certainly is in game audio.

74
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,415
And I don't think, once again,

75
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,056
I don't think that anyone intentionally tries

76
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:10,016
to try to keep you out necessarily,

77
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,957
but it's just that since prejudices do exist,

78
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:19,205
it just kind of congeals into this sort of standoffishness,

79
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,246
which is very difficult to combat.

80
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,908
Yeah, and in terms of sort of thinking about,

81
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,689
okay, well, how do you go about approaching that?

82
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,910
Let's say you're someone who's starting out in the industry.

83
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,351
How do you think about networking?

84
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,892
Since it's such, as you said, Akash,

85
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:38,933
it's like such an important part of making your way

86
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:39,734
and making your career.

87
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:49,423
I think my advice would be, at least my journey has just been like, you know, find my first

88
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,004
GDC.

89
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:54,247
I like stepped into this room with like all of the black people who make video games.

90
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:59,111
And you know, there were not that many other audio folks there.

91
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:01,172
I think.

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,482
One thing that I would suggest is to is to maybe have sort of a dual pronged approach,

93
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:13,183
find spaces where you feel as john was saying, where you can be your authentic self, that sort

94
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:18,045
of feels like a little bit trite, but like it's, it's a good, good way of encapsulating that

95
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,285
feeling of being able to

96
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:23,897
bring all your lived experience to a space.

97
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:28,399
And then I think you need to then fork that

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,202
with like find your audio community too.

99
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:40,005
And you know, the sort of underrepresented groups

100
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:42,727
are like getting bigger inside of audio,

101
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:45,348
but it's still such a small amount of people

102
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,428
that it's hard to build.

103
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:52,899
a a large enough space where it feels like something that you can move through and something that you can, you know

104
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,681
Find your peeps inside that space. Um

105
00:06:57,022 --> 00:07:02,686
and so I think that would be probably my advice is that maybe you kind of have to to kind of

106
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,488
To fork those efforts a little bit

107
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,031
But jasmine, what's been your experience? Sorry, I started moderating

108
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:13,554
Um

109
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:22,268
So I guess my experience as far as networking, majority of, I guess, the relationships I've built have been online.

110
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:32,070
The only the only event that I've gone to was GDC, and that was before I came out here to an area of the world where there isn't a lot going on,

111
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,090
but there is a lot of opportunity to create spaces.

112
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,231
And I know for one thing with networking, sometimes that's what you have to do.

113
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,712
For example, if you're new into the industry, game jams are perfect.

114
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:43,972
You can.

115
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,826
you're instantly catapulted into spaces

116
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,207
where you're having to create something

117
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,028
with different people.

118
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,108
Well, the more you do that,

119
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,151
the more you will meet people who will go off to make games

120
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,171
and you'll have that connection

121
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,693
that you can tie yourself into.

122
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,354
But also in lieu of that,

123
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:02,517
you'll definitely find people that are into games

124
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:04,378
that are from a diverse background.

125
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,460
I know the last game jam that I did, it was me.

126
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,342
I had another guy on my team.

127
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,583
I think he was Brazilian.

128
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,585
And then I had a woman on my team who was,

129
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:14,924
from the Philippines.

130
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:17,064
So straight out the gate, I mean, it wasn't planned,

131
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:18,844
but we ended up having a very diverse team.

132
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:23,285
But I think sometimes you do have to create your own space

133
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:27,246
rather than trying to wait for a space to embrace you.

134
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:30,086
But I'll also say with networking,

135
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:33,307
a lot of the time doubt is superseded

136
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,287
if your work speaks for itself.

137
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,308
So like put your all into your work

138
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,928
so that way if somebody does doubt you,

139
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,568
all you have to do is just slide them a demo.

140
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:45,457
and say, oh, you doubt me, sir. OK, have a listen.

141
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,157
And then it gets eradicated.

142
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:50,198
So sometimes that's what you have to do, too, because that doubt will come.

143
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,199
It will rise to the surface.

144
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,360
But if you do good work or you put effort into what you do, then who you

145
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,821
who you are or what you look like is going to get there's a it'll get thrown

146
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,642
out the door to some degree because, you know, you know what you're doing.

147
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,603
So I guess that's what I would say.

148
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:08,343
Like, let your work.

149
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:15,023
speak for itself and then create spaces if you feel like you can't find one that you feel comfortable in.

150
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:18,125
I like that. I like that. So starting in 2020.

151
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:27,952
the kind of black struggles or experiences and issues have become, you know, more and more prevalent, at least, especially in mainstream media, right?

152
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:35,458
It started to trend on social media, it became more and more obvious to people who don't pay attention to that stuff, what's really been going on.

153
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:43,365
And now we're in 2021. And as so often happens, you know, things move on, the news cycle changes, people focus on different things.

154
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,007
So I'm curious between 2020.

155
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,613
and 2021, how have your lives and careers changed?

156
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,574
Has there been a groundswell of support for you

157
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:54,795
and then it died away?

158
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,236
Is it still staying?

159
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,157
Is the support still staying?

160
00:09:58,618 --> 00:10:01,680
What have you noticed in terms of all of those trends,

161
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,821
that social media, that mainstream media,

162
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,463
and how has that support you received changed your careers,

163
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,443
if it has at all?

164
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:12,607
I'm listening.

165
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,348
I'm just writing notes because I forget stuff.

166
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:14,788
Sorry.

167
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,389
I mean, I can I can start us off again. So, so

168
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:36,388
So 2020, you know, it's odd, it's weird, it's still strange for me to talk about,

169
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:43,370
but it was a complete like career explosion for me, right? Like people that I had worked with

170
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,552
before reached out to me, people that were like kind of thinking about working with me were like,

171
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:51,573
oh I'm going to work with you now, which like one of the people I'm thinking about is like a great

172
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:54,515
friend of mine, so this is not like I'm not throwing shade or anything like that, but

173
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:59,903
And then there were opportunities that were a real direct result of everything that was happening,

174
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:04,250
like my getting to work on the anti-racism PSAs for Steven Universe.

175
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:12,864
There has definitely been a shift, I would say. Like all of that explosion of things and that

176
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:18,787
groundswell, like that is not around in the same way that it was. Which, you know, I have feelings

177
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:24,650
about and that's a bit disappointing. But I will say that on a positive note, like I think being

178
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,253
able to do things like this panel, I think honestly having the opportunity to even say something to

179
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:34,257
Anyway, like these are things that I was never going to talk about, right? Because like, who's,

180
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:38,442
I mean, I hate to be cynical, but like, who's gonna give you a job if you're like, you know

181
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:45,511
what I mean? So being able to have that openness, I think does feel like a huge change. You know,

182
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:46,031
I think

183
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:53,894
there are like certainly there's certainly a sense that there are people maybe kind of more

184
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:59,415
established in their careers who are like much more optimistic about speaking with me than maybe

185
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:06,777
they would have wouldn't have been in the past that are like it's kind of this feels kind of

186
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:11,058
weird to say as well but I feel like people are kind of trying to correct and like that is

187
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:14,419
continuing to have an effect on my career so that is a positive thing.

188
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,501
What do you mean by trying to correct?

189
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:20,084
I mean, like

190
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,211
So there's this great picture I remember seeing that I'm, I don't know why I'm going to try to

191
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:31,133
describe a picture, but it's a picture about equality versus equity, right? And it's a picture

192
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:35,314
of like, oh yeah, with the fence and the boxes. All right, I'll still describe it though. So it's

193
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:40,296
like two people are trying to look over a fence and they're like both kind of shorter than the

194
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:45,397
fence. And so equality is like, they both are given like one box, but like one person with

195
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:49,478
one box can see over the fence and the other person is too short. So with one box, they still can't see.

196
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:55,301
Whereas equity is like, oh, you give the person who's like shorter, more boxes so that they can both see over the fence.

197
00:12:55,442 --> 00:13:06,468
Right. And I feel like there is a sense that we're maybe at the very beginnings of like starting to work towards equity in this space, I guess.

198
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:07,788
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

199
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,872
I could give my perspective as someone who's in-house and I've been in-house my whole career.

200
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:43,563
I think I do think john, I agree with you that when, for example, you're looking into hiring the, the idea of sort of stopping the line and saying, Hey, do we have a diverse slate of candidates for this position is now like, acceptable, right? Like people get that and are willing to make space for that. And so

201
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,407
As you had mentioned, John, right?

202
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,690
Like, like there was this reaction, right?

203
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:55,198
Of, of this like enormous groundswell of opportunity and inclusion and people

204
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,201
actively reaching out to say like, Whoa, like, like.

205
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,106
Who are the black folks in this space?

206
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:04,007
Let's figure out who they are and lift them up, right?

207
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:08,748
I think that there is, but that muscle has relaxed,

208
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:13,689
as you've said, and that sort of groundswell

209
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,990
of opportunity is not there.

210
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,710
But I do think that there's some amount of memory there

211
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,811
and some amount of structural change.

212
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:27,936
like, is it as much as we, as sort of where the pendulum was last year? No. But is there,

213
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:33,680
is there a sort of positive systemic change that comes from that? I think yes. But it's,

214
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,483
you know, in the end, it's smaller than we would like. I speak with the royal we.

215
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:48,730
But, but it's, it is, it is like, it's a change. And I think folks are

216
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:59,179
folks are just generally more receptive to understand other groups' perspectives and to

217
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,142
empathize with the experience of those groups going through the processes that they've built

218
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:10,526
inside of a company and are looking to change those.

219
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:16,890
I've definitely seen some very positive outreach as well amongst recruiters and people who are

220
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,491
looking to

221
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:23,716
either hire Black talent or to at least just uplift them and, you know, have Twitter threads

222
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:30,597
and say, here are our Black creators, check them out. And even if that has certainly slowed down

223
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:36,598
in 2021, which by the way, I don't think it necessarily has in the terms of the recruiters.

224
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:41,759
I've definitely seen impressively some recruiters from certain publishers doing a great job of

225
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,280
making sure to find Black spaces like the

226
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:49,479
Black and Gaming Facebook groups and other spaces

227
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,759
to find creators.

228
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:56,480
I definitely would say that it's also partially on us

229
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,241
to continue and take whatever momentum was generated in 2020

230
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:03,321
to see if we can take the baton and go from there.

231
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:07,382
And from my experience, I've definitely

232
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,323
found so many wonderfully talented people

233
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,723
in the past year and a half or so.

234
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,313
partially because of groups like Black In Game Audio,

235
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,914
like Discord group that John started,

236
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:22,217
and also Composing Diversity Collective,

237
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:26,080
and just kind of seeing people out there in the wild

238
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,501
of Twitter and Facebook,

239
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,243
and maybe they're on some mega thread,

240
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,624
maybe I just happen to see them.

241
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:34,086
But I take note of them, and I just realize,

242
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,748
okay, well, hey, here's a group of people,

243
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,251
maybe it's on me as well to hire Black talent,

244
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,993
to hire other forms of underpublished talent,

245
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:44,034
other represented talent.

246
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,972
and see whatever little power that I have, which isn't great,

247
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:50,533
but it's enough to uplift them and help.

248
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,733
And I think that I'm not alone in that regard.

249
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:59,795
So my outlook is actually still rather positive,

250
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,815
even if it's on the surface does seem like the 2020

251
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,136
momentum has slowed.

252
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,516
Yeah, I would agree, Will.

253
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:11,557
I felt as part of the last year as sort of.

254
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:21,581
weight of responsibility that I hadn't really felt before. Like, I'm in the game,

255
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:30,364
in the game scheme of things, I'm like getting old now. And so I'm like, and so I felt like,

256
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:36,387
okay, yeah, there's a huge opportunity, but there's a huge amount of work to do, right?

257
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,749
to build organizations in order to to structuralize.

258
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:51,391
making the change that we want to see. And so, yeah, there's been a sort of groundswell,

259
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:55,212
at least in sort of my realm of things, a groundswell of organizational work.

260
00:17:55,972 --> 00:18:01,773
I started a thing called the Game Audio Diversity Alliance, like to give scholarships out to kids.

261
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:04,974
And then, Will, you've been involved in one that's run out of gang, right?

262
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:13,021
And so I think that's sort of another space of opportunity that I saw open up was like,

263
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:22,585
oh yeah, let's build these organizations that can be Black and more diversely owned and operated

264
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:25,987
in order to make structural change.

265
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:31,350
And I agree with what you said, Will, especially about the onus being on us.

266
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,352
Also, I think I'll talk about

267
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:42,270
2020 after this, but I will say 2021. I, I think it has made for

268
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:46,133
those of us who do want to try and push the envelope in terms

269
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:49,936
to incorporating black talent into our work. It has made it

270
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,878
easier for us to do that depending on who we're working

271
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:55,941
with. I know one of the projects that I'm on, I have a really,

272
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,703
really huge goal that I want to meet with this project. And I

273
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,606
honestly didn't well just what I wanted, I want at least 90% of

274
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,251
the musicians that I hired to be black or people of color.

275
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,472
And I had planned to do this and never told the developer.

276
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,754
And we actually, I don't know if that's a good thing,

277
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:16,755
but I was just like, you know what, I'm just gonna do it.

278
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:17,155
And then-

279
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:17,756
I'll just do it.

280
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,277
But I was gonna do it.

281
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,778
And I was like, I mean, whatever, I'm a composer, whatever.

282
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:26,840
But we had a face-to-face, we had a meeting,

283
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,701
one-on-one meeting, he was doing this with everybody.

284
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,602
And he literally asked the question,

285
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,123
is there anything that you have like aspirations for?

286
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:38,372
in this project that you would like to discuss.

287
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,453
And I told him, and he was like,

288
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:40,534
yo, I am 100% for this.

289
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:43,116
And I was like, I mean, it doesn't matter if you weren't,

290
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:44,818
but I'm glad that you are.

291
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,719
I'm like, I'm glad that you are.

292
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,622
But I guess it's just the fact that

293
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:53,525
with this company, I felt comfortable enough to say,

294
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:54,245
I wanna do this.

295
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,389
And a good part of me felt like they would be for it.

296
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,270
And he was.

297
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,092
So it's just knowing that we're in a space now

298
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:02,812
where we could do that.

299
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:03,653
We're just like, you know what?

300
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:10,644
want this type of, I want these people being a huge conglomerate of what I'm working with.

301
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:16,226
And, you know, the people that I'm working for are like, you know what, I, I totally, I totally get

302
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:22,709
it, you know, doesn't, I'm here for it. So that's nice. But in 2020, I think I'm, I was definitely

303
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:29,693
one of the ones who was extremely skeptical of people who were reaching out. I didn't,

304
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:31,393
nothing really changed for me.

305
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:39,253
what I did notice was a lot of focus being put on to, you know, like, hey, I have this job. If

306
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:44,617
you're Black, please, you know, apply. And I'm one of those people where when I see that, I get

307
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:50,441
irritated. Like, you could just say diverse applicants can apply or, you know, or just,

308
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:56,505
just say I have a job and go for it. But, you know, I understand that other people might like

309
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:58,867
seeing that wording put on a job application.

310
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:03,901
But I know for me, just as soon as I see that, I'm just like, I don't, I just, I don't want to do it.

311
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:08,144
And that's probably because a bit of it felt performative for me.

312
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:17,832
I know, I know there were some people, other, there were some composers like offering services, like, hey, it's like, if you're Black or you're marginalized, like, I want to give you, you know, help.

313
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:18,793
I want to help you out.

314
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:22,716
And that frustrated me too, because my thought process is we've been going through this for years.

315
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:27,680
And now you want to offer your services now when, you know, you can kind of.

316
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:31,382
it can add to the clout that you can get on social media.

317
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,603
It's one of those things where we know

318
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,004
it's been happening for forever.

319
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:37,024
So why are you offering your hand now

320
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:40,826
when it feels as though socially it's accepted

321
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:42,527
and exalted if you do that?

322
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:48,649
But I am happy that it has led to opportunities

323
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,551
and things that have been exposing themselves now in 2021.

324
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,412
So I'm happy about it now.

325
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:56,852
That's all I got.

326
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:03,766
Yeah, you brought up a really good point, Jasmine, about that kind of performative activism

327
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,306
that can happen during situations like this.

328
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:13,088
It tends to be a thing where I imagine, and you tell me what you feel, does it sometimes

329
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,089
feel that you can tell when it's performative and when it's not?

330
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,570
Can you kind of see through it?

331
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,331
Is it the sort of thing where you know, like, okay, come on?

332
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,352
And how do you kind of deal with that sort of coming up?

333
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:31,538
I think for me, at least with me, at least in that, I think in that realm, it's like

334
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:36,520
you lose either way because you have people like me who are just like, I can't stand it

335
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,141
when they do that.

336
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:40,822
We have other people who are just like, I love it when they, so it's, you really just

337
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:45,305
kind of, you have to do what your heart feels like is the correct thing, because whoever

338
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:49,146
feels inspired to apply or join into it, they'll do it.

339
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,348
And that's just from a surface level perspective of it.

340
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:53,588
Once you're actually.

341
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:59,095
in the throes of like when you're actually in the environment with those people then you start to

342
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:05,602
understand uh y'all are just all show so i think as far as a job application you can't really tell

343
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:11,387
but when you start talking to people you start voicing ideas and you start hearing how you know

344
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:16,212
they act whenever you might make a comment about something that they said or something that they

345
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,935
might have alluded to and then you start to see

346
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:24,171
if they're open to being corrected or if they start breaking down and getting defensive in

347
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:30,257
certain ways, then you start to see, okay, I don't think this environment is what they

348
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:35,642
made it out to be, if they intended on it being an environment that's inclusive.

349
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:43,109
Right. I think it's a difference between a group or organization saying

350
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:47,167
hey, we want to come to you on your terms rather than,

351
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:50,529
hey, will you come to us on our terms, right?

352
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:54,451
And yeah, it differs from place to place,

353
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:55,912
but I think like in the core,

354
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:58,893
that is maybe the difference between like performative

355
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:02,435
outreach and actual outreach.

356
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,838
Yeah, I would definitely agree with that.

357
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,220
Yeah, and I, so,

358
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,992
I kind of feel two ways about it, right?

359
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,778
Like on one hand, it's even honestly,

360
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:20,241
I've kind of noticed this performative thing.

361
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:25,808
probably less in my professional life, like a little bit in my professional life, but I have

362
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:29,751
really noticed it in my personal life a little bit too, actually, where people are like, hey,

363
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:33,353
if you need anything, just let me know. And it's like, oh, great. And, you know,

364
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:37,375
there are a couple of people where I had like, you know, one or two good conversations, but then

365
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:41,138
they were kind of back to like business as usual, back to their lives, back to, you know,

366
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,361
whatever they were doing. And that, along with some of the professional opportunities that have

367
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:47,882
kind of like,

368
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:54,838
you know, been that way can honestly be deeply upsetting. So that is part of it. Like I'm feeling

369
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:59,826
a little upset talking about it. But then on the other hand, if you'll excuse my phrasing,

370
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,609
like a check's a check. Like I have to...

371
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:08,095
Right? Like, I mean, I hate to, I hate to be that person,

372
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:09,756
but it's like, I, you know,

373
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,517
I've been wanting to do this since I was a child

374
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,099
and I made the decision that I was going to do it

375
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,800
whatever it takes.

376
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,421
So like sometimes, so you walk into a room

377
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,902
and like, I try to be optimistic.

378
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:20,943
Like I go in and I'm positive.

379
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,244
I'm like, yeah, we're going to do this.

380
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:23,004
It's going to be great.

381
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,065
It's going to be wonderful.

382
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:27,146
You know, like whatever doubt I might have,

383
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:27,967
I just ignore it.

384
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:29,848
I put it to the side and I'm like, let's do this.

385
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,430
And then, you know, maybe like five weeks later,

386
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,150
I'm like, okay.

387
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,813
I see, I see how this is gonna be. But I'm also like, but I got

388
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:41,037
paid. And I'm making some music or I'm trying to make some music

389
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:43,579
or I'm trying to make game which was the point in the first

390
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:50,164
place. So you have a few deep sighs and get on with it, I

391
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:50,464
guess.

392
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:53,827
Oh, there's one of them.

393
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:03,059
I need to be more like that.

394
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,501
I gotta work on it.

395
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:06,723
I'm just like it.

396
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:08,685
I'm just like I ain't got time.

397
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:10,526
Life's too short.

398
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:11,187
Yeah.

399
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:11,427
Yep.

400
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:16,578
So we were talking earlier about kind of that feeling like you belong in a space.

401
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,879
John, I think you're the one who brought it up.

402
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:20,720
You went to that barber shop and you're like, oh, I I feel good here.

403
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,801
I feel like I belong.

404
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,922
Do you feel in the kind of broader industry as a whole

405
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:27,803
when you walk into a room that just can, you know, anyone's welcome?

406
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:31,765
It's probably predominantly white if you're in the Western kind of world,

407
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:32,405
especially.

408
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:35,527
Do you feel that you have to kind of filter yourselves

409
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,028
or kind of act a certain way to fit in?

410
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:40,729
Do you do you feel that that comes up?

411
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:47,662
You know, I used to go to a lot of meetups, especially here in Seattle,

412
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:51,564
which again, you know, I'm not trying to say anything negative.

413
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:55,545
I mean, I think that Seattle has probably the greatest game audio community in the world.

414
00:26:56,965 --> 00:27:02,707
However, before every meetup I went to, it was a very lengthy and surprisingly

415
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:07,729
agonizing process of just going in front of the mirror, trying this outfit, that outfit, this one.

416
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:13,974
trying to figure out like, okay, I'm a little, you know,

417
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:17,096
a little more physical than most people.

418
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:21,659
How do I sort of minimize the scariness of my appearance?

419
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,062
How do I soften my appearance to look more acceptable

420
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:30,185
in this group of, you know, professional nerds and stuff?

421
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:33,248
You know, I'm making a joke of it.

422
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:34,548
Trying to be a softer nerd.

423
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:36,290
I think that's cute.

424
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,070
But it's true.

425
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,832
And I mean, I spent.

426
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:43,393
a truly agonizing amount of time worrying about this.

427
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,855
And then when I get there, you have to sort of like,

428
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:49,577
okay, keep your voice down and then you speak

429
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:52,699
with this sort of whatever, especially early on.

430
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,442
I mean, as time wore on and I befriended more people

431
00:27:58,562 --> 00:27:59,883
in the game audio community.

432
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:01,744
So it wasn't like, here's a room full of people

433
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:02,165
I don't know.

434
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:07,449
but instead it's like, here's a room full of people, 90% of them I know and have befriended,

435
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:13,213
and they know already what my credits and whatnot are. Then it's like, okay, now you can relax.

436
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:19,777
But honestly, I don't want anyone else to have to go through all of that. And that's kind of where

437
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:25,501
my headspace has been the last several years. I've been incredibly lucky, and I admit to that freely.

438
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:28,843
It's unusual.

439
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:34,798
for someone in our situation to have had the level of success

440
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:39,081
that I'm very happy to have and very grateful to have enjoyed.

441
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:41,703
But I don't want anyone else to have

442
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:46,666
to go through just rewriting yourself just to be accepted,

443
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:49,728
just so that someone can listen to you and not just assume,

444
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:52,349
oh, he's some fly-by-night operation that's

445
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,451
going to try to put hip hop in our games and things

446
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:58,674
like that, these assumptions that unfortunately

447
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,295
are a reality for us.

448
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:06,884
What if we wanted to put hip-hop in our games?

449
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:16,711
Right? Yeah. Why not? Exactly. And that's another part of it, is the diversity of the content

450
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:22,856
itself. I mean, I happen to be, you know, more into like the world music, orchestral world and

451
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:29,681
stuff, which is, you know, it's an acceptable genre for pretty much any genre of games. But

452
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,645
why don't we have more Spider-Man Miles Morales? You know, why don't we have more titles that...

453
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:38,797
blend different genres that typically aren't heard anymore.

454
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,738
And I think now's the perfect time to do it.

455
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,022
I haven't been in, like I said before,

456
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,263
I haven't been in any, I haven't been in many spaces.

457
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:53,747
And so I haven't really felt the need to filter myself,

458
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:54,827
primarily because of that.

459
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:59,270
And then, I don't know, when I went to GDC,

460
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,871
I felt more like an observer anyway.

461
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:03,093
So I don't know if that,

462
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:11,211
changes how I might see myself. But I'm trying to think. I mean,

463
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:18,614
I don't think I filter myself through. Or, yeah, I don't think

464
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:21,735
I've needed to, I don't think I've been in positions like

465
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:26,217
Will, to need to filter myself, since majority of my career

466
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,518
spawned online. So I could literally be myself anyway,

467
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:32,019
since I was technically anonymous. And

468
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,400
So that, I guess that worked out for me. So yeah.

469
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,881
Yeah, I mean, I'm a biracial kid. So like, I've been code switching literally my entire life.

470
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:54,984
And so, you know, it's, it's, it's something you just sort of I've, I've been thinking a lot about

471
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:58,225
that I go, I just don't realize that I do it, you know. And

472
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,252
Especially sort of my journey through games. I started at Harmonix, which is a place that

473
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:12,316
at the time and still is was just like rock culture, right? Like it is just like,

474
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:19,007
And so I, you know, put that part of myself away when I was at work.

475
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:24,850
Um, and you know, the part that I grew up on, like, you know, listening to hip hop

476
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:30,012
and like, and being part of the sort of part of myself that is steeped in black

477
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:32,314
culture of like the nineties and early two thousands.

478
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:39,938
And, um, and so you do it without thinking, like you, you lean more into the.

479
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:50,305
into the part of yourself that loves games, right? And you lean more into the culture that you know

480
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:59,672
is shared in those spaces, right? And that makes, you know, people feel more safe and

481
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:09,600
you therefore more acceptable. But unwittingly, you're hiding away a part of yourself

482
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:14,310
that you, without thinking, don't think is safe to show, right?

483
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,710
Oh.

484
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:20,472
And so that's sort of the, that's the beauty of like inclusive spaces, right? You can,

485
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:27,134
is it like you can dust off and excavate that part of yourself that you didn't realize you

486
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:35,317
weren't using for the past, you know, 15 years or whatever. And rediscover it.

487
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:35,658
Yep.

488
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:39,299
Yeah. Stand up, sit brass lion are like, are.

489
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:48,160
wildly different. I'm bringing out all the old references and it's great. But yeah, I

490
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,803
didn't realize I wasn't doing it for the rest of my career.

491
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:56,886
John, did you have something to add?

492
00:32:57,386 --> 00:33:03,170
Yep, is what I added. Exactly that. Honestly, all of that. I couldn't have said it better myself.

493
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:04,691
Awesome.

494
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:11,382
Yeah, and Will, you just brought up the interesting thought of genres in when it comes to music, especially.

495
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:19,009
Have you ever run into the issue for any of you where someone expects you to do a certain genre based on your race?

496
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:25,834
They'll just assume that maybe you do traditionally black music and just be surprised when you don't.

497
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:31,559
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

498
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,301
Absolutely. I mean, you know, it's.

499
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:40,341
It's understandable, especially if you just don't have any experience at all with people,

500
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:45,423
people of color, then it's like, okay, sure, you have your stereotypes. I mean, I've

501
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:49,565
definitely gone to I don't mean to I feel like a bad cop. Why do I always have to deliver

502
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:57,369
like a setup all along? But yeah, you know, I've been to GDC, you know, you have the nice

503
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,890
little conversation circles West third floor.

504
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:06,370
And, you know, people getting to know each other and someone's asking, oh, what musical genres do you all write in?

505
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,372
And everyone kind of goes in the circle explaining, yes, to me.

506
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:12,574
And the person just says, oh, so I guess you do hip hop. Right.

507
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:15,455
And at the time I was working at LucasArts.

508
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:19,477
So I had this LucasArts badge that literally said that's right there.

509
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:23,339
And I'd already introduced myself as, you know, that as such.

510
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:27,242
So I said, no, you know, I mostly do orchestral, you know, Star Wars.

511
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,402
You know, I've done some Star Wars.

512
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:29,603
And then they just went.

513
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:39,116
Okay, so like jazz? And to which I just say, yeah, sure. The

514
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,977
conversation at that point was kind of over.

515
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:47,639
I love how for him, black orchestra is jazz. Like, orchestra

516
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,219
has to be jazz. That's what you think.

517
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,521
It is absolutely what it is. But just like Jasmine mentioned

518
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:58,122
earlier, your work has to speak for itself.

519
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:04,925
And I think more than that, you know, every every black parent tells their kids, look, you have to work twice as hard.

520
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:07,087
You have to shine like crazy.

521
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:14,112
You have to work super hard at your work because in order to be taken seriously, it has to just be that much.

522
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,353
No, it has to achieve that much.

523
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:23,498
And so, yeah, it's it's funny when they make these assumptions about me just because of, you know, whatever.

524
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:28,245
But after a while, if you keep at it

525
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:29,986
and keep sort of improving yourself,

526
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,208
have that humility to be extremely

527
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:35,411
self-critical about your work, then these kind of issues

528
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:37,993
go away and it just becomes hilarious

529
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,794
when they make that assumption about you.

530
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:46,760
I was curious, Will, like what...

531
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:56,552
What was your experience when you were approaching the score for MK, which is like sort of leaning

532
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:02,634
as sort of mainstream video games go has sort of some amount of Venn diagram overlap with black

533
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:09,176
culture. Yeah. Like, what was that experience like? You've just won my heart because I didn't

534
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:16,038
think anyone would notice that. But actually, I'll explain it. It was actually quite intentional.

535
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:21,093
there's a whole faction in the game of, I mean, they're Earth

536
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:24,797
Realmers, but they're pretty much all American, like Sonia,

537
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:30,482
Jackie, Jax, Cassie, Johnny Cage. And I immediately I saw

538
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:33,404
this faction. And I said to myself, I want to write a theme

539
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:37,388
for this faction that embraces black culture, that embraces

540
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:41,211
spirituals. And it has that kind of pentatonic melody that you

541
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,713
would expect from from spirituals.

542
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:51,229
And, you know, I hired an amazing soul singer for this one scene with Johnny, Cassie and Jackie.

543
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,111
And, you know, she knocked it out of the park, obviously she's amazing.

544
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:59,133
And it was very important to me that I had kind of two sides to it.

545
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:02,755
One was to show, yes, this is the American sound.

546
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:05,256
You can't divorce Black music from American music.

547
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:05,896
It's impossible.

548
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,898
So I wanted to show this is the American sound to kind of portray the characters.

549
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:11,659
But also...

550
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:17,671
Another kind of nuance to it, which is another reason why I'm so glad that you brought this up,

551
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:24,495
was that there was a military heroism in it as well. And just like that, you cannot dissociate

552
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:30,278
the Black experience from the military and American military history as well. And I had

553
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:36,101
that sort of military pride in there in certain moments with Jacks and Jackie,

554
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,143
showing that they're a military family. They have a lot of pride.

555
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:43,166
and they're also black characters.

556
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:46,428
And yeah, I mean, I felt just so blessed

557
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:47,389
to be on that project.

558
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:50,691
The audio directors were extremely open to all of my ideas

559
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:53,854
and it was a great opportunity to sort of,

560
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,055
I don't think we've ever really had spirituals

561
00:37:56,836 --> 00:38:01,199
in a video game or soul singing or anything like that.

562
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,921
I mean, I could be wrong, you know, and excuse me if I am,

563
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,843
but it was a fantastic opportunity

564
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:07,864
to bring that to the forefront.

565
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:11,170
Yes, I love that.

566
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,631
Caleb, thank you for asking that.

567
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:13,051
That's awesome.

568
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,272
Yes, thank you, sir.

569
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,132
I'll stop my own script.

570
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,413
Notice that wasn't a plan.

571
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,516
I didn't tell you that.

572
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:23,599
So actually, I might as well ask my question for you, Caleb.

573
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,400
We'll put you in the spotlight for a second.

574
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,023
So you are an audio director of color.

575
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:31,044
There aren't very many of those

576
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,826
in the Western kind of game industry at all.

577
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:36,208
I could maybe count on one hand off the top of my head,

578
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:37,108
the amount that there are.

579
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,970
So I'm curious what kind of...

580
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:46,494
discussions or thought processes that you can have now that you are an audio director of color

581
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:51,818
that you couldn't maybe at previous companies or kind of previous spaces that you've been in?

582
00:38:51,838 --> 00:39:02,086
Big question. Well, I think the sort of most obvious one is around hiring, right?

583
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:07,810
And team building, you know, both as an audio director sort of.

584
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,607
You're that you're now in the position to be the shot caller for like, what

585
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,488
composer do you put on a project?

586
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:16,329
What voiceover talent are you hiring?

587
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:20,171
How are you building your team and how are you building the processes of the

588
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:26,734
studio in order to, you know, in this case, ensure that we're, we're, we're.

589
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:31,076
We have like diverse hiring practices and requirements around

590
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,557
diverse slates and things like that.

591
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,939
So that is like an amazing privilege and an amazing responsibility.

592
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:47,508
Also, it is a seat at the table, right? It's a seat at the table creatively around

593
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:54,934
building what a video game is. Like, it's, it's, I'll sort of...

594
00:39:56,196 --> 00:40:01,820
seeing the praises of being an audio director for a second, because it's amazing. But I don't come

595
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,746
up through the traditional studio background, which a lot of sound designers do, nor do I come

596
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:18,631
through the music conservatory background. I'm like an interactive artist, basically. I used to

597
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:22,894
do sound installations. And so

598
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:29,340
The thing that drives me to work on games is that I love games.

599
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,863
I happen to be really good, maybe, probably not, at doing sound stuff.

600
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:36,965
Um, but I love games.

601
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,867
So I consider myself like a game developer who works in audio rather than

602
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,048
an audio person who, who works in games.

603
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:50,014
And so being able to be sort of present at the creation of the ideas and the core

604
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:53,056
ideas of what a game is, is like an amazing position to be in.

605
00:40:53,716 --> 00:40:55,337
Um, and.

606
00:40:57,084 --> 00:41:07,434
it's a vector by which I can help steer games to be something that I want them to be, to sort of

607
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:14,920
make the things that I want to see in the world. But as I said, it's a huge responsibility because

608
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:22,787
it's also an opportunity to take a crowbar and pry out space for folks, right?

609
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:28,083
And there is so much work to do, especially in audio.

610
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:32,926
In audio, it's really a case where

611
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:37,829
we have sort of twin vectors in order to really change

612
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:40,090
the face of our discipline.

613
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,413
We have an enormous gender inequality problem in audio.

614
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:49,405
And we just generally have a diversity problem in audio.

615
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:54,750
You know, it's it's why I shaved my beard off. We need like, no

616
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,494
offense to all the bearded dudes, but like, we need a

617
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:04,720
little less. But so it's, it's difficult. Every hiring

618
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,804
decision is, is, to be honest, is kind of agony. Because

619
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:15,796
every spot in game audio has a lot of meaning.

620
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,818
And maybe I'm putting like a little too much weight on it,

621
00:42:18,878 --> 00:42:20,059
but you know, there aren't that many

622
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,740
sound designer positions at each studio.

623
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,262
So every, like, especially for in-house positions, right?

624
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:30,304
And so it's a really, really difficult decision

625
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:34,506
to decide who to put on your team,

626
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:36,467
because every person on your team

627
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:38,028
changes the voice of your game a little bit.

628
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,052
But yeah, it's a blessing and a curse,

629
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:44,333
blessing and a responsibility.

630
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,716
But I wouldn't trade it for anything.

631
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:51,919
Like I love being at the table

632
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,800
to figure out what games are.

633
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:54,521
It's awesome.

634
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,464
Love that. And for the rest of you, and also Caleb, too, from your previous experience,

635
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:05,847
considering most of the time if you are on a project that has an audio director,

636
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:10,591
odds are they're a white person. The odds are very high that that's the case.

637
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:16,496
Have there ever been any sort of situations where you've had to kind of push for more diverse thought

638
00:43:16,616 --> 00:43:21,900
or any diverse music or anything like that? Or has it generally just been accepted whenever you do

639
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:24,643
have any of those ideals that you want to put forward in your music or sound?

640
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:39,612
I think for me personally, I feel like I'm kind of neutralizing this.

641
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:43,513
I haven't been in a position where I needed to.

642
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:49,075
The current project that I mentioned earlier would probably be the very first time that

643
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:54,056
I've ever done anything that could bring about opposition.

644
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:55,616
And I got it.

645
00:43:55,656 --> 00:43:56,677
It didn't.

646
00:43:56,797 --> 00:44:00,858
And even then, like I said, if I hadn't said anything, the opposition wouldn't have come

647
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:02,138
when it was too late.

648
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:04,078
So other than that, I wouldn't have even cared.

649
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:12,500
But fortunately for this, I brought it to the forefront and it wasn't an issue.

650
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,781
So, nice.

651
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:18,562
Anyone else.

652
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:28,587
I don't make it a bunch of faces over here. Um, I don't know, like I, it's.

653
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:34,759
For me, in general, I think not even necessarily as a black person, but just as an artist,

654
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,503
it can be very difficult to find out how much creative freedom you have and to like kind of

655
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:49,369
bounce things back and forth. So like, I will say that like, I don't know, I, as I go further in my

656
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:52,751
career, and as I work in kind of different environments, I do get a little bit more

657
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:58,174
comfortable with like doing some stuff that's a little bit more out there. So I don't know, I

658
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:04,230
I don't even know if I should have started talking. I don't know. I would say in general,

659
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:15,343
you know, there's probably kind of a dual thing, right? It's like, you're a composer and you're

660
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:18,746
also Black, and it's like, maybe both of those feet are like, pressing down on some of my creative

661
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:24,551
expression. So like, in general, just the more open people can be, I think the better off. I mean,

662
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:29,455
they get better, you get better music in your game if you like, just let people do stuff, you know?

663
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:34,779
And people are afraid to do that, I think. Yeah, that's for sure.

664
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,240
This is not an experience I have, but...

665
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:40,512
as an audio director, I imagine that like we're vaguely terrifying.

666
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:45,817
Well, because like you want to, you want to like please the client,

667
00:45:45,857 --> 00:45:50,341
like we're the client, right? You want to like please the client. And so,

668
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:59,610
yeah, I agree, John, like giving that space, my sort of general ethos as an audio director is like,

669
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:05,323
have an opinion of like, have a, have a version of the thing in your head.

670
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:06,885
Don't share that.

671
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:13,552
Uh, because if you do it, it will often destroy the ability for the person

672
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:15,955
you're working with to exceed that expectation.

673
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:22,930
So I do that with composers and I do that with voice talent as well.

674
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:29,214
You can always fall back on the thing in your head if you're not, if you're like, no, we're

675
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:30,054
not finding it.

676
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,635
I need to just get the thing.

677
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:40,881
But if you leave that space for the people you're working with to bring themselves and

678
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:41,881
to surprise you.

679
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:48,210
then that's just better, because it's better than your wildest dreams. But if you just,

680
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,773
you know, if you let that out of the out of your bag too early, like, you know,

681
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:58,656
people are just gonna do that because, you know, they want to, they want to please you.

682
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:05,200
Yeah, I mean, I think this is not necessarily well, for in my experience, this hasn't necessarily been

683
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,504
a black in game audio situation, but more of a composer in game audio situation that everyone

684
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:11,124
kind of goes through.

685
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,342
And I have to say that having worked on basically every tier

686
00:47:15,362 --> 00:47:18,324
of game development from like very high budget

687
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:21,387
to very small budget, there is no correlation whatsoever

688
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:25,611
between budget or status or whatever of the game

689
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,193
and how much creative freedom that you have,

690
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:31,576
at least not that I've experienced.

691
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:36,519
you know, once again with Mortal Kombat, it almost seems like it was a goal for me to like,

692
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,243
how can I just surprise them? How can I come up with something that's going to, you know,

693
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:45,907
surprise them and be maybe very left field, but still make it in, still work for the game.

694
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:51,352
And they were completely on board with every single weird decision that I came up with.

695
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:55,495
Big action scene and it's just a pipe organ, you know, things like that.

696
00:47:56,536 --> 00:47:59,459
But it worked and they were totally happy with it.

697
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:07,435
interesting opportunities I think that we have, not only with the coming generation, next gen,

698
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:12,639
which is now or whatever you want to call it, but also just with our history in game music,

699
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:17,181
is that there really are a lot of musical genres that have not been explored.

700
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:23,746
And a lot of them are Black American musical genres. You haven't heard much gospel in games,

701
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:28,969
you haven't heard much spirituals, you haven't heard that much of different kinds of jazz.

702
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:37,917
And of course, hip hop is only just now starting to get on the rise with the indie world and Miles Morales, like I mentioned earlier.

703
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,539
So I see it as a great opportunity, honestly.

704
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:54,770
And I'm hoping that directors can be open to this and kind of think less in terms of like, well, here is how I envisioned the score going and more in terms of, well, how does this work on an emotional level?

705
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,052
How does this work on a mechanical level as well?

706
00:48:59,878 --> 00:49:02,579
That said, by the time that they've chosen the composer,

707
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,201
they usually chose that composer for a reason.

708
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:08,182
That reason usually being either their demo,

709
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:09,743
their previous work, or whatever.

710
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:14,165
So there is only so much wiggle room that they can tolerate.

711
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,047
But it is definitely something to keep in mind.

712
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:19,088
Nice.

713
00:49:19,488 --> 00:49:19,668
Nice.

714
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:25,530
So, question for you, Jasmine, specifically. I'm curious, considering you've been in Vietnam

715
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,696
for a little bit now, and you have kind of a unique view on being.

716
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:35,278
overseas, right, when it comes to being in the game audio field, and you've built your career

717
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:41,460
primarily online as well. So I'm curious, from your point of view, have you ever had to kind of

718
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,941
hide or accentuate your blackness in any way? Have you felt you've had to in any way when you are

719
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:52,263
kind of making this career happen online? Or have you just kind of gone with whatever feels right,

720
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:59,705
and it's worked out fine? I generally have just gone with however I felt.

721
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:04,828
I know, I guess when you say accent my blackness, you mean act more black?

722
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:05,628
Mm hmm.

723
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,631
Because I've seen a lot of spaces, people tend to kind of expect that.

724
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:10,952
Okay.

725
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:12,313
No, that's interesting.

726
00:50:12,854 --> 00:50:19,559
I I'll definitely say not from a game audio perspective now, but just being

727
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:22,521
in like an expat space has been interesting.

728
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:27,845
But as far as being online, no, I've been able to continue just.

729
00:50:29,137 --> 00:50:36,359
being my normal self online, I haven't had to overcompensate in any way. So yeah, I've been

730
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:41,481
fairly, I don't know, I feel like, I mean, granted, you get most of, I believe most of the opportunities

731
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:49,223
that you get as a composer come from in-person interactions. But I will say, even though it's

732
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:53,944
definitely a lot harder to grow a career online, when you don't show your face,

733
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:57,168
where you go a long time without having to show your face.

734
00:50:57,188 --> 00:51:00,710
A lot of the things that I've heard that John will and Caleb having to do,

735
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,271
you don't have to do that's probably,

736
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,352
but honestly it's because everybody automatically thinks you're a white male.

737
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:09,094
So, so, you know, I don't have to hide because I,

738
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:13,655
people already assume I'm status quo, you know? So I guess that's,

739
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:18,518
I guess that's the upside to it. Um, I know I had tangential,

740
00:51:18,978 --> 00:51:19,678
but I remember I,

741
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:24,640
when I was first starting and a guy, a guy knew that I was a woman.

742
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:26,608
And so it was like, hey, you know what you should do?

743
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:30,051
You should create this sexy girl persona

744
00:51:30,071 --> 00:51:31,912
that'll help you sell your music.

745
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:32,953
And I was like, ugh.

746
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:34,575
But I mean, the fact that somebody,

747
00:51:34,855 --> 00:51:37,117
like that's gonna help me get work?

748
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,919
To be a sexy girl?

749
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,382
Okay.

750
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:43,863
Yeah, yeah, I know.

751
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:46,165
Granted, that was early on,

752
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:47,906
and I've only had that happen once.

753
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:50,328
But I just threw up in my mouth, like,

754
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:52,330
why, what, do you think that works?

755
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:58,345
But yeah, I haven't had to deal with any need to be extra black all the time.

756
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:58,826
That's funny saying.

757
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:00,976
But yeah, good.

758
00:52:01,736 --> 00:52:14,387
Good. So kind of a few questions kind of as we kind of circle to the end, I'm curious because, you know, we're doing this panel we're getting some of your experiences thoughts, your, your kind of ideals out there.

759
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:22,514
But once this panels over people will kind of go back to their regular lives will go back to experiencing the rest of GDC, they'll think about their careers, etc, etc.

760
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:29,480
if you were to say what things people should do or what they should take away and what we

761
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:36,305
should act on to make the space more diverse, more inclusive, more empathetic to your experiences

762
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,028
and everyone else's, what would those things be?

763
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,512
I feel like

764
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:51,167
Even if a person, you know, if you feel like you want to be helpful, right?

765
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:56,994
If you were to take even like 30 minutes out of your day to sit and

766
00:52:57,134 --> 00:52:58,716
think about what you could do.

767
00:52:59,817 --> 00:53:04,399
It doesn't even matter if you come up with a good idea, a bad idea, no idea.

768
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:05,439
It really doesn't matter.

769
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,201
You could, I mean, you could say the most awful thing after having done this 30

770
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:15,763
minutes, but I feel like if you do this 30 minutes, I think that'll change, like

771
00:53:16,303 --> 00:53:18,324
who you are when you approach someone.

772
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:20,985
And even if you say something off color or whatever.

773
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:26,060
I think they'll feel your effort and that will be meaningful, right?

774
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:28,283
Like that doesn't mean that they're going to embrace you and be like,

775
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:29,164
oh, you're so wonderful.

776
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:31,827
Like don't go in with that expectation necessarily,

777
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:34,990
but just like put in the smallest amount of time

778
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,375
and I think it'll have a dramatic impact on your interactions with people going forward.

779
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:39,976
Like honestly.

780
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:52,091
I have a question. Is this is this question geared towards people trying to make their spaces more inclusive?

781
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:59,533
Yes. OK. I think mine might be similar to what what John said, I guess a couple.

782
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:07,676
Oh, honestly, this is based off what Caleb said, like going to spaces versus expecting people to come to you,

783
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:13,358
because when you do do your research to try and put yourself into a position.

784
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:16,238
One thing I was talking to somebody about this where.

785
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:23,473
a lot of people, generally their spaces are, or the people that they interact with are people that

786
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:29,917
are very similar to them. And it's like, I feel like a lot of the time the government or environments

787
00:54:29,957 --> 00:54:36,080
try to force diversity on people, but usually people tend to, I feel like most people tend

788
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:41,383
to gravitate towards spaces that they're comfortable with, which is generally comprised of

789
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:45,345
people that look like them. And so one thing that I thought about was if

790
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:49,293
people weren't put in positions to have to interact with people that are different from them.

791
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,313
What do they feel led to do that?

792
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:54,874
Like, ah, I actually do hang out with a lot of people who don't look like me.

793
00:54:55,414 --> 00:54:56,754
Well, this place is open.

794
00:54:57,334 --> 00:55:04,016
Am I interested in going to see with how other people who, you know, be willing to open up my

795
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:09,517
mindset to what other people may live their life or what their culture may be like?

796
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,337
And so I guess I would definitely say.

797
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:15,134
put yourself in a position to be uncomfortable, be okay with being

798
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:19,476
uncomfortable, just so that you can expose yourself to what other people

799
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:24,599
generally feel. You know, I think just practice trying to walk in someone

800
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:31,663
else's shoes, you know, would definitely be a start. Yeah. And I guess also be

801
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:36,145
open to like self reflection. I think that's difficult to like, being here in

802
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:36,706
Vietnam.

803
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,567
I realized that I

804
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:42,133
have an immense amount of privilege.

805
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,874
And I feel like for some people,

806
00:55:44,894 --> 00:55:46,095
depending on where they're coming from,

807
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,396
they might come to another country and not realize that,

808
00:55:49,456 --> 00:55:51,517
that, oh, you have a lot of power

809
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,277
that you didn't feel like you might've had back home,

810
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,118
but you have it now, and are you aware of that?

811
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,820
And also being able to look at some of the actions

812
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,761
that you might do and go, oh, wow, that's actually,

813
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:03,842
I'm actually not.

814
00:56:04,555 --> 00:56:08,717
being conscientious of how my actions affect the people

815
00:56:08,937 --> 00:56:10,857
that live here or affect the people

816
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:13,298
who primarily take up this environment

817
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:14,779
and being okay with someone saying,

818
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,440
hey, you do realize that what you're doing needs this.

819
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,281
And rather than getting defensive,

820
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,282
being able to internalize that and go,

821
00:56:24,142 --> 00:56:25,202
actually they have a point.

822
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:27,623
And this time I can do this

823
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:30,044
the next time the situation arises.

824
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:31,384
So I guess being open to,

825
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:33,845
being able to put yourself in uncomfortable situations.

826
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:39,531
and also being able to reflect on an event or an action

827
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:40,672
that someone might bring to you.

828
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,953
Like it's not, it has nothing to do with your character.

829
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,914
It could just, this is just a way for you to,

830
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:49,816
for your character to grow, I guess, in that sense.

831
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:50,916
Yeah.

832
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:53,757
Yeah, I would recommend that folks,

833
00:56:54,498 --> 00:57:00,020
one, like, in your hiring, change your hiring practices.

834
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:00,920
Yeah.

835
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,081
Like move to, like.

836
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,663
There are companies I've worked at that have requirements around diverse,

837
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,704
having a diverse slate of candidates before they were hot,

838
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:14,045
they will hire for a position. That's like a pretty,

839
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,566
from a lot of people's perspective, that's a pretty large step to take,

840
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:22,428
but I think it's an interesting way and a really effective way to drive,

841
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:27,790
to drive sort of more diverse teams. This is putting a little bit,

842
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,371
this is always like a little bit of a catch 22 because it's putting work on

843
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:31,991
people, but like,

844
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:42,745
Go into spaces where you're not the majority and listen.

845
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:48,269
Like, come down into the Black in Game Audio Discord, right?

846
00:57:48,689 --> 00:57:49,129
And listen.

847
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,431
And ask questions, right?

848
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:53,252
It's OK to ask questions.

849
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:57,776
And also, this is the putting work on people part,

850
00:57:57,816 --> 00:57:59,637
like, keep tapping.

851
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:05,830
Keep tapping people's networks when you're feeling like, oh, like I want a

852
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:09,393
diverse slate of people, but like, I don't have those people in my network.

853
00:58:10,014 --> 00:58:15,197
Keep reaching out and being like, Hey, you know, folks like just like, keep doing

854
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:17,239
that, it is putting work on other people.

855
00:58:17,279 --> 00:58:19,580
And that's always like a little bit of a trap, but.

856
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:19,641
Um.

857
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,742
Do you know the outcome is positive?

858
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:29,647
And I think it's, it's a great sort of muscle memory to build to like reach

859
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:35,392
outside your networks and try to tap into those adjacent networks, um, in order

860
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:40,476
to find, to sort of broaden searches, broaden the amount of connections that

861
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:43,098
you can make, um, that would be my advice.

862
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:48,416
Yeah, I know this is a horrible thing to bring up with only one minute left, but I'll try to go fast.

863
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:54,478
So the two things I wanted to bring up, number one, there is a group called the Composers Diversity Collective.

864
00:58:55,298 --> 00:59:09,321
You can literally go, I think, composersdiversitycollective.com or .org, and it's an easily searchable database list of all of this talent, of all different races, countries of origins, language, first languages and whatnot.

865
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:13,888
It's basically Hollywood's way of saying there's no excuse anymore.

866
00:59:13,928 --> 00:59:16,850
You can find us here or all over the world.

867
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:22,754
And the other thing I wanted to mention is that we really should rethink how we're looking

868
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:26,476
at entry-level jobs in this industry.

869
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:31,119
We really should rethink that because does it really make sense for an entry-level job

870
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:31,780
to require

871
00:59:32,279 --> 00:59:33,960
years of AAA experience?

872
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,901
Does it make sense to require any kind of a demo at all?

873
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:39,502
Because think about it, if they have a demo

874
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:41,922
and it's outstanding, chances are

875
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:45,484
it's someone who is able to afford all the greatest sample

876
00:59:45,524 --> 00:59:47,164
libraries, gear, whatnot.

877
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:51,306
Maybe they already have some form of an advanced education

878
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:52,006
in the field.

879
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:56,447
And you're kind of already kind of re-accentuating

880
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:58,768
whatever inequalities are already there.

881
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,529
So perhaps maybe look more into soft skills.

882
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:04,004
How teachable does this person seem?

883
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:05,747
How personable are they?

884
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:09,253
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

885
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:16,836
I think the point that the work that's being done at PolyArc, there are several articles

886
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:23,899
about how they've been, Kristen and Stephan have been adjusting their hiring processes

887
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:28,521
to make them more inclusive and to try to lower those technical and sort of monetary

888
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:30,001
barriers to entry.

889
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:34,443
It's really, really inspiring, something I've taken a lot of inspiration from.

890
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:39,258
um so yeah you'll get better employees that way you'll teach them your studio's methods

891
01:00:39,578 --> 01:00:45,061
and you've already guaranteed that they're going to be teachable people likable people yeah rather

892
01:00:45,101 --> 01:00:49,703
than just like well uh we're hiring for entry level and we can save a couple of bucks if we

893
01:00:49,743 --> 01:00:55,165
hire someone who's actually mid-level you know we have to kind of stop that process

894
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:00,242
John, did you have anything to add?

895
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,263
I do, I really do.

896
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,705
I know we're over, but I was gonna say, like,

897
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:06,527
the entry-level thing I think is so huge

898
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:08,408
because, like, you know, I, you know,

899
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:10,369
I went to the school that I could barely afford.

900
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:11,390
That's a whole other story.

901
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,372
But I went to the school that I could barely afford

902
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:14,873
and I came out of school and, like,

903
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:16,714
I could have made music for games,

904
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:18,955
but, like, there are so many.

905
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:23,983
people and you know I'm sure there are so many entry-level positions that would not have given

906
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:29,976
me a shot and it's like I was capable but it wasn't going to happen and honestly by the time like

907
01:01:30,964 --> 01:01:35,047
I am honestly questioning whether or not I could get an entry level position right now,

908
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:37,468
like sitting on this panel.

909
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:43,472
I'm like, could I, like, I know that's preposterous, but I don't feel that it's preposterous.

910
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:44,132
You know what I mean?

911
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:46,794
So like, it's ridiculous.

912
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:52,757
Just come on guys, like, come on.

913
01:01:53,137 --> 01:01:53,918
Okay, that's it.

914
01:01:55,194 --> 01:02:00,922
Awesome. Well, John, Will, Caleb, and Jasmine, thank you all so much for doing this panel.

915
01:02:00,982 --> 01:02:04,767
It is super appreciated, and I think it'll be a huge help to everyone out there. And

916
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,229
thank you to GDC for hosting us. Thank you, Akash.

917
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,932
Thank you, Akash. Thank you so much.

918
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:08,753
You're a great moderator.
