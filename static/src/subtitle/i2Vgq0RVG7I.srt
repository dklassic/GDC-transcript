1
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:15,606
Animation is not the answer. It's kind of a ridiculous, over-the-top, click-baity title, but that's what we're kind of going with here.

2
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:21,328
It's one of these things where, now over multiple animation boot camps and at the animation roundtables,

3
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:29,150
a lot of the conversations have been about animators themselves becoming a lot more technical, having more ownership of becoming technical.

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,790
And, uh...

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,693
We wanted to sort of touch on the next part of that step,

6
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:37,515
where if you do decide that as an animator,

7
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:42,099
you want to embrace having more ownership

8
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,421
on implementation of your animations in the game,

9
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:47,843
what sort of conversations is that gonna lead to?

10
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,667
What are some general personality types that you're going to run into as far as the other

11
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:57,432
developers and disciplines on the team that you need to sort of be aware of, right?

12
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:02,036
And how can we sort of maybe help get you past some of those initial speed bumps so

13
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:07,821
that you can get right into the fun of maybe the next level of implementation and get through

14
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:09,342
some of those growing pains?

15
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:09,662
But...

16
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:10,103
Thanks.

17
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,163
Bye.

18
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,460
That's pretty straightforward.

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,080
So we're going to play it up a little bit.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,301
What we're going to do is we're going

21
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:24,763
to have a steam panel of amazing engineers and animators

22
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:28,244
play some very specific roles that you

23
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:32,085
might run into when you have these conversations.

24
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:38,768
So first up, we're going to have the tech enthusiastic animator

25
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:39,468
Clay Mathews.

26
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:50,940
So, I'm Clay, I'm a senior animator at Volition.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,421
I've worked on Red Faction Guerrilla,

28
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:57,383
the Saints Row series, and Agents of Mayhem.

29
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:02,485
But my claim to fame, I guess,

30
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:06,207
is that I don't elbow drop animators

31
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:09,269
when they complain about not wanting to be technical.

32
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:10,269
Yeah, excellent.

33
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,831
All right, and next up, we're going to have Jeff Harwer.

34
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,969
our cynical animation programmer.

35
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:20,310
Thank you.

36
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,114
Hey everyone, Jeff Harware here.

37
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:28,577
I am a principal software engineer at Electronic Arts.

38
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,879
I've been there since 2001.

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,143
I worked on pretty much every EA Sports title in some fashion.

40
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,345
My claim to fame is...

41
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:43,529
Probably back in the day I was one of the first engineers working on our internal animation tool Ant.

42
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:50,732
And my other claim to fame is I've choked out two animators on this very stage at GDC boot camp in the past.

43
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:58,034
I'm currently a gameplay lead on UFC 3 and I've got an animation talk on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock. Check it out.

44
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:58,094
Yes.

45
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:05,777
Alright, next up on our panel is going to be the tech futurist, Paul McComas.

46
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:09,256
Hi, I'm Paul McComas, head of animation tech at EA.

47
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,358
I've worked on many, many sports titles just like Jeff.

48
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,420
I've worked on some non-sports titles too, like Battlefronts

49
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,441
and so on.

50
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:22,404
My claim to fame might be that I wrote a bug that was so

51
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:27,527
popular in the British tabloids, it was featured and

52
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,689
had over 2 million hits on YouTube.

53
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,669
And it was fantastic.

54
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,210
You can look at two soccer players kissing each other.

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,891
It's fabulous.

56
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:33,191
The dream.

57
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:33,471
The dream.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,923
And then we have our devil's advocate to all of these specific viewpoints, Mr. Cody Pleppel.

59
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:46,667
Hello, my name is Cody Pleppel. I'm a gameplay programmer at Blizzard Entertainment and my

60
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:52,510
claim to fame is that I've helped build and design animation systems for Heroes of the Storm

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,792
and generally stop animators from getting too technical, but we'll talk about that.

62
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:06,129
All right, and then I will be playing in this the role of the unsure animator who is breaking

63
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,091
out into tech for the first time.

64
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:08,771
I'm Mike Jungbluth.

65
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:11,414
I'm a senior animator at BioWare.

66
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:11,914
All right, so...

67
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,735
All right, so let's get it started.

68
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,395
The design of the game has been said

69
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:23,776
that we need to have better melee combat.

70
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,696
So, as an animator, I guess that should mean

71
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:28,237
that all I'm gonna do is just care

72
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:32,138
and spend all my time about making some really sweet,

73
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,458
synced interactions between two characters,

74
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,599
and that's it, right?

75
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,019
All I need to do is just do some of those

76
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,480
sweet takedown animations like we saw

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,960
in the Mordor talk, right?

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,160
Clay, tell me I'm right.

79
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,079
You're part of the way there, right?

80
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,120
The end goal for the system is a, you know,

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,401
is a, you know, it's a melee system, right?

82
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,802
You're talking about making the pieces

83
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,123
that go into that system.

84
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:03,485
So, if we think about it as a, you know, as a puzzle,

85
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,745
you know, each of the pieces has to, you know,

86
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,706
has to fit together in the right way,

87
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:08,887
a very precise way, right?

88
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,567
So if you become more technical,

89
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,648
you can build that, you know,

90
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,751
complete that puzzle on your own.

91
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,853
And once you have those skills,

92
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,754
if your tool set allows for it,

93
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:26,956
you can be completing all kinds of puzzles, man.

94
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:30,517
And we don't, we won't need the rest of these guys.

95
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:31,878
It can just be me and you.

96
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,039
We can make our own game.

97
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:34,259
Yeah.

98
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,080
With hookers and blackjack and you know.

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,281
I like blackjack.

100
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:42,123
So yeah, just, you know, let's, you know,

101
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:47,240
Getting those skills to complete your own puzzles

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,740
is so powerful, and you want that.

103
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,761
Sweet, so then I don't have to deal with programmers.

104
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,821
Done, okay, cool.

105
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:55,822
Okay, I don't agree with anything you said.

106
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,203
I think it's cute that you're trying to learn programming

107
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:01,303
and everything, but what I'd really like you to do

108
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:05,204
is go off and build some previs work for us.

109
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,225
Show us how this could really look good

110
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,206
in the best case scenario,

111
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,526
and then we'll just throw that work away.

112
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:15,496
And we'll come up with a design that kind of constrains your animations,

113
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,077
tell you exactly what you need to do,

114
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,940
and then you'll just start pumping out assets for us exactly as we ask you to.

115
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,141
You can learn tech stuff on the side.

116
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:27,742
I think that'd be great for your own personal development.

117
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,243
But we're building a AAA title here.

118
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:35,066
If we're going to sell millions of copies based solely on this brand new Melee system,

119
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:39,268
we can't have a hobbyist building the architecture for it.

120
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:39,468
Sorry.

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,342
Okay, so just keep doing what I've been doing for years,

122
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:44,802
but I still get to make a super sweet,

123
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:46,663
like, pre-viz animation.

124
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:50,966
So, Clay's wrong, you're right.

125
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,888
So, I kind of like what Clay's saying,

126
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,069
and I kind of like what Jeff's saying,

127
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:58,430
but I don't like either of these approaches.

128
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,931
So, what I'm gonna say to you is,

129
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,692
we're gonna, I read about this amazing stuff, okay,

130
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,693
and we're gonna make this amazing black box thing.

131
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,935
You're not gonna get it for about two weeks before ship.

132
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:10,876
Okay? And what you're going to do is you're going to feed in all of these animations,

133
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,577
and it's just going to magically do everything you need for it.

134
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:17,179
And you're like, how do I control this? Well, I'm going to give you two dials.

135
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:21,001
I'm going to give you dial one, it's going to do something, I'm not sure exactly what that dial does,

136
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:24,982
and dial two is going to do something else, and they might fight each other, they might not, who knows.

137
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:29,844
And with that, you're going to be able to take all this amazing content that you've created,

138
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:33,766
and it's going to output the most amazing melee system, 90% of the time.

139
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:35,803
That's an A.

140
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:36,984
Pretty good, it's gonna be pretty good

141
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:39,064
and you're gonna be able to ship a game with it.

142
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:42,026
Sweet, all right, so then I just need to make

143
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:46,947
some animations the way I wanna make them,

144
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:49,448
put them into your thing,

145
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,149
don't need to do extra learning by you,

146
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,950
don't have to keep doing the same old thing that you do.

147
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,811
I like it, right?

148
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,772
This is what we're doing.

149
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:57,852
No.

150
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,133
I don't even know what Clay's talking about.

151
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:00,653
Black box.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,441
says enough I think right there, there's two knobs.

153
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,462
I think the right approach here maybe is to listen

154
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:08,543
to none of these people and kind of choose the approach

155
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:09,564
that fits what you're trying to do.

156
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,665
Maybe a little bit of both, maybe a sprinkling of both.

157
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:12,905
Maybe some new tech, maybe a little bit

158
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:15,707
of handcrafted animation, maybe some new systems

159
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,188
that'll make the handcrafted animation shine.

160
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:19,849
Maybe a collaborative approach that could,

161
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,330
I mean, this was the hot take, I haven't thought about it.

162
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:28,574
Okay, all right, so let me see if I can sort of figure this stuff out then.

163
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:38,119
So all right, if I am going to care more about the melee system as a whole in some way, kind

164
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,821
of like what you're saying, you didn't call me an imbecile, right?

165
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:48,805
Then I guess really what I need to think about is, all right, let's...

166
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,883
I guess all the alignment, orientation, and timing.

167
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,483
Those are like animation things.

168
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,464
So maybe all of that stuff should then be owned

169
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:59,245
and implemented solely by me.

170
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,605
That you still get to do some stuff,

171
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,206
but maybe that's the right stuff, right?

172
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:05,427
Like that should just all be, that's us.

173
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,467
That's the role of animator.

174
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,488
We don't need programmers for that.

175
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:12,129
As an animator, as an artist, you wanna own everything.

176
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:15,271
It can be exactly the vision you have for it

177
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,732
if you learn the tools and how to set it up on your own.

178
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,152
Right?

179
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:19,692
All right.

180
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,518
That's the dream.

181
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:24,480
I want to build the system that I want to build.

182
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,021
That's, and if I have the skill set to do that,

183
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:29,362
why do I need to talk to these other people?

184
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,883
This is my system.

185
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:34,505
I'm the only one required to have input on this, right?

186
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,366
But like how many years into development

187
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,327
do you start animating?

188
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,548
Am I right?

189
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,149
Because like, that's crazy.

190
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:41,890
Okay, one more.

191
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,711
Oh God, you guys are confusing me.

192
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:44,971
Jeff.

193
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:49,834
Yeah, so, okay, here's the deal.

194
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,771
We have a team of, what, 10 engineers that all went to school

195
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:56,952
to work on these complex problems, the architecture and stuff,

196
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,573
and we're currently bottlenecked on animation.

197
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:03,815
I don't want you wasting your time on anything that's not involving animation.

198
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:07,336
Okay? You've got a whole team of people that are experts on this stuff.

199
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:10,958
We're going to build the architecture and we'll tell you exactly what we need from you.

200
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,379
We are a little tight in terms of, like, manpower,

201
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:19,641
so we are also going to need you to do a lot of data entry on things that kind of...

202
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,642
ties into animation a little bit,

203
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,683
but isn't really animating.

204
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,846
And we're gonna give you some really, really bad pipelines

205
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,607
and UIs in order to do that stuff.

206
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,490
And we're not really gonna explain to you how it works.

207
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,652
We're just gonna tell you exactly what you need to do.

208
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,234
And you're gonna have to do it over and over and over again,

209
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,695
like a thousand times.

210
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,356
And design is gonna change their mind,

211
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,258
like probably two or three times throughout production.

212
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,819
We'll rewrite these pipelines,

213
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,021
but we do not have the time to build UIs

214
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:47,144
or animator-friendly workflows for any of this stuff.

215
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:53,369
But we really, really appreciate the fact that you will take on these data entry tasks,

216
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:58,013
learn these pipelines by yourself and not bother us because we're busy building the important stuff.

217
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:05,348
Mike, aren't you sick and tired of these guys who made these games in the same ways and

218
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,809
they're sort of stuck in their box and they don't want to think anything outside of it

219
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,510
and they're like, you know, we have to do it this way because that's the way I shipped

220
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,730
the game with before.

221
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,992
We can't go anything further because, you know, this isn't going to work and that's

222
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:16,892
not going to work.

223
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,593
Surely you want to take a leap of faith here and do something a little more pushing the

224
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:21,114
boundary.

225
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:21,274
Yeah.

226
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:21,574
Yeah.

227
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:21,754
Yeah.

228
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:21,954
Yeah.

229
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:22,194
Okay.

230
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:27,396
So why don't you come and we'll work together and we'll make something that's going to

231
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,797
work most of the time.

232
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,980
I like 90% of the time.

233
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,700
It works 100% of the time.

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,220
You academic types are all the same.

235
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,021
You release some sort of tech demo

236
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,861
that gets the public all excited and my managers all excited.

237
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:42,122
And they're like, hey, let's do this machine learning thing

238
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:42,982
for the next project.

239
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:45,363
And it never works in practice.

240
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,123
You just give us these cool black boxes

241
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,883
that we have no idea how to use.

242
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,464
We've got to stick with the traditional stuff that

243
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:53,344
works until someone's put in the effort to prove

244
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:54,645
this stuff out in the real world.

245
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:55,805
And I don't want to be that person.

246
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,005
I don't want to be your lab rat.

247
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,472
All right, Cody, I'm like really confused at the role of animator versus programmer.

248
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,173
Can you tell me how all these guys are wrong?

249
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,673
Uh, yeah.

250
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:09,674
We should work together and flex our skill sets.

251
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:14,215
Like, you could push the boundaries of animation in awesome and interesting ways

252
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,896
without going wholesale and jumping into like a pit of knives,

253
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:20,477
which is what a black box that makes 90% of the animations procedurally is, right?

254
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,378
Like, what a nightmare.

255
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,918
But you don't also have to like sit in a corner and be the programmer

256
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,279
and the animator and the artist and the producer.

257
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,099
Like, let's...

258
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,899
I'm better at programming.

259
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:29,480
This is no offense.

260
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,060
It's all I ever do.

261
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,980
Let's work together.

262
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,601
Let's build it together.

263
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,621
I'll build a little bit of a box.

264
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,382
You can have a little bit more of the box and we'll make an

265
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,403
awesome animation going forward.

266
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:41,825
You don't have to do any of these single, like crazy one note.

267
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,406
Like they're, you get what I'm saying?

268
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:43,466
I do.

269
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,066
So, all right.

270
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,668
So I guess then if I'm going to do a little bit more programming work, then you guys

271
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,368
are going to learn a little more animation work.

272
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,944
I mean, I kind of have to to help build you the cool things you need to animate, right?

273
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,348
Okay, you know, that makes sense.

274
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:55,911
Alright, so if I'm gonna...

275
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:56,332
Okay.

276
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:57,415
Alright.

277
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:58,256
Okay.

278
00:12:58,256 --> 00:12:58,477
So.

279
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,078
Uh...

280
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,577
Then, I guess if we're going to start building stuff,

281
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,458
and we're going to start taking a little bit more ownership

282
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,078
of this stuff, but we're not going to own everything

283
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,759
because we're going to work together, right?

284
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,940
Then I guess we just focus on making that current design

285
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,340
that we get from the designers.

286
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,901
And whatever we come up with right off the bat,

287
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,121
we just do that, and it's done.

288
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,062
And then we can just get back to animating, right?

289
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:26,382
That's it.

290
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:27,342
That's all we got to do.

291
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:28,882
We just make that quick little thing, and then we're good.

292
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:31,116
Uh, no.

293
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,677
God damn it.

294
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:37,860
Um, you know, there's, you know, any, any process is iterative, right?

295
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:48,066
But you know, having a, owning the vision is, and understanding the vision is critical

296
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:54,029
to, to, you know, ensuring that it gets, you know, completed in the right way.

297
00:13:55,533 --> 00:14:00,737
a singular person can, if a singular person can own and implement that vision, then you

298
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:08,705
know it's going to, you know, you know it's going to be the one that was originally proposed,

299
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:19,154
right? Whoever wanted the melee system had a vision for it. If they trust you, the guy

300
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:19,995
that's setting it up.

301
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,714
and you can own it, and you can be the end-all be-all for that system,

302
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:24,895
then why not go for that?

303
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,778
I'll tell you why not to go for that.

304
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,417
I've seen this happen too many times.

305
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:40,299
A tech-happy animator starts building some fancy layering stuff on top of his base animations

306
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:43,480
and it makes the animation look more organic and the transitions look smoother and everyone's

307
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,642
thrilled about it and then he starts to get his tendrils into other things that start

308
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:52,503
to affect gameplay and introduce a whole bunch of bugs into the systems and come finally,

309
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,484
who do you think they ask to fix those problems?

310
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,744
They come to the engineers.

311
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:02,025
The animators are off doing, I don't know what, smoking weed up on the roof or something.

312
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:06,848
While the engineers are trying to figure out these bugs, and then we're exposed to these huge

313
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:11,892
spaghetti mess of visual programming graphs that I have no idea what's going on. I come to you and

314
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:16,355
ask you what this is all about, and you wrote it three months ago and you have absolutely no idea

315
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:19,958
how it works anymore, and it's on me to read through this stuff and trying to figure out

316
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,419
what the hell is going on. I don't want that to happen ever again.

317
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,662
Designers change their mind all the time.

318
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,043
I'm not going to trust them either.

319
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:27,845
I'm just going to build what I think

320
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,747
is the best interpretation of what the designers are asking

321
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:33,810
for that covers my bases when they do change their mind.

322
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,452
And you're just going to do what I ask you to.

323
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:40,316
OK, these guys are never going to work together, Paul.

324
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:43,700
So you've had some stuff that's out there that doesn't.

325
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:48,270
tell me there's some future solution that means these guys can stop

326
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,550
bellyaching about whatever they're doing and you'll save us.

327
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,871
I think what we're going to do is we're going to go rent out a mocap space and we're just going to

328
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,152
organically just capture everything we think we might want.

329
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:59,893
And we're not going to do it in a sort of systemic way, we're just going to sort of

330
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:03,113
organically capture all the combat that we want in the system.

331
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:06,694
And we're just going to rely on the thing to learn what is good.

332
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:11,295
Okay, so I got a couple of... how much is a lot?

333
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:11,535
Um...

334
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,647
How long is a piece of string?

335
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:14,227
Like, you know...

336
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:14,587
Okay.

337
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:19,889
I mean, it's going to be your job to clean up all the data, but, you know...

338
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:20,830
It's what we do now.

339
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,892
Yeah, and eventually we'll have machines to do that for you as well.

340
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:29,473
So you're cool to back up to smoke and weed on the roof.

341
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:35,835
I am legitimately astounded right now

342
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:40,757
at the nightmare fuel this sounds like.

343
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,658
I don't even know how to go at this.

344
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:45,899
I've been burned by animators too, and by designers,

345
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,000
and I've burned them subsequently.

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,241
I was like, here's some sweet turning tech,

347
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,241
and then it didn't turn.

348
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,902
I've learned that lesson, right?

349
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,823
But I think that the takeaway here is that,

350
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:55,445
yeah, don't go sit in a corner ever.

351
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:58,386
I think my message is gonna be one note the whole time.

352
00:16:58,386 --> 00:16:59,427
Why would you go and do this alone?

353
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:01,628
We're working as a team, we can build things as a team,

354
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:04,009
and I think better off as a team.

355
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,270
Like, vision holders and notaries don't really have a place

356
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,372
in making collaborative designs and collaborative art.

357
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,032
Like, what are you, this is crazy.

358
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:11,653
You guys are like, terrified of everything.

359
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,958
Well, here's, I'll tell you what I'm terrified of, right?

360
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,522
What I'm, what I'm completely and utterly terrified of is,

361
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:26,430
how the hell am I supposed to balance being like a traditional aesthetics focused animator

362
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,674
who cares about like that visual quality?

363
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:33,299
We care about the performance of the character.

364
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,123
And now I'm having to learn about some form of owning

365
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,586
all the things, some form of something,

366
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,768
but nothing and smoking weed.

367
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,870
I gotta get good at that now.

368
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,212
You're talking about like lengths of string.

369
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:52,835
Guys, like how do I balance becoming more technical

370
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:57,159
while all the stuff and why even like, what the hell?

371
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:01,219
How much of it do you want to own,

372
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:02,179
is what it comes down to, right?

373
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:06,800
Like, you were tasked with building a melee system, right?

374
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,600
You can offer the assets to a certain point,

375
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,581
but when you start plugging them in,

376
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,621
if it's your job to set them up,

377
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,402
and you find out that the pieces don't fit,

378
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,822
then you're gonna have to go back and revise them

379
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:19,022
so that they do fit, right?

380
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,523
And then you have to deal with design iteration,

381
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:23,283
with timing changes, all that fun stuff.

382
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,804
You're gonna pick up the knowledge

383
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,824
whether you want to or not.

384
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,103
if it's required of you to set the system up.

385
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:37,225
So why not just take it a little bit further

386
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,867
and then just cut out the middleman

387
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,467
in terms of iteration and timing

388
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,808
and just do it all yourself?

389
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:47,591
Okay, so learn just enough so that I can keep applying

390
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:50,132
the traditional stuff that I know in game.

391
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:53,314
You can't lose sight of the end goal, right?

392
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,795
The end goal is the system.

393
00:18:56,377 --> 00:19:03,445
Like the pieces you build are part of it, but in the end it's, you know, you're delivering a system.

394
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:03,725
Okay.

395
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:10,173
I think the traditional aesthetics is the most important part of your job, and that's why you were hired,

396
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:12,755
was to make sure that the game looks really, really good.

397
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:16,360
And we're going to put a lot of constraints on you in that effort.

398
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,003
And if you're trying to figure out where you want this technical development to focus on,

399
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:30,147
make sure that it's always driving forward those traditional aesthetics in whatever way you feel is necessary.

400
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:37,090
DCC tools that help your effort out, automation tools that help get around the bad pipelines that we're providing you.

401
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,332
Just make sure your focus is always on those traditional aesthetics.

402
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:41,492
Don't get distracted by...

403
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:48,775
building gameplay mechanics and feeding AI different parameters so it looks smarter and all that kind of stuff,

404
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:53,396
or control mechanics, don't worry about any of that stuff,

405
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:57,678
just focus on trying to get the aesthetics to the best place that they can be,

406
00:19:57,678 --> 00:20:02,439
and in whatever ways learning technology will further that goal, by all means pursue that.

407
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:05,760
Okay, so I have a question then, because I'm trying to take a page from Cody,

408
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,362
because he's the only one that I feel like is not a rage cannon right now.

409
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,108
Where do you need me more as an engineer?

410
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:18,051
Helping implement or on giving you a lot of assets?

411
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,013
Most of the time it's giving me assets.

412
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:25,257
But the one place where your skill sets can really help

413
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,059
is evaluating the game and understanding

414
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,080
when it doesn't look good.

415
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,969
and trying to figure out why it doesn't look good

416
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,029
and what part of the implementation is causing that.

417
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,730
Because that's a part that the traditional technical people

418
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,210
may not have an eye for.

419
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,631
And they may be completely blind to it

420
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:42,671
because they've been staring at it for so long

421
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:45,752
and they're invested in the technical solution.

422
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:47,032
So I want you to look at the game

423
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,292
and understand where it doesn't look good

424
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,093
and then try and figure out why it doesn't look good.

425
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,173
That's another really, really good use

426
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,493
for your technical skills.

427
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:57,234
Okay, so then how am I gonna balance

428
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:00,885
art and tech with the crazy stuff you're talking about.

429
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:05,367
So what I would like from Animator is to embrace technology.

430
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,368
It is not going to take over your job.

431
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:10,249
You are going to be, instead of creating one creature,

432
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,029
you're going to be creating ten creatures.

433
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:15,351
You're going to have a multiplicative effect on your output.

434
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:19,392
But you can't do that if you're worried just about...

435
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:24,255
the specific posing of one particular finger on one key frame of one animation.

436
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:26,356
You've got to start thinking more holistically.

437
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:30,439
So I'd like you to start really understanding the technology and

438
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:34,241
really understanding what's going wrong when it's not doing the right thing.

439
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:39,904
Really figuring out how I can communicate to the engineer

440
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:43,607
how to make this technology obey the 12 principles of the animation.

441
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:47,589
How to make it feel like an animation, not just a sequence of poses.

442
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:51,485
Okay, it feels like they're starting to come around a little bit, Cody.

443
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:53,346
Yeah, I feel like I don't have a lot more to say here,

444
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,507
other than like, I think there's a balance to strike

445
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:57,488
where you get to own some of that implementation

446
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,189
because at the end of the day, like, you have the vision

447
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,091
for what that animation's gonna look like.

448
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:01,351
I don't.

449
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:03,852
Like, as an engineer building the system for you,

450
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:05,634
I am gonna look at it for 14 hours a day and be like,

451
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,235
it looks like those quaternions are doing their...

452
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:09,115
they're quaternion and then I'm gonna move on.

453
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:11,736
But if you're like, wow, that arm looks terrible

454
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:12,776
and I don't see that, tell me,

455
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:13,997
so then we can work together to make it.

456
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:16,017
Or conversely, if we make a cool system,

457
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,238
you get to have a hand in making it too.

458
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:18,898
But there's a balance to strike

459
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:21,839
and I think we're convincing some of the engineering people

460
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,139
to kinda get on the same page.

461
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:23,400
Okay.

462
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:28,922
All right, so then what I want to do, because I feel like we're starting to get to a point where we're

463
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:33,384
understanding, and I'm a little less lost when I'm dealing with some of you guys,

464
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:38,686
that, like, what's your closing argument? What is it that you feel like you need to say to me,

465
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:42,287
the animator that's starting down this technical path?

466
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:49,649
I think you need to keep your eye on the prize, you know, don't lose sight of the end goal.

467
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:53,514
you started out by saying,

468
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:55,955
hey, I need to make a melee system

469
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,415
and your first step in the process was,

470
00:22:58,415 --> 00:23:01,096
I'll spend all my time making the pieces, right?

471
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,417
You know, that's a, you know,

472
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,818
can't see the forest for the trees kind of thing

473
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,379
where you're going too low level with it.

474
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:15,101
You know, make sure that those pieces, you know,

475
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:19,682
are in service to the vision, you know, to the goal.

476
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:23,528
just don't lose sight of the goal.

477
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:23,628
Cool.

478
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:29,190
For me, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

479
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,211
And complexity will sneak up on you.

480
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,393
I've seen it happen before.

481
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,793
Something that looks like it's a simple problem

482
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:42,014
to solve with some sort of scripting solution,

483
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:44,695
very, very slowly gets more and more complex.

484
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:50,100
So just be aware of that fact when you start dipping your toe into this kind of stuff.

485
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:57,124
If it feels like it's getting out of hand, you don't think you can control the system yourself anymore,

486
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:59,905
or it's feeling like this thing isn't going to scale,

487
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:04,688
I'm starting to get bogged down with trying to debug this thing because the debugging tools aren't very good,

488
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:10,531
whatever it is, don't feel that you have to take that on yourself

489
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:14,593
and continue to build on that poor framework and increase the complexity.

490
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:18,639
Go to someone whose job is to manage that complexity

491
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,500
and say, hey look, this is getting too big.

492
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,461
I think we need to re-implement this in a different way.

493
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,561
Is that something that I can do

494
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,322
or is that something that you should be doing?

495
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:28,882
And just make sure that you're aware of that stuff.

496
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,803
Don't go down this path and get lost in a sea of complexity

497
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,904
that you're not quite ready to handle yet.

498
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:34,044
Cool.

499
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,717
I guess I would say that if you're going too far and you're like,

500
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:43,220
I made this system, now I just need to add 12,000 more assets for it in order to be complete,

501
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,062
maybe you've gone down a path that's a little too structured.

502
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:48,863
And if the engineer is saying to you, we have to do this in this exact way,

503
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,625
and we've got to do this with this much timing and this thing,

504
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,166
maybe that's a little too structured.

505
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:57,229
So you've got to work with the engineer and work with your own wisdom to say like, hey,

506
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,871
maybe we can create a system that could do this dynamically.

507
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:02,973
Maybe there's a way that we could leverage both parts to create something

508
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:04,514
that could be done a little more procedurally.

509
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:07,259
Maybe I don't need to make slope animations for 12,000 different creatures.

510
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,285
Maybe that's not a good idea in the use of my time.

511
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:11,267
Cool.

512
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,997
I mean, I see the irony now in having this talk

513
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,657
about soft skills versus becoming a more technical animator,

514
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:19,818
but it really is about that, right?

515
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,118
I agree with what they're saying.

516
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:24,079
I want to, as an engineer, I want to enable you

517
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,919
to make better and cooler art,

518
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,199
and that might mean giving you more control

519
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,059
or not giving you more control

520
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,019
or making it more procedural.

521
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,740
I don't actually know the right answer to that question.

522
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,960
It's so context-dependent, but the key takeaway

523
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,660
is collaborate, talk to people.

524
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,101
If you can't do that, let's solve that problem,

525
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,921
and that's a totally separate issue, right?

526
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:40,541
But let's work toward making you more technical as a team.

527
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,381
I think that's the takeaway.

528
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:49,311
for me. All right. So we have a couple minutes left. And so what we wanted to do was offer

529
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:54,798
up the chance for anyone out in the audience to ask a question of our panel. You have two

530
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,364
options. One, you can ask them to answer earnestly as they essentially just did.

531
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:05,355
or if you feel like you've been having an argument with somebody and you want that extreme counterpoint,

532
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:10,919
you can specifically ask your question to one of their personas, and they will give you that answer.

533
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,783
All right? So anyone who has questions and wants to do that, come on up to the mics.

534
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:19,426
Also, who on the panel, if these are the type of conversations you're interested in having,

535
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:25,511
and having more of, all of these guys are fantastic people that will help train you

536
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:29,934
up and are excited about doing these types of things more and more.

537
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:34,097
Who all up here is hiring right now for animators or animation programmers?

538
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,639
All right, so if you're interested in this type of stuff,

539
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,401
talk to Cody, talk to myself, talk to Clay,

540
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,502
talk to Paul and Jeff, right?

541
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,824
Like, this is something where a lot more conversations

542
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,646
need to happen and are happening,

543
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:51,628
and hopefully this starts you to get a little bit idea

544
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:54,269
of where it can go and what you might encounter.

545
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:55,750
So who's got some questions for our panel?

546
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,632
Come on, I wanna hear Jeff say some more inflammatory things.

547
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:12,716
Hello. I guess you can answer this. I don't know. I kind of want to see you guys get spicy,

548
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:19,221
but I also earnestly want to know if you see whether or not there is a world where an animator

549
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:28,049
could be strictly like fine art animator versus like is life now animators must be technical

550
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,090
or can you just focus on the art?

551
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,511
I feel like.

552
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:37,166
Outsourcers get a chance to focus just on the art

553
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:41,270
if they stay within the metrics that they're provided.

554
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,554
But I'm assuming most of you people want to be

555
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,856
more focused developers as opposed to outsourcers.

556
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:53,461
Focusing on the art is great,

557
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:57,044
especially in like cinematics and areas where

558
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:01,307
there's no sort of active input.

559
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,028
Anytime you layer input with control,

560
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,349
concessions have to be made, right?

561
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:12,072
You can make a bunch of really awesome puzzle pieces,

562
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:13,133
but if you've got...

563
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:17,016
I've got a puzzle piece for the Avengers

564
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:21,619
and a puzzle piece for Dora the Explorer.

565
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,560
They don't fit together, right?

566
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,721
Changes have to be made to ensure

567
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:26,862
that those two things go together.

568
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,533
Sure, there's going to be some sacrifices, right?

569
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:38,137
There are metrics and technical details

570
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:40,618
of asset authoring that are critical

571
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:46,022
to ensuring that it functions well together.

572
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:51,205
Pure art, I think there are opportunities

573
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,547
in terms of gameplay animation.

574
00:28:55,207 --> 00:29:00,448
One of the biggest ones we get for kids coming out of school

575
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,890
is they have to sacrifice anticipation, right?

576
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,490
It's one of the first things that go

577
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,092
in terms of gameplay feel, but yes and no.

578
00:29:10,092 --> 00:29:13,533
Got another question.

579
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,714
You want the genuine or spicy?

580
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:16,194
Genuine.

581
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:16,414
Okay.

582
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:19,875
So you were talking before about having artists

583
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,196
meet up with engineers and I'll learn a little bit

584
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,997
what you do, you learn a little bit what I do.

585
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:32,790
I've been in those conversations and I've learned what they do, but they don't reciprocate

586
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,090
that.

587
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,191
How do you teach people how to learn in that sense?

588
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:39,293
Or to accept what you're trying to teach them?

589
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:40,954
We might want to plug...

590
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:43,175
When is...

591
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,755
No, who's doing the...

592
00:29:48,903 --> 00:29:53,527
Yeah, so at 3.30 we've got one about teaching your team to fish and communication and all that stuff.

593
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,969
So I don't want to step on your toes, but we do have something coming for that.

594
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:57,290
Possibly, yes.

595
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,772
But I still want to hear your guys' opinions.

596
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:03,355
Well, so for me, when I got into the industry,

597
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:05,557
the first thing I was tasked to do was help build animations out for...

598
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,217
or somebody who turned into a dragon.

599
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:11,101
And they were like, hey, so it doesn't really do this thing that you needed to do.

600
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,743
And it was all Greek. I was like, cool, yeah, totally, I'm on that, man.

601
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:17,966
And I went back to my desk and was like, I'm not on this. I'm very concerned.

602
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,449
So, like, for me, I think I'm fortunate that I had to go back to the animator and be like,

603
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,551
look, I have no idea what you're talking about. Can we step through really slowly? I know.

604
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,653
dumb Cody, but we're gonna get there.

605
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:28,875
And I think that was also a factor of production.

606
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,898
Like I talked to their lead, or I talked to their producer

607
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,359
and was like, I need time to sit down and learn.

608
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,181
Like that's part of my job.

609
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,363
So, it sounds really rough to say,

610
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,124
but that's a structural, institutional thing.

611
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:41,006
Make the case for it, because learning that stuff

612
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,908
is invaluable for your studio continuing.

613
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:43,488
It's awesome.

614
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:51,315
It's, as everyone talks about the animator who wants to focus on their art and doesn't want to get technical,

615
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:53,216
but the flip side is equally true.

616
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:56,616
You've got engineers that just want to focus on pure engineering,

617
00:30:56,616 --> 00:31:02,598
and they don't take the time to understand the aesthetics and the importance of, like,

618
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:05,319
responsiveness and feel and gameplay balance and all that kind of stuff.

619
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,139
And the most...

620
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:12,361
The most valuable members of your team on your engineering team are going to be the ones that do appreciate the aesthetics of animation

621
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,582
and the ones that do understand the nuance of gameplay,

622
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:21,625
even if it's just at a surface level and are able to apply that understanding to their work.

623
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:25,346
Even if they're not the ones responsible for making everything look right,

624
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:28,167
if they have an understanding of what does or doesn't look right.

625
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:32,371
they can spot problems quicker and respond to them quicker

626
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:37,937
before it gets out and it's a lot more difficult to draw that stuff back in.

627
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,980
I believe it applies to every discipline in gaming.

628
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,922
How you get people there, I don't know,

629
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:46,225
but I think it's one of the most important things in this industry

630
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:49,128
is having that cross-pollination between all the disciplines

631
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:52,571
and at least having an understanding of it in every single discipline.

632
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,346
Yeah, I got a tip for you.

633
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,907
So if you're trying to get an engineer to help you do

634
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:59,529
something better, what I would recommend to you is book a

635
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,070
meeting with the engineer.

636
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,392
Get him to sit down with you at your desk and go through

637
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:05,253
your workflow.

638
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:07,855
Make him really understand what it is that you're doing

639
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:08,635
day to day.

640
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,617
And immediately, because the engineer is going to get

641
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:12,018
frustrated, he's like, this is a waste of time.

642
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:12,718
I've got to do this.

643
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:14,980
And he'll be thinking, oh, I could do this to improve this.

644
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,380
I could do this to improve that.

645
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,742
And it's like you'll come up with tangible items about how

646
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,123
you could improve your workflow.

647
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,585
And the engineer will see it, because he'll experience that.

648
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,345
pain face to face.

649
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,625
All right, I know we're technically out of time,

650
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,966
but Christian has a sly smile on his face,

651
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,726
and I feel like he wants a spicy one,

652
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,547
and I want one more spicy to end us off.

653
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:33,167
Thank you.

654
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:33,447
Sure.

655
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:34,667
Don't let me down, Christian.

656
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,367
I was gonna ask for a genuine one,

657
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,028
but, yeah, we'll go with spicy, that's fine.

658
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:42,109
As for Paul, so, I'm an animator,

659
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:44,709
I wanna keep embracing my animation roots,

660
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,789
and I also want control,

661
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,490
but I also wanna embrace the future.

662
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,490
How are you gonna help me with that?

663
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,790
I need more than two dials.

664
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:53,928
I could give you three dogs.

665
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:56,480
Can you start spicy and then end sweet?

666
00:32:58,925 --> 00:32:59,605
Start spicy.

667
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,646
Yeah, so I'm with you, buddy.

668
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,806
I want to create the best animation system

669
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,867
that we have available.

670
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,507
In fact, I want to create the best system that's

671
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:07,827
not even available.

672
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,108
And we're going to work together,

673
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,909
and we're going to see some amazing stuff.

674
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,450
And it's going to look and sound really impressive,

675
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,150
and then we're going to choose little snippets of it,

676
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,110
and we're going to demo that.

677
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,431
And then we're going to build a whole feature

678
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,132
set around this thing, and we're going

679
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,392
to ignore these little problems that you see.

680
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:26,313
And you'll be like, but I need to do this in this situation.

681
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:26,973
And I'm going to tell you.

682
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:34,493
So, to be fair, coming out of character a little bit,

683
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:38,315
it is very difficult to balance making a complex system

684
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,337
easy to understand and controllable.

685
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:42,678
It's basically like control plus complexity.

686
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,941
they're very difficult to marry in a nice way

687
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:51,381
that it's a simple and easy to get the result you want.

688
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:54,842
So I think it's always just about this iterative loop

689
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:55,922
of us constantly trying to get better

690
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:58,883
and working with the animator to see how that workflow is

691
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,704
and to see what the shortcomings are,

692
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,524
and then trying to really make a system

693
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:06,165
that isn't going to be so problematic

694
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:07,565
for your particular game type.

695
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:10,026
So sometimes the system might work really well,

696
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:12,086
but it's not gonna be for the right,

697
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,627
for a particular style of game.

698
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:18,134
So we can agree that the animation, whatever happens, is going to look amazing?

699
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:18,354
Yes.

700
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:18,854
So, okay, cool.

701
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:26,019
So that basically means that when any animation awards and everything come around, then the

702
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:27,200
animator gets the credit?

703
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,921
I think the mo-cap artist does, right?

704
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:28,961
Oh.

705
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:32,423
All right, all right, that was perfect.

706
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:33,204
We gotta go.

707
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,285
Thanks to the panel.
