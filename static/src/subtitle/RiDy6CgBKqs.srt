1
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,212
I am Derek. And I made a little freeware PC game called

2
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,912
Spelunky and it turned into a much bigger XBLA game by the

3
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:20,232
same name.

4
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,623
And when I think about how that happened, how I started with

5
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:41,924
this tiny little game and how it became something so much bigger,

6
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:46,165
I'm still pretty amazed. It still feels pretty incredible.

7
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,066
But in this talk we're going to try to make some sense of it.

8
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:55,389
So I started working on Spelunky pretty soon after I finished

9
00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,991
Aquaria with Alakaloka. And that was a game that we released on

10
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:01,591
December 2007.

11
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:06,775
And it was, the project took us over two years,

12
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:12,038
and it was a really intense and difficult development

13
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:14,300
as I think Alec would attest to also.

14
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,242
It was about as stressful as it was wonderful.

15
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:19,763
So after that, I really wanted to work

16
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:20,604
on something a lot lighter,

17
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:23,806
something small and kind of fluffy.

18
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:26,788
And it's kind of ironic because Spelunky's now

19
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,509
turned into a bit of a monster itself.

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,571
But when I think about it,

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,581
with all of my big projects, and those are Eternal Daughter,

22
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:40,342
Aquaria, and Spelunky XBLA, those games all took at least

23
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:43,863
two years to make. Between all those projects, I always made a

24
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,464
lot of small games and released them. And when I think about it,

25
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:52,125
those small games always led to the bigger ones, whether

26
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:56,286
indirectly or directly. So, for example, with I'm OK, working on

27
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:59,746
that is how I met Alec, and that eventually led to Aquaria. And

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,947
all the small games that I made before Eternal Daughter,

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,810
you know, they got progressively bigger and they gave me the

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,992
confidence to do a project of that magnitude. Spelunky, the

31
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:16,714
freeware version, of course, led to Spelunky XBLA. So small games

32
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:21,355
led to bigger games. And Spelunky itself I considered,

33
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:24,456
the freeware version, I consider it to be really like a refined

34
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:30,498
prototype. And that refined prototype came from a number of

35
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,819
even smaller prototypes that I never finished.

36
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,374
So when I approach prototyping, I like to treat it like

37
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:40,376
drawing. You know, with drawing, if I want to come up with an

38
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,658
idea for something to draw, I'll just pick up my sketchbook and a

39
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:46,720
pen and I'll just start doodling all over the page. And I'm not

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,063
concerned about trying to create something that's going to win

41
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,104
IGF or create something that's going to make a million dollars

42
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:57,027
or even create something that is going to make people like me or

43
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,949
that people are going to approve of. The key, I think, is really

44
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,430
just to zone in on

45
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,902
what I'm enjoying at the time, things that I'm interested in.

46
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:09,103
And when it comes to making games, tools, game making

47
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:12,144
programs like Game Maker for some people it's Unity, for

48
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:15,785
some people it's Flash and libraries and frameworks like

49
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:19,486
Flash Punk and Flixel, those are like the equivalent of a

50
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:24,108
sketchbook for me because it lets me get my ideas out very

51
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:29,990
easily. So this is, these are screen shots from the

52
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:33,822
a roguelike prototype that I started working on before

53
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:39,084
Spelunky. And the goal for this prototype was really just to

54
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:42,745
have fun. I had a lot of fun making the graphics and I was

55
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,167
trying to boil down the essence of roguelikes into something

56
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:51,749
that was just simple and fun to play. And if you're not

57
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,310
familiar with roguelikes, they're dungeon crawlers that

58
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,171
have random level generation, permanent death and a lot of

59
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,672
variation. And it's a really compelling genre.

60
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,457
Because those three things really make the game very

61
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:08,959
exciting and infinitely replayable. And even though it's

62
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,321
a pretty niche genre, it's had a lot of influence on a lot of

63
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:17,923
really popular games like Diablo, Minecraft, and ToeJam

64
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:21,004
and Earl. I really love that game. Those games are all based

65
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,205
on rogue legs. I think the reason why they're still niche

66
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,607
is because they haven't really advanced in terms of their

67
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,068
interface beyond the original rogue game.

68
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:34,660
which is just, which was just ASCII graphics basically.

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,361
On the other hand, platform games is, you know,

70
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:42,242
they're a really well understood and well loved genre.

71
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,963
They're action based, they require reflexes

72
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:50,524
and precision timing and memorization of the levels.

73
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,645
And I think, you know, everyone is pretty intimately

74
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,105
familiar with platform games.

75
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,247
So here are a couple of screenshots from just,

76
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:02,423
really simple platform games that I was working on at the

77
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:05,826
same time that I was making those roguelike prototypes. If

78
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:09,289
you look carefully, you can kind of see some little elements

79
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:16,175
actually made their way into Spelunky freeware. So, you know,

80
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,557
working on platformers and working on roguelikes at the

81
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:21,720
same time, working on these small prototypes, it really

82
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,263
didn't get very far. I came up with the idea of

83
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:29,717
combining the aspects of roguelikes that I really liked

84
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,258
that I thought were really compelling, the random level

85
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:35,379
generation, the permanent death, the variation, the fact that

86
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,720
you get into these unscripted situations that are really fun

87
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,883
to get yourself out of. I wanted to combine that with a platform

88
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:47,544
game, you know, and I'm a big fan of that genre and as I said

89
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:52,686
before, it's a very accessible and well-known genre. I wanted

90
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:53,546
to make something that was...

91
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:58,084
new and exciting but also accessible. And the big

92
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:01,545
challenge I think between reconciling those two genres

93
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:07,046
was the level design because platform games really depend on

94
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:11,466
their levels, on their platforms and roguelikes are exciting

95
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,587
because they're randomly generated. So I thought I'd

96
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,907
quickly just go through the algorithm that I used to

97
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:20,948
generate levels in Spelunky. So each level in Spelunky really

98
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,188
starts with a grid of

99
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:27,557
16 rooms, four by four, just like this. And then we draw a

100
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,918
path from the entrance at the top of the level to an exit at

101
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:33,519
the bottom of the level. You're always going down in Spelunky

102
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,421
for the most part. So we generate this path and mark each

103
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:42,823
room as being part of the path. And for each room, we have a set

104
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:46,925
of template rooms that we can pick from. And what set of

105
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,026
templates we choose depends on the area of the game that

106
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:54,404
that the level is in and whether the room falls on a path.

107
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:56,526
So for example, you know, if we want to have,

108
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,348
if we need a corridor that connects to other rooms,

109
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:03,371
then we draw from a set of corridor templates

110
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,353
and put it in there.

111
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,054
And within each template,

112
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:11,777
there are these little randomized chunks that are specified.

113
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,699
And that kind of, it just adds variability

114
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,280
and more interesting...

115
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,876
things to these set templates and at the very end we add

116
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:24,779
monsters, treasure, traps and whatever else to kind of

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,422
complete it. And that's about it. So working on a game like

118
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:32,705
this is really fun. It's very satisfying because you can

119
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:36,287
create a lot of content with a small team. You know, if you

120
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,489
look at a game like Dwarf Fortress, it's essentially

121
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,611
programmed by one guy. It's a two-person team. And they're

122
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,753
making entire worlds, you know, like it's just

123
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,081
it's really awesome. And as a developer, it's really fun to

124
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:53,123
work this way because you're always surprised by your own

125
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:56,904
game. You know, even playing Spelunky now, like having worked

126
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,906
on now two different versions of the game, I'm still having fun

127
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,407
with it because I'm always running into things that excite

128
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:09,429
me. So it's really fun to develop. Spelunky is not the

129
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,910
first sort of refined prototype by any means either that turned

130
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,290
into

131
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:21,197
a bigger project. We see examples of this in all kinds of media. Super Meat Boy, for example,

132
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:28,862
started as the Flash, the free Flash version called Meat Boy. And Google, they've got this

133
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:34,146
thing called Google Labs, which they describe as a playground of experimental prototypes that

134
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:40,310
people can just give feedback on and, you know, if anything good comes out of it, they turn it into

135
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,773
a full-blown product. It's a great way to test out ideas.

136
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:48,218
And it extends even into other creative mediums like writing.

137
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:53,262
The author Haruki Murakami, in the intro to a collection of

138
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,745
short stories that I think is called Blind Willow Sleeping

139
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:59,507
Woman, but I might have gotten those mixed up. But anyways, in

140
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:03,771
the intro to that collection, he describes his process and he

141
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:07,113
says that right after he writes a big novel, the first thing he

142
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,455
does is he writes a bunch of short stories and he keeps

143
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,378
writing those short stories until he comes up with

144
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:21,151
inspiration for his next big novel. So making these small

145
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,833
prototypes and then refining them into something and

146
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:28,374
releasing them is a great way to test out ideas. It's a great way

147
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:33,136
to refresh yourself after a long draining project. It's a great

148
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:38,899
way to, you know, get that relief creative tension, you

149
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:42,060
know, and it's also just a great way to get into.

150
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:47,970
your next big project. So Chris Hecker, who I know loves to be

151
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,553
quoted out of context, in an interview with Edge that he did

152
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:56,475
with John Blow, he described small independent games that

153
00:09:56,555 --> 00:10:00,457
don't fully reach their potential as mulch. And he said

154
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:05,260
that big, you know, big games, bigger games that reach their

155
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,862
full potential, he described those as trees. I really like

156
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,263
that analogy. But...

157
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:15,194
The way I feel about it is that you can be a mulch and a tree

158
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:17,495
person and it actually goes really well together. So if

159
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:21,338
you're someone who wants to release big games, and I really

160
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:26,201
define myself and my work by the big projects I've released, but

161
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,444
at the same time, working on the small games on the mulch has

162
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,946
allowed me and given me the opportunity to work on the big

163
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:37,049
games. So on that note, I'm going to hand it over to my

164
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,310
friend and partner Andy Hall. He's going to talk to you about

165
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,952
the XBLA version of Spelunky.

166
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:53,558
So as Derek said, my name is Andy, that's true. This is a

167
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,839
picture I drew of myself. I was a little bit generous with my

168
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,800
hair. But other than that, basically despite that, what I

169
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
mostly work on on Spelunky XBLA is the programming, although I

170
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,681
am helping with the other aspects as well. So I thought

171
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:12,162
I'd start with how Spelunky XBLA came to be. And basically it

172
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:15,682
all started with a man we all know and love, Jonathan Blow.

173
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:18,363
Jon was a big fan.

174
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:26,868
It took a while. You guys had a pause while you read down the list. So John actually was a big

175
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:31,691
fan of the original game and he contacted Derek and said, hey Derek, would you be interested in

176
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:37,595
doing an Xbox Live version of Spelunky? And of course Derek said yes, of course. And that kind

177
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,316
of got the ball rolling with the green light process with Microsoft.

178
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,665
The green light process was fairly easy because Derek

179
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:49,326
already had the original game to send into Microsoft. They could

180
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:52,708
play it, see what made the game fun, see what made it work, and

181
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,808
also they saw that the game already had a built-in

182
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,909
audience. There were players that were already enjoying it

183
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,690
and loving the game a lot. I think a lot of people, myself

184
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,371
included, feel tentative about releasing smaller projects that

185
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,752
maybe don't express the extent of what we think our abilities

186
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:08,092
are.

187
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,131
But I think Spelunky really shows that people will see the

188
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:15,233
game for what it is and be able to appreciate the things in the

189
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:21,236
game no matter what level it's at. And I think that the

190
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:24,598
feedback from those games helps improve the games so they'll get

191
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:29,460
even better. And, you know, the game and the ideas involved will

192
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,362
evolve as you work more and more on the project.

193
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,476
John also actually offered to let Derek use the braid engine

194
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:42,477
for Spelunky XBLA. Derek took him up on this and actually had

195
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:45,358
a very early version of the game running in the braid engine.

196
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,060
And that's when I came on board. We spent about a month and a

197
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,022
half working with the braid engine and we were having some

198
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:57,043
problems understanding some of the code. There was unneeded

199
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:01,544
features such as the timer winding which we weren't using

200
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:02,605
that were complicating matters.

201
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:07,569
And when we contacted John to ask about some parts of the code, he had moved on to other

202
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,712
projects and really wasn't familiar with the code anymore.

203
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,815
So it made it difficult to get information on what was going on.

204
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:20,241
At that point we decided that it would be best to start again with an engine from scratch.

205
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,081
Because we had the original game to look at, we knew the features

206
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,043
and scope of the engine that would be required to make it.

207
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:32,024
And we felt pretty comfortable that the two of us could handle

208
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,665
it. And we also liked the idea that we would be able to reuse

209
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:41,968
the code for later projects that we work on after Spelunky. So as

210
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,809
we're working on Spelunky, we're really treating it more as a

211
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,870
sequel to the original Spelunky than trying to just do an HD

212
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,111
remake of the game.

213
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:55,017
And this might be scary to hear, but we can't be afraid to change things from the original

214
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:55,297
game.

215
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:59,459
And this took me a little bit of time to get used to, because I love the game, and I think

216
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:05,122
it felt awkward at first, feeling free to change things in the game.

217
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:10,706
But that's the only way we can really evolve it and make it feel different and special.

218
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:16,309
This was made easier by the fact that the original game will still exist.

219
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,890
We're not deleting it by making the Xbox Live version.

220
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,323
people can still go back and play that and appreciate it for

221
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,364
what it is. That said, though, we don't want to break what

222
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,864
worked about the game. We want to improve it. So we want to

223
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:30,105
keep the complexity and interactions and things that

224
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:37,307
made it really fun to begin with. So obviously we're trying

225
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,607
to improve the game in all sorts of different ways. And I think

226
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,748
the most obvious, and I think most of you have seen a lot of

227
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:44,729
the screenshots that we've put out so far, is the art upgrade

228
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:45,149
to HD.

229
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,526
less obvious is that we're really working on streamlining

230
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:53,126
the controls and the interface to make it easier for players to

231
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:58,048
get into it. When I first played Spelunky, I didn't stick with it

232
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,829
very long on the PC. I had a little bit of trouble with the

233
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:05,130
controls and it wasn't until I kept reading on the TIG force

234
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,631
forums that people were raving about the game that I said, oh,

235
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,872
okay, I need to sink some more time into this and really

236
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,773
uncover what is so great about the game.

237
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:19,468
We wanted to eliminate that hurdle of the controls. So as

238
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,769
an example, in the original game, if you want to go into a

239
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,630
shop and buy something, you have to use two different buttons

240
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,651
just to pick up the item, just to check the price to see if you

241
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:31,052
want to, can purchase it and want to purchase it. If you do

242
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:34,633
want to purchase it, you have to hit a third button. If you don't

243
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,834
want to purchase it, you have to hit another two-button

244
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,655
combination to drop the item, and you risk hitting the

245
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:43,016
shopkeeper, who will become enraged and shoot you in the

246
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:43,296
face.

247
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:49,268
So to make the shopping experience a little more pleasant, now when you're in the shops,

248
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:53,213
if you're overlapping an item that's on sale, it will immediately pop up with the price.

249
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:58,299
And if you can buy it, there will not be that little red mark over the RB button and you

250
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,983
tap it and you'll immediately purchase and equip the item.

251
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:08,519
So roguelikes are founded on this idea of having tons of

252
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,861
different monsters and items in the game and all the different

253
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,922
interactions that come up between them is what makes the

254
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,944
game interesting and fun to play. So we're going to be

255
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:20,526
adding more of that stuff to make the complexity go up, keep

256
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,068
the variation of the games up so that not only is the game fun

257
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,590
for new players, but existing players will find new and

258
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,931
exciting things in the game as well.

259
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,655
There was one feature that was probably more requested than any

260
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,417
other feature from the freeware game. And we decided we had to

261
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:42,559
do it for the Xbox live version. And that is multiplayer. So...

262
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,322
So the game will support four player local play.

263
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,932
And it really fits in the kind of chaotic nature of the game.

264
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,114
If you're playing with someone, you're able to toss them up to

265
00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:00,775
a ledge they wouldn't normally be able to reach. But if you

266
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:02,756
mess up, right, they might ricochet off the wall and fall

267
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,497
into the spikes. But maybe that's what you intended all

268
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:11,260
along because you want their jet pack. So basically we'll

269
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,162
have more information coming out about the different multiplayer

270
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,943
modes as we get closer to release.

271
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:21,624
So in conclusion, the freeware game really acted as our design

272
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:25,347
document in making the Xbox Live version. And it made it easy

273
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,349
for me as the programmer because I didn't always have to contact

274
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,572
Derek about small details with the game. I would just refer to

275
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:36,275
the original design and make it function in the same way. I also

276
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,599
used the Spelunky wiki a bunch for everything from finding out

277
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:43,501
how much the different gems cost to the different interactions

278
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,725
with monsters. And I think Spelunky really shows that.

279
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,848
There's more benefits to releasing these games than I think people realize.

280
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:58,271
And that even though you have these small, polished games that you think kind of are

281
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,432
these small projects, they really can go hand in hand with the larger commercial projects

282
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,153
and grow into something really cool.

283
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,835
So I think if we can take some questions now, that would be great.

284
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:14,377
Thank you.

285
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:14,857
Thank you.

286
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,358
Thank you.

287
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:16,578
Thank you.

288
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:16,778
Thank you.

289
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:16,978
Thank you.

290
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:17,358
Thank you.

291
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:17,558
Thank you.

292
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,470
I have a very simple question, actually. I was just wondering

293
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,491
how long did the original Spelunky take to make from like

294
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:36,452
once you got like, oh, I know what I'm doing to and compare

295
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:39,292
that to how long is the current Spelunky taking?

296
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,473
I started working on the first version of Spelunky like the

297
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:50,314
summer of 2008. And I think I released version 1.0, like

298
00:18:56,974 --> 00:19:00,217
I don't even remember, actually. When I first released the game,

299
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:04,840
it was like version 0.6 or something, and I kept working on

300
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,982
it for a while, and I think I ended up releasing a version 1.0.

301
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:13,366
It probably took me like a year and a half for the original

302
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:17,490
freeware game to get it to 1.0, and this version is probably

303
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,573
going to take around two years. So it's actually pretty similar

304
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,395
for the first version of the game and the XBLA version.

305
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,901
I think that's because the first version involved a lot of

306
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,922
design work, which can be really difficult and you have to kind

307
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:39,185
of like go back and forth a lot. But the XBLA version is just a

308
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,507
lot of like, you know, there's a lot more technical work and

309
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:46,968
stuff like that. So it ends up evening out a bit, actually.

310
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:48,649
All right. Thanks.

311
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,680
make more sense to bug you about it in front of 500 people.

312
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,923
So when you talk about Spelunky and your development process,

313
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,364
it all sounds very loose, right?

314
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,905
I mean, you're sort of creating these systems that

315
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,926
are going to procedurally generate all sorts of stuff

316
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:09,709
that you can't even imagine what the final layout is going

317
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:10,729
to be like and so on, right?

318
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,510
And you're surprising yourself every time you play.

319
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,492
But if you go and study Spelunky like I have,

320
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,834
there's a lot of very tight.

321
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,802
things that happen in terms of the design. The reason you want

322
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:24,424
to play just one more time and you end up playing 100 times in

323
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:29,488
a given evening is because it seems like there were decisions

324
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:32,410
made about how rare certain things are, how likely you are

325
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,612
to see a damsel, how likely you are to find a shop with a

326
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:38,515
shotgun just waiting there to blast the owner with. And it

327
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:41,837
doesn't just seem like just anything goes, like just throw

328
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,438
all these random things together. It seems like there's

329
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,641
so many tight game design things that come in there. How did you

330
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,364
come up with that stuff? Were you conscious of it or did it

331
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:53,025
just kind of roll out of the procedurality and that kind of

332
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,925
thing?

333
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:59,348
You know, I got to say it wasn't too strictly planned a lot of

334
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:03,069
that stuff. Like, for example, how often does a certain thing

335
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:07,271
appear every time? I kind of just went with what felt right,

336
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,692
you know? One out of ten or something like that. And it

337
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:15,134
tended to work. You know, I just tried it and it would seem to

338
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:15,454
work.

339
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:19,229
you make decisions at a certain point where you tested it and

340
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:23,331
found like, oh, God, you know, having a damsel come 50% of the

341
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:25,593
time is too much and I'm going to tweak it down because it

342
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,194
feels like it's ‑‑ I want it to be more rare than that. Did

343
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:30,475
you make decisions like that at certain points when you were

344
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,316
testing?

345
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:35,418
I did, but I can't say that I remember anything that was so

346
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:39,480
significant that I added it and then it was just completely

347
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,542
broken the first time around. I think part ‑‑ one of the

348
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:45,123
things that helps is just having ‑‑

349
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,126
So many things going on and not having any one thing kind of

350
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:58,351
dominate everything else so that, you know, even if the

351
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:03,714
formulas aren't completely focused test, tested to a T or

352
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:06,535
anything like that, it still feels really compelling.

353
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:07,476
Right.

354
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:09,117
So I guess we just have to chalk it up to genius.

355
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:11,398
I wouldn't say that.

356
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,179
I didn't say that.

357
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,459
So.

358
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:22,195
In fact, in a lot of ways I feel like it's maybe a lack of genius

359
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:25,737
that helps you come up with solutions for some of these

360
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:30,280
things. Like for the level generation, I really just tried

361
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,424
to do what was simplest and what seemed like the most just brute

362
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:41,969
force way to make a level that worked. So I'm no genius, quote

363
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:42,449
Derek Yu.

364
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,146
Could you talk a little bit about the production

365
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:50,868
requirements for the XBLA version? Is it just the two of

366
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:51,408
you?

367
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:59,554
Yeah, it's just the two of us. And we have dev kits. And Andy

368
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:02,836
actually lives in Connecticut, so we usually, you know, he'll

369
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,078
come out here and we'll jam together for like a couple weeks

370
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:11,541
at a time. But usually we just work over Google video chat and

371
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:13,082
pass code back and forth. I think

372
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:18,080
I'd be pretty embarrassed to actually go through our entire

373
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,422
production process because it's pretty ghetto fabulous.

374
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:26,565
So definitely got our indie cred going on.

375
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,847
Do you guys have to worry about, you know, like marketing

376
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:33,469
and PR of this or are you kind of relying on the community?

377
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:37,071
That is something I worry about and it's something I worry

378
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,633
about because it's honestly something that I'm not that

379
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:41,334
interested in when it comes to.

380
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,323
You know, I can't say that I'm really passionate about marketing at all.

381
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:51,046
I like talking about my game and I'm really enthusiastic about working on it, but I'm

382
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:58,471
just – my personality, you know, I don't know, my personality, I'm just not – I

383
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:02,354
kind of – when I'm working on games, I kind of really like to put my nose to the

384
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:06,396
grindstone and actually kind of – my inclination, I think, is to really just

385
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:10,460
hideout. So I am worried about marketing and we're trying to

386
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,326
think of things to do that fit our personality and our fun. But

387
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:19,768
it's something that we really have to work on, I think.

388
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,932
Yeah, I mean, I come from a more traditional product company. I

389
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:28,877
was a toy designer for a while. Five years. For five years. Five

390
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:29,477
long years.

391
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:34,339
But I, when we're talking about how we're going to promote the

392
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,541
game, I'm very much in line with traditional ways of marketing

393
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:41,945
it. And, you know, suggesting things, I mean, I see Derek's

394
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,887
side of it, that, you know, we do want it to fit the aspect of

395
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:48,529
the game, you know, kind of the feel of our team and you don't

396
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:51,111
want to kind of do something that's not in line with the

397
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:54,734
game. But at the same time, we don't want to be too

398
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,976
understated as well. So I think we're still trying to find that

399
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:57,396
balance.

400
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,946
I do want to mention that there's a third person on our

401
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:06,309
team and that's our musician Eric who is in Norway right now.

402
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,972
He runs the pause indie music, indie game music label. So

403
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,255
anyways, want to put that out there. I think we got one more

404
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:21,498
question. In the last few years there seems like there's been a

405
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:26,561
resurgence in the more difficult games like Spelunky and Demon

406
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,642
Souls, that sort of thing.

407
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:30,764
What do you think has caused this resurgence and how do you

408
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:34,665
balance like difficulty versus frustration in your game?

409
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:38,866
Right. I mean, I think it goes back and forth. So, you know,

410
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:41,667
it feels like games are getting too casual. You hear people

411
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:46,909
really complaining about not having games that they can

412
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:53,111
really enjoy. And I think the key to making a challenging game

413
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,811
that's not frustrating is just to

414
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:59,210
give the player all the tools that they need to overcome the

415
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:05,594
challenge and never make it the game's fault that they lost,

416
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:11,758
essentially. So, you know, with games like roguelikes, one of

417
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,119
the things that's so fun about them is that you have all of

418
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,881
these tools at your disposal. You never know when you could

419
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:21,503
get into a situation where, you know, I don't know, you're

420
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:23,945
surrounded by monsters and all of a sudden you have to use

421
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,666
a tin of goblin meat to get yourself out of it and you feel

422
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:32,650
really smart about it. Roguelikes give you lots of

423
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,155
those tools so even though they're really tough, it's

424
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,820
always fun. And I think that's it. So thank you very much.

425
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,140
Thank you.
