1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:11,121
My name is Cyril Baron. I've been in the industry for about 20 years.

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:17,207
I had a first part of my life in publishing, marketing, working for Atari, Infogram,

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,730
and then I switched to production and joined actually Ubisoft DÃ¼sseldorf.

4
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,792
in 2012, so about seven years ago.

5
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:26,974
Ubisoft du Soleil is actually part of Ubisoft Blue Byte.

6
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:30,417
We are one of the oldest studios in Germany.

7
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:34,700
We are doing a bit older type of product that Ubisoft is doing,

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,622
so big codev on the big brand of Ubisoft.

9
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,464
We have some PC brand, maybe, you know, Anno, you know, Settlers.

10
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:41,885
And we love innovation.

11
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:46,007
And actually, so Ubisoft Escape Game is one of our innovation projects.

12
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:48,209
It's coming out of Ubisoft du Soleil.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,181
Basically, our mandate is to create virtual reality escape games

14
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,986
in the best gaming world of Ubisoft.

15
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:59,091
And we have actually released two experiences already.

16
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:01,394
The first one is called Escape the Lost Pyramid.

17
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:06,366
It's actually based in the world of Assassin's Creed Origins,

18
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,106
and we released that in July 2018.

19
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,547
And we just released, a couple of months ago,

20
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,809
a second experience called Beyond Medusa's Gate,

21
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:17,389
which is also an escape game set this time

22
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:20,130
in the world of Assassin's Creed Odyssey,

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,551
so back in ancient Greece.

24
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:25,906
What's special about our games, at least for Ubisoft,

25
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:30,451
is we are doing them exclusively for location-based entertainment

26
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,011
businesses.

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,695
So our clients are actually physical escape rooms.

28
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:40,400
They are VR arcades, or they are whatever outlets

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,781
specialize in entertainment.

30
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,643
So we have some family entertainment center.

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,264
We've got some laser tag, et cetera.

32
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:48,570
Something also which is a bit special in our project is

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,932
we are actually controlling the distribution.

34
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:54,854
What I mean by that is we do not have distributors.

35
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:57,616
We actually want to have a one-on-one relation

36
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:58,857
with every single partner.

37
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,158
And we are currently building this network

38
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:03,840
because in LBE, it's very important

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,841
to have very good partners,

40
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,782
and I think this line of communication

41
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:07,963
is super important for us.

42
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:10,245
So you know a bit what we are doing,

43
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,586
and what I would like to start with

44
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,447
is to tell you about our journey into VR.

45
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:21,307
Actually, we operate a bit like a small startup within Ubisoft.

46
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:25,530
So you see all the teams, there are 21 guys at the bottom of the screen.

47
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,153
We are very small, we need to be very fast.

48
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,975
We want to change the world a bit like a startup.

49
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,897
It actually started back in 2017.

50
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:39,142
I think we submitted a concept to our editorial team in Paris.

51
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:43,867
about doing Escape Room in VR and they actually liked it and they told us, you know what,

52
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:49,411
maybe it's a good idea, we're going to give you a small prototype budget, build a team and try

53
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:53,995
to prove to us that it could be interesting. So we had three months to create this first prototype.

54
00:02:54,616 --> 00:03:00,018
And then we presented it to Serge, Serge Asquet, who is our chief creative officer in Ubisoft,

55
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:04,540
and he said, you know what, I like it guys, so please go and start doing the first game,

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,102
which we started back in October 2017. So at the time we were 10 devs.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,902
And we actually released, so Escape the Lost Pyramid,

58
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:18,065
our first game at the end of June in 2018.

59
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:22,249
And by the time of release, we were actually 16 on the team.

60
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:23,630
So still very fast.

61
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,012
And actually, our first client started operating our game

62
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,393
on the 1st of July, 2018.

63
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,937
Immediately, the team started to work on the second game.

64
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,838
And at the same time, we were trying

65
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,421
to find new partners to distribute and operate

66
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:38,821
our games.

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,801
This year in February, we actually reached 100 partners worldwide.

68
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:46,603
In May, as I've told you, we released our second game.

69
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:49,304
July, we reached 200 partners.

70
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:52,125
We think we are the market leaders.

71
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,526
There's no official data, but our reach is quite important.

72
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:59,847
And currently, all the team is currently working on our third room,

73
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,788
which is not going to be based this time on Assassin's Creed

74
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:05,869
and that we are going to release actually next spring.

75
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,170
And if we find...

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,741
one or two missing people we want in the team, we should be 23 by the time of release.

77
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:18,384
So as you can see, or at least for Ubisoft, we are a very small team and we have a very small

78
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:24,967
development schedule. Basically what it means is that from the get-go, especially when we are 10,

79
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:30,589
we had to make lots of production choices to make sure we could deliver on time and quality.

80
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:36,831
And so basically what we decided is that our experiments are going to be room-scale only.

81
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,521
And from the get-go, we say it's going to be exclusively

82
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,743
for location-based VR.

83
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,845
It was great, because for us, it mean

84
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:50,629
we could have the same minimum specs for every single partner.

85
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,591
So we did not have to spend as much time to do optimization

86
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,472
if you want to cover lots of different pieces.

87
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,194
And at the time, so it was two years ago,

88
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,255
we said that we would support.

89
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,492
Rift and actually HTC Vive.

90
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:06,597
And that's today still the two devices that we are supporting

91
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,759
because our partners who have started,

92
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,882
we want to make sure that they can continue to explore our games

93
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:13,584
year after year.

94
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:17,308
Also, what we decided from the get-go

95
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,189
is that it's going to be multiplayer only

96
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,051
and actually it's going to be auto.

97
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:28,207
of four players. Why two or four players? Because we said if we want to do four we are going to do

98
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:33,532
two times two so we are going to do twice the experience we're going to mirror it because in

99
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:41,298
terms of design it would be easier and we would be able to actually do that in time. We also said

100
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:44,941
that it's going to be a one-time experience. There was lots of discussion about can you make

101
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:49,765
it replayable but it's difficult to do an escape room in a replayable way because it's all about

102
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:50,345
discovering.

103
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,514
It would require too much time for not enough value.

104
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,236
And we said, no, we are not going to do that.

105
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,137
It's going to be a one-time experience only.

106
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,680
And if we are very fast in developing one game,

107
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,862
it's better to try to do more than one

108
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,864
than trying to do actually replayability.

109
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,632
And for our first and second game, we also said,

110
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:09,433
OK, we're not going to have NPCs in the game

111
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,235
because we have no animator.

112
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,577
It's more difficult, and we won't

113
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:14,558
be able to do it on time.

114
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,561
So see from the very beginning, very strong choices.

115
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:22,887
At the same time, we have some very agile production method.

116
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:25,329
So basically, the first thing, and one of the most important,

117
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,330
was having the right people.

118
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,270
And basically, all the people I've got in the team

119
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,032
are people who have a very let's-do-it mindset.

120
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:33,792
We just do the prototype.

121
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:34,733
We put it in the game.

122
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:35,653
It needs to work.

123
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,935
So basically, we have a very flat hierarchy

124
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,536
in the team overall.

125
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,438
It's all about weekly sprints.

126
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,259
We need to be always playable.

127
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,341
And we started with a very light project management Kanban

128
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,362
system, which has evolved a bit now that we are more.

129
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:55,803
But it's still the same philosophy.

130
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,798
Also, one thing that we decided very early on,

131
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:04,000
and I think it was a very good decision,

132
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,602
is actually if it's a one-time experience

133
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,203
that is going to be played outside,

134
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:09,985
we're going to do one-time playtest.

135
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:12,987
So we're lucky because we are in a big studio.

136
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,649
So we are about more than 200 in Dusseldorf.

137
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,431
So we organized a big contest within the company

138
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,413
where a group of four could actually apply.

139
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,435
And since before Alpha, actually people were coming.

140
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,011
playing the game. So basically, we were able to measure and iterate and actually see what was

141
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:33,832
happening. And that's when, when we started VR, we understood actually what matters is not what

142
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:38,773
you see or what you see as a dev on screen, it's about what you feel. And making sure that we had

143
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:44,114
all these playtests from very early on actually gave us lots of knowledge and confidence about

144
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:50,035
the quality of the experience when it was released outside. So let's talk about how do we create

145
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,316
business-to-business experiences.

146
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:54,421
for mainstream consumers.

147
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:59,923
Because one thing is clear is that our audience is actually very mainstream.

148
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,544
If you know Escape Room, Escape Room is for everybody.

149
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,805
It's for all ages, all people.

150
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:08,206
You go there as a family, you go there with your grandmother,

151
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,727
you go there as a company, it can be a corporate event,

152
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,188
so you can go with your boss, with your colleague.

153
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:20,544
So basically, it's also for people who have no VR experience most of the time.

154
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:25,826
Sometimes they don't have video game experience. So thinking about accessibility from the very

155
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:30,328
beginning was one of our core principles. And you can also see that we've also been testing

156
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,031
at Blue Byte with people in wheelchairs because accessibility is one of the key.

157
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,296
And at the same time that we have this, in terms of audience,

158
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:43,260
we know that if you do location-based entertainment,

159
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,583
you have some constraints from the business side.

160
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,327
One of them is on the business side,

161
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,551
customers are going to book a 60-minute session.

162
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:56,174
especially in VR arcade, which means that you actually have

163
00:08:56,294 --> 00:09:00,577
only 60 minutes to learn the game and finish it.

164
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,638
So you really need to think from the beginning

165
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,640
about onboarding the players, how do you finish,

166
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,162
and how you're going to give tools to your partners,

167
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:12,064
the operator, to manage all the different players.

168
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,446
So this is what we had in mind when we started.

169
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,708
And we said, OK, so what are we going to do?

170
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:18,728
How are we going to do it?

171
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,625
One of the first things we were wondering is,

172
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:23,925
why do you go out of home?

173
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:27,448
Because it's not going to be played at your place.

174
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:28,989
You're going to have to go out.

175
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,231
And basically, if you go out of home,

176
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,952
it's because you want to meet friends.

177
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:34,894
Most likely, you're going to meet colleagues.

178
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:36,275
Maybe you go out with your family.

179
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,476
So that's why, from the very beginning,

180
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,398
we say it has to be multiplayer.

181
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:44,721
And here, you can see one of the setups is all two or four

182
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:46,342
players, so that's a four-player setup.

183
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,775
So the game was going to be multiplayer, and I think if you listen to the arcade and looking

184
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:55,999
through the entertainment, doing VR, they tell you that 90% of the games which are played are

185
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:01,604
actually multiplayer games. So I think it was a very important decision. And what we wanted to do

186
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,889
is to make sure there was a very strong collaboration in the game. So if you go as a

187
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,914
group, you want to make sure that all together you're going to be working well. And so basically

188
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:12,715
what I'm going to show you...

189
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:19,237
is a video of a group of four players in the game.

190
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:25,141
They are talking to one another and they understand that they have to do it together,

191
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:31,104
otherwise they are not going to make it. So please pay attention more to what they say than what you see.

192
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:36,668
Can you stay at the bridge too?

193
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,571
You have to work together guys, right?

194
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:48,556
You've heard the guy said, oh, we have to work together guys, right?

195
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:53,540
And it's correct. It's one of the really core principle of our experience.

196
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,644
And one of the rule we have is you cannot solve the game on your own.

197
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,406
If you don't escape room, physical escape room,

198
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:04,810
sometime you are in a group where somebody is very fast in picking up everything.

199
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,152
He finds a lock, he does everything for you.

200
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,074
So you're watching, but you say, oh.

201
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:14,676
Okay, so you feel a bit outside and what you wanted to do is at the end of every single experience,

202
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:20,161
anybody from the team should be able to say, guys, without me, you would not have done it.

203
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:24,024
And it's important because when you go as a group and you have the satisfaction,

204
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,207
it means that when you come back home or when you go back to work on Monday,

205
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:31,271
you're going to say that you've done something for your team and you're going to talk about it.

206
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:34,994
So that was one of the core rules that we've got.

207
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:37,979
Also, what we wanted to do, if you go out of home,

208
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,800
is we wanted you to do something that you cannot do actually

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,440
in your living room.

210
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,362
So of course, it's larger than your living room.

211
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,803
So in our game, if you have four players,

212
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:48,923
you need four room scale.

213
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,244
So you're not going to be able to do that at home,

214
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,625
or at least not a lot of home are

215
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:53,805
going to be able to do that.

216
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:57,447
But what was important for us is to be larger than life.

217
00:11:57,787 --> 00:12:00,068
And I think that what VR offers you,

218
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,169
it offers you to transport people to different places.

219
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:07,313
So again, pay attention to what people are saying.

220
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:36,080
Is that Atlas? So imagine, you go back to work on Monday, what you can say is, oh, together

221
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,103
we were with my three friends, we were on a boat in this massive underground cave and we have the

222
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:48,747
giant statues of Atlas above us. That's the type of emotion that you want to give actually to a

223
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:52,930
player. So we want them to experience something larger than life. We want them to do something

224
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,212
that you actually cannot do in real life, maybe because it's too difficult.

225
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:02,971
maybe because it's just impossible or too dangerous. And again that's what people are

226
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,755
doing so you're not going to see what they've done but basically they have to climb something

227
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,398
which is quite steep and they are actually commenting on it.

228
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:25,045
I wish that climbing was that easy in real life.

229
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:26,686
And yes, it's amazing.

230
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,347
I think when people actually do that

231
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,829
and they've got this feeling of doing something incredible,

232
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,411
it brings actually satisfaction

233
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,033
to the experience that you are doing.

234
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:39,456
So this was one of our principle of everything we do.

235
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:40,697
We want to be larger than life.

236
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:41,498
We want to be,

237
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,722
to enable you to do something you cannot do in real life.

238
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,284
And at the same time, because of our audience,

239
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:50,545
we need to make it accessible.

240
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:57,450
to actually everyone. So how do we do that? What were our design guidelines? First,

241
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,772
we are non-violent. What does that mean? That even though we are set in the world of Assassin's Creed,

242
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:07,854
you're not playing as an assassin, you're not going to assassinate anybody, and I think it's

243
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:11,715
valuable because we have lots of feedback from partners, the arcade saying, you know, it's good

244
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:16,937
to have a game where you can put anybody, you're not going to kill anybody, which is positive,

245
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:19,758
and we think it was important, especially for our target audience.

246
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:25,224
Second, what we've done, and it's probably one of the best decisions we made,

247
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:30,247
even though it was not a decision we've done from the get-go, is we are giving you a full-body

248
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,229
avatar. So one of the first things you do when you arrive in the game, you're going to be in a lobby

249
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:40,151
all together, you have your avatar, and you see yourself. There is a mirror, so if you wave at

250
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:45,594
the mirror, you're going to see you're waving. And actually, this is the moment where people

251
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,756
who have not done VR are sold on VR, because at that moment they understand.

252
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,359
Oh, but that's not just a video game.

253
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,321
That's not a gaming console.

254
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:55,661
That's incredible.

255
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,582
That's actually me.

256
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:57,763
And we can see each other.

257
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:58,864
People can talk.

258
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:00,485
You've got some accessories.

259
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:01,105
You've got hats.

260
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:04,227
So you can take the hat and you say, how do I put it on?

261
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,389
And you tell them, well, how do you do in real life?

262
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,871
Oh, and you put it on and say, wow, it's incredible.

263
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:10,452
It's working.

264
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,614
And I was saying it was not an obvious decision

265
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:15,415
because when we started, we had no animator.

266
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,933
So basically, you're not tracking the feet.

267
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,074
So yeah, if you look at the animation,

268
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,015
it's not perfect at all, far from that,

269
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,076
but it doesn't matter.

270
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,738
Actually, the benefit of having a full body

271
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,759
is so much better than actually,

272
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,841
it's really selling VR to actually customers.

273
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,082
So I really recommend people

274
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:34,663
who are not sure about having a real body avatar,

275
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:35,984
it's really worth it

276
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,605
because it's really making people

277
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:39,666
enjoy the experience a lot.

278
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,521
Then, if you want to be a manta ray, you need to be as natural as possible.

279
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:50,183
So of course, as you've seen, people are talking.

280
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,044
Well, you're not in a tutorial to talk.

281
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:56,746
When we do bow shooting, we put a bow in the whale, we put an arrow,

282
00:15:56,907 --> 00:16:01,389
and I think anybody understands that if you grab the bow, grab an arrow, put it in, and shoot.

283
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,820
It's working. You don't need a tutorial.

284
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,642
It's magical.

285
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,285
Climbing is a bit more difficult, but people get it.

286
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:11,308
And because we had room scale,

287
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:14,071
you actually don't need to learn really locomotion,

288
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,032
so it was quite natural.

289
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,194
And actually, we have just two tutorials in the game.

290
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:22,039
One is for grabbing, so we are telling you to press the trigger

291
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,600
to actually grab an object.

292
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,683
And the second one I'm going to talk to you about.

293
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:30,470
So at the same time, even though we had room scale,

294
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,492
natural walking, what we decided also is to give you,

295
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,654
in each game, a kind of moving platform for you

296
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:41,077
so we could actually transport you in a much bigger world

297
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,399
to make sure that you would see more of the universe.

298
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,240
And now I'm going to show you.

299
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,461
So you've seen that Medusa,

300
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,022
which has all the extract you've seen,

301
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:51,343
you are actually on a boat.

302
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,164
So you've got your boat with your mate

303
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:54,745
and it's going through the cave.

304
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:56,846
And actually in Pyramid, this is what we had.

305
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:21,304
So in Pyramid, actually you have this small platform and actually the platform where all

306
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:26,027
the players are coming together and it transports you from the very bottom of the pyramid to

307
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,288
the very top if you manage to find the exit.

308
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,126
So you've seen everything is super natural.

309
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,886
And then what did we decide to do?

310
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,487
Ha, teleport.

311
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,167
You're going to say, but that's crazy.

312
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,147
It's not natural.

313
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:38,868
It's difficult.

314
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:40,188
It's true.

315
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,049
And that was probably the most difficult decision we made.

316
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,510
We're still arguing about it, saying it's not perfect.

317
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,591
Actually, we decided to keep it mainly for convenience

318
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,331
for the partners.

319
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:56,132
Because if you have a partner who has a smaller size,

320
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:56,792
maybe 2 by 2, not 2 by 3.

321
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,447
Well, it's more difficult. We wanted to be able to accommodate,

322
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:05,009
so we said, okay, we're still going to allow teleporting the game

323
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,830
because it's going to be easier for actually operators to do it,

324
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,411
but we've done something a bit different.

325
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,251
I mean, if you are a VR expert,

326
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,052
when you have a game with grabbing and teleporting,

327
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:16,393
you will have your two-button control.

328
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,253
So basically, you're going to grab with your trigger

329
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:21,194
and use your pie or joystick to teleport.

330
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,916
What we've done is we actually implemented by default

331
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,597
one-button control system, which means that actually on the trigger,

332
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,450
You have both the grabbing and the teleporting.

333
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,052
The way it works is, if you have an object that you can grab,

334
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,493
and you put your hand close to it, it's going to be highlighted.

335
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,274
You press the trigger, you grab it.

336
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,336
And if you want to teleport, you need to point at the floor,

337
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:46,718
maintain the trigger in, and you have an alpha second delay.

338
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,361
You see a line going on, and then you've got this blue circle.

339
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,962
And when you release it, you teleport.

340
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,845
If you are a VR expert guy, when you try your game, you say...

341
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:03,773
your game is not working. I think there's a real problem with teleporting because I'm trying to do it. It takes some time.

342
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:11,782
And it's true, but actually if you are a very mainstream person who has never played, who has just 60 minutes to learn, who has never done video games,

343
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:15,887
you can learn how to use one button in 60 minutes. You can't learn two.

344
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:18,499
And actually, it really makes sure that for us,

345
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,460
we've seen that everybody has been able to play the game,

346
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,660
even though if they had no VR or no game experience.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,241
And what we do is for more experienced VR players

348
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:31,922
in our tools for the partners,

349
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,263
they can actually activate by default two button

350
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,904
if you want to, but it's not what we advise

351
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,924
as a main control.

352
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,885
And again, we've been very happy

353
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:46,345
with the choice we made on this level.

354
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:52,710
Finally, what we've put in the game is, because it's working really well with Assassin's Creed

355
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,151
in general, is this eagle vision.

356
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:57,193
And basically, it's kind of replaced the Game Master.

357
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:01,416
So basically, when you are in the world and you're a bit lost, and it can happen in VR,

358
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:06,079
especially when you've never done it, if you raise both your hand above your head with

359
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,663
your controllers, we are going to highlight in the world what's important for you to touch

360
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:13,844
or interact with if you want to solve your quest.

361
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:19,941
And that's actually quite helpful, because if you don't know, you do that and you kind of find your way through.

362
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,463
So this is all the idea we had when we started Pyramid.

363
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:30,087
We released it. Of course, we had lots of feedback and we realized that everything was not perfect.

364
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,568
There are lots of things that we could improve.

365
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:37,972
And actually, we changed a couple of things when we've been doing our second game.

366
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,556
The first thing we've done is we've staged the multiplayer differently.

367
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,796
In Pyramid, basically, you start four in the lobby where you have character,

368
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:54,097
then we separate you to make sure that you feel the tension, and little by little we put you back

369
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:58,799
together as a group because you have this notion of coming back together which is very satisfying.

370
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,960
But by doing so, actually on some of the paths,

371
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,933
you were too and you did not have the choice of what you could do.

372
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:09,497
And it was bad because for example we have some climbing to do

373
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:16,005
and we know how intensive can be climbing. Some people could not do it but

374
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,089
they had no choice and that was really bad. So actually what

375
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,691
we've done in Medusa is

376
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:25,049
We have actually changes to make sure that the beginning of every single stage,

377
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,131
you start at four players, you see what's happening,

378
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:31,053
and you can actually decide where you want to go.

379
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,114
So if you don't want to climb, you don't have to do it.

380
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:36,436
Then we can still split you because it's really satisfying

381
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,998
to make some small group working together really well,

382
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,459
but you have the choice at the very beginning.

383
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,343
Also, one rule that we applied is we keep the line of sight.

384
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,625
So here on this screenshot, it's from the view of one player.

385
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:56,499
just on your right there is somebody climbing and maybe you don't see really well but on the other

386
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:01,965
side you have two other players hugging one another so basically even on this big level

387
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:06,410
the four players are always inside and why is it important because

388
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,915
we realized from our first game is that when you're lost in VR

389
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,154
you feel really lost. You don't know what to do. If you have to wait, it's a really a bad experience.

390
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:22,259
But as long as you can see the other players, you can actually talk to one another. They can

391
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,384
actually help you. And basically, you never have the feeling that suddenly you've been on your own

392
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,248
or you're not part of the group or it's different. And by making sure that at any single point,

393
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:38,292
you can always see the people you always feel as a group, which is at the heart of what we want to do.

394
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:45,669
One of the things also we've done is, so this help system, you remember that we had,

395
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,617
we actually made it optional, so it's actually actionable from what we call the spectator.

396
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,541
Basically, all the videos you've seen are the screenshots.

397
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:59,046
It's the view that the partner has using our spectator mode.

398
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,709
which is a tool, it's not made to be great looking,

399
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,810
it's just made for the partner to see

400
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,131
and to follow the way he wants to,

401
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:08,192
all the different players,

402
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:10,453
and he's able to act on the game.

403
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:14,756
And he can activate or deactivate this help system

404
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:19,279
if somebody wants a harder game or a simple one.

405
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:23,882
What we also change is...

406
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:30,037
the time of the experience. So Pyramid, the average completion time is 44 minutes worldwide

407
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,080
and it was too short because when it's 44 minutes, I'll show you after, the distribution of play time

408
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,582
varies a lot depending on the groups and too many people were able to finish it less than 30 minutes

409
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:42,762
which is too short.

410
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:49,728
So basically for Medusa, the average playtime, completion time is 54 minutes,

411
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:55,518
and we think it's right now the optimal time in terms of satisfaction for the different partners.

412
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:01,448
Finally, in Pyramid, if you've done some escape games,

413
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:03,830
at the end as a team, you escape,

414
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,052
people tell you, okay, come together as a team,

415
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,453
we're going to take a nice photo,

416
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,995
and it's a cool souvenir and you can post it,

417
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:10,715
it's really cool.

418
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,837
So that's what we are doing in Pyramid,

419
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:16,119
but in Medusa, actually, we do it in game.

420
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,703
So basically, I know it's having an electronic photo

421
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:23,165
in ancient Greece, it's a bit daring,

422
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:25,226
but actually people love it,

423
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:26,547
and it's a great memories,

424
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:26,867
and then...

425
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:32,411
partners can actually give that to their customers, they can share it and it was something positive.

426
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:39,516
So this is what the part about more about the choice we made in terms of design and what I

427
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:45,240
want to talk to you now a bit more is about what the client say, what our partners say because

428
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,603
we have the direct relations so we talk a lot with them because we're actually learning a lot

429
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:54,446
from the market and actually what does it reveal for the market in general.

430
00:24:55,864 --> 00:25:02,188
So we have a lot of data. We track how players are playing and it gives us some interesting

431
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:07,310
statistics. So for example, in terms of number of players, and I think we were surprised by this

432
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:13,854
because if you look overall at our games, you actually have more two-player sessions than

433
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:19,617
four-player sessions. In escape room, in traditional escape room location, there's

434
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:23,239
more four players, but in general, for example, in VR arcade, there's more two players.

435
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:29,984
And I think what we realize is VR Escape Room is a fantastic experience for couples.

436
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:37,806
Lots of people have the adventure together as a couple and I really, we're always saying now to

437
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:42,847
our partners, you know, think in your marketing to target couples, to do something together,

438
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:47,528
because that's really something which is very strong, which you can actually do together.

439
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:53,950
One of the things that I was mentioning before about average completion time

440
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,391
is you can see the kind of distribution and the difference between actually Pyramid and Melusa.

441
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:05,853
And having this 54 minutes is really more optimal because you have very few people

442
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:09,455
who are able to finish before the 30 minutes, where I'd feel a bit too much.

443
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:14,557
And to actually help partners to manage this, we have a kind of leaderboard, which is not to

444
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:20,281
encourage teams to be fast, because we want people to take advantage, but it's to be able

445
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:25,423
to say to somebody who's been very fast, look, you are among the best guys, so you're a great team.

446
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:30,066
Don't be upset. I mean, you've done so well. I mean, we could not expect you to actually do so well.

447
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:41,373
In terms of completion rate, there's more people who are finishing the game in escape rooms locations, but...

448
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:42,394
There's a bat.

449
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:47,221
We should not think that these people are actually more efficient in doing it.

450
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:51,604
It's just that traditional escape rooms have a different approach to booking.

451
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,267
So basically, often they don't have just a 60 minute time slot.

452
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:58,910
Some want to have 75 or 90 minutes because their approach is to say,

453
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,971
I want everybody to finish.

454
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:01,792
I want to talk to them before.

455
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,133
So they take more time.

456
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:06,956
And that's actually why there is actually a bigger time, because in general,

457
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:11,940
there is a very similar success factor between one or the other.

458
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,792
And then what we do, because we have this direct relation

459
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,854
with our different partners, we are doing lots of survey

460
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:19,214
with them.

461
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,796
So this one is a bit old, because it

462
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:23,538
was done before the release of Medusa.

463
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,562
But it's still valid in terms of information

464
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,064
that had been shared with us.

465
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:33,226
So as you can see, in the surveys,

466
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:35,368
there's a split between Escape Room and VR Arcade.

467
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,331
We have just all been entering about.

468
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:44,093
our questions. So one of the first questions we asked them is, is the revenue in line with your

469
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:50,735
expectation? So we were happy to see that 60% say yes, but actually you do realize that for 30,

470
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:57,396
35% they say it was below expectation, what they got as a result. And so we were asking them,

471
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:01,497
so why do you think it is below expectation? What can we do about it?

472
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:07,598
So one of the comments we've got usually is the fact that because we are two or four players,

473
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:13,623
if you are, especially if you're on escape room, usually you bring groups of five, six people

474
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:18,767
together, which you actually cannot do right now. And it makes sense because if you put six people

475
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:22,831
instead of four, you're going to have a kind of better business. So we know it's not something

476
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:27,235
we can do. But a lot of the comments are not so much related about this, are more related about.

477
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,694
it's still very new, so we still need to communicate. We thought that just because it's

478
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:37,258
VR, because you have a big brand, it's going to pick up just like this. It's not the case.

479
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:46,686
And actually, people sometimes underestimate the effort you need to do to market actually VR and

480
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:52,611
the experience outside of VR. And basically, what we can really see is that there is

481
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:59,564
not a general happy and acceptance of VR and there are very lots of differences

482
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:06,006
per venues and per type of consumers and basically you still need to convince

483
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:06,466
mainstream.

484
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:13,670
It's quite interesting because some of our partners are doing pretty well, meaning that

485
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,693
some VR arcade are really, because it's a bit different than their traditional model, which is

486
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:23,196
a pay per minute, this is a pay per session, you book one hour, so it's something different for

487
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:28,700
them, but some are really trying to emphasize the fact it's different from the typical VR arcade

488
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,883
where you can get access to a big catalog of games, you come from a session, and the one who

489
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,145
market this as an escape room

490
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:41,071
What they're telling us, it's super interesting for them because they are bringing in people

491
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,054
who would never come, actually.

492
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,877
to a VR arcade because they are not interested or they do not know about it because they don't have

493
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:51,398
this term of acceptance but they are interested by escape room and if you like escape room

494
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:56,320
you like a challenge so if it's in VR it's okay you can pick it up but what they are saying is by

495
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,603
doing so actually this guy have discovered that VR is cool and some of them actually are coming

496
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:07,605
back to the to the location so there is an interest by entering by a kind of a different

497
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:08,586
side to the market.

498
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:11,384
What we also ask them is,

499
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:13,606
do you think you're going to increase the space

500
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:16,929
dedicated to VR escape room in your venue?

501
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:22,935
As you can see, lots of people were actually in favor of doing it.

502
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:27,219
Actually, almost half of these people were people who mentioned before.

503
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:34,895
that the revenue was below their expectation. So we were a bit, well, we are happy because we

504
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:39,677
think it's better, but we wanted to understand why is that. And I think one of the reasons we've got

505
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:46,101
is when we ask them, is the feedback that you got from customers,

506
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:51,424
on the experiment. Is it in line with your expectation? Is it below or above? And actually,

507
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:56,405
I think that's one of the reasons. Actually, even though they played the game before,

508
00:30:56,645 --> 00:31:03,447
they know how they are. The feedback they got is actually excellent. And it really shows you that

509
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:10,329
when VR is excellent, people are doing better. So they see that there is something there which

510
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,110
is going to grow and get better over time.

511
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,080
So actually when you ask them, how bright do you see the future for VR escape rooms?

512
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,381
So it's on a scale from one to seven, you can see everybody's about four.

513
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,922
And actually almost 60% were saying that there is a real opportunity.

514
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:32,763
And actually something that I can say we've seen on the market, and it's quite new, because

515
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:38,484
when we started two years ago, we had never heard about this, but now we have many actually

516
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:39,225
people saying.

517
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:44,111
I'm going to do an escape room business, but it's going to be solely with VR experience,

518
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:49,315
because we think it's a future, we think it's working, and actually now we have about 240

519
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:56,880
partners, eight of them are doing exclusively escape room in VR, and I think it's a trend

520
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,362
which is going to actually continue.

521
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:04,405
Finally, I wanted to go maybe a bit beyond the data.

522
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:09,286
Not that I have certainty about how to market and address

523
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:11,907
the consumers, because it's still difficult.

524
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,108
We still need to learn about it.

525
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,769
But there's a couple of points which I think are interesting.

526
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:18,369
And if you have some idea, I'm also

527
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:23,291
interested to discuss after the talk with you

528
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:24,471
to see what we can do.

529
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,732
One of the first thing we are always telling,

530
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:29,273
especially Escape Room, is,

531
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:33,846
You need to explain to people that VR is not a gaming console.

532
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:39,452
I mean, you're not going to pay $30 to go and play on PlayStation outside your home.

533
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,874
And that's still what lots of people believe.

534
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:46,960
They don't understand that what we're doing are not video games,

535
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,442
they are experiences. And it's fundamentally different.

536
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:54,490
And when you are able to go beyond that, when people understand that this is the case,

537
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:57,437
they have a very different relation to what VR is.

538
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,664
And I think that's one of the challenges we've got is how do we communicate that.

539
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:02,640
I don't have the solution.

540
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,083
The one thing I know is we should not market it as a video game.

541
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:10,188
So for example, I'm a bit hardcore on this topic,

542
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:14,993
but there's not one trailer of our games available outside.

543
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:18,237
So what you've seen today are the only moving images

544
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,418
that have been produced.

545
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:20,619
So you have an idea.

546
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,180
But because

547
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:29,403
they don't properly relate what you do and what you see. It's always below. So I know that everybody

548
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:34,106
wants to communicate and they say we need the trailer, we need something, but I mean our game

549
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:38,910
is never going to look as good as the last Assassin's Creed because it's the way it is,

550
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:45,255
we are not a 2D game. So I don't have the solution, but I think we should not do that. We really need

551
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:50,719
to market it as an experience because that makes a difference. And the one thing I've seen which is

552
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:51,700
really really working.

553
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:53,419
actually is...

554
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,140
you need to let people try.

555
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:00,263
And that's one of the things that some of our escape rooms

556
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:00,724
are doing.

557
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,225
When they finish a traditional one,

558
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:05,187
they go back in the lobby where you have this character.

559
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:06,388
They just put the headset.

560
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:09,150
It can be 10 seconds, but in 10 seconds,

561
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,332
the guy understands it's something different.

562
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:13,994
And something similar I remember,

563
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:18,277
which I thought was very clever, a surveyor in their arcade,

564
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:19,418
actually in Torrance.

565
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:21,940
What they had, they had a very nice arcade,

566
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,821
and he's giving on a big mall down the street.

567
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:31,168
you have a very big transparent front window and what we are putting just in front is Richie's

568
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:37,233
plank and basically you could see from the outside people and basically tell you what is this that's

569
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:42,938
very different it's again going into the direction of this is an experience and it's not just a video

570
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:49,343
game and that's what is making I think location-based entertainment VR actually successful.

571
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:55,647
So that's pretty much everything I've got to share with you today.

572
00:34:55,667 --> 00:35:00,530
I think if you have questions, maybe we have a bit of time, I'll be happy to answer them,

573
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,092
or I can answer some afterwards, or you can send me an email.

574
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:10,436
And if you want to do VR, actually we have lots of opportunities in Ubisoft Dusseldorf.

575
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:11,076
It's really cool.

576
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:17,420
And if a French guy is telling you that it's cool to live in Germany, it's probably true.

577
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:19,601
Thank you very much.
