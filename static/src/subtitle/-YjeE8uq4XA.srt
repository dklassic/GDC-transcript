1
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:11,588
My name is Raoul Barbet, I'm the creative director and music supervisor of Life is Strange,

2
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:15,310
and here is Sébastien Gaillard, the audio director.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,973
We are here today to talk about the use of music in Life is Strange, in all the Life

4
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:26,396
is Strange games we have created, Life is Strange 1, Life is Strange 2, and the awesome

5
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:27,697
adventures of Captain Spirit.

6
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:35,607
how we have integrated the music between the creation of the score and the use of the listen tracks.

7
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:39,689
First, we are quickly going to present ourselves and our background.

8
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,270
Hi everyone, I'm Sébastien Gaillard, a video game audio director.

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:54,771
I've started my career as a sound engineer in music recording studios, mainly for Sony Music,

10
00:00:54,771 --> 00:01:02,953
but also worked on Femi Kuti's album Shoki Shoki, a famous Afrobeat artist, as an engineer assistant.

11
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:08,734
My first video game experience began at Cryo Interactive in 2000, mostly on adventure games.

12
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:16,884
When the studio collapsed, I became a freelance sound designer for Ubisoft, Darkworks and Arkane Studios,

13
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:23,211
where I worked on the amazing Dark Messiah of Mighty Magic game.

14
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:29,558
In 2010, I've joined Dontnod on Remember Me, and I'm now audio director on Laughy Strange Games, working closely with Raoul.

15
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,795
So my name is Raoul Barbet, I'm a video game and film director.

16
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:43,760
I've studied engineering and I've begun my career in the cultural and audiovisual fields

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,104
in film festivals, for example in Canada and Europe and audiovisual centers in Cambodia.

18
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:55,349
The first game I've worked on was Heavy Rain, on both motion capture and game design.

19
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,774
I've moved to the film industry with Illumination McGuff and The Lorax

20
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:03,676
as a layout artist with the team behind Despicable Me.

21
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:10,722
After this film, I missed a bit of interactivity, so I joined Dontnod for the first game of

22
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:19,430
the studio called Remember Me, and then Life is Strange, that has begun as an indie project

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,672
to become an important brand for Square Enix.

24
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,765
The game was a huge surprise and we decided very quickly to continue to work with Michel

25
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,909
Corr, the other director with me, and Jean-Luc Canot, the original writer.

26
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:38,514
Between the two Life is Strange games, I've co-founded an animation studio based in Paris,

27
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:44,419
Capsule, specialized in high-quality CGI trailers and cinematics.

28
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,444
But let's go back to the game now and all the work we have done with Sébastien.

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,641
So today we will talk about the use of music in the three games we have created.

30
00:02:57,641 --> 00:03:01,882
Life is Strange 1, five episodes during 2015 and early 16.

31
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,083
We follow the character of Max Caulfield.

32
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:11,085
The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit in June 2018.

33
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:15,006
This game is completely free, so don't hesitate to play it.

34
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:18,227
And you will discover the character of the young Chris.

35
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:25,874
And finally, Life is Strange 2, Episode 1 and 2 are already out, Episode 3 soon, following

36
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,195
the two brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz.

37
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:34,278
We won't talk about the game Before the Storm that has been made by another development

38
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:34,478
team.

39
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,028
As you see, we switched our graphic engine between the first and the second Life is Strange,

40
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:44,312
as well as updated our Y version.

41
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:49,519
For the ones who don't know about the games, here's a video showing the mood of each one.

42
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:30,023
Let's say sunshine for everyone

43
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:36,905
But as far as I can remember

44
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,593
It's just me, Captain Spirit.

45
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,436
This is Chris of Flying Fortress.

46
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,577
Have you spotted Snowmancer?

47
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:58,238
Not yet.

48
00:04:58,238 --> 00:05:00,440
Keep me posted.

49
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,001
Chris, breakfast.

50
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,822
Okay, dad.

51
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,904
You're drinking beer?

52
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,845
I don't need a lecture from my son.

53
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,428
I always get picked last for the team at school,

54
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,510
and they never throw the ball to me.

55
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,392
They can't tell stories like you can, can they?

56
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,833
No way.

57
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,282
I have no idea where we are.

58
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:29,286
Feels like we're walking nowhere.

59
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:34,289
I don't think Daniel understands what's going on.

60
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:35,069
On the ground!

61
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:44,375
Don't move!

62
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,838
What are we gonna do now?

63
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,101
There's nothing we can't do.

64
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,427
As long as we're together.

65
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,220
So here is the plan we are going to follow today.

66
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,381
First, a general introduction to our project

67
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,603
and the way we use music.

68
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:19,544
The first scene we have created,

69
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:22,546
how it gives a general philosophy behind the games.

70
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,247
We'll talk about the creation of the score

71
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:26,189
and the use of licensed tracks,

72
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,731
the interaction between our characters and the music.

73
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,412
We'll conclude with a piece of work

74
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,193
about the artists themselves.

75
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:42,130
We wanted to warn you that this talk contains some spoilers from Life is Strange 1 only.

76
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,511
I think.

77
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:44,172
Sorry for that.

78
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,223
So for the ones who don't know about the franchise, I will describe very quickly the games we are creating.

79
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:56,608
It's narrative-driven games where player choices and consequences are very important.

80
00:06:56,608 --> 00:07:03,513
It can be seen as an evolution of the old adventure games with mostly exploration, interaction and dialogue choices.

81
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:06,836
They take place nowadays in the same realistic universe.

82
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:09,178
You can have links between them.

83
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:15,796
We tell stories of believable characters facing real life issues

84
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:19,197
and exploring different sides of our society.

85
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:23,499
We also want to deal with difficult themes for the first Life is Strange,

86
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:28,321
for example, difficulties you can face as a teenager to become an adult,

87
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:30,142
social harassment, depression,

88
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:35,024
and or grief and education for the second Life is Strange.

89
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:42,347
We try to put the player in interesting situations where choices can be difficult and impactful.

90
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,128
Let's go back to the music.

91
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:49,630
Music was a huge part of the project since the beginning.

92
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,814
Why? Because we strongly believe in power of sound and music in narrative and wanted to use them as a key element.

93
00:07:56,814 --> 00:08:02,816
But this use has to be original and linked to our story.

94
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:06,678
and our characters. It has to bring a lot to the scenes.

95
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:09,639
To achieve that, we decided very early

96
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,741
in the production to have a mix of licensed tracks and original score.

97
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:17,283
Our stories take place in a realistic world,

98
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:22,985
so the presence of existing songs was a great way to anchor them into reality.

99
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,607
And of course, also to emphasize the emotion of some sequences.

100
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:38,413
I work with Sébastien for years now and I was really happy to begin a project where we will be able to work end in end.

101
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:46,136
So we are discussing a lot with the audio team and also Michel Corr, the other director with me, about the songs and all the score.

102
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:50,937
A lot of questions are always asked before beginning to work on a scene.

103
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,121
What is the purpose of this scene?

104
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:57,523
Why having music at this specific moment?

105
00:08:57,523 --> 00:09:00,145
Why this artist or this original score?

106
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,446
It's really important to have a good reason

107
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,708
to have a song or music in a scene.

108
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,170
We didn't want to create a jukebox of songs we like

109
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,431
just because we want to hear them in the games.

110
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:13,113
It's really important and sometimes difficult

111
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:14,534
to choose them for this reason.

112
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:22,856
So it's a lot of research, listening to artists, taking some notes about each song to be prepared to find the good one.

113
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:35,500
Also, as music supervisor, I have to be careful that each song is really meaningful, but also could be used in a sequence or on a cinematographic point of view,

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,461
for the rhythm or the length, for example, and will work on a technical point of view.

115
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,242
I will let Seb talk about the technique.

116
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:51,391
So the audio integration is not very complicated

117
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,892
on a technical point of view.

118
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,095
Tips and methods that we will show you

119
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,916
are already used in a lot of games.

120
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,679
The idea here is more on how we use those techniques

121
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,002
with the constraints and the style of game we are creating.

122
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:13,589
Due to episodic formats, games formats, sorry, we have to finish all audio, music integration

123
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,931
and mix before launching a new episode, every three months.

124
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:26,596
Every main feature may have also to be finalized in the first episode for technical reasons.

125
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,057
Licensed tracks have also to be secured early.

126
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,981
Money and overall budget are of course part of the equation when selecting a track and

127
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:38,142
find a good balance with the original score.

128
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:47,666
So our main engine middlewares used on these games were Epic Unreal Engine 3 and 4, Stenberg

129
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:53,248
Nuendo, AudioKineticWise, CryRare SoftDeck 2 and RadToolsBink.

130
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:57,250
So you will see all along this talk many contents based on them.

131
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:05,767
We think the first scene we have created in Life is Strange games is a good example to begin with.

132
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,571
This scene was used to sell the project to Square Enix.

133
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:13,837
It's the moment in the first episode when Max, the main character of Life is Strange 1,

134
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:16,140
is reunited with an old friend, Chloe.

135
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,107
Here he is.

136
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,348
In this scene, she's discovering Chloe's room

137
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,109
after five years.

138
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,630
The player can really dive into Chloe's universe,

139
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,672
and it was really important to describe this character

140
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:34,014
perfectly as a player will follow her during five episodes.

141
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:36,796
A lot of details can help in this kind of moment.

142
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,577
Writing, acting, body and voice,

143
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:42,378
design, interactions, environment,

144
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:45,040
camera work, and of course, music.

145
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,263
Here we have the chance to include Santa Monica Dream by Angus and Julia Stone.

146
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:57,549
This song was important because more than just describing the mood of our characters,

147
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:01,351
it gives this nostalgic feeling to the whole scene,

148
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:06,235
and shows what will be the indie folk vibe we have tried to keep all along the episode.

149
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:14,026
So this first scene is quite simple.

150
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,947
The way it has been done is usual in movies,

151
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:19,868
but it was something we wanted to try and see

152
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,408
how it can render in our game.

153
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,889
Like Raoul was saying, the whole audio direction

154
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,830
really started here by engraving the music

155
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,831
in the heart of the game.

156
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:36,033
So the player has Max, has to find a CD.

157
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,482
The music will be played in 3D from the speakers.

158
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:52,126
So as you can see here, you can see the evolution of the sound.

159
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:56,229
We added pan, filtering, and of course, reverberation.

160
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:59,712
Anyway, you can find tools to fix your camera in the garage.

161
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,053
Chloe, are you OK?

162
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:01,673
Sure, I'm awesome.

163
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:05,716
I just want to blaze and be alone for a moment.

164
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,002
So we wanted this music to begin as diegetic or part of the world

165
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:30,526
and then become extra diegetic or traditional score when the player takes control of Max.

166
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:41,713
I haven't seen this place in five years. Seems like forever.

167
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:44,715
By doing this, the song is treated like in-game musical score

168
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:47,917
accompanying Max as she discovers Chloe's house.

169
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:53,598
I can feel autumn pushing out to summer.

170
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:58,166
This is creating a bubble around Max and the player.

171
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,896
Following this idea, let's have a look at another example from Life is Strange 2.

172
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:12,521
At the very beginning of the game we have the song Listomania from French band Phoenix.

173
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:18,406
During this scene, Sean Diaz, a 16 years old teenager, is coming back from school with his friends.

174
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:23,491
We wanted to have this teenage movie feeling, a light and festive atmosphere,

175
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,753
to contrast with the terrible event that will occur after.

176
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:32,976
On the music treatment, you will see that it's the exact contrary as the previous example.

177
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:39,819
Here, a song in 2D is used as score and will be transformed into diegetic coming from the bus.

178
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:43,200
Again, very classic cinematographic technique.

179
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,862
Notice that the video and song has been cut just for this presentation.

180
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:09,225
Not sentimental, no romantic, not disgusting yet.

181
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,667
Darling, I'm down and lonely.

182
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,250
When were the fortunate only?

183
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,511
A list of many a.

184
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:19,655
A glance would see it through.

185
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,957
Like a ride, like a ride.

186
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:26,521
Nothing's only offended.

187
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,447
See you tonight!

188
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,969
Don't be late, losers!

189
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:06,297
The song is not chosen by the character. Here, it's an element of the world around her.

190
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:11,600
The EV sound is quite impressive and the idea was to reinforce the

191
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,623
oppression Max can feel by being there and the difference between her and the people

192
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:18,284
around.

193
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:29,310
So as Raoul said, we wanted this song to be massive in terms of audio rendering as soon as the player opens the curtain

194
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,130
of the entrance.

195
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,212
Let's see.

196
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:29,091
So you hear the song in 2D at the beginning, but we also added a 3D layer of this one that

197
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:33,114
came from the speakers as the player is back in gameplay on the dance floor.

198
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:45,701
to say that even if you're out of your fear.

199
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,842
Also, the core gameplay feature of Life is Strange 1

200
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:48,563
was the rewind.

201
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,085
Any time the player used it, we managed to go back

202
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,206
in time in the track.

203
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:17,828
Just to explain quickly some technical aspects,

204
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:23,551
this is a global view of the swimming pool level in Unreal Editor.

205
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:29,455
We used a WiseBlend container with three synchronized tracks,

206
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:33,358
a 5.1 for global rendering for players who got the chance

207
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,278
to play in Surround.

208
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:38,004
A mono file for the speakers.

209
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:42,565
The green 3D sound you see here are not playing audio,

210
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:47,886
but they send a RTPC based on the player distance from speakers to the track.

211
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:53,148
And at last, another stereo muffled version of the song

212
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:56,028
when the player is in the bathroom at the back of the party.

213
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:07,836
The whole track is a mix of seven songs that last around 13 minutes made by Louis Martin, the sound designer who worked on this scene.

214
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:15,062
Additional tracks in this remix have been selected from a global music company we work with

215
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:15,883
called Audio Network.

216
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,734
As our technology did not handle full audio rewind,

217
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:25,296
we used a fake Unreal matinee, which

218
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:28,258
unbended the WiseBlend container.

219
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:31,941
It allowed us to resynchronize the music whenever

220
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,864
the player decided to rewind.

221
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:37,846
We also managed checkpoints and restored the exact time

222
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,268
in the audio track by seeking in the matinee

223
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:43,431
when reloading the scene.

224
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:47,634
Raoul, let's go talk about the original score now.

225
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:58,656
Jonathan Morali, you can see him here, has composed the original score of Life is Strange 1 and 2.

226
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:06,086
Jonathan is the leader of the French band Sin Matters. They have released four albums since 2003.

227
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:12,089
I'm a huge fan of Jonathan since the beginning, and when we have started to think about Mac's

228
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:17,011
character and the mood of the game, the music of Sin Matters came quickly in my mind.

229
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:22,113
The feeling you have listening to his music is exactly what we wanted to achieve with

230
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:23,153
our game.

231
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:27,975
This nostalgia, sadness, with moments of hope, and incredible melodies.

232
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:34,022
We have used very soon two titles of the band in the first episode.

233
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:40,649
Jonathan has already composed for movies, animated features and documentaries, but it was his first game.

234
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,893
He's a gamer, so he understood very quickly our needs.

235
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:48,198
We wanted to thank him today for his incredible work.

236
00:20:52,312 --> 00:21:01,454
So for Life is Strange 1, Jonathan delivered around 30 minutes of music covering eight different themes

237
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:09,236
dedicated to characters, Max and Chloe, Kate, or to areas of the game, Campus, Blackwell Academy

238
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:13,417
and to different moods of the game, Golden Hour, alternate realities, The Storm.

239
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:21,578
Jonathan had to compose something that was enough structured as a whole song and could be used in various ways.

240
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:26,784
Each theme should be representative of the song if played alone.

241
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:31,931
Every song can be looked forever without being boring or losing the feeling of the game.

242
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:39,560
In the end, we made more than 4 hour music remix based on these 13 minutes.

243
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:45,604
For Life is Strange 2, the story was a road trip.

244
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,007
We knew that we wouldn't be able to reuse the same themes,

245
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,649
so we aimed for much more than the first one,

246
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:56,072
to cover all of our needs in terms of moods, characters,

247
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:58,874
and to be able to have an evolution of the music

248
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:00,215
all along the episodes.

249
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,510
To show how we work on the score, we will take the example of what we have called Zen

250
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,850
Sequences.

251
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,473
In our games, at specific occasions, the player can choose to take his time, sit on a bench

252
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:23,995
like on the screenshot, lie on his bed, and it will launch a Zen Sequence.

253
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:32,194
It's a peaceful moment allowing to dive into characters' state of mind, Max, Chris or Sean,

254
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,295
and learn more about their feelings.

255
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:40,159
The player will hear voiceover but also enjoy new camera angle and music.

256
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,484
Those moments of contemplation and nostalgia are optional and are a reward for the curious

257
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:47,905
players who take their time.

258
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:54,208
For each of them, we have edited a unique remix of Jonathan's score, based on the situation,

259
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,689
the writing, and also the mood of the scene.

260
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:03,793
The example we are going to show you is coming from the fourth episode of Life is Strange 1.

261
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:11,417
Max is in a parallel timeline because of her action, and the character of Chloe is now suffering from an important handicap.

262
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:19,316
The bedroom we knew is no longer used, the player will find an empty one full of memories.

263
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:26,400
Max can sit and we will launch a then sequence allowing the player also to think about the

264
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,461
past actions.

265
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:34,365
You see the new window session here and we will add new layers to the music, acoustic

266
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,966
guitars linked to Max during this sequence.

267
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:42,109
Notice that we have only kept the music in the extract without voices and sound effects.

268
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:39,472
You

269
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:57,294
So this is how the transition has been managed in Wwise for most of the Zen sequences.

270
00:24:57,294 --> 00:25:06,697
To achieve a better in-out of the three guitars in this example, we use the same-time playing segment Wwise feature,

271
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:12,519
rather than doing this with a multitrack and a classical RTPC linked to the volume.

272
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:19,202
This allows the guitar to come at the grid, which is musically better than at random points.

273
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:24,015
We also added a fade-in-out between those two segments.

274
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,537
Guitar will come quickly as the player triggers the then

275
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:30,899
sequences, but will fade a longer time on exit.

276
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:41,044
Another example of the use of the score is the menu.

277
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:51,854
As our games are episodic, the menu is really important for us because it's a way to bring the player back in the universe of the game.

278
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:59,517
As you can see, on the left is changed one menu, the background view and the ambient sound are evolving, but the music is staying the same.

279
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:04,399
The strong main theme of the game linked all those different menus together.

280
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:33,922
For the second opus we wanted to begin with something very similar to Lefty Strange 1

281
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:37,970
with a folk vibe and this neighborhood feeling.

282
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,495
So at the beginning of the first episode you will have this menu.

283
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:47,321
After the terrible incident in Seattle, we wanted to break everything the player and

284
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,882
the two brothers knew before.

285
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:53,484
They have left Seattle and are now alone on the road.

286
00:26:53,484 --> 00:27:00,167
So during the same first episode, if the player is going back to the menu after the incident,

287
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:03,188
the menu will have changed, and also the music.

288
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:09,464
So it's another theme.

289
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:12,346
The Seattle theme you've just heard is no longer playing

290
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:15,607
and is replaced by the one from Into the Woods.

291
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:18,809
The player will be able to listen to the Seattle theme

292
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,311
only during the moments when Sean is thinking about the past

293
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:29,215
and his father.

294
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,316
So another important thing we wanted

295
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,678
to have an audio link and consistency between the score

296
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:37,819
and some major sound players' feedbacks.

297
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,804
Major choice is a moment when the time is freezed to take an important decision.

298
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:48,186
We use an extract from the first composed score.

299
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:52,369
It's not a sound effects, but an edit of three different stems mixed together

300
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,732
that can loop forever until player makes his decision.

301
00:27:55,732 --> 00:28:06,179
Whose is it?

302
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm sorry.

303
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,581
That was my joint.

304
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,281
Well, well.

305
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:16,621
So, no matter what music is playing at this moment, it can blend and highlight this suspended

306
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:16,861
time.

307
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:24,407
The consequences of player's choice is shown by an animated butterfly.

308
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:27,769
We also used some very small elements of the score for this feedback.

309
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:41,637
At last, we almost did the same with the inventory sound.

310
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:46,661
We used a simple guitar chord taken from some additional recording session with Jonathan.

311
00:28:46,661 --> 00:29:01,332
So the music of our game is a mix between original score and existing listen tracks.

312
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:04,635
So we now are going to analyze some songs we have used in our games.

313
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:10,730
The first example coming from Life is Strange 1 is a scene where you hear the last words

314
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,112
of one opponent of Max, Nathan Prescott, who has already disappeared.

315
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:21,534
The rhythm of the voice of Nathan, the beat, the silence, the reaction of Max are very

316
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:22,455
important in this scene.

317
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:28,097
In the meantime, Max is in the middle of a huge tornado and the whole city is beginning

318
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,177
to be destroyed.

319
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:33,639
So I will show you a video of the scene, listen carefully to the music and we will discuss

320
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,760
about it just after.

321
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:10,972
I told you, I, Trust Limbo, have been warning you people for years that our culture of sin and entitlement would lead to God striking us down.

322
00:30:10,972 --> 00:30:14,273
And I'm the one trapped in this fucking radio station.

323
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,414
Somebody get me the hell out of here now! Now, goddammit!

324
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:26,158
How do I pay all those taxes, man?

325
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,458
You have one new message.

326
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:33,574
Message received yesterday at 9pm.

327
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:34,974
Max, it's Nathan.

328
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:37,776
I just wanted to say...

329
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:38,837
I'm sorry.

330
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,300
I didn't want to hurt Kate, or Rachel, or...

331
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,982
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

332
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:50,364
Everybody...used me.

333
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:54,567
Mr. Jefferson, he's coming for me now.

334
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,568
All this shit...it'll be over soon.

335
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:11,345
Watch out, Max. He wants to hurt you next.

336
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:12,686
Sorry.

337
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:33,027
So we can think here it's a specific score composed for this sequence, but we used an existing track.

338
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:37,549
The name of the song is The Sense of Me by Mudflow.

339
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:39,109
And the track is not edited at all.

340
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:43,611
Let's explain quickly how we proceed when we work on a sequence like that.

341
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,854
The first step is to feel the important moments of the scene.

342
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:53,820
So here for example we have the escape from the dark room with the car and the introduction

343
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,425
of the end of the world feeling, the radio speech that gives more pressure, the reception

344
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:05,812
signal of the message itself and Nathan's cues.

345
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:12,765
Nesson saying I'm sorry, which is very emotional when you know the guy.

346
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:16,387
Max's reaction to the fact that those are his last words.

347
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:21,870
And of course the destruction of the town the moment Max exits the car and the player

348
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,711
is back in gameplay.

349
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:30,535
Here is a window session we have created to show you the process.

350
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:34,658
You can recognize the different voices in pink, green and yellow.

351
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:41,982
You have the song itself in blue, and we have schematized the different layers that are

352
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:43,525
composing the song.

353
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:47,431
It's not the real layers, because we don't have access to them, but it's to show the

354
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:47,791
principle.

355
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,958
Again, the only change we have made on the song is the volume.

356
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:59,548
So the second step will be to analyze the song and the important moments that make us love it.

357
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:06,714
We will then try to maximize the synergies between the song, beats, and the sequence itself.

358
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:11,017
For example, the beginning of the melodic guitar while escaping the dark room,

359
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:16,081
the drums and bass to break the radio speech and prepare for the reception of the message,

360
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:22,826
the violin entrance and what I have called the take-off that gives to Nathan Maysett a lot of emotion.

361
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:30,734
The first vocals, just after Nathan has worn Max and begin to apologize.

362
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,275
Just a quick note about lyrics and vocals in a song.

363
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:37,618
It's really complicated to mix them with a character talking.

364
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:42,220
We have to be careful to keep them understandable and emotive.

365
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:47,642
It's sometimes less than a second that changes a lot for the feeling you want to create.

366
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:56,144
For example, I remember spending a lot of time with Sébastien to find the right moment to have the sorry moment of Nathan and the entrance of the backing vocals.

367
00:34:56,144 --> 00:35:00,786
It's a classic technique, but when it works, it could completely change the feeling of a cue.

368
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,446
You have noticed the electric guitar at the very end to highlight the tone destruction

369
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:13,695
and the moment when Max is exiting the car keeping only the melodic guitar with all the

370
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:18,702
other layers down, with in the end the huge ambience of the storm coming up.

371
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:26,050
So it's a lot of back and forth between the audio team and the camera team to finalize this kind of scene

372
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,312
with adjustments in editing and framing.

373
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:32,417
So I wanted to thank the camera team for their patience and incredible work.

374
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:38,664
It could be seen as small details sometimes, but I think it helps to have the emotion maximized.

375
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:42,046
I know a lot of players love Nathan.

376
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:45,809
I think he's one of the most interesting characters, lonely and sad,

377
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:51,112
so it was important for us to take some time for his ending sequence.

378
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:59,698
That is even more true that he was only there through a voicemail.

379
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:03,726
So you can see here how this scene was built inside the

380
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:07,370
engine to achieve seamless transition between gameplay,

381
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:12,035
real time, and pre-rendered cinematics.

382
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:15,218
It was really important for us to maintain a continuous flow

383
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,199
on the screen.

384
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,084
So we used a Bing video in between the two Unreal levels

385
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,545
to avoid any loading screen.

386
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:30,048
This ensures a perfect audio synchronization no matter the hardware platform.

387
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:36,316
Because on Life is Strange 1, the challenge was also to make this work on all generation

388
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:39,760
consoles, PS3 and Xbox 360, as well as next generation.

389
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:51,994
This kind of process Raoul has described was used many times when we have some music behind.

390
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:56,275
He analyses a track to create his cinematography on top of it.

391
00:36:56,275 --> 00:37:05,097
Here are some other examples we have used this process and seamless transition in Life is Strange 1.

392
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:10,698
The discovery of Rachel, the ending of episode 3, the endings of episode 1 and 5.

393
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:19,829
Here we have worked with the songs as a whole, but sometimes we are very lucky

394
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:24,191
and we can have access to tracks separated in layers.

395
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:28,572
So we'll take the example of the Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit.

396
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:34,755
The process is a bit different in this case because we are able to use a track in a new way.

397
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:38,556
Not just having an existing song on top of images.

398
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,098
We can reduce the volume of one instrument, create a new mix.

399
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,180
cut or create loops for a choice for example,

400
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,605
it's incredible for us to have access to this level of interactivity on an existing song.

401
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:56,930
Of course, what is really important in this case is to keep the spirit of the song,

402
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,892
its strength and to preserve the will of the artist.

403
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,014
As we can do all the changes we want,

404
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:05,397
we have to be careful to respect the original work of the musician.

405
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:11,474
So we'll take the example of the song Death With Dignity from Sufjan Stevens,

406
00:38:11,474 --> 00:38:15,199
which has become the score of the awesome adventures of Captain Spirit.

407
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,806
Sufjan is one of the greatest folk artists of our time.

408
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:23,751
We are really proud to have it in this game and wanted to thank him again for his trust.

409
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:35,717
So in Captain Spirit, you play Chris Erickson, a lonely and imaginative child who has lost his mother and lives alone with his father.

410
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:41,562
The player will have to discover during this game the past and the difficulties of this family.

411
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:50,849
This song and the whole album Carry On Lowell is very personal, talking about Sufjan Stevens' mother's death, dealing with difficult things.

412
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,150
So it was of course resonating with our own story.

413
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:05,010
So, we have decided to split the song in three parts, corresponding to the three verses of the original.

414
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:17,433
The first one is played when you see the introduction of the game.

415
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:21,154
You discover Chris' universe, the neighborhood, his bedroom.

416
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,154
It creates a perfect mood for our story.

417
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:40,516
Spirit of my silence, I can hear you, but I'm afraid to be near you, and I don't know where to begin.

418
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:53,142
The second part of the song is played if the player is going to the treehouse of Chris and launches a sequence.

419
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:59,546
It's an interesting moment because Chris is lonely in his world and is able to think of his mother.

420
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:16,550
Amethyst and flowers on the table

421
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,370
Is it real or a phase?

422
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,831
Will I suppose a friend?

423
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:22,254
One of the missions of Chris is to find an hidden treasure.

424
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,796
It's a small box with memories of his mother, drawings, photos.

425
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:31,080
Susan Stevens is talking directly about his mother, only in the third verse of the song.

426
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,882
It was supposed to be a moving moment for Chris and the player.

427
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:41,280
I forgive you, Mother, I can hear you

428
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,941
And I long to be near you

429
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,082
But every road leads to an end

430
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:50,043
Yes, every road leads to an end

431
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:54,865
Your apparition passes through me

432
00:40:54,865 --> 00:41:01,767
In the willows, in five red hens

433
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:04,308
You'll never see us again

434
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:15,578
So this song is perfect for us to create a beautiful and unique soundtrack for the game,

435
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:23,242
give a new insight on Chris' background with another very personal and strong family story,

436
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:28,044
and reward the players that are curious and manage to dive into Chris' universe.

437
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:35,148
We have used again some moments of this song when Sean and Daniel are meeting Chris in

438
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:37,229
the second episode of Life is Strange 2.

439
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,921
We didn't want to use our songs just as soundtracks, but also make them a real part of the world,

440
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,602
something that the characters can interact with.

441
00:41:52,602 --> 00:42:00,424
The next example is one of those interactions to thank again the players that are curious

442
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:02,384
and want to dive into the character universe.

443
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:09,885
You will hear a song from Rosé González, Crosses, an artist that Max likes a lot.

444
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:23,324
Home sweet home, my favorite cocoon.

445
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:26,786
So Max enters the bedroom and can learn some music on a stereo.

446
00:42:26,786 --> 00:42:35,290
So you hear the sound in 3D, like if you were in your own bedroom.

447
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,473
While listening, you can do different interactions with a book, water, plant.

448
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:46,376
But you can also grab your guitar and sit on a sofa.

449
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:56,397
So you will hear Max playing.

450
00:42:56,397 --> 00:43:03,245
These layers have been composed by Jonathan Morali on his own guitar, and we have asked

451
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:06,528
him to play as a teenager, a bit late, with some mistakes.

452
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:43,126
If you are still playing when the song is finished, Max will continue to play alone.

453
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:46,570
And of course, if you decide to get up, the last track will stop.

454
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:55,512
So this kind of small interactivity with the music, very simple, gives a lot to the universe

455
00:43:55,512 --> 00:44:01,538
because of the realism of the situation and to the characters because of the mood of Max

456
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,779
and the way she's playing guitar.

457
00:44:08,336 --> 00:44:12,681
For the first scene of the main character of Life is Strange 2, Sean Diaz, we wanted

458
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:13,782
something different.

459
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:17,887
He is younger than Max, lives with his father and young brother.

460
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:21,912
So we wanted the right mood and atmosphere while listening to his first song.

461
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:25,095
We decided to have a song from the streets on a flip of a coin.

462
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,902
The player enters Sean's room, discovers his universe.

463
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:41,326
It's quite similar as the scene you've just seen with Max from Left 4 Dead 1.

464
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:44,848
Sean can listen to music while doing his stuff.

465
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:06,308
I don't totally suck.

466
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:15,105
Somewhere up the line, a girl in the world, she's waiting for a boy.

467
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,504
So you can hear the character singing or trying to sing on top of the song.

468
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:28,909
Again we have asked our actor Gonzalo Martin to sing during the voice recording.

469
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:36,416
He was quite stressed about that, but it gives this great feeling you have when alone in

470
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,719
your bedroom or in your car, you sing very badly.

471
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:43,082
You all know this moment, I think.

472
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:50,095
So to achieve proper synchronization between the song lyrics and Shun voices,

473
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:58,437
we use the Wwise Music Custom Cue system by setting every moment we want Shun to sing.

474
00:45:58,437 --> 00:46:05,398
We also asked our audio programmer to implement callbacks from his custom cues in Halloween blueprints,

475
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:10,099
allowing us to get them in real time and trigger the relevant voices from Shun.

476
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:20,851
I just wanted to show you the overall blueprint that was handled by Yannick Tassin, the sound

477
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:22,853
designer responsible of this scene.

478
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:29,159
We had to manage checkpoints, 2D, 3D versions of the song, as well as ensure that our system

479
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:31,281
went through the global voice manager of the game.

480
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:43,385
Another quick example of our characters interacting with a song is at the end of the first episode.

481
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:52,451
Sean and Daniel are safe in a motel room and the player has something terrible to announce to his little brother.

482
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:59,716
When you are going back to the room to do so, Daniel has launched the TV and just wants to dance on the bed.

483
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,617
We use Block Party's song, Banquet.

484
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:14,239
Okay, don't think about it.

485
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:19,121
Just tell Daniel the truth.

486
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:20,782
Are you kidding me?

487
00:47:20,782 --> 00:47:23,463
Remember that song?

488
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:26,464
Come on, dance!

489
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:56,017
So in this specific case, as the player can take all the time he wants to make his choice,

490
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:58,558
it pushed us to create an infinite loop in the song.

491
00:47:58,558 --> 00:48:04,101
So we have split the track in three segments, intro, loop, and end.

492
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:08,243
So the song feeling is preserved.

493
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:15,166
On top of that, we use also a 3D 2D effect when both Sean and Daniel are dancing together.

494
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:19,388
And the music will of course stop if Sean gets out of the bed and switches off the TV.

495
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:30,280
So we are very lucky to use music from a lot of great artists.

496
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,861
We wanted to thank all of them again today.

497
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,102
We thank a lot of people today.

498
00:48:34,102 --> 00:48:38,825
But it's a very long process to have all those artists involved,

499
00:48:38,825 --> 00:48:42,267
and here is a quick description when everything works.

500
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:46,369
As already explained, for the selection of tracks of the game,

501
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:48,790
we gather titles from a lot of artists.

502
00:48:50,138 --> 00:49:00,947
For each track, I keep as much information as possible, the meanings of the lyrics, the feeling listening to it, the beats of the song, but also the backstory of the artist and the track itself.

503
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:13,578
It ends in a huge file full of song titles. As soon as I select a title, we will test it with the audio team and also the camera team, if it's a sequence.

504
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:18,682
If we are happy, we can ask for a price and finalize approval and contract.

505
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:23,789
It's long and complicated to get artist and publisher answer.

506
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:28,514
We work with Feel for Music Agency in London.

507
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:32,019
And thank you again Ben and Glenn, maybe they are here today,

508
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:34,862
for their help about all those contracts.

509
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:42,185
Video games, media, can be still seen as a card chase or a gunfight only.

510
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:46,167
So we have to explain a lot what we are doing, and the type of game we are creating.

511
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:51,028
I write letters for the artists, show some images, explain our philosophy.

512
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,975
But it's changing very quickly nowadays, so it's really cool for all the artists.

513
00:49:56,975 --> 00:50:03,742
Again, this process you've just seen here occurs when everything works perfectly.

514
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:10,910
In reality, it can also be like we don't have enough time to listen to all the music we would.

515
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,591
Nobody agrees with you, never.

516
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:19,258
Each time you test on a sequence it doesn't work, but in your mind it was just perfect.

517
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:21,580
You check the price and it's too expensive.

518
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,233
And let's say now that everything is working great,

519
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,455
every camera shot fits perfectly the song,

520
00:50:29,455 --> 00:50:31,216
you manage to deal the price,

521
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:34,579
and in the end, the artist say no.

522
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:37,641
So, of course, it's not always like that,

523
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,663
with those steps in this specific order.

524
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:42,045
Every case is really different,

525
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:44,207
but it's for sure a very long process

526
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,969
dealing with financial, legal, and creative aspects.

527
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:59,470
First of all, you can see the names of the different artists behind the artworks we have seen during this presentation.

528
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,772
We wanted to thank them for the wonderful work they have done.

529
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:11,796
As a conclusion, working on the music and how we integrate it in our games is one of the things I prefer in Life is Strange projects.

530
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:18,860
It's something very long and difficult, but it's like alchemy, and when it works, it's really, really powerful.

531
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:21,967
Let's end with some advice.

532
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:24,128
You can of course follow them or not.

533
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:29,190
Every project and every team is really different.

534
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:36,213
So first of all, the most important for us is don't use too much music.

535
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:42,927
Even if we love it, the main danger for us is to put too much music in our game.

536
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:46,809
We have to be really careful with that.

537
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:52,491
We really believe that it always be better to have some at very important moments.

538
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:57,554
We have seen too many games that have destroyed the strength of a musical score by putting

539
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:01,196
it everywhere.

540
00:52:01,196 --> 00:52:07,259
For the little ones, do not create a jokebox.

541
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:15,731
Do not select a song only because you love it.

542
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:19,973
It's really important to always communicate with the other teams.

543
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:25,376
Even if the music is great by itself, it could not work if the scenes and the design are

544
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,337
not prepared for it.

545
00:52:30,496 --> 00:52:33,919
Third one, don't ask too many people for feedback

546
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,143
and choose the songs wisely.

547
00:52:38,143 --> 00:52:40,505
Music is very personal and survey

548
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:43,488
can generate a lot of frustration in a team.

549
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:48,533
Be sure you have a general coherence in your music.

550
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,575
Having only one people is the best way to achieve that.

551
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,577
It could be the main composer

552
00:52:53,577 --> 00:52:56,080
or the creative director like for us.

553
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:07,484
And last one, always have a plan B, even a C. Easy one, but you have so many unexpected

554
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,308
events and you really have to be prepared.

555
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:18,076
Thank you everyone for listening.

556
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:19,077
Thank you for your presence.
