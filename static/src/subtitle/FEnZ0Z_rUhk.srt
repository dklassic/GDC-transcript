1
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:12,669
the future. Good afternoon,

2
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,430
everyone. I am so you lean. I'm

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,651
a user research. I'm a user

4
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:20,532
experience researcher from Net

5
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:22,433
East Games. It's a pity we

6
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:37,280
Playing games is no exception and our talk concerns on players' health too.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,142
It's my pleasure to introduce our research on visual fatigue when playing games.

8
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:47,703
So here is the outline of this talk.

9
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:54,706
First, I will briefly introduce some background on visual fatigue induced by viewing screens.

10
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,717
And in part two, I will talk about two experiments

11
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:04,341
we conducted to investigate visual fatigue, specifically

12
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,702
when playing video games.

13
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:11,888
And finally, part three, I will explain the common causes

14
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:16,152
of eye strain and give some suggestions for game designers

15
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:17,733
on how to avoid them.

16
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:22,197
Now let's start with part one.

17
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:30,571
As we know, looking at digital screens for long periods can cause a series of symptoms,

18
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:36,656
such as eye strain, headaches, bladder infection, dry eyes, and so on.

19
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:40,659
This is also known as computer vision syndrome.

20
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:47,264
With the growing popularity of handheld and head-mounted VR devices,

21
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:54,365
Visual fatigue is now a very real threat to the health and gaming experience of our players.

22
00:01:56,026 --> 00:02:02,731
Many reports and literatures have also concluded that screen usage might lead to eye strain,

23
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:08,375
especially for long durations. We also hear about players

24
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:12,346
complaining of eye discomfort after play sessions.

25
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:16,667
They wonder why some games lead to severe eye strain,

26
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:17,907
but not the other games.

27
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,728
They also try every way to relieve such discomfort.

28
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:27,189
Since user research aims to provide better experience

29
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:30,830
for users, the health of our users' eyes

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,871
is an important concern for us.

31
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:38,924
We want to know how game playing leads to visual fatigue

32
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:40,224
and how to relieve it.

33
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,005
So now, we will show two studies we

34
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:48,706
conducted to investigate eye strain for mobile games.

35
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:55,827
In study one, our aim was to set up an assessment tool.

36
00:02:56,287 --> 00:03:02,208
We wanted to find an objective and easy to implement

37
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:02,768
indicator.

38
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,574
and we hope it is comparable across different scenes.

39
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:14,160
So by reviewing literatures, we found several different methods,

40
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:18,064
including the first one is self-reporting,

41
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:23,150
which is easy, conductive and comparable between different scenes.

42
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,874
But it is obviously a very subjective method.

43
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:32,015
And we also found the second one, the optometric measurements,

44
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:37,657
which is absolutely objective, but it is very difficult to conduct.

45
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:43,579
And okay, the last, the third one, psychophysiological methods,

46
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,400
which fully meets our requirements.

47
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:54,590
So by using psychophysiological indicators, we measure one's physical states,

48
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,412
such as heart rate, eye movement, skin conductance, and so on.

49
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:05,814
Then we use these indicators to infer about their mental states.

50
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:13,736
In this study, we chose two indicators relating to visual sensitivity to infer eye strain.

51
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,917
So here is the first indicator we use in this study.

52
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:24,520
That is CFF, or critical flicker frequency.

53
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,863
It is one of the indicators we use

54
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,185
when measuring for eye strain.

55
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:35,409
Here we shown is the device we use to measure CFF.

56
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,573
An LED light is mounted inside this device.

57
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:49,803
subjects watch through the eyepieces and they can adjust the frequency of the LED.

58
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:56,689
Now let's watch an animation. Please beware of flashing patterns ahead.

59
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,264
Now let's watch this animation.

60
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:05,126
As we can see, the LED flashes at the beginning.

61
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:08,568
As subjects increase the frequency,

62
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:13,371
they begin to perceive the flashing LED as continuous.

63
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,913
When subjects feel the light is continuous,

64
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:19,034
we then record the frequency.

65
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:21,955
This frequency is the so-called CFF,

66
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,616
or the critical flicker frequency.

67
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,038
Let's watch the animation again.

68
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:30,144
Now at the beginning, it is flashing.

69
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:33,054
It's flashing and it's still flashing now.

70
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:36,456
Also a bit stable but still I can feel the flashing.

71
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:38,737
Okay, no flashes anymore.

72
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:43,760
Then in this case, CFF is at 30 hertz.

73
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,002
That means when the flashes increase,

74
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,804
the frequency of the flash increase to 30 hertz,

75
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:55,647
we can no longer feel the LED is flashing.

76
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,709
It's perceived as continuous to us.

77
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,754
So we may wonder, how does CFF work as an indicator of visual fatigue?

78
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,035
Let's look at an example.

79
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:14,699
Before playing games, I have a higher temporal sensitivity,

80
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:21,183
which means I am very good at discriminating the tiny flexion patterns.

81
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:31,818
So it needs a frequency as high as 40 hertz to make me perceive a steady and no flashing light.

82
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,260
Any frequency lower than this threshold will be perceived as flashing for me.

83
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:46,862
Then after I play games for two hours and I'm really tired, my sensitivity decreases,

84
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:52,264
which means I can no longer discriminate the flashing precisely.

85
00:06:53,296 --> 00:07:01,122
At this time, a lower frequency at 35 Hz is enough for me to perceive as continuous.

86
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:08,147
This means by comparing the CFF before and after play sessions,

87
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:11,970
we can infer the severity of visual fatigue.

88
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:19,886
If CFF decreases dramatically, we might infer that the eyes must be tired.

89
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:27,851
In contrast, if no such changes before and after playing games, eye strain may not happen.

90
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:35,476
Another psychophysiological indicator we use is contrast sensitivity,

91
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:40,860
which is the ability to distinguish between an object and the background.

92
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:49,312
A traditional method to measure contrast sensitivity is using a chart where the characters

93
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:55,253
gradually fade from black to grey as we can see in this graph.

94
00:07:56,814 --> 00:08:03,495
For example, when I am not tired, I can distinguish the slightly darker letter V

95
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:09,036
from the background. However, when I am tired,

96
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:15,927
I can no longer see the letter V, but can only see the much darker, or another saying,

97
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:24,373
a higher contrast letter H. So we can also infer the severity of visual fatigue or eye strain

98
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:32,820
from the threshold changes of contrast sensitivity. Besides psychophysiological methods,

99
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:41,091
We also asked subjects to self-report on a scale of 1 to 5 points to measure various symptoms

100
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:49,793
of visual fatigue and to check whether the CFF and contrast sensitivity indicators are valid or not.

101
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,155
In summary, we had three indicators of Einstein in this study.

102
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:02,576
The first one is CFF, which measures temporal sensitivity.

103
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,417
CFF decreases when one is tired.

104
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,398
The second one is contrast sensitivity.

105
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:14,659
When one gets tired, he or she can only

106
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,699
discriminate a letter with higher contrast.

107
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,140
That is, the threshold would be increased.

108
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,601
The third one is self-report.

109
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,181
It is straightforward.

110
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,299
Now we move to the experiment.

111
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,961
The procedure was quite simple.

112
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,725
First, we asked players to play games or watching

113
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,306
videos for 20 minutes.

114
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:44,590
Before and after the screen exposure,

115
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,794
we measure their CFS, their contrast sensitivity,

116
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:53,997
and also ask them to fill the self-report questionnaire.

117
00:09:55,422 --> 00:10:00,703
And at last, by comparing the pre-test and post-test results,

118
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,325
we can figure out to what extent players feel tired.

119
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:08,946
Here are the results.

120
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:16,488
First, the gray bar shows the CFF, or the critical frequency,

121
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,148
before viewing screen.

122
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:24,939
Remember that CFF decreasing indicates players might have a lower sensitivity

123
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,444
and we can infer that they may suffer eye strain.

124
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:34,470
Let's come to the results. As we can see,

125
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,656
after 20 minutes of screen exposure, CFF decreased more or less.

126
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:51,072
But we also noticed that playing games did not induce more severe visual fatigue than simply watching videos.

127
00:10:53,073 --> 00:11:00,036
We also found that FPS and racing game players suffer much than players of other game genres.

128
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:09,280
We also found moderate correlations between CFF, contrast sensitivity, and self-report.

129
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:17,183
which suggests that CFF and CS threshold are effective indicators of visual fatigue.

130
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:26,631
So these are the insights of study 1. At the beginning of this study,

131
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:31,836
we aim to find out quantitative and valid indicators of eye strain.

132
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:39,001
Through our psychophysiological methods, we found that CFF or critical flicker frequency

133
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:45,463
and contrast sensitivity, they seem to be effective indicators of tiredness.

134
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:50,145
They can be useful for helping game designers

135
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:54,387
determine whether in-game elements could lead to visual fatigue.

136
00:11:55,828 --> 00:12:00,150
For example, players may complain that looting indoors

137
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,972
induces discomfort when playing battle royal games.

138
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:08,555
It is possible that the brightness of indoor lighting

139
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,055
matters.

140
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:14,158
So we can compare between a bright and a dimly lit house

141
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:15,899
throughout A-B testing.

142
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,242
We can combine psychophysiological and self

143
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:24,404
report data to find out which condition.

144
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,295
will lead to eye strain.

145
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:31,538
For example, the indicators shown here

146
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:36,380
suggested that looting in the dim-lighted room, that

147
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,262
is, the lower scene, might easily lead to visual fatigue.

148
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,944
Once we identify this risk factor,

149
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:48,506
we can try to eliminate the impact of such factors.

150
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:54,255
For example, we can reduce the amount of such rooms to avoid

151
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,737
playing players cost too much time in such rooms.

152
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,479
Or we can address the brightness and give a better transition

153
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,161
between darkness and brightness to provide better experience to

154
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:12,804
the players and reduce the discomfort of visual fatigue or

155
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:13,285
eye strain.

156
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,898
So in study one, we found effective indicators.

157
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:24,562
These indicators, including psychophysiological indexes,

158
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:27,945
which are objective and sensitive.

159
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,887
And self-report is very useful too.

160
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:35,791
And we also found that FPS and racing game players

161
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:36,952
suffer the most.

162
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:42,777
In study two, we wanted to further understand

163
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:44,558
the underlying mechanism.

164
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,821
and hope to shed light on how to relate the tiredness.

165
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:53,023
So we chose FPS and racing mobile games

166
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,224
to further study visual fatigue.

167
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:59,706
And we also brought in optometric measurements

168
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:00,946
in this study.

169
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,549
By reviewing literatures, we borrow

170
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,610
three optometric indicators.

171
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,312
The first one, during the players.

172
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:20,452
playing games, one may focus on the screen and they blink much less than usual.

173
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:30,999
This might lead to eye dryness. So we use the indicator tear breakup time or TBUT to assess

174
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:40,885
for dry eyes. TBUT shortening implies that eye dryness and discomfort might occur after or during

175
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,326
the playing session.

176
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:50,617
Second and the third indicators were related to accommodation ability of the eyes.

177
00:14:51,878 --> 00:15:00,742
As we can see, when focusing on distant objects, ciliary muscles relax and the lens will flatten.

178
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:10,146
In contrast, when focusing on near point, ciliary muscle contracted and the lens will thicken.

179
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:15,849
It might lead to ciliary muscle tired after a long duration

180
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,852
when focusing on near points.

181
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,215
So we use two indicators.

182
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:26,519
The first is anterior chamber depth, or ACD,

183
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,523
and the second, accommodation power, or AP,

184
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,405
to assess these symptoms.

185
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:42,772
Changes of these indicators implies that ciliary muscle are tired and might lead to blurry vision.

186
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:48,557
In summary, we have three optometric measurements in this study.

187
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:55,262
The first one is tear breakup time, which is a clinical assessment of eye dryness.

188
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:58,764
The second one is anterior chamber depth.

189
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,805
When the eyes focus on near point for a long duration,

190
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:08,346
anterior chamber depth or ACD might temporarily shorten,

191
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:13,528
suggesting that the ciliary muscle get tired and need rest.

192
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:17,969
The third one is accommodation power.

193
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:21,350
It is also related to focus adjusting.

194
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:29,073
When one gets tired, the accommodation power would be impacted and the image cannot project

195
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:34,135
to retina precisely and hence leading to blurry vision.

196
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:39,997
By using these optometric measurements, we can further understand

197
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:43,298
the mechanism of visual fatigue when playing games.

198
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:49,265
The procedure for this study was very similar to study 1.

199
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:54,309
It involves pre-game testing and one-hour gameplay session

200
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,111
and post-game testing.

201
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:03,918
Here shows the results of CFF and contrast sensitivity.

202
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,262
As expected, CFF and contrast sensitivity

203
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,165
were impacted after each play session.

204
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:21,699
Notice that the decrease of CFF and increase of contrast sensitivity both means eyes get much

205
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:29,800
tired after playing. But we found no differences between playing FPS and racing games.

206
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,481
The automatic measurements show some interesting results.

207
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:42,023
On one hand, tear break-up time decreased after playing both games.

208
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,171
which was similar to results from previous studies.

209
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:51,716
This result implies that dry eyes and discomfort

210
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:56,060
could occur after one hour exposure to the screens.

211
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:02,985
On the other hand, anterior tremor depth, or ACD,

212
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:09,351
and accommodation power, or AP, were impacted only in FPS games

213
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:10,912
but not in racing games.

214
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:18,024
As we can see here, anterior chamber depth or the ACD,

215
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:22,589
it decreased, suggest that after playing FPS games,

216
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,873
ciliary muscle get tired temporarily.

217
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:30,659
And the time cost of accommodation increased.

218
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:35,662
indicated that accommodation power was also impacted.

219
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:42,407
I needed a longer time to complete accommodation after playing FPS games.

220
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:49,280
That is, our eyes' reflective and focusing powers

221
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,801
are strongly affected by playing FPS games.

222
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:58,203
It might be because of in which or in the FPS games

223
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,364
it involves more camera turning motions.

224
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:08,967
The results of study two suggest that the effect of visual fatigue

225
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:12,168
differs across different game genres.

226
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:21,910
First, a tear break of time might indicate the result of exposure to a digital screen,

227
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,391
and it was a general effect.

228
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:35,036
ACD and AP were specific to FPS games. This may be due to this genre demanding

229
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:40,518
more rapid eye movements and frequently shifts in focus distance.

230
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:47,929
So the ciliary muscle might get much tired after FPS gaming

231
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,313
and hence lead to the decrease of ACD and impacted

232
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,036
AP or the accommodation power, which

233
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,618
is just a fancy way of saying that the eye's

234
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:04,681
ability to adjust focus may be temporarily affected

235
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,363
after playing FPS or shooting games.

236
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:17,090
In study 2, we used optometric measurements to further shed light on the mechanism

237
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:24,814
underlying visual fatigue. FPS games may differ from other game genres.

238
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:31,458
It requires lots of eye movement, focus shift, tiny discrimination.

239
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:36,881
It is much higher visual demanding comparing to other game genres.

240
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:45,158
So playing shooting games for a long duration might lead to temporary impairments to visual function.

241
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:54,083
On the other hand, the results of tear breakup time also suggested that exposure to screens

242
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:59,926
for a long time will also induce eye dryness even though not playing shooting games.

243
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:08,440
OK, then at last, we came to some conclusions from our own studies.

244
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:13,444
And combined with review of other literatures,

245
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:18,008
we have summarized the common causes of visual fatigue.

246
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,272
This is the information that designers can use

247
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:24,634
to build better games for our eyes.

248
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,814
So the number one cause of visual fatigue is high brightness.

249
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:38,576
Here, we use Life After, a survival mobile game,

250
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:39,796
as an example.

251
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:44,217
During alpha test, players often complain

252
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:48,398
that they feel eye strain when it rain in the game.

253
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:54,799
By analyzing the graphic and comparing with other games,

254
00:21:55,684 --> 00:22:02,050
we found that this was caused by raindrops that were too dense and too bright.

255
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:10,419
So in the official launch version, we cut down the density and the brightness of raindrops

256
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:18,307
to improve users' experience, and we also received good feedback on this iteration from our players.

257
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:26,929
And the second common cause of visual fatigue is low contrast.

258
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:34,931
Obviously, in a very low contrast condition, it will make it very difficult to see and find

259
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:44,093
useful information in the scene. For example, the same plan is much easier to identify and to tell

260
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:50,594
the details in the right picture than in the left, which with lower contrast in the left.

261
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:57,128
We can imagine that with too low contrast, players will squint

262
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,949
and have a hard time playing the game,

263
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,710
and which would lead to faster visual fatigue.

264
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:12,792
And another factor is about FOV and camera sensitivity.

265
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:16,153
It is another common cause of visual fatigue,

266
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,173
especially in shooting games.

267
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:25,045
This clip shows how a narrow FOV plus high camera sensitivity

268
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:26,506
can make players dizzy.

269
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,009
Now let's watch this animation.

270
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:37,816
First, FOV with 90 degree, it seems still acceptable for us,

271
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:38,197
right?

272
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:44,582
Then with 140 degree FOV, it gets much better and much

273
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:45,383
smoother.

274
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:48,185
But with a very narrow...

275
00:23:48,987 --> 00:23:57,153
only 30 degree of FOV, it looks very dizzy for the players. So of course, we do not say that

276
00:23:57,474 --> 00:24:06,080
never use narrow FOV in your games, but it should be very careful to use such settings.

277
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:14,406
As we have seen, a narrow FOV with high camera sensitivity will lead to eye strain quickly.

278
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:22,454
A compatible camera sensitivity with Apple V would provide better experience for players.

279
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:32,161
And another factor relating to camera is steadiness. Let's take racing games for example.

280
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:39,966
As we can see from the clip, the car position is not always the

281
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,589
keep the same during players playing the games.

282
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:52,969
Let's watch it again. As we can see, when the car slows down, the car position is more closer

283
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:59,373
to the players and when the car accelerates, the car was far away from the players.

284
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:06,017
The relationship between car position and speed is shown here.

285
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:10,972
When the car brakes, the car gets closer to the players.

286
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,415
And when it accelerates, the car moves away.

287
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:19,039
This position changing is a frequently used trick

288
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,602
to provide a stronger sensation to players.

289
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:27,607
And most of the situations, this trick we use

290
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:32,571
will not induce visual fatigue or visual discomfort

291
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,492
to the players.

292
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:38,871
But in some other games or in the extreme conditions,

293
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:43,975
the car position changes too obviously and too suddenly.

294
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,877
And this will make players feeling

295
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:49,759
that the car is something like jumping

296
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,341
and the camera is not steady.

297
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:55,243
And the camera, they feel, is very shaky.

298
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,526
And this will lead to visual discomfort.

299
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:01,128
So.

300
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:08,000
What can we do to avoid or relieve visual fatigue when we're developing our games?

301
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:16,984
Our first suggestion is conducting A-B testing that use effective indicators of visual fatigue.

302
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:22,045
When designing new maps, adding new elements,

303
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:24,896
or making any changes to your game,

304
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:29,379
you can use A-B testing to identify elements

305
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,382
that might cause visual fatigue and try to reduce its impact.

306
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:40,146
As I explained earlier, CFF and contrast sensitivity

307
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:44,509
and self-report are very project-friendly indicators

308
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,091
of eye strain, especially contrast sensitivity.

309
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:51,053
All you need is a contrast chart.

310
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,903
or a computer to conduct the test.

311
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:59,405
By combining various methods, we can find out the risk factors

312
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,266
and try to eliminate them.

313
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:08,509
The second suggestion is providing options for players

314
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:10,450
to set their preference.

315
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,211
By customizing displayed options,

316
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:19,033
such as brightness, FOV, camera sensitivity.

317
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:24,342
players are more likely to find parameters suited to themselves.

318
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:33,552
We also can provide better experience by reminders and game setting during play sessions.

319
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:42,417
Thus, a so-called 20-20-20 rule is recommended by eye doctors to prevent eye strain.

320
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:51,624
Basically, they suggest that every 20 minutes spent using a screen, one should try to look away

321
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:56,968
at something that is 20 feet away for a total of 20 seconds.

322
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:02,002
Return to game design, we can recommend a red dot

323
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:07,785
when players have been playing for long durations, especially

324
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,585
for kids and youth players.

325
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:15,688
Also, we can utilize adaptive brightness features

326
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:20,149
on phones or other devices to adjust the screen brightness

327
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,411
according to the game content and environment lighting.

328
00:28:25,892 --> 00:28:30,176
This will make a better experience of the eyes.

329
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:34,219
So in summary, we talk about

330
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,324
CFF and contrast sensitivity are very effective

331
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:43,568
psychophysiological indicators of visual fatigue.

332
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,052
They are objective, easy to conduct and comparable.

333
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:56,010
Using these indexes in A-B test can help us identify risk factors of visual fatigue.

334
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:07,855
We also talk about some common causes leading to tiredness, such as brightness, contrast, unmatched FOV and unsteady camera.

335
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:14,218
At last, we can also do something when players play games.

336
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:19,738
In-game settings, such as reminding automatic brightness,

337
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,579
can relieve eye strain.

338
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,541
Finally, credits.

339
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:28,503
The work I show today was done in collaboration

340
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,865
with Jay Wang, my colleague at NetEase Games.

341
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,987
And we want to give sincere thanks

342
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:38,489
to Professor Wang, Wang Yousheng, who's

343
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:41,491
from Guangdong Optometric Association.

344
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:47,236
who provided optometric measurement and data analysis for the second study.

345
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:53,077
That is all of my talk. You can follow us on social media.

346
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:56,738
And thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of GDC.

347
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,159
Thank you very much.

348
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,660
Hi, that was super interesting and informative.

349
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,408
It's interesting because you're looking at the phenomenon

350
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:10,709
in terms of discomfort.

351
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,211
That's your ultimate sort of variable

352
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,031
you're trying to predict.

353
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,753
But the first thing that I thought of was

354
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,935
a lot of times in game design,

355
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,996
you try to get people to notice things.

356
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,178
So for instance, you want them to notice

357
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:23,359
that there's a button they should press,

358
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,561
or they should notice a state change in a HUD element.

359
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:28,303
And so if you think about tiredness,

360
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:29,544
not just as an end result,

361
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:32,346
but also as like cognitive load could be tiredness.

362
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,985
The more tired you make the player using the variables related to eye fatigue,

363
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:39,467
they actually make it harder for you to be good at the game

364
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:43,131
because it's harder for you to notice the things that you need to notice.

365
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:47,656
And so it's interesting that while you're measuring for fatigue,

366
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:50,338
there's gameplay implications as well,

367
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,461
and that's why sound and other modalities can be.

368
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:58,065
But I've always struggled to find a way to describe to people why adding more blinking

369
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,167
lights and things like that are going to help with noticing things.

370
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:05,710
And so I found your research fascinating because you actually gave me sort of some scientific

371
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,231
underpinnings to display it.

372
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:12,614
So I guess my question is, are you, have you also thought about taking your research to

373
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:14,095
how do we make people...

374
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:21,005
better at learning and playing and mastering these games through the sort of principles that you're

375
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:27,149
teaching, as opposed to, or in addition to, making their eyes less tired at the end of the experience?

376
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:39,357
In my understanding, we, when in the game settings, we could, as I mentioned at the last

377
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,700
session of my talk, we think it is a good idea to

378
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:56,439
introduce some eye health knowledge to the players and tell them, for example, every

379
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:06,543
maybe every 20 minutes or every 30 minutes playing games, we can recommend our rest to the players

380
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:10,584
and also we can use the we can

381
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:24,429
monitor the time the players using per day or monitor the lighting environments of the players

382
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:32,555
to provide a better experience to the players. And also we think it is some politician and

383
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:42,336
effect or guidance to the players, especially for the kids and the youth players to reduce the usage

384
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:53,065
of the screens. And we also found that not only in our study, but also in the other literatures.

385
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:04,745
a long a very long duration exposure to the screen is not so health to the players no matter how old

386
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:14,211
the players are so it is i think it is uh both responsibility for the game

387
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:20,194
game designers and politicians or the governments yeah

388
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:23,296
uh i hope i

389
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:25,896
can answer your questions.
