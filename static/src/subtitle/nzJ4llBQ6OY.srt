1
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,564
OK, I think we're ready to start.

2
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,488
Welcome to the Art of Severed talk.

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,090
It's kind of weird because the game is not out yet,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,671
but it will be soon.

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,333
A couple of years ago, I did a talk

6
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:19,474
about the art of Guacamelee.

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:24,178
And they put the video in the vault, and I watched myself.

8
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:27,380
And apparently, I have an accent, which.

9
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:34,992
I didn't know about that. So hopefully everyone can understand me properly. Let's get

10
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:46,875
started because this is a bunch of stuff. So I work at Drinkbox Studios as a concept lead. We

11
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:51,316
developed about a mutant blobs attack and most famously guacamole.

12
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:57,856
And for Severed, we had been doing platformers

13
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:02,419
for a long time, and we were kind of saturated a little bit.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,143
So let me take you back to the magical time that was, 2013,

15
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:13,547
when we were wrapping up Guacamelee.

16
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:17,069
And all these ideas for new projects

17
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,410
started to come up in the studio.

18
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:27,712
Chris Harvey or someone, one of the founders, had an idea of making maybe a touch game,

19
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,694
an iOS or something like that.

20
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:34,279
There was some other ideas, maybe like a Cursed Warrior or something.

21
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:41,504
These were all just ideas, nothing tangible yet.

22
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:49,211
It got me thinking of doing something very different, just to have a new set of challenges

23
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,995
and change it around a little bit.

24
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,997
Around that time, I'm also having...

25
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:05,378
uh, just, just different ideas about memories and, uh, being away from, from my family.

26
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:12,100
Um, I remember, I distinctly remember, uh, weird moments with, um, with my mom where,

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,222
like, I think we were wrapping up guacamole and, like, um, just...

28
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:17,736
talking to her on the phone.

29
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:19,697
And I'm just pacing around the room,

30
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,679
and she's giving me some nice advice.

31
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,241
And I remembered some other advice that she had given me

32
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,162
like six months before.

33
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:33,004
But the image of the memory was me pacing around the room

34
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:34,485
having a phone conversation.

35
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,186
with this disembodied person.

36
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,367
Which was very interesting because usually

37
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:42,268
when you have memories, nice memories with someone,

38
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:45,149
you have kind of like a place and a smell

39
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:46,350
and maybe what they're wearing,

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,391
maybe the scenery is different.

41
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:51,352
But all these memories started to be kind of the same

42
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,373
even though in my mind they were different.

43
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,614
So kind of thinking about that as kind of like

44
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,875
an emotional kind of core for a game.

45
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,956
And all of these ideas started to come together.

46
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:09,895
And at one point, it's kind of like it starts to simmer and then all of a sudden like starts boiling and you're like

47
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,175
Okay, I need to do something now. So I

48
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:17,057
Did a concept video which I'll show you right now

49
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:23,699
So I would go home after work and like that week a couple of days of the week and make this really rough

50
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:28,000
concept pitch for what eventually would become severed so

51
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,401
I'm gonna show you

52
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,370
This doesn't have audio, it's just images.

53
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:36,832
Oh, no.

54
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:37,713
OK.

55
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:40,015
Is it playing now?

56
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:42,297
Yeah.

57
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:47,128
So I just animated this in Flash very, very roughly,

58
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:47,808
as you can see.

59
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,090
It's just basically a square tool over and over.

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,493
But the idea is to create a mood for what the game could

61
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,815
be, kind of packaging all the stuff that some ideas

62
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:06,516
from the studio and some ideas kind of packaged

63
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:10,298
with what I had just been talking about, the memories

64
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:10,918
and all that stuff.

65
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,791
So the plot, I wanted to have something very mysterious

66
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:21,833
and not as operatic as Guacamelee,

67
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,413
or not as prototypical.

68
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:27,075
And at that time, I called the game Slash,

69
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,216
which I thought it was pretty clever

70
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,017
with just like a division symbol,

71
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,339
meaning obviously like slashing around,

72
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,700
but also like the divide

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,761
that this character is going through.

74
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:43,324
And now here is like some example of what the navigation,

75
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,826
how I envision navigation being.

76
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,848
And this is kind of borrowed from an old game

77
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:50,209
called Shining in the Darkness.

78
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,190
It's a precursor for Shining Force.

79
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,512
It's like a obscure Genesis game.

80
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,954
But basically you're in the middle of the town

81
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:01,697
and you act as kind of like the axis around it.

82
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:05,760
So you can choose to go, say, to the tavern

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,961
to recruit people or to the shop or whatever.

84
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,213
In this case, this is like a transition.

85
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,095
You're inside, and you're like maybe buy something.

86
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:20,641
The idea was that you can make a 2D game or make 2D art

87
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,984
presented in a way that you can have a spatial relationship

88
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,746
that feels more three-dimensional,

89
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:30,770
kind of like those old school dungeon crawlers or something

90
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,070
like that.

91
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,733
So I wanted to make something simple, something

92
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,255
kind of like a palette cleanser.

93
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:41,219
from doing all this platform or something that was easy and cheap to make, and we can

94
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:48,967
create a lot of content out of it. That's kind of the exploration part of it, and here's

95
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:57,715
kind of like what the combat would be. A character shows up, maybe like a Pokemon, and then you

96
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:00,518
go into battle mode and you haveâ€¦

97
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:07,969
your life bar or whatever, and all this lashing, I was

98
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,752
interested in keeping it simple, so not having like a

99
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,553
shield or anything that you're carrying.

100
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,855
So everything is like basically touch control.

101
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:19,078
And I mean, this is like incredibly crude, as you can

102
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,179
see, this is now like.

103
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,860
like, wow, this looks amazing.

104
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,301
But that was not the point.

105
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,463
The point was to like, hey guys, this is the idea

106
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:27,205
and this is how it sort of plays.

107
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:32,729
And I see concept pitches or concept art as kind of like.

108
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,501
I think good ideas just generate better ideas.

109
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:43,523
So if you have a seed, and then hopefully you

110
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,344
end up with a full crop once you share it

111
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,605
with a team who are also very talented.

112
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:55,168
And then just some ideas on how to expand magic systems and stuff

113
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:55,908
like that.

114
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:57,969
Maybe you have to draw.

115
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:08,098
some pictographs or something that create a magic spell or something like this.

116
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,962
Maybe it's complicated to do that kind of detection, but anything goes at this stage.

117
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:22,446
It's just like a cheap drawing right now. I remember being very nervous about sharing

118
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:28,329
this with the team, because I had spent some weeks thinking about it and a week or two

119
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:28,749
making it.

120
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:35,456
and it was like a Sunday midnight deciding whether to send it or not to

121
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:39,519
to the founders of the team because I know it like at this point this is

122
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,341
completely outside of the wheelhouse of what we've been doing as a studio like

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,863
just from Guacamelee just switching to something completely bizarre with like a

124
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:51,966
very dark atmosphere like a sword fighting game we've never done a full

125
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:58,790
touchscreen game so it was like kind of weird to be pitching this thing and

126
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,648
So for the first day I sent that,

127
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,910
nobody kind of mentioned anything.

128
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,811
And I'm like, okay, maybe they didn't see it or whatever.

129
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:12,173
The second day, like Tuesday, nothing.

130
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:15,155
Hey guys, did you see the email?

131
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,676
It's like, yeah, yeah, we saw it.

132
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,657
Oh, okay, okay.

133
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:20,058
Cool.

134
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:22,619
And then like a week later, like, okay,

135
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,281
I think we're gonna, we like it.

136
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,562
We're gonna do a prototype with a bunch of other ideas.

137
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:30,687
we're doing.

138
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:33,828
Basically, this is the pitch,

139
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:37,809
and this is just some mood

140
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,210
kind of sort of storytelling thing.

141
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,151
I mean, coming back to the Cursed Warrior

142
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:46,112
kind of idea that started it all.

143
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:50,213
So, this was the pitch for me.

144
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:54,434
Like, having a single-player touch-based experience

145
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:56,675
with really easy to make backgrounds,

146
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,055
just like flat art.

147
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,653
It's just short, make it arcade-y, you know, like it doesn't need to be graphically amazing.

148
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:12,476
6-8 production cycle, like very quick turnaround, or way quicker than what we've done before.

149
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:17,298
Low detail characters, continue with like a graphic theme.

150
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,860
We don't even need to do main character, because it's first person.

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,001
Like we don't need to do all those animations and stuff.

152
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:26,074
The combat, keeping it very simple, very light.

153
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,735
And the storytelling will be very minimalistic

154
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:34,076
and kind of like in the background, not in the foreground.

155
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,597
So I mean, what could go wrong?

156
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:39,678
It's like, this whole thing looks so solid,

157
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,238
but everything went wrong.

158
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:47,532
So we did that prototype among with other ones.

159
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,634
This is some animations that Ben Thomas did.

160
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:53,414
He's animator at Drinkbox.

161
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,516
And I was away during this prototype.

162
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,797
We did like a two-day jam at the studio

163
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,798
and I was away in Mexico for vacation, so I missed it.

164
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,479
But they did a prototype.

165
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,680
They reused the Samurai Jack backgrounds

166
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,562
for the Eternal Game Jam, which I thought was cool.

167
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,678
So let's go through all these points.

168
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,119
Single-prey touch-based experience.

169
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,601
So to put that in context,

170
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,443
we're also doing super turbo championship edition.

171
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:25,944
So we're prototyping this stuff.

172
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:29,147
At the same time, we're doing like Guacamelee DLC

173
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,469
and porting and doing the sort of Guacamelee 1.5

174
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,290
at that time.

175
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,323
And Guacamelee was a pretty straightforward formula.

176
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,047
Like, everybody got it.

177
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:44,836
It's like, Metroidvania with, like, melee combat.

178
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,854
to the power of Mexico and then that's basically Guacamelee.

179
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,774
But when trying to define this single player

180
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,535
touch-based experience, it's like,

181
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,476
well, what is this experience?

182
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,216
Is it action?

183
00:10:58,276 --> 00:10:58,816
Is it adventure?

184
00:10:58,856 --> 00:10:59,476
How much is it?

185
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:01,436
You know, like Zelda has puzzles.

186
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,517
Are we doing puzzles?

187
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,818
We're looking at things like Mike Tyson's Punch Out

188
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,958
because we like that combat, the rhythm,

189
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:11,819
like waiting for weak points and stuff like that.

190
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,292
We're looking at the awesome art for Year Walk and things like that, where the storytelling

191
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:22,701
is very moody, although that doesn't have combat at all, it's just like a puzzle game.

192
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,026
We didn't want to do like a Mexican game this time.

193
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:31,648
It was just too much pressure to keep going with all that stuff.

194
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,329
And something like Myst, I thought,

195
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:36,870
was an atmosphere that was very interesting.

196
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,152
But also elements of Zelda, but also like it's not

197
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,513
top down, this game is.

198
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,595
So you know, touchscreen for Ninja, I was like, oh,

199
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:47,595
for Ninja, yeah, of course.

200
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,036
It's like it's not that gameplay,

201
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,056
but there's something there.

202
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,758
It feels good to just like cut fruit, right?

203
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,443
And Infinity Blade, of course, except Infinity Blade has a dodging mechanic and it's third-person

204
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:06,269
and the graphics are fantastic and you don't explore too much and you don't fight more

205
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:06,830
than one enemy.

206
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,493
So it's not really a template that we can fit our game into.

207
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:15,478
So that was incredibly tough to do because everybody kind of took...

208
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,540
their experience of this is what an experience means,

209
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,800
or this is what touch base means,

210
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,001
or action adventure means.

211
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,761
And we were not kind of in the same page,

212
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,522
so it was hard to find exactly the genre.

213
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,203
So single player touch base experience

214
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,884
was a very difficult thing that we didn't think

215
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:37,424
it was gonna be difficult,

216
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:41,626
and we kept coming back to that problem

217
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:42,806
to try to finesse it.

218
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:44,706
It turns out we were doing a dungeon crawler.

219
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,374
But we found that out like a year into production.

220
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,367
The easy-to-make backgrounds, okay,

221
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,167
well, like, at least we can do this.

222
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,308
Like, we can finesse what the game is,

223
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,088
but the background production

224
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,229
should be pretty straightforward.

225
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:02,430
This is some early navigation concepts.

226
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,151
So basically, the idea is to have like a scroll,

227
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,911
kind of like a Flintstones background

228
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,112
that keeps looping around.

229
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,893
And that's basically dividing quadrants, right?

230
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:15,394
So the tower is like north, east, south, the cave, and west.

231
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:19,421
the other passage or something, and then cross-dissolve between them.

232
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:25,870
These are just some early explorations on style and things like that.

233
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,855
I kind of like the brushy kind of texture part of it.

234
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:35,085
which we actually couldn't do

235
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:38,449
because it was very expensive to do sprites for our engine.

236
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:41,712
So we had to go back to do something

237
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,195
more like Guacamelee, where it's like

238
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,998
graphics and gradients and just verts.

239
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,630
These are just kind of all over the place,

240
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,913
because we're figuring things out still.

241
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:59,316
So you can see, we're going to have NPCs,

242
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,078
how much of an adventure part of it.

243
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:03,360
We're going to have towns, what it's going to be like.

244
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,803
But I drew this image, and here is where I feel like,

245
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:09,505
for me, it kind of started to turn around.

246
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:14,049
Because it just struck a chord, or something was here

247
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,350
that was very interesting.

248
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,991
So this was kind of like...

249
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,990
the beginning of going in that direction.

250
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,972
At the same time, we're figuring out how to do the concepts of the rotation and combat.

251
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,873
So here's like a quick battle mockup.

252
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:34,233
You fight, but then you turn.

253
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,494
Maybe you go to the cave.

254
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:37,674
Maybe you keep walking.

255
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:38,895
We keep going around.

256
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,964
This is all not in Engine.

257
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:44,146
This is just a quick animation I did in Flash.

258
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,589
And it has some parallax in the background, which is weird,

259
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,071
because when you rotate, there's no parallaxing.

260
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,333
But it looked cooler with it.

261
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,315
And doing something like Year Walk,

262
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:01,117
where when you move forward, then more stuff shows up.

263
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:07,673
I'm just going to go quickly over this.

264
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,113
These are some other tests.

265
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:15,575
Something that was very difficult is to determine arbitrarily how much is moving forward, how

266
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,016
much is a unit of moving forward.

267
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,956
Is it like a soccer field?

268
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,297
Is it like two steps?

269
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:25,718
Is it like how many steps forward are you doing?

270
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,459
That was kind of like this test with this house on the right.

271
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,699
On the left is kind of like an early kind of dungeon kind of idea.

272
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:42,182
This is, again, this is all stuff that as we're getting the tech ready, we're figuring

273
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:46,524
out what are the rules of this world for the navigation because it's not as easy as just

274
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,505
doing the scrolls.

275
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:54,129
There's a lot of rules like how big are the doorways, how far can you see things, that

276
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:54,609
kind of thing.

277
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:00,392
In open areas, you cannot do diagonals, so limiting it to the cardinal directions, things

278
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:00,712
like that.

279
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,196
we didn't think before starting.

280
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:05,657
It didn't work at all.

281
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:06,758
It was terrible.

282
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,280
Like, you don't feel like you're rotating.

283
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,162
You just feel like you're moving side to side.

284
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,824
And that was not a good thing for a game

285
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,426
that you needed that 360 kind of look.

286
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:23,511
So, one solution was hotel virtual tours,

287
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,793
which is basically a panorama.

288
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,056
Basically, it's like a cylinder.

289
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:33,413
with flat images on it.

290
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,375
So Google Maps kind of uses this also.

291
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,897
So if you've ever seen like a panoramic picture app,

292
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:40,798
this is what they do.

293
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,941
It's basically a mesh that is a cylinder around you in 3D

294
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:49,344
and you're stitching together pictures that are 2D.

295
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,746
when you move around, then the mesh deforms.

296
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,267
That deforms the image.

297
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,389
So I'll show you in a minute how it looks.

298
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,553
But basically, this is my crappy diagram drawing.

299
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,416
Because we needed one cylinder, of course, for the first layer.

300
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:09,218
But you also want to have that depth.

301
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,642
So that meant having to do a second layer and a third layer.

302
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,644
So it's three cylinders in our engine

303
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,805
where we're mapping this to the art.

304
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:24,100
This is a test that Steph Goulet, the art director, did.

305
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,147
I don't know if I can play it, yeah.

306
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,570
He did this in 3D Max really quickly

307
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,313
and has like the cardinal points.

308
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,917
just so the rotation, but you see like the ground layers

309
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,098
has three different colors.

310
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,240
So like now you're in layers three now

311
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,061
and that kind of thing, how would that work?

312
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:49,643
It's obvious that it was really hard to figure

313
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,525
that stuff out given like this test doesn't look

314
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,366
as good as what it ended up looking at.

315
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,828
But that was the trial and error with this thing.

316
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:03,189
And we started to be very concerned

317
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,510
about being able to pull this off.

318
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,632
Because it looks so simple, but it didn't scale

319
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:10,452
that way at all.

320
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,602
At the same time, I'm doing more exploration on the style,

321
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:19,584
so it's just like some palette cleanser images

322
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,105
before it gets too technical.

323
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:26,729
Again, exploring mood and that kind of thing.

324
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,472
Now, the ground, the layering is visible there.

325
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:40,204
So this is what we ended up attempting as a first test.

326
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:44,186
So for the outdoors, it's okay if the cylinders

327
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,308
are just kept like that because the forest is organic.

328
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:46,688
It's fine.

329
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,589
But the indoors, we didn't want it

330
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,270
just to be in circular rooms.

331
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,212
So we did this thing where when you map things

332
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:54,833
to a cylinder,

333
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:56,915
it deforms it.

334
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:02,200
So if you have a normal plane, it just naturally deforms.

335
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,223
So if we pinch the art, when it deforms it,

336
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,885
it makes it feel like there's a corner there.

337
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,389
So this is final art from the game.

338
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,291
And each of those kind of bubbles,

339
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,853
that's like a cardinal direction in our game.

340
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:24,658
And this is what, oops.

341
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:28,724
this is what mapping it to those cylinders looks like

342
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:30,566
as you're navigating now in the game.

343
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:34,870
So, eventually we had to do,

344
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,211
I mean, this is very polished.

345
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:39,054
We didn't figure this out at that time,

346
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,516
but it was kind of refining that process

347
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,336
to the point where.

348
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,360
It feels like you're in a 3D space, but you're not.

349
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,641
You're just in a cylinder.

350
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:48,842
The camera moves a little bit,

351
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,924
and then you're just teleported to the next node.

352
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,426
So this is kind of like what Google Maps does.

353
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,628
It just cross-desalts between them,

354
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,793
and it just works for some reason.

355
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:05,293
Like, it ended up being not distracting when you're playing.

356
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,535
You just accept that that's how the world happens.

357
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,776
So, easy to make backgrounds.

358
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:12,457
It's super simple.

359
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:15,799
All you need to do is 2D art of an interior,

360
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,781
distort it with some action or script in Illustrator,

361
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,023
map it to a cylinder in our engine,

362
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,265
and you just make sure to not tilt the camera up or down

363
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,346
because there's no art there.

364
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,307
and you need three of those layers.

365
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:33,390
So, no, it didn't, it was not simple at all.

366
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,491
And at this time, I should mention,

367
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,773
like, pre-production, getting all this stuff ready

368
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:43,615
already had taken like four to six months, informally,

369
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,316
because we were doing some Guacamelee stuff,

370
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,498
but that, like, short turnaround game

371
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,040
was also not gonna happen.

372
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,361
And at this point, this is like a year after the pitch.

373
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,692
And we made this concept video.

374
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,596
We wanted to do an announced trailer,

375
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:04,999
but we didn't have the tech running yet or anything

376
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:06,921
to show for after all this work.

377
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:10,123
So we decided to animate, kind of have

378
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:14,127
like a target of what the game would look like.

379
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:20,633
So I'll show you real quick a portion of this concept video.

380
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:31,236
Also, the music is by the amazing Yamantaka Sonic Titan, who signed up to do the music, the soundtrack for the game.

381
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,318
And they did an amazing job.

382
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:42,149
So, this was animated by Ben and myself, also using Flash.

383
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,878
And some of the concepts are shown there.

384
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:48,860
A lot of this stuff we don't know how to do.

385
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,041
Like, all this stuff is just like,

386
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,682
this would be cool to do,

387
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:58,785
but we don't have the game structure yet.

388
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:05,728
So this is just like conceptual things at that moment.

389
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:11,486
and introducing some NPCs and characters that kind of made it up.

390
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:15,089
Some of these were reused from the earlier tests that I have made.

391
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:24,317
But somehow it starts to, these ideas are starting to generate more ideas and getting

392
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:26,979
the team excited to make this.

393
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:46,163
So yeah, the idea was just create kind of like a crazy visual kind of dump on this and

394
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,807
see how much we could try to do for the game.

395
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,343
So that's like, we're in the timeline,

396
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:58,105
this is where we're at, right?

397
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:00,448
So we decided to do like a vertical slice,

398
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,511
a demo at that point.

399
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,415
These are just some rough storyboards

400
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:09,741
for kind of the first dungeon of the game.

401
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:17,522
And this is just some concept art.

402
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:23,466
I kind of like, I wanted the dungeons to not be monotonous

403
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:25,148
or just be brick walls.

404
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:30,832
Definitely wanted a moody, kind of dark, kind of aesthetic.

405
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:34,114
But also, combined with on the left,

406
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,216
there's kind of, maybe you reach kind of like

407
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:38,958
an internal garden or something like that.

408
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:46,010
with some stuff that looks kind of like there was a culture there or something,

409
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,301
and maybe something off-putting or creepy, like those plants that look like eyes.

410
00:23:55,134 --> 00:24:01,558
We're starting to do concepts that now are tied to game areas, so this is like another

411
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,180
quick test just to see how much we can reuse.

412
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,543
Now we have established some stuff like how much it's going to be foggy in the background.

413
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,366
We're going to just have three layers deep that you can look into.

414
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,401
And obviously the outdoors,

415
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:19,803
we just make it as though they're giant walls

416
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:21,504
so that it's clear, the direction,

417
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,945
the cardinal directions are clear.

418
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:25,467
So there's some concepts of the house

419
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:26,547
at the beginning of the game.

420
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:30,210
This is kind of taken with that,

421
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,351
that first image I showed you guys

422
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,492
that was, that struck a chord with me,

423
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:36,393
that was kind of like the reinterpretation

424
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,515
of what it would look like in the game.

425
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:42,877
Some exploration on forest and palettes.

426
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:47,282
It was very quick, just reusing things.

427
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,504
How can we block doorways?

428
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:52,445
How can we make the dungeon not look the same

429
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:55,727
if there's just doors and nodes like that?

430
00:24:56,987 --> 00:24:59,589
So finding some variety, maybe with vegetation,

431
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,170
maybe with what you see through the doors.

432
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:03,671
Excuse me.

433
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:10,354
So I want to jump a little bit to the characters.

434
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:11,935
Because some stuff in the characters,

435
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:12,675
there's not a lot of...

436
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:17,445
Like it's not like Guacamelee, it's not like a parade of NPCs in the game,

437
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,966
but there's like a bunch of characters.

438
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,728
It's some sketches of our main character, Sasha.

439
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:31,511
She's this warrior that's in search of her family.

440
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:37,314
And at the beginning I thought she would be like in her 20s or 20 year old or something like that.

441
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:43,736
But as we're developing the game, we realized we're doing a rites of passage kind of story.

442
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:47,881
So then the design shifted to be more of a teenager,

443
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:53,989
just so that it feels like she doesn't understand the world yet completely.

444
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,591
She doesn't have that maturity yet.

445
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:02,728
And I wanted to make her kind of racially ambiguous.

446
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,889
We're like, kind of like a mixed heritage or something.

447
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:08,450
Like, we're doing a fantasy game,

448
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,430
but I didn't want to be tied to doing

449
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:15,011
something that's inspired in Norse mythology

450
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,152
or something like that.

451
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,612
That's kind of like the established thing.

452
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:21,153
So we couldn't make anything.

453
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,593
And even the language is gibberish

454
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,514
and people think it's Spanish,

455
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,134
for some reason or something.

456
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:31,476
So, yeah, so I want to kind of like an exotic

457
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,598
kind of look for the family and for Sasha.

458
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,160
But I really want to talk about the enemies.

459
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,323
And at this point, we have four enemies.

460
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,784
I mean, like at this point in the timeline,

461
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:49,805
not in the game.

462
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:56,008
We started doing four enemies and those took a long time.

463
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,190
The iterations, it was slow, it was not working.

464
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,112
So then we made some adjustments

465
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,494
and we decided to prototype one enemy per week.

466
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,336
So we had two months to make eight enemies

467
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:08,498
and that's a lot of work.

468
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,921
But I wanna show you because this is, I think,

469
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,443
the most fun I had during the process.

470
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,025
So I'm gonna go over quickly.

471
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:22,176
I can talk about this after.

472
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:26,260
Basically everything starts with an idea.

473
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,404
Graham, or in this case David Rusak, Graham is a producer.

474
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:32,565
He's one of the founders.

475
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:38,890
David, he wears multiple hats, but he was in charge of doing the design of the enemies,

476
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,971
the paper design.

477
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,935
We had this giant Google Doc, and he would write some ideas.

478
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:47,117
In this case, I'm just going to go over one of the enemies.

479
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,200
It was called DemiGhost at the beginning.

480
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,462
And the idea was to have an enemy that would split apart

481
00:27:54,582 --> 00:27:56,624
and maybe attack you in a flurry.

482
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:58,285
Because when you're prototyping these enemies,

483
00:27:58,325 --> 00:27:59,525
they need to work in tandem.

484
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:03,048
Because you're not fighting one on one like a boxing match.

485
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:07,390
You have to fight one, and then another one appears.

486
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,671
And now they need to work.

487
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,654
sort of together so that it's fun for the player.

488
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:13,776
So the behaviors needed to be different

489
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,958
so that you're not just like spamming,

490
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,999
dragging your finger around like crazy.

491
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,021
There's like some strategy to it.

492
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:21,823
So in this case, this was an enemy

493
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,244
that the more you engage with it,

494
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:24,145
the more you attack it,

495
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,928
the faster, the more aggressive it becomes.

496
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:32,559
So when Wednesday comes, David writes a proposal.

497
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,102
Then on Thursday, we meet.

498
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:37,325
I go over it.

499
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:40,710
I selected some visuals from like the giant pool

500
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,195
of different sketches that Ben and myself had made

501
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,416
for like a year and a half.

502
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:51,444
In this case, Ben had this cool ghost guy made of ghosts.

503
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:56,170
Because we didn't want to have just guys with axes

504
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,374
or zombies or something like that.

505
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:01,817
You could do anything at this point,

506
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:04,341
so why not a ghost made of ghosts?

507
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:08,123
So it would disband maybe, and I don't know.

508
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:09,664
This was just like one visual idea.

509
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:14,407
And I just throw like three different ideas to the team.

510
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:16,609
So the second one was another of Ben's sketches.

511
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:20,951
This guy with like multiple mouths and multiple wings.

512
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:22,572
And I thought that was cool.

513
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:26,315
So maybe they're actually different.

514
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,416
Like when they dodge, they actually disband.

515
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,518
And then they individually attack.

516
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:34,680
And then they kind of mush together and recombine into one.

517
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:37,479
And the third one is kind of more like, okay,

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,903
more like a ghost or a blob or something.

519
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,086
Your slasher maybe has a normal attack,

520
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:43,789
but at the bottom maybe has a heavier attack

521
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,655
where it summons the statue back into life

522
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:48,716
and then attacks you like that.

523
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:52,768
So then, that's Thursday.

524
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,053
Friday, we meet Alex, who's doing the programming,

525
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:02,419
who would do this really amazing flowcharts of the enemies.

526
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,683
Basically, this is the behavior of that enemy.

527
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:10,048
You have the idle stage, a timer to the attack, and then.

528
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:12,244
If unparried, then it repeats.

529
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:13,424
If parried, this happens.

530
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:18,949
And that's kind of like a nice kind of portrait of our enemies

531
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,811
in this just scribbly pages.

532
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:25,899
So we decide what the behavior is.

533
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:29,481
We like sort of certain things about some enemies

534
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,282
or the aesthetics, and then we decide.

535
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:35,165
So then that Friday, I go back to the desk

536
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,465
and I kind of clean up.

537
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,287
In this case, we realized we needed,

538
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,989
we liked the guy with wings.

539
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,272
So we realized we needed kind of like a distinction

540
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,854
when like it's aggressive and when it's not aggressive.

541
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:53,996
some animation notes for them, like when they

542
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,358
recombine, like we don't want to make the animation

543
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:59,879
completely expensive, so maybe just like

544
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:03,120
just make it like that and then they just combine already.

545
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,201
And the severed post, so in this game you

546
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:09,983
chop the enemy parts and that's kind of like

547
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:11,524
your currency in the game.

548
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,965
So we needed that variety, so we chose a guy with wings

549
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,826
because nothing else is dropping wings at that time.

550
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:21,569
and we wanted kind of that variety, so that would be cool.

551
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:26,714
Then Ben goes on and does the...

552
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:28,796
starts to rig up the animation file

553
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:31,838
and starts to talk to Alex about prototyping the anime.

554
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:36,156
And in the meantime, I do like a finished polished pass

555
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,697
of what the enemy would look like.

556
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:40,037
In this case, I chose blue

557
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,778
because none of the enemies at this point were blue.

558
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,198
We wanted something colorful.

559
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,759
The wing is how this enemy attacks.

560
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,039
So change the wings from a feathery look

561
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,360
to more like a razor sharp kind of look.

562
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,261
And it was important that it was not floating around,

563
00:31:56,301 --> 00:32:01,102
but like the wings are actually having to carry this body.

564
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:09,093
So this is what the animation looks like in our file.

565
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,474
We've switched to a boom at that point,

566
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:15,076
and this is Ben's animation on the attack,

567
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:16,597
one of the attacks.

568
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:19,799
This has been iterated and is polished,

569
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,840
but I just wanted to show you what it looks like.

570
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,803
And this animation polish happened later,

571
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:29,164
but on Monday and Tuesday of the next week,

572
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,985
we review the enemy as it's being prototyped

573
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,905
as Alex has time to program it

574
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:37,306
and Ben has the first pass of the enemy.

575
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:40,807
And then Ben polishes up until Thursday,

576
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:44,467
because on Friday we already started

577
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,308
the next cycle on Wednesday.

578
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,169
So I'm gonna show you what this guy looks like in game.

579
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:58,641
And this is actual game footage.

580
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,685
So the attacks are there.

581
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:05,686
We change it.

582
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:08,829
We have to do a state where it's catching its breath.

583
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:12,771
And then if it gets too aggressive, then it splits up.

584
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:17,135
And now you need to manage the different attacks

585
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:20,017
from different directions to use the screen a bit more.

586
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:26,126
and then severing and then you collect your wings.

587
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,268
So for this, the interesting thing is that

588
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:32,010
this is just one enemy in this arena,

589
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,152
but there could be multiple ones,

590
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:36,974
so it makes it more dynamic and more difficult

591
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,736
as the game keeps evolving.

592
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:46,858
So low detail characters, yes, I would say they're graphic and simple looking, but I

593
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:52,546
wouldn't say low detail because a lot of the detail in these characters comes from their

594
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,007
behavior and iteration and how...

595
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,950
how they need to convey the information for the player.

596
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,712
Because it's a very intuitive game,

597
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:01,933
we wanted to make it extra clear

598
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,754
where the attack is coming from,

599
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:07,476
not like you feel it's unfair

600
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:09,558
because you've died against this guy like five times.

601
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:12,159
You need to kind of learn from that.

602
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,661
And that's like a lot of work for the animation team

603
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,144
to convey that as an enemy is attacking you

604
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:20,665
from the front in a 2D game.

605
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:25,723
And this also piggybacks on the simple combat

606
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:26,523
using touchscreen.

607
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,744
Because yes, the combat is simple and intuitive

608
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:34,925
for the user, but not for us making it.

609
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:37,325
To make it look seamless and simple,

610
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,966
it's like a lot of work that goes in there.

611
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,507
And combat is the main focus in the game.

612
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:46,827
So that's something we cannot skimp on.

613
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:47,707
We cannot like,

614
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,109
just, yeah, I mean there's other things in the game.

615
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,370
There's like exploration and characters

616
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,691
and stuff like that in the storyline.

617
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,632
But the combat is the main thing,

618
00:35:00,672 --> 00:35:04,913
so we really need to make sure we prioritize that

619
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,034
and make sure the combat was very deep.

620
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,516
And so for minimalistic storytelling,

621
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:17,334
Originally I didn't want any dialogue in the game,

622
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:21,415
but we're not Journey and we couldn't do it.

623
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:22,516
It was so hard.

624
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:25,957
So you can like spend like two months

625
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,417
trying to do a tutorial with just pantomime

626
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,398
or you can just like, okay, fine,

627
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,138
let's do a text box or something.

628
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,480
So we went with the text box.

629
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:42,287
But I do think we succeeded in doing like a minimalistic story for the game. It's kind of

630
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,490
like it's in the back. It's kind of

631
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,293
it's very moody and

632
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:53,138
it's not too direct, but that makes the player more engaged in a way to try to discover

633
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,802
the meaning of some things without having to handhold them through the storyline.

634
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,331
So I don't want to talk too much about this, because I don't want to spoil anything.

635
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:10,173
But I'll show you real quick, this is at the beginning of the game.

636
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,014
This is the tutorial I was mentioning.

637
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,335
This is the mother character.

638
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,156
And just like trying to convey, I mean, yeah, you're conveying the rules of the

639
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,317
game at this point.

640
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:25,198
But also, it was important for the characters to feel like characters.

641
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,242
This is kind of like a glimpse at the relationship

642
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:31,143
that Sasha has with her mom.

643
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:35,748
And it's just in like the small choices

644
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,011
in the animation and the posing.

645
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,214
Because it's basically two poses,

646
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,056
but it's important to convey things

647
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:44,557
through the character design

648
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:47,020
and through this choice of poses.

649
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:53,513
That was very hard to do, so I'm crossing it

650
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,195
because it was really, really hard.

651
00:36:57,016 --> 00:37:00,299
Like, minimalistic stuff, or narrative stuff,

652
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,461
it's always super complicated.

653
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:09,826
So, to recap, how am I doing with time?

654
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:19,714
To recap, the single-player touch-based experience

655
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:21,996
Yes.

656
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:26,218
What you need to do is define it.

657
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:31,881
Because this was a problem that was constant for us.

658
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:35,483
Like just putting everybody in the same page

659
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:37,884
was incredibly difficult.

660
00:37:38,364 --> 00:37:42,927
So we discovered we were making a dungeon crawler.

661
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,768
Like that was the closest genre.

662
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,289
But that came after like a lot of trial and error.

663
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,310
And like looking at games that.

664
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,367
they don't fit that genre.

665
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:56,569
And sometimes, like, when you say, like,

666
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:00,831
oh, let's make this game an X game,

667
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,433
like a Metroidvania or like a fighting game,

668
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:07,015
there's like a stigma to those genres

669
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,896
because like other mediums have more...

670
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:15,960
like, you know, genres that are more emotionally based instead of mechanically based.

671
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,804
So, sometimes there's like, I didn't want to jump into doing that, right?

672
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:25,766
Like, I just want to make a game that's fun and interesting and engaging.

673
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:30,549
But by not having that label, that made it a bit difficult.

674
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:32,891
So, in a way, it's counterintuitive.

675
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,633
You kind of sometimes have to start with something that's pre-established

676
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:38,234
because that will make it easier.

677
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,560
So for the easy to make backgrounds,

678
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,522
I mean, if you're mapping 2D art to a cylinder

679
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,804
and all that stuff, you're not making it easy on yourself.

680
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:54,506
It does look way, way cooler than any

681
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,087
of the initial concepts.

682
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:59,328
But it blew up the project.

683
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,489
It was not a 6-to-8-month project.

684
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,211
It just became this giant game that we still

685
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:07,573
thought in our minds that was like a small game.

686
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:10,534
So when that happens, I mean, the solution

687
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:10,975
is like.

688
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,887
It could be like scale down, like, okay,

689
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:17,568
let's go back to this arcadey slingshot game.

690
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:18,769
Maybe it doesn't look as good,

691
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,969
but at least we can finish in time.

692
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,811
Or, okay, let's just keep going with this scaled up version

693
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,591
and make sure you make kind of like

694
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:30,132
the psychological change to make.

695
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:32,213
Okay, we're not doing a six-month game,

696
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,273
we're doing a two-year game.

697
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:41,356
So, that's also adapting.

698
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:43,390
from what I just said.

699
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,915
Like, there's an initial plan and sometimes you're like

700
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:48,676
very...

701
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:52,813
worried to deviate from that plan.

702
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:58,316
But it's all, timelines are very difficult

703
00:39:58,376 --> 00:39:59,977
in this industry and things change

704
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:01,879
and you discover new things about the game

705
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,079
and what you wanna do.

706
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,582
So you do need to make some judgment calls

707
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:09,304
and make sure everybody's on board with that

708
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:12,246
and adaptation is very important.

709
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:16,168
For the characters.

710
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:21,756
I would say yes, you need to identify

711
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:24,757
what's the center of your game.

712
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,257
For us, it was the characters,

713
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:31,998
so we definitely spend a lot of time and detail with those

714
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:34,979
because that's what's gonna make the game good.

715
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,480
And that allows you to not spend a lot of time

716
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,940
worrying about some more irrelevant things,

717
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,601
but when you're trying to do everything,

718
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:45,921
you're not gonna accomplish

719
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:59,724
The biggest thing though was maybe it won't be a huge revelation for you guys because you're smarter than me, but

720
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:06,965
Simple does not equal simple to do so a lot of this thing was like it was simple because it's just simple to explain

721
00:41:08,286 --> 00:41:10,446
But to execute like very subtle

722
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:18,548
Combat or our story or something like that. There was a lot of care and a lot of things that it simply was not

723
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:20,488
It was not simple to me

724
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,867
And, you know, this is storytelling.

725
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:26,027
It's not such a thing.

726
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:29,088
Like, you still need to do the whole iceberg, you know?

727
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:33,170
And then, if you want to choose to show only the top 10%,

728
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:34,710
that's cool.

729
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,711
But you still need to build the whole thing.

730
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,193
And in a way, you know.

731
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:44,114
Less is more, like it is more work.

732
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:47,575
Simple and storytelling, it doesn't happen.

733
00:41:48,595 --> 00:41:52,336
It's just be constantly iteration and headaches.

734
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:56,357
So don't think because you have less things

735
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,778
to show in your story, that's gonna make it simpler,

736
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,679
especially in a game where like it depends

737
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,119
on the mood and the storytelling.

738
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,760
of our character.

739
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:09,485
Because in a way, you need to be more careful

740
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:11,987
because you're not showing everything.

741
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:15,350
So you really need to show only the specific,

742
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:16,612
the good things.

743
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,473
And that means there's a lot of work

744
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:21,917
in just taking out all the excess stuff.

745
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:33,046
But, you don't need to listen to all I've said because I think mistakes are actually

746
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:33,726
okay.

747
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:39,051
I think learning from experience is so, so valuable.

748
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:44,535
I think people sometimes dismiss that as failure or something like that.

749
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:55,184
The mistakes we made here were crucial for us to improve the game and to improve ourselves as developers.

750
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:57,548
If someone asks me...

751
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:03,948
if I would go back and try to do the whole thing

752
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:08,510
knowing what mistakes I was gonna face

753
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,511
and the tough parts that I was gonna face,

754
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,492
I don't know if I would take that chance

755
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:19,274
if I didn't, if that meant I didn't get to experience

756
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:20,815
the failure of that.

757
00:43:24,465 --> 00:43:28,831
if I was told to go back, knowing what I know now,

758
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:30,633
knowing all these failures and mistakes,

759
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:32,275
then yeah, of course, of course,

760
00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:36,700
jump back in that DeLorean and fix things,

761
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,303
make sure this is the priority,

762
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:41,326
this is what's gonna happen, definitely.

763
00:43:43,138 --> 00:43:44,780
But you want that experience.

764
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,043
You want to go and try it and fail and try it again

765
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,084
and fail and try it again.

766
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,746
If someone just gives you the answers to the test,

767
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,388
sometimes it's not actually useful at all.

768
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:00,170
So I encourage you to just don't listen to me

769
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,991
and just do your own thing.

770
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:06,715
And that's it.

771
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,876
I have the trailer here.

772
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:25,877
Just really real quick, just to get some perspective because I haven't shown much of the game

773
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:28,780
Because it hasn't come out yet

774
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,484
To put you in context a little bit

775
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:01,714
Oh

776
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,400
I don't know if we have time for questions.

777
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,703
If anybody has any questions, you're welcome.

778
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:53,074
Thank you so much for taking that challenge and doing it.

779
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:55,395
You probably just allowed me to win a bet.

780
00:45:55,696 --> 00:45:57,637
I've been talking to a few technical guys.

781
00:45:58,097 --> 00:46:02,179
I'm a 2D artist and wanting to try something like that.

782
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,880
And they said it couldn't be done.

783
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,520
So thank you.

784
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,402
Real quick, though, about your ring setup.

785
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:12,564
When they move forward, is the ring?

786
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:16,028
moving into them or are they moving into the next ring?

787
00:46:16,168 --> 00:46:17,412
Does that pass ring?

788
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:19,533
Yeah, it's kind of tricky.

789
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:24,536
So the question is, with that three-ring setup,

790
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,138
what's actually happened with the camera?

791
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:32,880
So the camera is moving forward in Z.

792
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:34,842
Like, it's actually moving.

793
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,142
Our engine is actually 3D.

794
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:38,844
It houses that cylinder.

795
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:43,246
But when you move away from that cylinder, it starts to deform.

796
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:45,786
and it starts to break.

797
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:49,369
But at that time, that's where the cross dissolve happens.

798
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,312
So basically, yes, the cylinder is deforming

799
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:56,754
and the layers in the back stop matching perfectly.

800
00:46:57,455 --> 00:46:59,216
But then you cross dissolve

801
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:00,977
and then they don't match perfectly

802
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:02,338
and then you get to the center of it.

803
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:06,581
And your brain just kind of like fills in the rest

804
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:08,763
and it's like, oh, it's fine, I just move forward.

805
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:09,503
Yeah.

806
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:18,909
Hello, first of all, thank you, Augusto, for making Guacamelee and Sever with your team.

807
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,296
To me, it's a really great experience to see this kind of games being released.

808
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:26,780
And my question here is...

809
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:36,227
I know this is not based on Mexican culture, but to me it still feels really similar to some things you did for Guacamelee.

810
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:40,149
Like, I still see the monsters as some sort of alebrije.

811
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:47,054
It has a little bit of influence, and that's great because you are representing your culture.

812
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,855
I mean, it's almost impossible to...

813
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:52,097
I don't know, distance yourself from that, right?

814
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,699
And so my question here is,

815
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,442
are you guys planning to continue doing things like that,

816
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:01,664
pushing different cultures into games,

817
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,887
and maybe making things like fantasy, man?

818
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:08,530
Because fantasy is just often dwarves, elves, and things like that.

819
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,292
I mean, there are so many mythologies that could be explored,

820
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:17,396
and the games industry seems to be a little bit fixated on those archetypes, you know?

821
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,598
So I don't know, what are your thoughts on that?

822
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,907
Yeah, I mean, I love all that stuff too.

823
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:25,428
That's great.

824
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:28,050
It's just kind of think we want to sort of stand out.

825
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:30,172
It's like we're a small team.

826
00:48:30,192 --> 00:48:33,215
We really need to make it look different.

827
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:38,837
So yeah, and whenever you, sorry, so like,

828
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:42,860
this talking about like adding the cultural aspects

829
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,521
of making like a fantasy game and how,

830
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:50,824
yeah, it's hard to distance myself from the Mexico stuff

831
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:52,125
because I just like it.

832
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:53,806
So I'm just gonna do it.

833
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:55,607
It's not like somebody forced me to do

834
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:57,588
the Guacamelee stuff.

835
00:48:58,028 --> 00:49:01,130
But yeah, as soon as you add color to monsters,

836
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,592
then you get alebrijes, because that's what they are.

837
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:04,813
And they're very unique.

838
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:07,795
And we didn't want to shy away from the color.

839
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:11,057
In a way, having a very colorful game

840
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:15,260
with such gruesome themes, you're chopping enemies apart.

841
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:18,203
So if you make it very dark and moody,

842
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:23,106
then it starts to feel very weird.

843
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:24,467
You start to feel off.

844
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:28,408
So we wanted that balance where like it's still a game, it's still abstracted.

845
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:32,169
You still feel a bit uneasy but you don't feel

846
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:40,311
it's not a gory game because of the graphics are stylized and the colors are very vibrant.

847
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:44,092
So that kind of compensates that and makes this really weird.

848
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,533
Like that dissonance is what makes it interesting for us.

849
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:57,939
Awesome talk.

850
00:49:58,379 --> 00:49:58,940
Appreciate it.

851
00:49:59,300 --> 00:49:59,500
Thanks.

852
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:05,581
Just as a gameplay systems designer, super fascinated for me to see somebody approach

853
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:11,582
making a game starting with art and theme and mood and emotion and then gameplay systems

854
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:12,863
being figured out later.

855
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:15,443
Is Guacamelee the same?

856
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:17,224
No, Guacamelee was...

857
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:18,744
Every game is different.

858
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:19,824
For us it's not like...

859
00:50:20,524 --> 00:50:22,145
For this one it started with that.

860
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:24,325
For Guacamelee it was more like...

861
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:29,176
What about doing a game in Mexico and just like the visual stuff.

862
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:34,279
And there was like a bunch of ideas that fit really well with that.

863
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,342
But like the dimension idea for Guacamelee and like the idea of

864
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,805
melee moves as platforming,

865
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:45,548
that was sort of a separate idea.

867
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:54,726
Thank you.

868
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:56,850
Thank you.

869
00:50:58,192 --> 00:50:59,134
Yeah, I think that's it.

870
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:02,860
Thank you guys for coming and enjoy the rest of the GC.

871
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,621
