1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:07,185
Welcome, humans, to everything I said was wrong,

2
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:08,706
why India is different now.

3
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:11,067
Allow me to briefly set the context

4
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:12,568
for this series of micro talks.

5
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,349
This is a session about regret.

6
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,430
Everyone on this stage has given advice,

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,571
advice that they stood by and truly believed in,

8
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:20,792
advice that maybe they don't think

9
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:22,953
is such a good idea anymore.

10
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:26,175
So today's a chance for us to refute our past selves,

11
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:28,776
to set our records straight, and to protect our reputation

12
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,477
as decent givers of advice.

13
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:32,246
But why do we care?

14
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:35,569
Why bother about things we said in the not so distant past?

15
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:40,713
Well as we have all been told, the industry changes super fast and advice given just a

16
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:44,837
couple of years ago in earnest may be irrelevant in today's world and context.

17
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:49,080
To illustrate, let's take a look at how the future of games has changed over time.

18
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,261
So I think it's a good idea to look back on things

19
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,703
that were considered the future of games many years ago

20
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,104
because it's a good way of looking at how people

21
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:00,045
were reacting to the changes that were happening

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:00,886
right underneath them.

23
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,668
And also stuff that seems super obvious and commonplace now

24
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,770
wasn't necessarily as obvious then,

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,791
especially developments that would have wound up

26
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,272
having a huge impact on indies.

27
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,453
And you know, sometimes you make a prediction

28
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:14,815
about the future and it's not, it's just not like right.

29
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:18,035
Doesn't quite make it, but the point is,

30
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,476
opinions change fast, predictions about the future

31
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:23,377
change fast, and our industry just changes super fast.

32
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:27,319
So, advice we give today probably has an expiration date.

33
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,300
Basically, context is everything when giving advice,

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,741
and time frame is but one of many contexts

35
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,041
that you will listen to today.

36
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:35,202
So, let us begin.

37
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,103
My name is Lisa, I am a game designer,

38
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,683
and I'm a giver of bad advice.

39
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,611
I've worked on a number of large AAA games,

40
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:43,631
and a number of indie games,

41
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,292
and one game that's sort of in the middle of there.

42
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,354
And over time I've given a lot of advice,

43
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:50,176
be that in formal articles, or on forums,

44
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:51,677
or speaking with aspiring devs,

45
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,018
or giving feedback on game jams or whatever.

46
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,679
And as it turns out,

47
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,401
a lot of this advice has been less than good.

48
00:01:59,222 --> 00:01:59,782
In hindsight?

49
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,185
My big thing, I'm very concerned with pendulums,

50
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:05,227
meaning sometimes I would give advice

51
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,488
that wasn't outright bad,

52
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,610
but over time it would swing too far in one direction,

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,072
so I want to take it back towards the middle.

54
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,795
So my bad advice are mostly a lot of updates

55
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,857
and clarifications and course corrections.

56
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:22,780
So when I say bad advice, I probably really mean okay advice that was given irresponsibly

57
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,522
and bad in specific cases as if they're getting too pendulous, but that is long and hard to

58
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,083
say so we'll keep with bad advice.

59
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:30,364
So here's number one.

60
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:34,026
This is a pretty general one that I used to give very early on in my career and it goes

61
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:34,746
something like this.

62
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,848
Someone who's just getting started in the games industry would say.

63
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,692
or they were just getting started making games at all,

64
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:41,614
or interested in games.

65
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:43,477
They would say, how do I break into the games industry?

66
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,380
And I, being a young enthusiast who

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,244
was freshly at the start of my career, would say, make a game.

68
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:49,787
Congrats, you are in the industry.

69
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,715
Now, before I explain the trouble with his advice,

70
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,336
let me explain why I did it.

71
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,458
This advice, the problem it was addressing

72
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:57,378
was one of confidence.

73
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,980
You know, at the time, the indie scene was still on the rise

74
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,442
and a lot of aspiring developers still had the mindset

75
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,964
that the industry was limited to big studios

76
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,186
and that there was some prerequisite they had to fulfill

77
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,847
before they actually got to make games.

78
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,028
So, you know, imposter syndrome has,

79
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,429
and will probably always will be,

80
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,911
a big obstacle for people to overcome to get in the games.

81
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:17,612
And, you know, that was good.

82
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,730
That's good advice for those people,

83
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,991
but I hesitate to give this blanket advice

84
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,851
immediately anymore, because yes,

85
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,612
it's still helpful for people who are just getting blocked

86
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,653
from being in the community,

87
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,593
but I started realizing over time

88
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,714
that this is only a subset of people

89
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,194
who are asking this question.

90
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:35,895
For everyone else, how do I get into the games industry

91
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,936
was often a broad question that was masking

92
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,936
something more specific underneath.

93
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,957
Questions like, how do I make

94
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:43,697
a sustainable business making games?

95
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:46,298
Or, how do I get to work in this particular studio?

96
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,101
I want to make a game and I'm confident but I feel overwhelmed and don't know where to begin.

97
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,204
Please help. Or how do I feel like I belong in this industry or this community?

98
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,594
And for all those people, the advice of just make a game

99
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,715
is really unhelpful, like supremely unhelpful.

100
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,615
So I stopped defaulting to this response

101
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,256
when I noticed I was occasionally getting more eye rolls

102
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,396
and exasperated sighs.

103
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,737
And also, what an asshole I was to have that response,

104
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,757
just make a game and you're in, coming from me

105
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:16,617
who had one, gone through an expensive graduate program

106
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:19,238
in the US with a highly active network of alums

107
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,198
and budget to send students to GDC.

108
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,161
and who got extremely lucky that a lead designer at a big studio took a chance on her for an internship

109
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:30,604
that pretty much paved the way for her to enter studio work directly after school conveniently

110
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:34,827
sliding in just before the local economic climate made that path way harder for everyone else

111
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,249
and I'm just like yeah just make a game and

112
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,630
So I wasn't very self-aware in the early days.

113
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,191
So nowadays, if someone asks me that question,

114
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,792
I drill in for more details first.

115
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,053
What do they mean specifically when they're saying

116
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,654
what, how do I get into the games industry?

117
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:51,975
And then of course, any subsequent advice I give

118
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,076
is amended with the fact that the industry

119
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,217
constantly changes, so I have no business

120
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:58,378
giving break-in advice when I got into the industry

121
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,799
eight years ago, but I can try and be as helpful as I can.

122
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,743
So, the pendulum, in this case, the course correction,

123
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:04,323
looks like this.

124
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,506
I gave this advice as pushback to the perception

125
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:10,267
that there were these big obstacles keeping someone

126
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,129
from making games that they weren't allowed to.

127
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,431
But over time, it swung too far in the other direction

128
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,213
and became an answer for too narrow of an audience.

129
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:20,614
So now I try and take it back to the middle there.

130
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,409
All right, bad advice number two.

131
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,150
This is a bit student-centric,

132
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,371
but I still think it has some general applications.

133
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:27,752
It's about portfolios.

134
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,013
People often ask me for portfolio advice,

135
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,555
and there used to be a time when I would tell people,

136
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,475
especially students,

137
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,417
game jam games are great for your portfolio.

138
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,442
Now I do love game jams and I think they have tremendous value, but I don't give this advice anymore.

139
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,043
And let me explain why.

140
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:46,667
So, in the first place, I would give this advice for several reasons.

141
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:52,233
One, you know, this is just good advice for people to take when they're afraid to jump in and make anything at all.

142
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,136
I found that years ago it was way more common

143
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:58,078
to find people who were mired in gigantic,

144
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,799
too long projects as their first game

145
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,541
and needed a way of overcoming that.

146
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:03,182
And on the student front,

147
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:05,164
there were fewer game programs at the time

148
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,866
and many people making games for class,

149
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,748
those games tended to lack depth.

150
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,090
In fact, I remember a time when a lot of professionals

151
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,653
gave the advice, don't include student work on your resume.

152
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:17,714
And that was because of reason.

153
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,936
So I encourage students to include Game Jam games

154
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:21,758
as a way of pushing them to do work

155
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:22,999
independent of the classroom.

156
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,641
But things are different.

157
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,363
For one, game schools are more prevalent

158
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,306
and many are way more robust in the props tricks

159
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,447
they require of their students,

160
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:33,709
which are definitely things that are worthy

161
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,010
of showing up on resumes.

162
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,412
It isn't just, oh, this is an offhand assignment

163
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,093
I did for class.

164
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:39,494
So that's being fulfilled.

165
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:41,675
But game jams have also changed.

166
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:47,837
Game jams used to be less frequent and only a few happened a year and they tended to feel

167
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:51,979
like big notable events and participation could draw a lot of eyes on each one.

168
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,961
And now there are many, many game jams you can count simultaneously running at all times

169
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:59,582
as you can see from this slice of the game jam event calendar on itch.

170
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,423
And I noticed recently, like within the past couple

171
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,923
of years, I had students that participated

172
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,684
in so many game jams so frequently

173
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:11,144
that they weren't spending any time on any long form work.

174
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,805
So their portfolios ended up being quite shallow.

175
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,805
So I still think game jams are wonderful ways

176
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,386
to get involved with the community,

177
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,246
get experience working with new devs,

178
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,887
have a chance to like force yourself

179
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,307
into some creative constraints.

180
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,507
And of course it is extremely useful still

181
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,008
for someone getting over the hump

182
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,008
of completing their first game.

183
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,089
And I recommend it to those people all the time

184
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:32,729
for those reasons.

185
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,810
But when it comes to the portfolio stuff,

186
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,811
I don't say that anymore.

187
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,492
I tend to recommend them as supplementary material.

188
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,474
And the goal here is the pendulum swung so far

189
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,415
from only do what's required in class

190
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:47,395
and I have to make an MMO as my first game

191
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,637
to all game jams all day, every day, forever.

192
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,658
So just trying to take it back to the middle.

193
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,112
All right, number three, this is an apology to tech folks

194
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:58,853
and programmers that I've worked with over the year

195
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,196
who patiently taught me why this advice was not so great.

196
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:05,738
This was another one I'd often get from people

197
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,339
wanting to get started and they would say,

198
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,361
what programming language should I learn?

199
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,401
And I would say, it doesn't matter.

200
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:12,963
It does not matter what programming language you learn.

201
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:16,179
And I don't give that anymore.

202
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,982
But at the time, that advice by itself isn't necessarily bad.

203
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,804
And at the time, I had a lot of students,

204
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,346
or not students, but just people getting into games.

205
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:28,429
They were coming up through game dev.net communities

206
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:29,569
where there's these arguments

207
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,431
about what the best programming language is

208
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:35,034
and this weird posturing thing going on in that community.

209
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:38,316
And that sort of thing can really demoralize people

210
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,278
even before they get started.

211
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,039
So for folks in that context,

212
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,340
that was a useful thing to say.

213
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,244
But I found that over time, saying this as a general blanket advice for everyone involved

214
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:53,728
in games could perpetuate inaccurate information and it ended up blocking some programmers

215
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,669
from reaching the goals that they had.

216
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,352
Because yes, at a certain level it doesn't matter what language you use and it's good

217
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,053
not to get discouraged by evangelists.

218
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,815
But you know.

219
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:09,574
there is this one level, like when you start dealing with memory management and optimization,

220
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:15,816
it's different. It's a different level and at this point it does start to matter what language you

221
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:20,137
learn. There's just like a different skill threshold. So I started to realize by withholding

222
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:24,639
this information up front, it did people a disservice, especially if they had particular

223
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,100
future goals where they might need to end up knowing this sort of stuff.

224
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,381
And I know we tend to think of optimization as like

225
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,682
things for big AAA companies and console game development

226
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:33,903
not relevant to indies.

227
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,984
But that's not always the case

228
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,505
and it doesn't always have to be the case.

229
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:42,688
Especially with VR being such a thing for the indie community.

230
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:46,551
Optimization is a thing that can come into play

231
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:50,095
and even just on that, I know a lot of people

232
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:53,979
who got into gameplay programming and ultimately realized

233
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,600
that their true passion was tools.

234
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,563
And so that sort of thing was a bit of a block

235
00:09:58,623 --> 00:09:59,564
to keep them from getting there.

236
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:03,815
So it's not that this advice is bad without context,

237
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:07,737
but I noticed over time I started seeing interpretations

238
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:10,558
of that advice turn into something a little bit pendulous,

239
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:12,659
which is why I don't give it anymore.

240
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,120
So instead, if someone asks me for advice

241
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,381
on programming languages, I try and get more details

242
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:18,621
and context, you know, what...

243
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:19,942
What are your goals?

244
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,163
What's your current experience?

245
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,544
Are you the sort of person who learns best

246
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,025
by seeing results fast?

247
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,726
Are you the sort of person who needs

248
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,187
to completely understand a system

249
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,608
and how it works before moving forward?

250
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:33,690
And all of these bits shape the answer to be more specific.

251
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,331
So there we go.

252
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,693
This is where it started, where it ended up.

253
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:39,674
Trying to keep it down in the middle.

254
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:41,554
Alright, last one.

255
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,955
This is kind of a super specific weird one.

256
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:44,975
It's different than all the others,

257
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,756
but it has something that has burdened me with guilt

258
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:49,476
for many years, so bear with me.

259
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:51,817
For a long time, throughout my career,

260
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,238
I used to say this, I used to recommend,

261
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:57,238
group brainstorming is the ideal way

262
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:58,899
to generate creative ideas.

263
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,040
And I really believed this.

264
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,203
I believed it so much, I once wrote this extensive article,

265
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,724
I think on Alt Dev Blog a Day,

266
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,786
about how to moderate these meetings

267
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,867
and pool of tips to make them not terrible.

268
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:12,289
And it's because at the time I was really believed

269
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,231
in emphasizing that ideas came from the team,

270
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,713
not one person dictating all the creative decisions.

271
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:17,814
So I really pushed this.

272
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:21,416
But as it turns out, group brainstorming

273
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,497
is actually not a very good way

274
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:25,618
to generate creative ideas like at all.

275
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,780
And this has been proven like with science,

276
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,800
all those hot takes.

277
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:33,042
This is the research that they all refer to.

278
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:35,343
And you know, the reason it ends up being

279
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,104
has big creativity flaws,

280
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,126
it's because of interference of human group behaviors

281
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,467
like anchoring or social loafing

282
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,148
or regression to the mean, stuff like that.

283
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,009
But there's something else going on

284
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:46,729
that I want to point out.

285
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,972
These studies on the ineffectiveness of brainstorming

286
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,052
came out in 2010.

287
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,135
Meanwhile, my manifesto was a year later.

288
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,277
So it's not like I didn't have this information

289
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,018
available to me.

290
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,099
In fact, I'm pretty sure in those years

291
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,500
I probably heard the counterclaim

292
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,741
about group brainstorming being.

293
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,423
garbage, but I conveniently filtered those out,

294
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,924
and it's quite frankly because I wanted it to be true.

295
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,605
I was good at those meetings,

296
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,165
I was good at moderating, brainstorming,

297
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,626
and I wanted it to be a useful skill.

298
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:17,427
So I conveniently filtered out these facts.

299
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,188
This is one of the most dangerous parts of giving advice,

300
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:21,969
is the cognitive biases that come into play

301
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,930
that allow us to pass on terrible advice,

302
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,691
especially when it comes to advice

303
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,231
that involves always or never

304
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,692
or the best way to do something.

305
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:32,174
So remember the wise words of Neil deGrasse Tyson.

306
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:33,916
If you want to assert a truth,

307
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,278
first make sure it is not just an opinion

308
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:38,119
that you desperately want to be true.

309
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,101
So I don't give this advice anymore,

310
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,063
but it's not like a complete wash.

311
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,004
I do advise a slightly modified process

312
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,486
that works pretty well and keeps the teamwork aspects in

313
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:49,788
where you brainstorm problems to solve as a group,

314
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,310
break off, come up with solutions individually,

315
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,872
and then come back together to discuss those solutions.

316
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,214
I've used this on a few smaller games since,

317
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,294
and it's a pretty good process.

318
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,370
All right, so the pendulum here was one of an extreme.

319
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,711
I was pushing the group brainstorming for the group part,

320
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,552
but was justifying the process

321
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,173
with something that was not true.

322
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,914
All right, so real quick, to close out,

323
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:11,395
I wanna give some rapid-fire advice

324
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,736
for people receiving advice, how to take advice.

325
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,679
Number one, be suspicious of how-to success stories.

326
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,821
Stories where, you know, stories about how people got

327
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,443
where they are are great, but watch out for things

328
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,864
that are like, I did these steps and had success.

329
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:30,286
Therefore, to success, you do these steps.

330
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,268
Similar, realize people may not have had success,

331
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,690
or they might have had success in spite of the things

332
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,591
they did instead of because of them.

333
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:41,188
And number three, mind the voices you are not hearing

334
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,189
when you hear advice.

335
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,112
We hear a lot of the same voices in this community

336
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,353
over and over again.

337
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,455
And just be mindful of this,

338
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:50,336
be mindful of who you are not hearing from.

339
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,437
Because if you aren't careful,

340
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,659
the people you hear from over and over

341
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,241
can end up sort of narrowly defining

342
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,024
what the industry is, and that's dangerous.

343
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,265
So just be mindful of that.

344
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,606
Mostly, context is everything.

345
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:05,507
The answer to any request for advice is usually it depends.

346
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,129
Mind the pendulum and give advice responsibly.

347
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:09,569
Thank you.

348
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:22,294
All right.

349
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,183
So I've given a lot of advice.

350
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,104
My name's Daniel Cook.

351
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:29,730
I'm a chief creative officer over at Spryfox.

352
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:30,711
And.

353
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,942
I've given a bunch of bad advice.

354
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:37,323
We've had some of that success bias

355
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:38,563
that Lisa was talking about,

356
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,964
where we've done things and we've been successful,

357
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,145
and then we try to tell people those,

358
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,486
you know, it's like, hey, look at this cool thing we did.

359
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,327
You could try it too, and then it never works out.

360
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,647
And then I come back a couple years later

361
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:53,148
and I talk to the people that I've given advice to,

362
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,669
and they're like, yeah.

363
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:59,533
We kind of went through a year of hell trying to do what you told us might be work out.

364
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,317
And we almost lost our passion for games and our lives were almost ruined.

365
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,180
And but you know, then we figured out kind of something that works for us.

366
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,781
But thank you so much for that advice.

367
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:15,466
And I just go away and I'm like, Oh, why am I a horrible human being?

368
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,240
So this site gets me in trouble a lot.

369
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,081
There's a website called Lost Garden.

370
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,303
It has a lot of, it's got years,

371
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,985
years of game design advice on there.

372
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:31,528
And yeah, you know, context.

373
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:34,010
In 10 years, a lot of stuff changes.

374
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:41,157
For example, I used to give advice, this was in 2005,

375
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,700
before there was even a thing called free to play.

376
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,481
The acronym didn't really exist.

377
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,124
And I was super excited about this new business model

378
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:54,187
called service based games or free to play games.

379
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,208
Like I wrote this article about like.

380
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:01,170
It's like getting the band together and you're going touring as opposed to selling this big album.

381
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,232
I was contrasting it with retail sales and I was super excited about where that would take us.

382
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:12,740
there were all sorts of good things about it.

383
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,183
I don't know if anyone here has done retail.

384
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,805
I don't know if retail exists for a lot of people anymore.

385
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,868
But it used to be these feast and famine cycles.

386
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:24,550
You'd really get lots and lots of money

387
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,293
and then you'd have no money for like three years.

388
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,314
And then you prayed that your next game

389
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,375
was gonna be a hit.

390
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,718
And so I'm like, wow, if we could get continuous money

391
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,440
all the way along, wouldn't that be awesome?

392
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,923
There were big, powerful publishers,

393
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:41,166
the indie digital distribution thing

394
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,427
didn't exist at the time,

395
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,891
and it's like, wow, we could break the power of publishers,

396
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,614
we could have direct connection with our customers,

397
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,197
and free-to-play's gonna solve all that.

398
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,619
We're gonna have this tight connection

399
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,222
between us, the developers, and our community.

400
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:05,285
And so all this good stuff was I was like excited about it was one of these things where sometimes advice givers

401
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:12,633
They see a future and they make that future into a beautiful thing in their head, but then

402
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:14,936
reality happens and

403
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,397
capitalism happens

404
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,261
Turns out that service based games are a pain in the ass to

405
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,723
make. You can make them and you can lose your shirt on them.

406
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,345
Super specialized knowledge to build well. You have to have

407
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:34,606
analytics and back end knowledge and there's certain patterns

408
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:37,828
that work and there's certain patterns that don't work. There

409
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:40,969
are, if there's a hundred ways that a steam launch can go

410
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,451
wrong, there are 10,000 ways that a free to play launch can

411
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:44,951
go wrong.

412
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,033
And they do not work for every game.

413
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:53,014
Certain people, like developers, they have a dream game,

414
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,834
and they're like, oh, well, just switch out

415
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:57,875
the business model and add that free-to-play to it.

416
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:58,735
It doesn't work.

417
00:17:59,135 --> 00:17:59,916
It doesn't work at all.

418
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,096
Like, the game and the business model

419
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:04,277
are tied together at an intimate level.

420
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,998
Most of the games that you grew up with in the like.

421
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,802
in the 90s or early 2000s,

422
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:14,684
were specifically, they evolved for retail.

423
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:18,526
They evolved for a very specific market environment

424
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,267
where there was a single price

425
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,888
and they didn't give a damn what happened to you afterwards.

426
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,009
As long as you paid that upfront cost

427
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,651
and you got excited about the press and PR

428
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:29,851
and you bought the game,

429
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:32,333
then the game was good to sell.

430
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,214
And so we built these genres

431
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:35,895
that were based off that business model.

432
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:39,077
and they don't transfer very well to service-based stuff.

433
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,860
And teams don't necessarily have the same skills,

434
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,881
mindset, excitement.

435
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:44,802
Oh, sorry.

436
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:46,703
I'm just talking here.

437
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,187
Put me in a closet, turn me around backwards,

438
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:52,548
and I'd be happy.

439
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,578
So they've also evolved into their own ecosystem.

440
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:02,021
So like Free to Play is just a weird,

441
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:06,308
it's this weird like Galapagos of its own type of games.

442
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,287
You know, like, you see the future,

443
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:14,669
and you dream about it, and then you build it,

444
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,271
and it turns out every single time

445
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,552
there is a new technology or a new platform,

446
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:22,274
it's going to come with unique constraints.

447
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,016
And we don't know what those constraints are

448
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:25,797
when we're dreaming.

449
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:27,578
And when we get there,

450
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,979
they may not be constraints that we'd like.

451
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,303
So, and you may not want to build on Galapagos.

452
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,465
It's kind of a series of islands full of turtles

453
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,626
in the middle of nowhere, right?

454
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:39,928
So maybe that's not your thing.

455
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,931
So whenever you're hearing someone dreaming,

456
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,173
it's very exciting to listen to dreamers.

457
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:49,177
But don't necessarily say, oh wow,

458
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:50,558
it's gonna be everything they promise.

459
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,241
Because usually it's that plus a whole bunch more.

460
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,551
The other one I was excited about

461
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:58,872
was making your game multiplayer.

462
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,734
I'm like, maybe we can connect people.

463
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:07,057
Wouldn't it be cool instead of dying slowly

464
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:09,518
as we stare at the glowing screen

465
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:11,519
all by ourselves in a darkened room,

466
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,161
we were actually connecting with humanity

467
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:17,102
and making friends and building relationships.

468
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,903
That sounds like an amazing thing to me.

469
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,132
And like, you know, you put a game out there

470
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,333
and it's got community and people are playing

471
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:26,033
with each other.

472
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:29,435
It's like all the joy of playgrounds in our childhood

473
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:33,197
coming into a game that we're making for others.

474
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:37,218
And so I got really excited about multiplayer as well.

475
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:45,480
And it turns out there's a whole bunch of other constraints associated with that that cause people to

476
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:50,227
Destroy their entire careers as they smash up against this cliffside

477
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:52,765
It's very expensive.

478
00:20:54,346 --> 00:21:00,290
Multiplayer can be anywhere from 2 to 10x as expensive to make as a single player game.

479
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,610
It's a lot of work.

480
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,212
It has more design risks.

481
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:10,196
It turns out when you put people together with other people, they do weird shit.

482
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:11,817
And...

483
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,585
When you have a single player game,

484
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,805
you kind of have this funnel,

485
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,526
and you can do a bunch of play tests,

486
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,627
and there's a limited range of things that people can do.

487
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:26,128
But multiplayer, it's like, wait,

488
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:28,729
I had no idea he was going to do that

489
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:31,550
with the seashell to that other person

490
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,811
with 500 of his friends.

491
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,732
Like, it's just not something that comes into your head.

492
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,833
And they do it and you're like, oh wow,

493
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:40,773
we now have to solve that.

494
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:43,714
And now you're into weird, messy design problems

495
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:47,235
of like governance and like how do we implement

496
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,895
a proper like government and democracy

497
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,276
and rule system in our game.

498
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,516
And it's like, wait, those are unsolved problems.

499
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:55,917
And so it's hard.

500
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,258
And technical risks and servers.

501
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:05,520
And so everyone who took that advice kind of failed.

502
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,379
So I've had great guilt over that.

503
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:17,629
So I would say whenever

504
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,525
Multiplayer development is sort of like

505
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,726
expert game development, is one way to look at it.

506
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:28,187
So if you've got four or five games under your belt,

507
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:32,149
you have an amazing technical background,

508
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:36,490
you've built like a half dozen multiplayer prototypes

509
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,911
in your spare time, you know how to scale servers,

510
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,251
you know how to do all this stuff,

511
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,912
then sure, go for it.

512
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:42,672
But...

513
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:46,913
Often I should like say, wait, what's your background?

514
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:49,374
Like, is that the type of game you want to make?

515
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:53,755
Like, you know, like what's your skill set

516
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,695
when you hear some of this advice?

517
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:00,756
Go cross platform.

518
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:02,577
This was another piece of advice I gave.

519
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,237
Seemed really smart.

520
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
So multiple shots on goal, like you make one game

521
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,981
and then for relatively inexpensive porting costs

522
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,982
you get to put it on multiple platforms.

523
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:20,583
And let's say that one platform totally screws you over

524
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,104
by not giving you a feature, well that's all right.

525
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:25,265
because then you can get a cool feature

526
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:27,546
on a different platform and maybe you'll be a success.

527
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,207
And this actually worked for us.

528
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,308
We released Triple Town on two different platforms

529
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,869
and it was a disaster, complete disaster.

530
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,930
And then we released it on mobile

531
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,411
and it was this wild success and we're like,

532
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,912
obviously this works because it worked for us.

533
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,253
So multi-platform is the way to go.

534
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:51,105
But you know, it's not always a good idea.

535
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,826
Certain games fit certain platforms well.

536
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,669
We had a game, Scott Brody, right over here,

537
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,272
and we released a sort of a collectible card game.

538
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,974
And we put it on Facebook, of all places.

539
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:10,299
And at this point, Facebook was relatively new.

540
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,060
It was a new platform.

541
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,262
New platforms are exciting

542
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,424
because you can get access to customers.

543
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:18,347
So it's not like this bloody red ocean

544
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:20,589
of like thousands of games out there.

545
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,332
You might be like a small number of games

546
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,013
relatively early on.

547
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:28,557
Hey, look at all these people that are desperate to play.

548
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:29,658
They'll play our game.

549
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,094
But each platform has its own style preferences.

550
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:38,537
The players on Facebook prefer a particular type of game.

551
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:41,419
The people on a mobile platform prefer

552
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,480
a particular type of game,

553
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,602
and games don't transfer all that well.

554
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:46,123
Control systems don't transfer.

555
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:48,364
Aesthetics do not transfer.

556
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:53,188
And early on in a platform's life,

557
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:56,029
you don't know what those aesthetics are going to be.

558
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,890
You have no idea.

559
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,511
So again, you're guessing into the future,

560
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,632
you're making a prediction,

561
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:03,314
and often you'll port a game to that platform

562
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:04,275
and it just won't work out.

563
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,517
It just will be like a complete disaster

564
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:10,179
because you kind of missed something really, really obvious

565
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,361
that you learned about six months too late.

566
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:20,300
With multi-platform, I still think it's an okay idea,

567
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,602
but on new platforms, you're really taking a risk.

568
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,444
And if you don't have a lot of experience with a platform,

569
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:28,484
you're taking a big risk.

570
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:34,507
So do it in a way where you can fail, you know?

571
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:41,151
Which actually leads directly to this last lesson.

572
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:45,213
Right here, or where are we?

573
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:46,788
There we are.

574
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:49,329
I was like, well, games fail all the time.

575
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,269
Like, I've been making games for about 20 years,

576
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,650
and you know how much money I've wasted?

577
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,331
How much time I've wasted?

578
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:00,032
Like, so many dead games.

579
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,352
So many things that I believed in 100%.

580
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,073
We built them, and they just failed.

581
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,534
Like, just carcasses of games.

582
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:09,354
That is my career.

583
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:17,601
And so I'm like, but wait wait, I know how this is done like I've watched publishers do this

584
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:21,826
What you do is even if you have like five games fail

585
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:28,953
That's okay because one game will be a success and it will make a lot of money and it will pay for all those other

586
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:29,373
games

587
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,192
And so I wrote this big article on it.

588
00:26:33,252 --> 00:26:35,674
I was like, hey, here's portfolio theory

589
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,176
for game development.

590
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,578
Here's how you make multiple games

591
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,459
and here's how you budget in order to like,

592
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,762
so that you can have one game be a success

593
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:48,645
and pay for some of the other ones and so on and so forth.

594
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,128
It's lovely business school theory

595
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:54,210
and it works really, really well, except

596
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:58,569
there's a problem with it.

597
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,831
People heard this aim for a 5X return on costs,

598
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,093
and they got completely and utterly freaked out.

599
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:12,195
Like, new devs, I was speaking to new developers,

600
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:17,358
and they're like, I'm struggling to just make a single game,

601
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:20,099
and you're telling me to make five games?

602
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:23,458
this is overwhelming.

603
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,679
You've basically just ruined all my dreams.

604
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,000
And I went home, I read your article,

605
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,960
and I went home and cried.

606
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,161
And they're like, and wait, wait,

607
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:36,001
like I made a game, and I'm so happy

608
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,242
because it made back the money that I made,

609
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,302
that I put into it.

610
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:40,562
Like it broke even.

611
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:41,863
I can make another game.

612
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:42,943
Isn't that amazing?

613
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,423
And then I read your article,

614
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,804
and it said, no, you're a failure of a human being.

615
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:46,884
And,

616
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:54,407
It's like, oh, it comes, like this portfolio theory,

617
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:57,028
it comes across as you're all gonna fail

618
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:57,908
and shouldn't even try.

619
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,291
And so I was giving advice that was based off

620
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:06,193
an actually well-proven sort of strategy for making games,

621
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:11,856
but it was the wrong advice to people

622
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,656
at the wrong time in their careers.

623
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:17,133
And it was really demotivating.

624
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,437
So again, that was a matter of me not listening to who they

625
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:21,658
were and what they needed.

626
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:26,043
So this kind of gets into

627
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,194
a piece of advice giving.

628
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:34,156
We're all on sort of a very, very personal journey

629
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:35,177
when we make games.

630
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:38,318
We all start out and there's certain things we're good at

631
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:39,679
and certain things we're bad at,

632
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,680
and then we learn new skills.

633
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:43,821
We might learn how to program,

634
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:45,422
we might learn how to do design,

635
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:47,303
we might learn how to think about business,

636
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:51,965
but we're all on very, very different points in that career.

637
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,147
And when someone gives advice,

638
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,028
especially in a conference like this.

639
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:00,511
they're usually at a completely different point

640
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:01,852
in their personal journey

641
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:04,334
than the person who's listening to the advice.

642
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:06,096
And it's not an advancement,

643
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:08,198
it's not like this person's level one

644
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,719
and this person's level five,

645
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,082
and level five giving advice to level one doesn't work out.

646
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:16,445
It's a tree, and people, like, there are so many,

647
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:17,826
there are lifetimes.

648
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,420
of learning in game development.

649
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,303
Like you can be, you could spend 100, 300 years

650
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,845
learning game development and you wouldn't know everything.

651
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:32,688
And so, when we give advice,

652
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,751
often it's, you're listening to an expert.

653
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:40,733
And that expert is very, very good

654
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,155
at a very specific area of game development.

655
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,856
what their advice may be doesn't really match up

656
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:49,578
with what you need at that moment.

657
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,344
So anytime you take advice,

658
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:57,891
use it to go off and do your own experiments.

659
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:00,619
and do those cheaply.

660
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,280
Don't say, I'm gonna do this thing

661
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,482
that this expert told me and it's gonna work out,

662
00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:06,124
because you may not have the right skill set,

663
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:10,248
you may not have the right mindset,

664
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,791
you may need to contextualize that advice

665
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:15,393
in terms of your own experience.

666
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,216
And this is, I think, one of the reasons

667
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:19,437
why people come back to me and say,

668
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,379
you ruined my life, but thank you.

669
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:26,005
because they were able to take that

670
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:27,627
and go on their own journey

671
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:30,549
and find out things about themselves

672
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:32,391
and about what they could do and what they liked

673
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,073
that led them to a place

674
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:36,855
where they could find success in the future.

675
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:41,659
And so just to show you how screwed up this is,

676
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,603
every single piece of advice that I said

677
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,845
you probably shouldn't do and was bad advice

678
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,906
is our company strategy.

679
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:55,105
Like, we take, we do every single one of those

680
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:57,047
on all of our games, and we're like,

681
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,189
of course we're gonna make a free-to-play,

682
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:01,812
multiplayer game, you know, that brings people together

683
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:02,753
and does all this stuff.

684
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:06,497
Because it works for us, in our place, in our journey.

685
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:08,078
But that doesn't necessarily mean

686
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,180
it's good advice for everyone.

687
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:30,537
That would be awkward, but...

688
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,277
Sorry, hold on.

689
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:31,938
Hi.

690
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:36,640
There we go.

691
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,200
Hi, I'm Liz England.

692
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:42,545
I speak really loudly, don't worry, you'll all hear me.

693
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:45,710
I'm Liz England, I am a game designer

694
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,893
at a tiny indie company called Ubisoft.

695
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,198
But, okay, so to be honest,

696
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:53,381
I'm here talking at the Indie Summit, obviously,

697
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:54,944
and I just wanna.

698
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:58,666
prep you guys to know that my talk is for everybody in the industry.

699
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:00,867
Doesn't matter if you're AAA, doesn't matter if you're indie,

700
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:03,629
doesn't matter if you're a student or an entrepreneur

701
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,510
or you're a developer or a business person.

702
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,132
Whether you're aspiring or you have many more years of experience than me,

703
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:13,233
I feel like this is one of those talks that sort of speaks to everyone.

704
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,095
So anyway, let's get into how I was wrong.

705
00:32:17,696 --> 00:32:20,357
So once upon a time I was a baby game designer.

706
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,370
And when I first entered this industry,

707
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,472
I did what a lot of other people I think do,

708
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,814
which is seek out advice

709
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,596
from more experienced game developers.

710
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:30,238
I sought out mentors,

711
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:33,001
and I tried to learn as much as I could from them,

712
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:34,783
from their prior,

713
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,685
like their existing experience in the game industry.

714
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:43,125
I took their advice, I took their industry wisdom,

715
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:46,108
I internalized it, I learned how the game industry works,

716
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:48,149
how does the game industry function,

717
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,672
and I followed a lot of that advice personally,

718
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,695
and I even came to attribute a lot of my success

719
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,957
to this advice that I gained from others, right?

720
00:32:57,678 --> 00:32:58,679
And I think,

721
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,657
As I was getting that advice and I was succeeding on my own,

722
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:04,619
I was like, well, obviously the next thing I want to do

723
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,461
is just as I was mentored by people more experienced than me

724
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:10,904
I would continue and mentor people following in my path.

725
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:13,466
And I take the advice that I was given and I was like,

726
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,187
oh yeah, this is great advice, I'm succeeding,

727
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:15,948
things are going well,

728
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,649
and then I pass it down to the next group.

729
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:20,632
And I think, I thought then and I still think today,

730
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:22,813
it's incredibly important to share knowledge

731
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:23,434
in this industry,

732
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,456
except that maybe you should be a little bit more critical

733
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,917
than I was on what that knowledge was

734
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:28,558
that you were sharing.

735
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,339
So one of the problems I ran into,

736
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,181
as I've gotten older and gained a bit more experience

737
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,081
and listened to some other voices,

738
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,763
I realized that a lot of the advice that I was passing down,

739
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:44,545
that industry wisdom, the how the game industry works,

740
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:46,406
was being passed down rather uncritically.

741
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:50,087
And so today, not only am I here to say that I was wrong,

742
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,668
but I'm now even philosophically opposed

743
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,348
to a lot of the advice that I used to give,

744
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:56,829
and I'm gonna pull out some of the worst things that I said.

745
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:59,890
And I'm repeating them here today

746
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,171
because I treated them like they were facts,

747
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,212
like they were immutable, unchangeable facts

748
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,592
about how the industry is.

749
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:09,153
And what they really are is myths we make up about our work.

750
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:13,036
And you could say that I'm kind of here to try to like break that cycle

751
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:18,160
And so a lot of these things that you're gonna hear me say are gonna be very familiar

752
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,465
And you may have heard yourself say them you'll probably have heard many other people here at GDC who have said them at some point

753
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:30,430
And I disagree with all of them, and I will tell you why so here's some of the terrible things that I've said

754
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:35,514
All that matters are your skills just do good work, and you'll succeed

755
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:37,856
You will have to crunch

756
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:43,993
I got to where I am by suffering or some sort of hardship,

757
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,114
and so will you.

758
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:46,655
You know, there's no way to cut corners.

759
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:49,256
Don't make games for the money.

760
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,438
Make games because you have passion.

761
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,639
A thousand other people would kill to have your job.

762
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,042
People who burn out, well maybe they're just not able

763
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:00,263
to make it in this industry.

764
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,345
And if you aren't willing to make a few personal sacrifices,

765
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:05,946
maybe the industry is not for you.

766
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:09,448
These got subtly more depressing as I went through them.

767
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:15,150
But this is advice that I received from my peers,

768
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:16,231
from my mentors.

769
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,533
This is advice that I followed for a while,

770
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:21,795
and some longer than others, I'm ashamed to say.

771
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:24,037
And it's advice that I used to tell others,

772
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:25,138
and it's advice that I still hear.

773
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,759
I hear it on forums, I see it on Twitter.

774
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,301
I hear about it in studio offices,

775
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,783
or among other game developers at ad conferences like GDC.

776
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,425
So this is advice that people still give.

777
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:39,311
And I feel like a lot of this advice is just putting on horse blinders.

778
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:43,256
If you don't see the problems in our industry, and you don't acknowledge them, then you can

779
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,138
pretend they don't exist.

780
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:49,566
Or maybe you can say, you can acknowledge that they do exist, but you can't fix them

781
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:49,906
anyway.

782
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,048
Or you can say...

783
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:56,929
say, as I think both Lisa and Dan may have mentioned, you can pretend that they're, you

784
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,030
can believe, you can choose to believe that they're ingredients to success, you know?

785
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,791
You can say that because of this advice you succeeded.

786
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:08,433
So you succeeded because of this advice instead of in spite of this advice.

787
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:12,974
So some of this advice, oops.

788
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,094
Some of this advice ignores or diminishes the effects

789
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:19,715
of say toxic work environments,

790
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:23,457
casual sexism, racism, xenophobia,

791
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,639
and ignores that some people have advantages

792
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:28,700
as others don't, and that not everybody is completely,

793
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,641
not everything that you do

794
00:36:30,682 --> 00:36:31,902
is completely under your own control,

795
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,683
and that sometimes if you don't succeed,

796
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:34,784
it's not actually your fault.

797
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:38,275
Some of this advice is all about sacrificing,

798
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:41,177
encouraging you and me and everyone around us

799
00:36:41,438 --> 00:36:43,620
as artists or as developers to give up

800
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,562
the best years of our life and to ignore self-care,

801
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,724
to put quality of life on the back burner,

802
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:51,487
because for some reason a lot of us have it in our heads

803
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,089
that making games is more important

804
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:54,750
than being happy and healthy.

805
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,286
And then a lot of advice is there to silence criticism,

806
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,468
and it makes you feel guilty or ashamed for complaining.

807
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,229
Because I mean, a lot of other people,

808
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,150
like we have it better than a lot of other people.

809
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,152
And some of us have it better than others, and it's true.

810
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,253
But the culture of making games can sometimes feel

811
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:13,355
like one of those stereotypical Greek fraternities.

812
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,457
We have this hazing ritual of sustained crunch,

813
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:19,859
whether it's days, weeks, months, years.

814
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,901
We eat poorly, we have poor health,

815
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,943
we miss out on major events with friends and families

816
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:27,104
because we're too busy making games.

817
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,187
I missed out on my aunt's wedding because of crunch

818
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:31,868
and this is somebody who helped raise me.

819
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:34,270
But I missed her wedding because I was too busy

820
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,171
shipping a video game.

821
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,833
We're an in-group of people who have like

822
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,435
these shared similar hardships

823
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,117
and a lot of us don't know an alternative way

824
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,438
but that doesn't mean that our hardships

825
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:45,739
need to be a rite of passage.

826
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:50,225
And sometimes the advice is just as much for us,

827
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:52,106
the advice givers, as it is for others.

828
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,387
They're the myths we tell ourselves about why people quit,

829
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,869
why our colleagues, our peers, our friends

830
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,550
are no longer in the industry.

831
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,312
And we say, well, it's not the industry's fault

832
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:01,952
they didn't succeed.

833
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:03,413
Maybe they just weren't right for the industry.

834
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,174
It wasn't a right fit.

835
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,076
Or maybe we imply that, you know,

836
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:09,497
they're the ones that need to change to fit the industry.

837
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,299
The industry can't change to fit them.

838
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,420
And maybe that's just an easy lie to tell ourselves

839
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,741
because it's just so hard to make change.

840
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:18,342
And then sometimes advice that's given out so freely

841
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,310
can feel threatening under the wrong circumstances.

842
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:24,258
Don't complain or you'll get replaced by somebody who won't.

843
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:28,394
So none of these statements are true, I say.

844
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:30,535
Although some would warn, don't take advice

845
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,476
that says none in all ways.

846
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:34,177
I found myself hearing them.

847
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:35,378
I repeated them.

848
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:36,819
I was pretty uncritical about them.

849
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,160
I still hear them tossed around pretty freely.

850
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,901
I apologize for every single one of these.

851
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,382
And the attitude paired with this advice

852
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,443
is not always bad, right?

853
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:46,003
Like a lot of times it's just being helpful.

854
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,784
I mean, I think I was just trying to be helpful

855
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:48,665
when I said it.

856
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:52,467
Sometimes...

857
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,725
We say this when we say, oh, we know it's true,

858
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,606
even if we don't like it, it's just the way it is.

859
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:58,707
It's kind of like giving up.

860
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:01,568
Sometimes we say it to scare off people

861
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,770
who are not really dedicated to making games.

862
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,451
You know, those people who don't realize making games

863
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:07,732
is actually hard work.

864
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:10,033
Without realizing that we're also scaring away

865
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,435
all those people who are willing to do the hard work

866
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:14,476
to make games, but they're not willing to follow along

867
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:16,337
with these myth-making hardships.

868
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:19,199
And so we scare off the people

869
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,560
that could be helping improve our industry.

870
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,181
And when I find myself repeating advice that I was given,

871
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,503
and when you find yourself repeating advice

872
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:30,704
that you were given from me or from others,

873
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:34,346
advice on crunch, on personal sacrifice for your art,

874
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,728
on the difficulty of breaking into the industry,

875
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:40,030
on the hard day-to-day work of just making a game,

876
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,971
I want you to ask yourself,

877
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:43,392
and I really mean this seriously,

878
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:45,893
ask yourself, what kind of game industry

879
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:46,754
do I want to have in 30 years?

880
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:50,708
And when you, just like me today, are in a position to give advice to others,

881
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:53,732
think about whether you're perpetuating bad habits in this industry,

882
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,153
the worst parts of the industry,

883
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:57,876
or whether you're encouraging improvements with your advice,

884
00:39:58,237 --> 00:40:00,099
whether you're encouraging the right kind of people

885
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:02,421
that will help this industry evolve into a better place,

886
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:05,364
so that you're still happy to work in it 30 years from now.

887
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,867
And 30 years from now, it'll look like a practical utopia

888
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:08,808
compared to how it is today.

889
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,831
So all that advice that I used to give,

890
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,433
those were the myths about the industry that I bought into.

891
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:16,934
And there's other myths today.

892
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:19,316
But that's what old Liz would have said,

893
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,657
baby game developer Liz.

894
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,259
And today, here's what I would say instead

895
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:23,879
for each of those.

896
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,601
So what I used to say, all that matters are your skills,

897
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,122
just do good work and you'll succeed.

898
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:30,604
Instead I say,

899
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,088
It's not just your skills that matter,

900
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:34,889
but also who you know, where you live,

901
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,891
what language you speak, your gender, your skin color,

902
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,753
or whether you even know about an opportunity

903
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,534
in the first place, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

904
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,496
There's so many factors that you can't control.

905
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:44,878
So focus on the factors you can control,

906
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:48,001
and if you don't succeed, it's not necessarily your fault.

907
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,523
It doesn't make you a bad developer.

908
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,503
You will have to crunch.

909
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:54,144
This one's still very popular.

910
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:56,185
So you don't have to crunch.

911
00:40:56,425 --> 00:40:58,286
So I know developers who are successful,

912
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:01,147
and I know studios that have made successful games

913
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:01,808
without crunch.

914
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,369
But not all of us have the privilege

915
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,510
to choose our own schedule.

916
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,631
So even if you don't have the privilege to not work under a crunch condition,

917
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,833
you can still make choices that will help mitigate crunch.

918
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,714
You can help make changes in the production cycle.

919
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:19,574
You can create methods and processes that will,

920
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:22,015
maybe if you can't eliminate it, reduce it.

921
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:23,616
And over time, it will improve.

922
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:26,597
But don't accept the status quo as it is.

923
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:32,094
I got to where I am by suffering, and so should you.

924
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:34,235
This is sort of like, I had a hard time figuring out

925
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:34,916
how to word this one.

926
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:37,657
It's like, I walked up two feet, I walked uphill,

927
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:39,518
two feet of snow, both ways to school.

928
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,939
I don't want you to hear me complain.

929
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,759
It's that sort of like attitude,

930
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:44,620
and it's really, really common in the game industry.

931
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:49,343
And instead, what I say is, it's my responsibility

932
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,583
to help improve this industry,

933
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,824
so that the problems that I face

934
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,585
are not the same ones the next generation face.

935
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:58,176
Just because I had to deal with a negative experience

936
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,237
doesn't mean that you have to.

937
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,458
And each new generation of game developers

938
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,879
should have it easier than me.

939
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,721
Don't make games for the money.

940
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,342
Make games because you have passion.

941
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,923
To that I say, you can't eat passion.

942
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,366
Don't be afraid to ask people to pay you for your work.

943
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:18,349
You deserve to be compensated fairly for your labor.

944
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:21,771
This cannot go, it needs to be repeated over and over,

945
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,792
especially among indies.

946
00:42:23,492 --> 00:42:25,373
Asking for fair compensation does not make you

947
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:27,775
any less passionate about making games.

948
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,721
A thousand other people would kill to have your job.

949
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:35,563
Well, now I say, be thankful you get to do something

950
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:36,423
that you love for a living,

951
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:37,863
and I hope that you still love doing it.

952
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,384
But never let yourself be satisfied with the status quo.

953
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:42,344
It can always be better.

954
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:46,265
I used to say, people who burn out,

955
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,406
maybe they just aren't.

956
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:49,377
they just aren't able to cut it.

957
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,598
One of my best friends is an excellent multiplayer designer,

958
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:55,239
or she was until she left the industry because of burnout.

959
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,639
And from that I learned that burnout

960
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,521
is not a sign of weakness, it's a symptom of depression,

961
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:03,941
and it can affect anyone.

962
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:07,042
And when our peers and our friends suffer from burnout,

963
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:09,803
we should do our best to support them as they recover,

964
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:14,984
and when we figure out when we should take...

965
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,005
My slides are really small on here.

966
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,046
We should take lessons on what triggers burnout,

967
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:24,148
and we should do our best to eliminate them from our work.

968
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,610
Again, it's all about improving what we have.

969
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,191
And then last, but definitely not least,

970
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,673
if you aren't willing to make a few personal sacrifices,

971
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,394
then maybe the industry is not for you.

972
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:37,815
And to that I would say, there's no contract you sign,

973
00:43:37,976 --> 00:43:39,777
no bargain with the devil that you make

974
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:41,457
when you enter the game industry

975
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:44,259
that says you cannot have a happy, full life.

976
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:48,805
So this talk is titled Everything I Said Was Wrong,

977
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:49,945
How Indy is Different Now.

978
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:51,946
I think I covered the first part, right?

979
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,108
There's a lot of things that I said that was wrong,

980
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,749
and there's probably still things today that I say are wrong

981
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,530
but I'd like to just change the second half

982
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,371
and say how Indy can be different now.

983
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:05,973
Because the industry and the way that things are right now

984
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:07,353
are not immutable facts of life.

985
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,674
Our industry culture is created by humans.

986
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,075
We're humans, we can change that.

987
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,276
The myths that I bought into about the industry

988
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,277
don't need to continue to be perpetuated.

989
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,838
And instead of scaring people out of this industry

990
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:22,140
with horror stories about how bad it gets

991
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,781
so that only those willing to put up the industry

992
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:25,981
at its worst stick around.

993
00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:30,903
Let's try to talk about this industry as though it has a future that's a much better one that we're painting

994
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:34,484
and encourage people who won't be satisfied with the industry as it is

995
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:37,245
to come join the industry and help make it better.

996
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:38,446
Thank you.

997
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:55,392
Applause

998
00:44:56,136 --> 00:45:01,483
My name is Rami Esmael. I'm one half of Dutch Independent Studio of Lambir. I'm also the

999
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:06,769
least experienced person here on this panel. I didn't know you could have an imposter syndrome

1000
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,551
for a talk about being bad at something.

1001
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:15,147
So it's funny, advice has always been a funny thing in my life.

1002
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:19,149
I was raised Muslim, and Muslims, when they give advice to each other,

1003
00:45:19,169 --> 00:45:21,330
they usually start with a phrase and end with a phrase that is

1004
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:23,512
Allah o'Alam, which means only God knows.

1005
00:45:24,212 --> 00:45:26,714
But it's funny because that phrase is meant to tell people that

1006
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:29,476
you shouldn't take anything at face value.

1007
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:31,597
You should think about what somebody tells you,

1008
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,958
like even a wise person, you should think about it.

1009
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:39,001
The irony is that that phrase became a signifier for somebody being a wise person.

1010
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,914
So even starting and ending your advice with that

1011
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:46,374
now just means like, oh, you should probably

1012
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:47,395
just listen to this person,

1013
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:50,456
because clearly they know what they're talking about.

1014
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,018
So here's what I've come to realize.

1015
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:58,539
All advice is bad.

1016
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,021
So okay, if I were to tell you the story

1017
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,321
of how Flambier came to be,

1018
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:08,102
if I were to give you the advice of how Flambier came to be,

1019
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:10,903
it would be go to a university that you don't like,

1020
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:13,245
Meet a person that you don't like.

1021
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,866
Start a company together and make flash games.

1022
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:20,307
That's how we did it.

1023
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,168
Done.

1024
00:46:21,768 --> 00:46:23,688
Congratulations, international success.

1025
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:26,870
Now here's the problem.

1026
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:30,023
We work in a really strange industry.

1027
00:46:30,063 --> 00:46:32,344
There are four factors to this industry that are really odd.

1028
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:34,285
First, we're a technological industry,

1029
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:35,665
and technology changes rapidly.

1030
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:37,085
Second, we're a creative industry,

1031
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:39,566
and that's deeply personal and subjective.

1032
00:46:40,326 --> 00:46:41,707
We're an industry of entrepreneurship,

1033
00:46:41,787 --> 00:46:44,087
which might even change faster than technology.

1034
00:46:44,908 --> 00:46:46,188
And then we make art.

1035
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:49,169
Let's not even get into that one.

1036
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:51,430
Then on top of that,

1037
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,150
on top of those really shoddy foundations,

1038
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,611
we build our own culture.

1039
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,031
We build video games culture.

1040
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,390
We built Game Development College, and guess what?

1041
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,811
That changes even faster than all the other things I just mentioned.

1042
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:08,172
And then we like to say that we're a global industry, but we're not really.

1043
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:12,772
We're global in that way where everybody that does what we do is considered part of the games industry,

1044
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:15,633
and everybody who doesn't is kind of, we don't talk about those people.

1045
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:23,234
And then every advice we give by the time we mention to form a coherent thought in our head is outdated.

1046
00:47:24,215 --> 00:47:24,395
So...

1047
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,332
Whenever you get on a stage or start writing a blog,

1048
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:31,054
let me tell you up front, your advice is bad.

1049
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:36,438
And for a moment, consider the irony of me standing here,

1050
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:41,281
giving you advice about how advice is bad.

1051
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,265
So I have a few stories I want to tell you.

1052
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,028
The first one is about perspective and hindsight.

1053
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,229
So I just told you Vlamber's story.

1054
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:54,630
Vlamber's story makes a lot of sense to me,

1055
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,972
and it's a comfortable story to me,

1056
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:58,893
because in that story, I kind of get to be the hero.

1057
00:47:59,794 --> 00:47:59,994
Right?

1058
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:01,255
It's kind of my story.

1059
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:02,656
It's like, this is how I did it.

1060
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:03,437
Like, nice.

1061
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:06,299
You could do it too, and then if you fail,

1062
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:08,940
that kind of means that I'm probably better at that than you.

1063
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,063
Like, it's weird, because it's not why I give advice,

1064
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:15,405
but it's a deeply human thing to want to be that person.

1065
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:19,208
So, I'm not trying to intentionally sabotage anybody.

1066
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,954
But in a weird way, the device is effectively sabotaging somebody.

1067
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:28,555
And by the time I give a talk about something, a lot of things have passed.

1068
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:32,336
Like, I remember when I was just starting, the first talk I ever gave was Vlambeer.

1069
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:34,716
It was titled, Games Should Be Games Again.

1070
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:43,558
And it was a scathing rant against the idea that games now had all this stuff that was like narrative and thematics, and it was all gross.

1071
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:44,938
I didn't like that.

1072
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:48,899
Like, games should be about the rules again, games should be about gameplay again, that was it.

1073
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:49,959
That was the first talk I ever gave.

1074
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:52,558
It was a bad talk, horrible talk.

1075
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:55,140
But I genuinely believe that.

1076
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,081
Like I had to kick against something, right?

1077
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,503
Like I was new, I was just starting out.

1078
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,265
Like obviously if I was happy with the games industry,

1079
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,967
I wouldn't be standing on the stage yelling about something.

1080
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:06,688
So I kicked against that.

1081
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,790
And I also used to say, the most important thing

1082
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:13,332
in the games industry is motivation, it's passion.

1083
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,090
Motivation.

1084
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,870
It's important.

1085
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,871
If you have three things, right?

1086
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:17,391
Three things.

1087
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,972
You have motivation, you have money, and you have knowledge.

1088
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:21,713
Right?

1089
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:24,314
If you would drop one, if you don't have money,

1090
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,275
but you have the knowledge and you have the motivation,

1091
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:26,955
you can make something.

1092
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:28,196
Right?

1093
00:49:29,256 --> 00:49:31,897
If you don't have the knowledge, but you have money

1094
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:34,478
and you have motivation, you can hire somebody.

1095
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,540
If you have all the knowledge and all the money in the world,

1096
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,841
but you don't have the motivation to do it,

1097
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:41,281
you're not gonna make something.

1098
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:41,941
Right?

1099
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,127
Made a lot of sense to me.

1100
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,707
It even sounds smart when you say it that way.

1101
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:49,788
But there's a weird thing.

1102
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:53,949
I remember being deeply, deeply demotivated

1103
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,069
through so much of our best projects.

1104
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,770
Ridiculous Fishing, I went through months of hell

1105
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,231
just being depressed about somebody else stealing our game.

1106
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:08,292
And I was demotivated.

1107
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:09,292
And here I am telling people,

1108
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:10,592
you know what, you need motivation.

1109
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:13,215
Because it makes sense.

1110
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:15,577
But it's not my own story.

1111
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:18,580
So nowadays I say, well, okay, motivation and discipline.

1112
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:21,142
Now I can tell you many things about me,

1113
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:22,263
but one of the things I can tell you

1114
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:23,944
is I'm also not super disciplined.

1115
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:26,166
And some of them are still here.

1116
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,768
But I'm hoping with that advice

1117
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,610
to point somebody in a direction

1118
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,872
where they can run into errors themselves

1119
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:34,513
and then figure things out.

1120
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,216
That in the meanwhile, oh, there's water here, my God.

1121
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:38,677
Sorry.

1122
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:45,710
Good advice. Drink water before you get on a stage.

1123
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,161
But that in the meanwhile, some people might run into walls that were

1124
00:50:58,201 --> 00:50:59,102
completely unnecessary.

1125
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,964
I couldn't help that?

1126
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:06,524
It's kind of a weird thing to say because I'm still getting on this stage, right?

1127
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:10,806
And I realized recently that part of that is just my position in the industry.

1128
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:14,488
Like, I'm a bad source for startup advice. Don't ask me.

1129
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:18,209
Like, I don't know. I'm looking back at the industry with six years of advice.

1130
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,191
You all have way more than me. Like, if you ask me how to get started today, I don't know.

1131
00:51:23,432 --> 00:51:25,072
Why are you asking me? I started six years ago.

1132
00:51:30,695 --> 00:51:31,135
So one day...

1133
00:51:32,517 --> 00:51:35,278
And this is actually kind of a cheat because this is not bad advice I've given.

1134
00:51:35,298 --> 00:51:37,299
It's bad advice somebody else gave.

1135
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:39,240
But I thought it was interesting.

1136
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,260
One day I went traveling.

1137
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,902
I travel a lot around the world and I talked to people in emergent territories,

1138
00:51:42,922 --> 00:51:45,003
a place where the games industry doesn't really exist yet.

1139
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:49,025
And I came across this one very peculiar indie studio.

1140
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:52,547
And what they had was effectively a vertical hierarchy.

1141
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:54,748
Everybody was in charge of somebody else.

1142
00:51:56,523 --> 00:51:56,944
Which is weird.

1143
00:51:57,184 --> 00:52:00,707
Like you had a CEO figure who was in charge of a CEO figure

1144
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:02,148
who was in charge of an artist who was in charge

1145
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:03,810
of a programmer who was in charge of a sound designer.

1146
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,092
I was like, huh?

1147
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,735
How do you like, I see a lot of indies doing flat hierarchies

1148
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:10,615
I don't like that either.

1149
00:52:11,216 --> 00:52:12,257
But a vertical hierarchy?

1150
00:52:12,277 --> 00:52:14,859
This is a strange place because you know,

1151
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:16,100
communicating was kind of hard.

1152
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,801
They didn't speak great English,

1153
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,162
I definitely didn't speak their language.

1154
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:22,285
So we're trying to communicate like how did this happen?

1155
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,486
And they pulled up this talk.

1156
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,700
that a friend of mine had given that was a sarcastic talk.

1157
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:30,341
And it was meant to be sarcastic.

1158
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:32,242
And it was meant to be so clearly sarcastic,

1159
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:32,982
it was so funny.

1160
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:34,662
I laughed through the entire talk.

1161
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:36,363
Then somewhere out there in the world,

1162
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,583
a bunch of people started a studio,

1163
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:40,984
taking that exact advice step for step.

1164
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:42,744
They started on four projects at once,

1165
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:44,784
they had a vertical hierarchy,

1166
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:47,545
they didn't start emailing the press

1167
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:48,725
until they were close to release,

1168
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:50,086
because stealth releases are good.

1169
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:53,487
And this was real advice.

1170
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:55,967
They took it as real advice.

1171
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:59,928
Now here's the thing, you can give a sarcastic talk,

1172
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,629
but it's not clear to you how much authority

1173
00:53:02,649 --> 00:53:03,209
people give you.

1174
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:06,010
I don't know how much authority you give me.

1175
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,031
Like some of you might think I'm really good at what I do.

1176
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:10,891
Some of you think I'm just the yelling guy

1177
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:11,832
at the end of this panel.

1178
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:14,492
You'd both be somewhat correct, maybe.

1179
00:53:15,313 --> 00:53:15,693
I don't know.

1180
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:18,033
The problem is I don't know.

1181
00:53:18,974 --> 00:53:20,634
And it gets worse, it gets worse,

1182
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:24,435
because I don't get to pick.

1183
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:30,158
Now one of the themes you keep hearing during these other talks was that a lot of times

1184
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:34,161
when you give advice you would like to specify and clarify what people are actually asking.

1185
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:38,644
Well let me tell you on this stage I don't get to do that. I don't get to do that for a number

1186
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:43,548
of reasons. A, you're too many. B, Charlie Hall right there is writing an article about it

1187
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,550
that's probably going to go up on a website somewhere that I don't have control over. And C,

1188
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,453
right there in the back of the camera, you see that camera right there? I don't get to pick who

1189
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:53,236
watches this video on the Vault either. So.

1190
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:54,897
Here's another story.

1191
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:57,759
One day I was in South Africa.

1192
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,001
And in South Africa there's this university

1193
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,182
called DeWitts University.

1194
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:05,185
And DeWitts has somebody that leads the gaming program

1195
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:05,825
named Hanli.

1196
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:07,627
Hanli is a phenomenal woman.

1197
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,490
And she has ran that game program for many, many years

1198
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,912
and managed to get a lot of people

1199
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:16,173
that would otherwise not be part of our games industry

1200
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:18,015
to look at games, to learn games.

1201
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,436
And one day she asked me to give a talk

1202
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:20,697
at DeWitts University.

1203
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:21,898
So I went over and I gave a talk.

1204
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,059
And one of the students.

1205
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,100
was kind of, you know, one of those kind of blunt students

1206
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,501
who ask questions that are probably inappropriate

1207
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,261
in like an educational environment,

1208
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:34,941
like should I drop out of school?

1209
00:54:36,762 --> 00:54:39,042
There's the thing, I'm a school dropout, right?

1210
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:40,522
So when I get that question,

1211
00:54:40,562 --> 00:54:43,283
I try to be very relative about the answer,

1212
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:45,423
like okay, listen, everybody learns differently.

1213
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:47,464
Some people, you know, have a lot of benefit

1214
00:54:47,504 --> 00:54:49,304
when they go to school and they follow a program

1215
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:51,504
and there's like set guidelines for how you do

1216
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:53,445
and how you engage, and some people,

1217
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,601
they're better off when they do it on their own

1218
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:57,902
and they don't learn as much in school

1219
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:01,583
because they feel claustrophobic

1220
00:55:01,743 --> 00:55:03,944
or they don't fit the way the school teaches.

1221
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:05,725
So it's really up to you.

1222
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:07,566
Like I always say, if you have to ask me,

1223
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,887
then you probably shouldn't drop out.

1224
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:15,370
So the student was happy and sat down and nodded

1225
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,731
and I looked back over to where Hanli had been watching

1226
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:20,712
for the entire talk, so I'm like back in the corner there.

1227
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,359
And she'd been smiling and so happy

1228
00:55:23,379 --> 00:55:24,480
with all the questions the students asked.

1229
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:25,441
Suddenly she was gone.

1230
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:28,564
And I thought, well, maybe she's heard that,

1231
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:30,385
you know, I sort of told them that school

1232
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,487
might not be all that necessary, and she's a teacher,

1233
00:55:32,507 --> 00:55:33,488
so maybe I hurt her feelings.

1234
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:35,530
So when I went off stage, I went to look for her,

1235
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,711
but I didn't have to because she came

1236
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:40,334
basically storming at me and grabbed me by my jacket

1237
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:41,434
and said, if you ever do that again,

1238
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:42,175
you're never coming back.

1239
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:44,817
I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1240
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:47,019
If I ever do what again?

1241
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,701
It's like, you don't understand, right?

1242
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:49,541
You're from the Netherlands.

1243
00:55:50,242 --> 00:55:52,903
You know what happens when you drop out of school? The state pays for your life.

1244
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:58,965
That's what they do. It's the Netherlands. You know what happens in South Africa when a kid leaves school without

1245
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:04,006
graduation? Kid that came here with a grant, they go into crime, they go into drugs, they die.

1246
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:07,827
They die.

1247
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,110
Hi, my name is Rami Esmael. I'm one half of Dutch Independence City of Lambeer.

1248
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,450
Did my advice get people killed? I don't know.

1249
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:23,689
Did yours? I don't know. Is that dramatic? Yes, it is. Is it real? Apparently, yes.

1250
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,170
Had I ever considered that? No.

1251
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,811
Is that the reality of a global industry? Yes.

1252
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,072
We don't get to pick who follows our advice. We don't get to pick

1253
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,693
who follows what we say. We don't get to pick how people think of us,

1254
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:41,093
what authority they give us.

1255
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:47,095
Sometimes that leads to painful situations.

1256
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,475
So why am I on this stage?

1257
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:51,279
Why am I here talking to you?

1258
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:54,780
So there's two types of advice.

1259
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,560
Either you try to maximize the winners or you try to

1260
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,361
minimize the losers.

1261
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,742
Those sound very similar, but they're very different.

1262
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:03,502
If you try to maximize the winners, it doesn't really

1263
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:04,662
matter how many losers there are.

1264
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:07,703
You try to minimize the losers, it doesn't really

1265
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:08,904
matter how many winners there are.

1266
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:11,344
There are two completely different ways of giving

1267
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:13,745
advice, and both are not right and both are not wrong.

1268
00:57:14,285 --> 00:57:15,325
Both have their own problems.

1269
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,027
So for example, if you come across a student and they say,

1270
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:20,147
okay, should have been in the games industry,

1271
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:20,927
and you say, go for it.

1272
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:23,888
You know that this industry can be rough.

1273
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:25,508
You know that the industry can be harsh,

1274
00:57:25,968 --> 00:57:28,088
but you're hoping that if through a combination

1275
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,909
of luck and merit, they will join this industry

1276
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,769
and that they will hopefully get to improve

1277
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:32,829
this industry in the future.

1278
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,510
Or you could tell them, be careful.

1279
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,310
This industry is rough.

1280
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,571
And then you have a chance that those that are confident

1281
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:44,591
and that don't have, that aren't marginalized,

1282
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:45,571
that.

1283
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:51,482
those will have a shot at the industry and that, you know, they will get to improve the

1284
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:55,845
industry in the future. And then you can choose the middle ground which means that you don't

1285
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,067
really get to pick which one happens. It's a little bit of both or maybe a little bit of

1286
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:06,371
neither. So all advice is bad. It's too personal, not personal enough, it's too broad, not

1287
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:07,552
broad enough, too specific.

1288
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:13,796
not specific enough. I stand here because I'm experienced. You know what? Experience is bad. I

1289
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:18,039
have experience. Who am I to tell somebody who's just starting out what to do? If I had

1290
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:27,243
followed my own advice, I wouldn't be standing here. I did everything wrong. I tell you I did

1291
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:33,106
everything wrong. But it's why I'm standing here. It's why I'm on this desk. So advice is

1292
00:58:33,147 --> 00:58:35,248
outdated, slow.

1293
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:43,348
Videos are saved and people can play them everywhere. So I used to end presentations with

1294
00:58:43,388 --> 00:58:48,413
make games. Make games exclamation mark. Make games. Go do it. That's why we're here for,

1295
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:53,018
right? Let's go do that and then if we do that in the future somehow things will work out.

1296
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,745
And instead of making games, you know what I did?

1297
00:58:56,785 --> 00:58:58,646
I made some games and then I built Prescott

1298
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,626
and I started flying around the world and gave some talks

1299
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:02,587
and started doing marketing and went to events

1300
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:03,587
and did all that stuff.

1301
00:59:03,647 --> 00:59:06,468
I say make games, that's the exclamation point to my talk

1302
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:08,108
and it's just a tiny part of what I do.

1303
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:10,769
It's a tiny part of what I believe made me successful.

1304
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:13,510
Now here's what I learned about giving advice.

1305
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,470
Extreme advice, it's bad advice.

1306
00:59:17,311 --> 00:59:19,151
Middle of the road advice, bad advice.

1307
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:22,092
Optimistic advice, it's bad advice.

1308
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:25,302
pessimistic advice, it's bad advice.

1309
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:30,065
Any attempt you will give to offer just a perspective

1310
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,226
will be taken as authority.

1311
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:36,528
No attempt that you do to look fallible will work.

1312
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,470
No attempt at offering caveats will work.

1313
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,572
No attempt at contextualizing your achievements will work.

1314
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:47,954
All advice you give is final,

1315
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:51,956
and it is truth to the people that listen to it.

1316
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:54,783
This is a failure talk.

1317
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:56,404
This is not a success talk.

1318
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:57,544
We're talking about our failure.

1319
00:59:57,825 --> 00:59:59,206
The fact that we failed probably means

1320
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:01,788
we shouldn't be an authority on what we're doing here.

1321
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,370
And still people are gonna take this as authority.

1322
01:00:06,371 --> 01:00:10,254
So, all advice in this talk is probably bad advice.

1323
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:14,777
All advice in my talk, probably really bad advice.

1324
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,419
How you mix those two in your mind,

1325
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:19,560
I don't know, that's up to you.

1326
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:26,130
But if all advice is bad, I have one thing that I think is worse, and it's no perspective.

1327
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,531
A lack of perspective is far more dangerous than bad advice.

1328
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:37,213
A lack of seeing lots of people do something wrong is worse than having nothing at all.

1329
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:42,494
So we can't preempt every possible failure of advice we give, and all we can do really

1330
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:46,936
is try to do right, check as frequently as we can.

1331
01:00:48,025 --> 01:00:50,146
to what changed in us, what changed in the world,

1332
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,867
what changed in the people that listen to us,

1333
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:54,748
and know that everything I've ever said was wrong.

1334
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:57,389
And then, you know, you get on a stage,

1335
01:00:57,409 --> 01:01:00,250
start typing a blog, and your advice is probably bad.

1336
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:01,091
Thank you.

1337
01:01:01,111 --> 01:01:01,371
Thank you.

1338
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,852
Thank you.

1339
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:03,792
Thank you.

1340
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:04,092
Thank you.

1341
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:04,773
Thank you.

1342
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:05,473
Thank you.

1343
01:01:05,493 --> 01:01:06,273
Thank you.

1344
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:07,334
Thank you.

1345
01:01:07,354 --> 01:01:08,034
Thank you.

1346
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:08,594
Thank you.

1347
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:09,535
Thank you.

1348
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:12,016
Thank you.

1349
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:12,596
I think we're done.

1350
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:14,317
I don't know the things

1351
01:01:14,357 --> 01:01:15,538
that you're supposed to say at the end.

1352
01:01:16,244 --> 01:01:16,905
Akira, help me.

1353
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:19,767
Evaluation forms.

1354
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,168
Evaluation forms.

1355
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:22,630
Do those.

1356
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:25,372
Lunch break.

1357
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:28,495
We'll be back at some time.

1358
01:01:28,675 --> 01:01:29,616
Thank you so much for coming.
