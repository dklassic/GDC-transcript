1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:09,906
I'm supposed to remind you to check your e-mail for session evaluations. Those will show up. I'm

2
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:17,352
supposed to remind you to mute your cell phones. So please do that. I'm going to talk today about

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:23,157
inventing new games. Because we all know we live in a world of clone after clone after clone

4
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:23,877
after clone.

5
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:26,993
There are reasons to invent new games,

6
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,474
and not all of them are good.

7
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,435
And I will talk about that too.

8
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,736
Sometimes being creative,

9
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:35,778
it's not necessarily an exclusive virtue, right?

10
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:40,100
But it can be if used practically.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,961
And really my goal for this talk,

12
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,582
and we're gonna do a little bit of workshopping in here,

13
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:45,342
I'm gonna warn you.

14
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,443
My goal for this talk is to try to give you

15
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,785
really concrete usable stuff you can take away.

16
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:58,556
So, as far as who I am, my name is Raf Koster, and I wrote a book called A Theory of Fun.

17
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:03,741
I've been working as a lead designer or creative director, starting with MMOs like Ultima Online

18
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:11,207
a very long time ago now. I've done pretty much every job there is in the game industry now,

19
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:16,131
some of which I really hated. And I like the creative ones the best,

20
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,153
so those are the ones I'm going to focus on.

21
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,910
There's a lot of ways to think about creativity.

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,192
And I'm going to focus primarily on innovation.

23
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,614
I'm going to focus on coming up with brand new game ideas.

24
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,656
And I'm going to spend a lot of time, more time,

25
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,518
disproportionately talking about coming up with new mechanics

26
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,780
as opposed to coming up with.

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,341
new themes or stories to tell.

28
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:43,162
Frankly, coming up with new stories to tell,

29
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,124
which I will cover, is relatively easy.

30
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:48,644
We have a lot of other media that we can go look at

31
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:49,725
for that.

32
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,346
Our failure there is mostly a failure of imagination.

33
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,168
I want to caution you all that innovation

34
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,329
doesn't necessarily mean success.

35
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:01,609
Right?

36
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,510
In fact, often it means the exact opposite.

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,371
So, we'll spend some time on that too.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:12,714
Okay, start, let's talk about what is creativity exactly.

39
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:15,255
A lot of people have this idea that it's the muses

40
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,036
descending from the heavens with fire and music

41
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:19,956
and I don't know what else.

42
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,277
And that's just usually wrong.

43
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,617
Most research on creativity shows

44
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,218
that it tends to arise out of scenes,

45
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,458
it tends to arise out of urban areas,

46
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,559
the clash, the collision,

47
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,440
the mixing together of disparate ideas.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,681
from different cultures or subcultures or disciplines.

49
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,341
OK?

50
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,702
In other words, creativity is what

51
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,483
happens when you take oil and water

52
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:46,024
and actually try to mix them.

53
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:49,845
It isn't the grand mystical thing.

54
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,347
It's actually a fairly straightforward process

55
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,228
that you can cause to happen quite intentionally.

56
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:59,489
And it's a skill set that you can actually practice

57
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,790
and develop into a habit.

58
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:08,430
Personal expression is wonderful, but it isn't necessarily creative. It isn't necessarily

59
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,053
bringing something radically new into the world.

60
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:20,662
How do you go about it? Well, the first thing that you really need is to have, you know,

61
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:24,686
you guys know what a substrate is in an aquarium? Anybody here keep fish?

62
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:29,429
Okay, it is the most boring part of setting up an aquarium, right?

63
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,955
You need gravel and maybe some muck of various sorts.

64
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,116
You need bacteria.

65
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,218
You need maybe some soil.

66
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,961
It's the stuff that sits at the bottom of the aquarium that covers a couple of inches

67
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,784
of what could be awesome-looking, colorful fish.

68
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,247
But without that substrate, nothing in the aquarium works.

69
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:51,230
If you try setting up an aquarium with no substrate,

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,213
you'll quickly find you can't actually

71
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:57,175
have a suitable ecosystem for anything to live.

72
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,122
The same is true of a whole lot of things in our lives.

73
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,563
But in particular, I want to talk about the substrate

74
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:07,967
that we need to be creative in the discipline of games,

75
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:09,828
in game design.

76
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,650
In other fields, your substrate is different.

77
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,712
If you were here to learn about poetry,

78
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:19,616
I would tell you you should go off and study prosody,

79
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,197
and meter, and rhyme.

80
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,059
You should study linguistics and other languages.

81
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,060
In the case of games.

82
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,193
I'm going to tell you to study games and to study how games are put together, the pieces

83
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:37,016
and parts of games. The first thing I want to encourage you to

84
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:45,182
do is to break your notion of what a game is. And I'll just throw out some random assertions.

85
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:52,306
First-person shooter is what we usually call a genre, right? But just for a moment, consider

86
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:56,669
the idea that first-person shooter and poker...

87
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:02,976
are the same thing, a game, a singular game.

88
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:07,899
A way to think of this is that you have a rule construct,

89
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:12,082
a set of behaviors and rules and resources

90
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:14,183
and that kind of thing that interact with one another.

91
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:17,305
Often we see it skinned differently,

92
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:20,968
like a Lord of the Rings chess set is still chess, right?

93
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,749
Then we see variants.

94
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,950
So for example, you might modify a rule.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,783
And that opens up the door to new styles of play,

96
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,785
but the game is still recognizably poker.

97
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,828
Add enough of these, and you end up with a family.

98
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:37,850
We start thinking of poker as a family.

99
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,273
And eventually, you end up with the poker genre.

100
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,777
The original version of poker was played with less cards,

101
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,000
did not have multiple rounds to it.

102
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,062
You just drew, and then you saw what you got.

103
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:58,307
And gradually variants started coming in, wild cards and so on, until today we have

104
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:58,748
poker.

105
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:03,191
And when you say poker, most people actually think of, let's say, Texas Hold'em, which

106
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:06,213
is a very specific variant within the poker family.

107
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,795
But we can still look at all of these and say they're still all poker.

108
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,738
There's something there that makes us say this is all in common.

109
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:18,428
Can you guys, let's, I warned you I'd workshop something.

110
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,190
You're looking at me, so you get picked.

111
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:23,511
Throughout a genre.

112
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:26,713
2D platformer.

113
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,195
2D platformer, somehow I knew you'd say 2D platformer.

114
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:29,976
Right?

115
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,598
So if we think of 2D platformer in the same lens

116
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,460
as we are with first person shooters here, right?

117
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:38,102
Here's first person shooters.

118
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:41,064
Can you do that for platformers?

119
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:44,366
Eh, to start with.

120
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,364
start with Mario, sure. That's acceptable. I would go earlier.

121
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:56,471
I would start with Donkey Kong. Okay? And then comes its first

122
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,574
re-skin or clone. You start getting things like Donkey Kong

123
00:06:59,634 --> 00:06:59,675
Jr.

124
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,771
Very quickly, we start running into variants.

125
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:08,094
So, we start getting things like kangaroo.

126
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:12,158
Kangaroo, very much like Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong Jr.

127
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,801
We start seeing differences in the maps.

128
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,202
We start seeing differences like that.

129
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:19,245
But kangaroo adds punching, which is a whole new thing.

130
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,447
It adds obstacles flying in from the sides.

131
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,630
Pretty soon, we have a whole family of 2D platformers.

132
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:33,060
Super Mario introduces the side-scrolling and really starts locking in what the family of it is, right?

133
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:38,988
But really we look at any of these and we say I jump and I have to get to the other side

134
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:42,853
Right. I mean that's still the heart of the platforming game

135
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:48,917
Almost every video game we make is actually a variant.

136
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,977
It is incredibly rare in video games for us

137
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:53,337
to invent truly new games.

138
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,758
This stands in stark contrast to, let's say,

139
00:07:56,778 --> 00:08:00,018
the tabletop game industry, where almost every game is

140
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:04,779
actually a new game, truly a new game, a new rule construct.

141
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,000
When we talk about German board games,

142
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,460
virtually every German board game

143
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,260
is actually significantly different.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,021
But that's not true when we look at video games.

145
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:21,664
In video games, you can actually say a game is a genre, and usually you will be right.

146
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,341
When we do see significant creative innovation

147
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:29,442
in game mechanics, it tends to be down at the casual end,

148
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,262
and it tends to be at the abstract end.

149
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,123
Puzzle games, for example.

150
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,903
We're seeing an explosion of innovation today

151
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,184
with indie games and with mobile games,

152
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,045
precisely because innovation is often very expensive

153
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,045
and highly risky.

154
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:47,005
So it flourishes at times when budgets are low,

155
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,706
cost of entry is low, and cost of failure is low.

156
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:59,098
Because of that, we've had an amazing period of new mechanics being invented, of creativity in the industry.

157
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:05,343
As we're seeing budgets rise, I would predict we see less creativity in the industry, actually.

158
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:10,627
Now, because of that, I want us to be realistic here.

159
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,210
I'm going to talk a lot about creating brand new games

160
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,970
from scratch.

161
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:19,693
But the fact is, the same tools, techniques, tips, tricks

162
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:25,077
work for creating variants, work for extending a family

163
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,138
or extending a genre.

164
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,360
You don't have to necessarily be creating a game from scratch.

165
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,442
You can still use these tools in order

166
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,984
to extend first-person shooters in a new direction.

167
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:40,840
So one of the biggest things you need to do, once you've gotten used to thinking that first

168
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,223
person shooter is a game, you need to start learning how to really break down things and

169
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:51,346
start looking at them really atomically. And this is something that particularly for those

170
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,086
of us who are worse...

171
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:59,009
more used to working in AAA, more used to working in large-scale narrative constructs than anything else.

172
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:02,350
This is often a skill that's a little bit weird, okay?

173
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:07,973
We often tend to look more at the game's surface than at the mathematics underneath the game.

174
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:15,905
The thing is, going back to the simple games of the 70s, the 80s, or focusing a lot on

175
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:21,268
the casual end of the spectrum, like mobile, is actually super valuable to you, even if

176
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,949
you tend to work at the large scale.

177
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:27,531
And that is because mechanics are usually games.

178
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,499
Games are built out of smaller games.

179
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,321
And so you can take these mini games

180
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,783
that might be an entire game down

181
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:37,784
at the casual or mobile end of the spectrum

182
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:40,366
and move them into being features in something

183
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,307
that's larger scale.

184
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:45,270
So super valuable to build up your mechanics library.

185
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,891
The absolute best advice I can give

186
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,853
everybody who is a working game designer in the video game

187
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:54,176
business, first, obsessively play lots of board games.

188
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,617
Second, obsessively play lots of mobile games.

189
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:57,058
And third.

190
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:02,236
Get yourself a mame cabinet and play the games

191
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,236
in chronological order.

192
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,938
One of the big reasons to force yourself out

193
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:11,919
of the narrative lens is in order

194
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,620
to distance yourself from your usual modes of seeing.

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,881
So let's give you, here's an example.

196
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,682
Let's say we take a deck of cards

197
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,083
and we distribute it into four separate piles.

198
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:27,863
We make sure that every pile has an ace in it.

199
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:31,574
Okay? But other than that, the rest of the cards are random.

200
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:36,118
And I'm going to say, start on pile one and begin flipping cards over.

201
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,903
When you find the ace, that unlocks the next pile and you can begin flipping over more

202
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:46,046
cards. Anybody think this game sounds super fun?

203
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:52,391
Anybody? This was game of the year last year.

204
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,314
Okay? Mechanically.

205
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:02,526
That is all the rule set of gone home really implies. That is not a knock against gone

206
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:09,811
home. A mechanic can be very, very simple. This mechanic here is called environmental

207
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:16,416
storytelling. That is the name of the mechanic. And what is it? You find hot spots in an environment

208
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:20,819
and you click on them and at some point the hot spot unlocks a block of more hot spots.

209
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:23,099
That's it.

210
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,760
Learning to see things this abstractly

211
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,641
is actually an enormous help.

212
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,942
And it doesn't denigrate the story in any way.

213
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,763
It doesn't denigrate the amazing value that that story provides.

214
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:41,145
Instead, what it does is help you build a library like this.

215
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:51,209
random little subset off the top of my head of very common small game mechanics. It's

216
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:57,151
far from being exhaustive, and therefore I'm now going to pick on people. We'll start with

217
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:05,153
Tyg. Give me one that isn't on here. Actually, anybody, start shouting them out if you want.

218
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,493
Yes, in the green shirt.

219
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,193
Item association, that's right.

220
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:14,239
So linking together items through shared qualities.

221
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,806
Yes, that could be a form of set packing and it might not.

222
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,851
Yep, that's a good one.

223
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:20,332
Somebody else?

224
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:26,929
Collection, absolutely, just building collections.

225
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:30,411
Again, that could be a form of set packing, might not.

226
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,772
One of the really interesting things about these,

227
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:34,473
by the way, is that you'll find that they're

228
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,374
isomorphic to one another.

229
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:40,236
What that means is sometimes the same mechanic

230
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:43,357
can be described using completely different words

231
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,278
as a different mathematical structure,

232
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,339
but they work the same inside.

233
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,001
Okay, so you can actually see Sudoku

234
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,822
as being a fill the map problem.

235
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,245
You can also see Sudoku as being a set packing problem.

236
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,466
And if you dig into the math of it,

237
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:02,327
those are different branches of mathematics.

238
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,108
But that's okay because different branches of mathematics

239
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,489
often tackle the same problem

240
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,230
just using different tools and techniques.

241
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:11,772
Can anybody think of a different one?

242
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,294
You guys just aren't awake today.

243
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:17,335
Laurel and I'm picking on you.

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:29,225
There are a lot of patterns in social interactions.

245
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:34,268
There are a huge number of game mechanic patterns that are social.

246
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:34,869
That's right.

247
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,071
Probably one of the biggest and commonest is roles.

248
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,753
Roles is a fundamental pattern for all social games.

249
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:46,856
And it's a good indication of how abstract it is.

250
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:49,277
In a social game on Facebook...

251
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:53,969
You really have two roles, neighbor and player.

252
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,831
And they're both vital to progressing, right,

253
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,033
in a given play field.

254
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,096
On a soccer team, you have goalie,

255
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:05,577
and you have striker, and so on.

256
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:09,720
And we can extend this through any kind

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,484
of team-based or even non-team-based multiplayer game.

258
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:18,526
If you're in WoW, we have healers and tanks and nukers.

259
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:22,091
So rolls is a great example of a mechanic pattern.

260
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,135
I don't think there's a good way to build an exhaustive list

261
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:26,476
of this.

262
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:30,140
So for those of you who are happily photographing this,

263
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,461
it's far from exhaustive.

264
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:36,146
Game design patterns, super useful book.

265
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,898
Another one, Advanced Game Mechanics,

266
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,740
another super useful book.

267
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,242
And these vary dramatically in the ways

268
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:45,743
in which they describe these patterns,

269
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,765
but they're just collections of mechanics,

270
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:52,728
patterns like this that you can then use.

271
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:56,710
And what you want to do is learn as many as you can

272
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,812
because these are the tools on your workbench.

273
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,414
So that was the substrate.

274
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,496
Now we talk about how you use them.

275
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,607
You never, I'll just be blunt,

276
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:12,449
nobody ever comes up with something out of the blue.

277
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,111
Life just doesn't work that way.

278
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:20,215
In practice, most creativity is taking a pattern

279
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:25,460
out of its comfy, recognizable context

280
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,741
and moving it into a different one.

281
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,187
that might seem boring, okay?

282
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,648
Just the other night, I was watching how we got to now,

283
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:39,089
the new TV series on PBS by Steven Johnson.

284
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,110
There was a glass maker in Venice

285
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,951
who wanted to make clear glass.

286
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,712
The only reason it happened is because he tried a plant,

287
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,673
the ashes of a plant he imported from Turkey,

288
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:53,354
and mixed it into the glass,

289
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,514
and somehow that made it clear.

290
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:56,715
I don't understand why that works, but it did.

291
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,075
Somebody else entirely said, you know what?

292
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:03,217
If we then grind these, we could make lenses.

293
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,398
And they invented spectacles.

294
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,260
But it took a long time to pull that out

295
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,742
into a different context and invent

296
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,042
microscopes and telescopes.

297
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:15,164
And it took a very long time to pull that

298
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:18,307
into yet another context and invent fiber optics.

299
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:19,227
So.

300
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,648
Moving a very simple idea from place to place and context to context and changing it in

301
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:31,389
the process is actually your biggest tool for creativity.

302
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,950
And it's the reason why scenes work, right?

303
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,730
Disparate groups of people coming together in an environment in order to bounce ideas

304
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,370
off of each other.

305
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:45,132
It's why non-homogenous teams tend to be more creative than homogenous teams or teams that

306
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,312
have worked together for a very long time.

307
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,600
Here's an example of this.

308
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,442
You are all familiar with the humble die.

309
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:59,084
And when we use a die, we always think of it in the same way.

310
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,606
It generates a random number from 1 to 6.

311
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:07,329
But if you say, here is the die, and I'm not

312
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,470
allowed to use it as a random number generator,

313
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:13,432
you remove that from the table, it

314
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:16,874
starts opening up all of these new kinds of contexts.

315
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,876
So for example, you could use it as a hit point counter.

316
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,457
After all, it's got a scale, one to six.

317
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,657
You can turn it.

318
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,957
You could use it as a timer.

319
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:29,058
It's got a scale.

320
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,098
It moves up and down.

321
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,558
You could use it to indicate state.

322
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,619
Maybe six means I am knocked down,

323
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,740
and two means I am in aggressive mode.

324
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,621
You could use it as an indicator of max.

325
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,861
So instead of tracking things, it

326
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,082
could be this is the max possible I could reach.

327
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:52,186
And then I don't know how many of you have played the wonderful tabletop game, Blueprints.

328
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,670
You literally use dice as building bricks in that game.

329
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:02,234
The numbers matter, but you're literally building a little building out of dice.

330
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,617
I'm sure there are more ways to use dice.

331
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:13,843
The point being, pull a simple tool out of its context, out of its assumptions, and move

332
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,164
it into someplace else.

333
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:19,406
And suddenly, you might get a whole new, fresh set of ideas.

334
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,107
This is why, if you're playing with cards

335
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,128
and using cards for a prototyping tool,

336
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:29,691
it's valuable to have a regular kind of deck and an Uno deck.

337
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,272
They look so different.

338
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:36,014
One uses colors, the other doesn't, and so on.

339
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:38,195
It pushes you in different directions.

340
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,996
Just the fact that Uno has four colors

341
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:43,718
and a regular deck has two, even though mathematically, they

342
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:44,998
are basically identical.

343
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,303
Okay? What else could we use cards for? You're looking at me, sir, so you get picked. Pull

344
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:57,887
cards out of the context. There's a classic example of what people use cards for.

345
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:12,815
Sure. Library of actions. Yep. What's a classic example? House of cards, right?

346
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:16,473
That's radically pulling the card out of context.

347
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:17,933
What's another one?

348
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:20,854
Right?

349
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,076
Fortune telling is a classic application for cards.

350
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:31,996
That's right.

351
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:38,038
Cards could be literally used just for the fact they are

352
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,398
convenience-sized maps to cover stuff up.

353
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:41,338
In fact.

354
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,805
Let's invent a game right now with that idea.

355
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,107
Let's take a card.

356
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,428
We lay it face up.

357
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:50,889
I don't know what we got.

358
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,430
Let's say it's the eight of diamonds.

359
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,611
The game is about covering up the diamonds.

360
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,912
So every card is now a play field.

361
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:00,074
And now we've got something else that we need to lay down

362
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:01,175
to cover up the diamonds.

363
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,036
What cards you end up with?

364
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,978
Maybe the pips on the card are actually

365
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,939
the monsters in that dungeon room,

366
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,140
and that's their initial position.

367
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:16,034
right? Move the element out of its context and all of a sudden stuff just starts appearing.

368
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:24,979
Completely new possibilities. The simplest way in which people try to affect game design

369
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:35,405
changes and variants and so on is to extend a statistic. Let's add fireball 6. This does

370
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:36,066
not work.

371
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:40,710
Not only is it not innovative, it's boring.

372
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:44,134
It's boring because you are not offering the player anything

373
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:44,895
new to learn.

374
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,918
You're not offering the player anything new except an

375
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:48,959
incremented number.

376
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,163
Odds are an incremented number measured against

377
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:59,565
another incremented number. I use Fireball 6 on a bigger ORC, XP sac, which actually

378
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:05,167
means my ratio is still 1 to 1, right, or whatever. That's just not interesting. Players

379
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:08,088
see through the patterns, see F, my book, Theory of Fun.

380
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:17,111
A new stat, though, completely new statistical metric, that can add a new rule.

381
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:22,545
And if you add a new rule, now you're in the realm of creating a variant.

382
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:29,428
So if you add a time constraint on virtually any game, you might accidentally create a

383
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:30,349
time attack mode.

384
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,670
You might accidentally create speed runs.

385
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:39,232
Time was always there, probably, but it wasn't a formalized stat, right?

386
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,933
You hadn't actually bothered to track it and display it.

387
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:46,195
The minute you track it and display it, goals will be created around it, rules might be

388
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:46,895
created around it.

389
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:51,346
If you track number of moves in virtually anything.

390
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:57,008
Let's try number of moves in an FPS.

391
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,529
All of a sudden we now have an accuracy meter.

392
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,969
Number of shots fired over number that hit.

393
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:03,830
Let's try it in an RPG.

394
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,070
I've actually never seen it in an RPG.

395
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,591
Is there such a thing as an efficiency meter in an RPG?

396
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:10,172
There could be.

397
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:11,332
Right?

398
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,213
And some players would probably find it a pretty interesting game.

399
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,491
So adding a new statistic, if it adds a new rule

400
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,853
and thereby creates a variant, can be pretty fruitful.

401
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,713
Now, you have to watch out.

402
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,374
A proliferation of statistics is not necessarily

403
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:30,255
going to be the best thing.

404
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:32,976
And so because of that, I would encourage you,

405
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,197
each time you explore adding a statistic,

406
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:38,238
try taking a different one away and see what happens.

407
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:42,259
Not all of them will work, but the permutation of it

408
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,820
will probably lead you somewhere interesting.

409
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:51,410
This one here is a classic way of doing this. There have only

410
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,215
been five fighting games in history. Everybody always gets

411
00:23:57,255 --> 00:24:00,037
really pissed off when I say that, especially because

412
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,541
street fighter is not on my list. Okay? But if you think

413
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:09,625
about it, the UR fighting game is rock, paper, scissors. You

414
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:13,008
have got three attacks, no defenses, and you can't move.

415
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:14,730
That's it.

416
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:17,919
Start adding attacks.

417
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,979
That's just extending a statistic.

418
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,980
But something like Karate Champ actually

419
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,761
added defenses, a new statistic, a new move class, a new rule.

420
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,082
And of course, they added the statistic of distance.

421
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,882
And now all of a sudden, you have this game.

422
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:36,543
Most fighting games to this day are still this game.

423
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,344
They are rock, paper, scissors moving back and forth

424
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:40,824
on an aligned axis.

425
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:45,107
In fact, Virtua Fighter and so on, Street Fighter, there's still this.

426
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:48,311
It doesn't matter if they're in 3D, because the 3D is a narrative thing.

427
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:49,813
It's an optical illusion, right?

428
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:50,474
It's not real.

429
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,298
Karateka created a whole new genre.

430
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,372
by changing the topology of the dimension,

431
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:59,153
saying we're going to make that dimension infinite.

432
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,155
And it created that side-scrolling beat-em-up,

433
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:04,876
and that's a whole family tree that grew off of it.

434
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:07,358
But it wasn't until Battle Arena Teshinden,

435
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:12,501
which added sidestep, that a true new dimension was added

436
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,483
into the fighting genre.

437
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:18,245
And sidestep, frankly, was a pretty lame one.

438
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:20,226
It wasn't an intuitive control.

439
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,348
It's still as far as most of the games have gone.

440
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,842
Somebody did actually say, let's extend the dimension one

441
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:30,143
further all the way to a full 2D plane.

442
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:31,204
That was Bushido Blade.

443
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,225
It turned out to be a bridge too far.

444
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,867
To my knowledge, the last fighting game that did that was

445
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:37,747
Bushido Blade 2.

446
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:39,628
And there it ended.

447
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,791
So adding a dimension is an incredibly common way to

448
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:45,512
extend things.

449
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:48,253
And if you think about what happened with platformers,

450
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:52,356
this is the technique that was used to extend 2D

451
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:52,916
platforming.

452
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,712
First, we had screen bound.

453
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:58,436
Then we added the dimension of an infinite scroll.

454
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,699
Then we added the third dimension.

455
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,742
And we got Mario 64.

456
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:07,729
And pretty much there it stayed since then, right?

457
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,593
For those who are trying to be creative and working

458
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:14,094
on these fundamental building blocks,

459
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:16,775
I actually strongly urge you to think analog rather

460
00:26:16,815 --> 00:26:17,376
than digital.

461
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:19,216
And there's a bunch of reasons for this.

462
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:23,138
One is that if you step far enough back from digital,

463
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,360
you realize that it's still turn-based.

464
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,961
It's just that the turns are on a timer that

465
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,303
expires 60 times a second.

466
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,984
So you can still apply mechanics.

467
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,606
These mechanics still work turn-based.

468
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,421
all the way down at that level, right?

469
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:43,083
And so often you can prototype,

470
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:46,066
even action game mechanics digitally.

471
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,548
This here is a highly processed photo

472
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:51,310
of my analog game prototyping kit.

473
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,992
And this is just a fraction of the crap

474
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,153
that I have in there.

475
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,435
I go to Michael's and I buy out chunks of the craft aisles.

476
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:04,873
Okay? Incredibly useful. Flat wooden squares, random wooden

477
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:08,521
shapes. Othello, because flipping binary state is super

478
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:08,881
useful.

479
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,441
They're the closest thing to a two-sided die that you can get.

480
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:18,265
Random things like stars, chips, hexes, circles, go beads, a hex

481
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:21,227
mat, all of these things go into the mix.

482
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:22,828
Why do they go into the mix?

483
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:26,270
Because saying something like, could I

484
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,712
stick a hex grid underneath a first-person shooter

485
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:33,775
is an interesting way to start mashing up contexts.

486
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:39,129
Working analog even for digital is an interesting way to force you

487
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:43,032
to step back and look at something very familiar your

488
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:51,598
shooter your platformer your farming game your puzzle game, whatever and make it unfamiliar to you again and

489
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,920
Making things that you know very well

490
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,622
unfamiliar to you again is a

491
00:27:56,742 --> 00:28:03,547
Classic creative technique and it's one of the reasons why the history of creativity is littered with people getting stoned in various ways

492
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:08,763
Speaking of unfamiliar.

493
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,306
The quick brown fox, they claim,

494
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:16,368
jumped the lazy dogs over and more,

495
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:19,511
forever cycling mad her quoted alphabets,

496
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,733
leveling zip, and indexed Joker wild.

497
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:26,075
Unlucky vixen, pangrim beast,

498
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:29,377
spending cues and hoarding Js, the thrifty ditzy wench.

499
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,539
Why futz phonemes throw in too

500
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,320
when flow twixt verbs and jokes?

501
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,822
The cogs of status quo delights us so.

502
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,629
Books bursting free, the japes, glyphs, queries, catalexis,

503
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:45,410
zeugmas woven from words quotidian to dazzle, vex, pry,

504
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,750
illumine, beckon.

505
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,191
Why judge letters equal?

506
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,791
Math must be seizing Raynard's mind,

507
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:57,172
values coughling, waxing jabber, equations poking till nothing's

508
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,333
left except a pangrammatic sieve,

509
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:04,234
quibbling z's and k's, hortatory, just, and swift.

510
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:10,977
I like sticking poetry in my game design talks, just because I have an MFA in it.

511
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:16,942
Can somebody tell me what the weird thing about this poem is?

512
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:26,009
Every line has every letter of the alphabet.

513
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:28,531
They are pangrammatic lines, that's right.

514
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,934
This is an example of working with a constraint.

515
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:37,612
Poetry is full of working with constraints on purpose.

516
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:42,597
Giving yourself an extremely limiting box to work in

517
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:47,101
is a time-honored, classic creative tool.

518
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,443
One of the ways in which artists are trained

519
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:50,745
is that they tell them,

520
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:54,148
here's this gorgeous still-life construction of stuff

521
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,369
that you should go draw.

522
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,071
You have seven seconds, go.

523
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,200
And they make you do that over and over again.

524
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,501
It's called gestural drawing.

525
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,844
And it's done to force you to stop looking at it familiarly

526
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:09,826
by imposing a constraint, imposing a time constraint.

527
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:14,009
Think about what you can do imposing constraints.

528
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,711
If I'm designing board games, for example,

529
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,433
I had a very successful design run with this board game.

530
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:24,476
I took some of the pieces out of that kit and said,

531
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,558
I'm going to make a game using only these pieces.

532
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,242
And you know what? I got a really good game out of it.

533
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:35,423
Okay? Forcing constraints on yourself is incredibly

534
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:40,325
valuable. Somebody on that side of the room, since I've picked

535
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:43,525
on so many people here, and who isn't, Loralyn, name a game

536
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:52,748
genre. Tactical RPG. Okay. Somebody over here, name a

537
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:55,729
constraint. Think about something that is like an

538
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,610
impossibly tiny box for a tactical RPG.

539
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,361
You have to work in a cube?

540
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:08,622
Okay, a tactical RPG that must fit inside a cube.

541
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,283
How about another constraint?

542
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,785
A non-violent tactical RPG.

543
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:15,705
That's a great one.

544
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:17,606
That's a really, really good one.

545
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:20,047
Are you getting the idea here?

546
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,448
You give yourself an impossible limit,

547
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:23,248
something that makes you go,

548
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:25,189
there's no way to do that in there.

549
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,069
And you know what?

550
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:28,470
You'll probably start coming up with solutions.

551
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,131
You'll probably start inventing new game mechanics.

552
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:38,528
Adding a verb or goal.

553
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,351
Now you have to be careful adding goals.

554
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,753
Players can't juggle too many at once.

555
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:48,137
Really good games tend to have more than one goal

556
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,760
operating at the moment to moment, okay?

557
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:53,743
Cause damage, not take damage.

558
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:57,506
Great example, two goals that might be in conflict.

559
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,608
Attack and defend at the same time.

560
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:05,603
How was Defender created from lots of fairly boring shoot

561
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:05,924
him ups?

562
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,025
By adding this little extra goal.

563
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:11,126
You have to protect the little people, right?

564
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:15,688
That alone made the game dramatically deeper,

565
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,289
dramatically more interesting.

566
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:19,990
There had been games about just rescuing,

567
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,171
and there had been games about just shooting things.

568
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,301
combining the two, a choplift or another example

569
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:30,804
from the same time period, using the same mix of verbs,

570
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,805
radically different games, of course,

571
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:36,107
but you can see the creativity that emerges

572
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:38,149
from throwing in disparate ones.

573
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:39,890
And in particular, they should be ones

574
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,651
that are in competition with one another,

575
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,713
ones where you go, oh, crap, do I spend my time

576
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:47,275
doing A or B, right?

577
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,837
Force the players to have to make that decision

578
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:50,557
moment to moment.

579
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:54,633
Now, your overall game picture might have one of these

580
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:55,753
as paramount, right?

581
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:58,514
In Defender, there's no question that defending

582
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:00,275
is the core goal, right?

583
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:01,475
Because you lose if you don't.

584
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,156
But at the moment to moment, defending and killing

585
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:08,497
intertwine and balance each other really regularly.

586
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:10,898
Same thing, speed.

587
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,719
We talked about adding the speed statistic.

588
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:21,647
Players have added the do it fast goal to any number of games that we didn't think to do it to,

589
00:33:22,187 --> 00:33:24,589
which was a failure on our part as designers perhaps.

590
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:29,293
But today we have the speed run movement, which is enormous,

591
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:35,337
from players imposing a new goal on games that had frankly been exhausted in terms of gameplay.

592
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,017
If you add enough goals to something,

593
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:42,039
you eventually add up with a sandbox game.

594
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,262
It's dangerous to add lots of disparate goals

595
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,584
that aren't balancing one another, right?

596
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:50,226
But if you have a multiplayer environment,

597
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:54,450
adding disparate goals per role is actually super critical.

598
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,732
It's actually the thing that creates roles.

599
00:33:57,393 --> 00:34:00,075
So the goals of a goalie are radically different

600
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:01,196
from the goals of a striker.

601
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:09,675
This one has been incredibly fruitful lately as we've moved to touch.

602
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:10,535
Okay?

603
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:15,820
A lot of people like to say the game is the interface, the interface is the game.

604
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,902
And that isn't really accurate.

605
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:18,923
Okay?

606
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,865
And I'll diagram why.

607
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:24,768
But it is a very fruitful way to think about things.

608
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:28,027
If you, how many of you have played soccer physics?

609
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:28,887
Anybody?

610
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,509
Go grab it on your mobile device.

611
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,630
It's on iOS, I know.

612
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,092
It's probably been cloned on Android also.

613
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:38,334
You get one button that you can tap or hold,

614
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:41,336
and that's all the controls you get for a soccer game.

615
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:42,617
Okay?

616
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:46,740
Changing the number of axes of movement,

617
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,021
the time duration of movement,

618
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:56,394
breaking a simple control into a complex one, combining a complex control into a simple

619
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:02,719
one, modifying your input so now it's haptic, maybe it's buttons, maybe it's joystick, no,

620
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,203
let's move the joystick into twin joysticks, right? I don't know how many of you have ever

621
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:13,168
played Robotron on the actual cabinet versus playing Robotron with a single joystick and

622
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:13,429
button.

623
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:18,490
It's effectively a variant of the same game and it is a different game.

624
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:24,636
Defender with the reverse button or with a joystick that is a four-way joystick is effectively

625
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:26,978
a different game in the Defender family.

626
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:31,822
And you can see this as it spreads across ports on various devices.

627
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:37,359
The reason why this works is because games are, in fact,

628
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:38,320
made out of games.

629
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,062
We usually think of a game this way, right?

630
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,963
And that isn't necessarily wrong.

631
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,545
It is good to think of this is still

632
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:47,927
the game of Defender with different controls.

633
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,729
That is a valid and valuable lens.

634
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,712
But it's also good to think of the controls are a game.

635
00:35:56,531 --> 00:36:02,154
and Defender is a game. And we master them separately. I might be great at Defender on

636
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:08,357
the Atari 2600 or something, where it's one joystick, and suck at the Defender with the

637
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:14,400
up-down and a reverse button in the arcades. Very easy to fall into that trap. Believe

638
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:20,484
me, I did. Wasted a lot of quarters. Because effectively there's a whole new game buried

639
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,144
in the controls.

640
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:26,340
So it's false to just think of things in terms of this is what

641
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,502
the game is. Games are made out of games. And it's better to

642
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:35,086
think about how can I take an entire game, chunk of game, you

643
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:40,630
know, sub game, out of this game and replace it. And inputs are

644
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,732
one of the easiest things that you can do that with. Take

645
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:49,576
Defender, put it on a Wiimote. Ah! Whole new game. Right? Even

646
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:51,518
if it is still Defender on the other end.

647
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:52,362
Right?

648
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,124
Swapping out inputs, incredibly useful.

649
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:59,047
Changing topologies, the graph space.

650
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,210
We often don't look at games in terms of their graph.

651
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,732
I've used this example so many times.

652
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,534
Asteroids is not played on a square.

653
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:08,695
It's played on a donut.

654
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:09,676
Right?

655
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:12,518
Pac-Man is also played on a donut.

656
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:16,470
donut or Mobius strip, depending what level you're on.

657
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,613
Snakes and Ladders is played in non-Euclidean geometry

658
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:23,575
with wormholes.

659
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:28,098
Learn to look at games that way in terms of their graphs,

660
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,759
in terms of their topologies.

661
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,060
And all of a sudden, it opens up new things.

662
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,723
In Space Invaders, we move side to side in a bounded way.

663
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,225
The enemies wiggle side to side, and they move outwards.

664
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,541
Change the way in which they move outwards,

665
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,582
and you get Galaxian.

666
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:47,523
But take that line and wrap it into a circle,

667
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,145
and you get Tempest or Gyrus.

668
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,266
All you've done is change the graph topology

669
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:55,067
by linking the ends of the line.

670
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:58,728
You've changed what had been a line into a circle,

671
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,470
or an infinite loop.

672
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,891
And that radically changes things.

673
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:04,551
It really does.

674
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,432
The number of variations on Tetris

675
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:09,853
with Tetris played with different shapes is insane.

676
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:15,399
and there are versions of it where the play field has a different topology and versions

677
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:21,642
of it where the pieces use a different topology. You could take virtually any game. So somebody

678
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:28,545
name a game. Somebody in the back. I'll pick somebody if somebody doesn't raise their hand

679
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:39,191
back there. Farmville. Okay. Somebody pick a different topology. Farmville,

680
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,544
FarmVille in 3D.

681
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:47,745
So to really do that, that means plants hanging in the air.

682
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:49,326
Think about that.

683
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:50,926
That's actually kind of interesting.

684
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:53,786
Orchid farming, maybe.

685
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,327
Plants might grow in any direction.

686
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:57,287
Maybe they spread.

687
00:38:59,027 --> 00:38:59,767
How about another one?

688
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:00,768
Some other game.

689
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:05,648
DDR.

690
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,569
DDR with a different topology or graph.

691
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:13,301
Sorry?

692
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:16,503
Mud room DDR.

693
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:23,567
So that one's kind of interesting, but actually, I was in Argentina not that long ago.

694
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:28,570
Mud rooms are, they're hypertextual spaces.

695
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,252
So that means they can have arbitrary graph shapes, nodes with arbitrary links.

696
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:38,415
If you think about it, I'm walking down the street in Argentina and I found inlaid in

697
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:41,357
the sidewalk the steps of the tango.

698
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:46,596
The steps of the tango, and in fact, any given dance,

699
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:50,137
are in fact nodes in arbitrary graphs,

700
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,258
because every dance has a different pattern of steps.

701
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,979
You just invented the dance teaching game.

702
00:39:58,839 --> 00:39:59,079
Right?

703
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,060
Brand new game.

704
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,901
I told you we'd come up with new stuff here.

705
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:06,242
What game is this?

706
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:09,823
Breakout.

707
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:10,043
Breakout.

708
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:12,924
Space invaders, yes.

709
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:15,365
Which one is it?

710
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:18,728
Could be either one.

711
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:19,788
It could be both, right?

712
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:22,550
When you take that step of abstracting, you suddenly go,

713
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,231
oh, this could be either one, which means

714
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:26,313
you could do an A meets B. How cool would it

715
00:40:26,353 --> 00:40:28,534
be to play space invaders where your method of attack

716
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:29,114
was breakout?

717
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:31,556
And they shot back, right?

718
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:33,497
That game probably exists, actually,

719
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,658
because it's almost too obvious.

720
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:41,519
Doing mashups of things that share underlying topologies is actually a really fruitful

721
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:42,039
way to go.

722
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:44,582
There's lots of possibilities there.

723
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,666
DDR meets Simon Says, right?

724
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,229
That's kind of how DDR was born.

725
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,951
That is what DDR is.

726
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,333
It's Simon Says with your feet.

727
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:02,026
Try doing this now with things that don't seem like they have anything in common.

728
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:04,408
Could you mash up Blackjack and Robotron?

729
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,110
I have no idea!

730
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:07,791
But try.

731
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:09,713
See what comes out of it.

732
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:15,037
If there's enough there shared in common, it might turn out that, hey, shooting robots

733
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:17,399
and push your luck is a good technique.

734
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,365
When we think about a game, we usually

735
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:28,327
reach instinctively for the most straightforward simulation tool.

736
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:31,088
And that might be a really big mistake.

737
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:33,569
Think about it.

738
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:37,251
Last year at GDC, I was in Soren Johnson's talk,

739
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:41,412
and he was talking about mostly tabletop game design.

740
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:42,633
He was talking about RTSs.

741
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:48,455
I was like, could you do an RTS where you don't have a map?

742
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,412
where it's simulated with just cards,

743
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:56,795
that's like probably a whole new genre of game, right?

744
00:41:57,455 --> 00:42:00,318
Because you're taking something that's poorly.

745
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:05,202
suited for simulating one of the standard elements of RTS,

746
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:08,743
the real time and the territory, right?

747
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:11,324
But what else could you apply

748
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:14,665
badly suited simulation techniques to?

749
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:16,706
It's not that you're going to end up

750
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,107
simulating the same thing,

751
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:20,607
it's that you're going to find different ways to

752
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:25,669
enact the relationships between things.

753
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,371
Could you simulate a first person shooter with

754
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:39,807
only dice. There's probably something there. The die roll maybe is your field of view.

755
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:44,351
Maybe it's actually, you know, you roll the dice in the direction, try to roll it along

756
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:49,476
the table to hit somebody. You start exploring these things by moving things out of their

757
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:50,377
familiar context.

758
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:59,112
Classic example of moving things out of context is by choosing a new metaphor.

759
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:02,655
Now this is not the same thing as just a new skin.

760
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:07,920
A skin is something like Lord of the Rings chest sat on top of regular chest sat.

761
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:09,582
That's not that interesting.

762
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:10,343
That's a little boring.

763
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:13,465
But what happens if you literally change the metaphor?

764
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,992
If we take a first person shooter and say that it's about cameras, all of a sudden that

765
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:22,673
says, wait, we could have depth of field in the game.

766
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,235
We could have rule of threes in the game, right?

767
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,556
We could have composition in the game.

768
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:31,497
And we start inventing entire new fields for the game.

769
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,198
So it's not just skinning.

770
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:38,660
Look what happens when we change this, which is just about visiting nodes on a graph, from

771
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,161
eating into painting girders.

772
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,873
Painting girders, all of a sudden we have to jump, adds a new game, into painting a

773
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:53,535
house, which adds the notion maybe you can paint over, you can repaint, you can have

774
00:43:53,575 --> 00:44:01,039
other people competing, which opens up Qbert, which is the same game as Pac-Man, visit every

775
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,880
node on the graph, right?

776
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,342
But this isn't even not on a grid.

777
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:10,984
It's actually a regular square grid turned this way and chopped in half.

778
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:13,648
Because the relationship between the squares

779
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:14,689
is still on a grid.

780
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,732
What would happen if you actually use a triangular graph

781
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,533
or a hexagonal graph?

782
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:21,954
Things change pretty rapidly.

783
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:27,297
So are there other genres you can think of where you go,

784
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:31,160
oh, I might be able to take that and radically alter it just

785
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,623
by picking a new skin metaphor, an alternate way

786
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:36,883
to describe the mechanical verb?

787
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:42,410
This also works moving mechanics out.

788
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,853
So yes, Pac-Man is visit every node on the graph.

789
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,634
But if you say, I actually only want

790
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:49,576
to visit certain nodes on the graph,

791
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:53,599
now it's picking up objects.

792
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:57,082
And then if you say, what if these nodes on the graph

793
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,844
are hidden, it becomes a secrets system.

794
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,427
Pac-Man was mashed into Super Mario.

795
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,081
And that is how we got Super Mario,

796
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,802
by mashing in the abstract mechanic

797
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:11,802
of visiting particular nodes on a graph,

798
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:14,183
visiting particular locations.

799
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,924
So all of that is very mathy.

800
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:21,525
That doesn't mean that math is the only area for innovation,

801
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:24,385
because you can innovate on the thematic side as well.

802
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:29,647
There's really only a couple of rules here,

803
00:45:29,787 --> 00:45:31,047
and it's fairly straightforward.

804
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:34,959
You want the mathematical underlying stuff

805
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:37,041
to match up well with what you're trying

806
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,561
to make the game be about.

807
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:42,003
And frankly, the biggest problem with innovating

808
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:45,526
in terms of games on the narrative, artistic experience

809
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:49,748
side is that we pick really boring, familiar experiences

810
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:52,750
to model, when we should be asking ourselves,

811
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,631
what is this actually about?

812
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,552
Because the vast majority of games

813
00:45:56,592 --> 00:45:59,754
are about becoming more powerful and nothing else.

814
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:05,769
right? Which isn't a particularly innovative or interesting idea, right? So if you want

815
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:10,852
to innovate on that front, you should be asking yourself questions on a slightly deeper level.

816
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:18,218
Even games, even films that are about the badass hero are very rarely about being a

817
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:24,423
badass hero. Standard example I use is that Die Hard, you've all seen Die Hard? Die Hard

818
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:27,085
is about a man trying to reconnect with his estranged wife.

819
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:30,464
He is so willing to do this that he will literally

820
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:31,905
walk on broken glass.

821
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:35,128
That is what the movie is actually about.

822
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,490
And yeah, there's terrorists and an exploding helicopter,

823
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,313
but it's not where the emotional core of the movie resides.

824
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:47,297
Now, you can approach solving this problem from either end.

825
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,360
You might start at the experience end.

826
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,883
Think of a cool, interesting, complex thing

827
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:57,025
that you want to say from an experience point of view.

828
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:01,378
That's a perfectly valid way to approach it.

829
00:47:01,438 --> 00:47:04,259
It's actually a very common way to approach it these days.

830
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,640
The risk here is that you then drill down into the same

831
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,761
mechanics as always.

832
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:12,862
Odds are that if you do that, you're going to undermine the

833
00:47:12,942 --> 00:47:14,182
point you were trying to make.

834
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,044
You're going to undermine the message because the mechanics

835
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:21,505
that you'll be using probably map to other things in

836
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:22,585
people's minds already.

837
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:26,928
If you want to be really successful at getting across a point, you want to find mechanics

838
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:33,673
that cleave closely to the same point as your theme.

839
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:42,500
One of the first steps is ask yourself, is there a story that literally hasn't been told?

840
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:49,365
So I threw up a bunch here, but again, somebody tell me.

841
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:53,932
a game about something that has literally never been seen on earth.

842
00:47:55,093 --> 00:48:00,594
And the easiest way to do it is go back to your last vacation or childhood experience.

843
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:06,436
Think about a peak emotional moment in your life. And just tell me what that experience was.

844
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:17,520
Learning to ride a bike. Great. I have never seen a game about learning to ride a bike. Ever.

845
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:27,179
Fantastic. Great. Somebody else over here. Adopting a child. Great. Right? It's actually

846
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:33,485
trivially easy to come up with these, right? Super, super easy. Our only failure here is

847
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:38,330
complete lack of imagination. It's just because we haven't taken a step back.

848
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:40,833
And you know what really does this?

849
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:43,314
I get to judge games for awards at the end of the year.

850
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,936
Getting all the games in one box and laying them all down

851
00:48:46,976 --> 00:48:48,797
with their covers face up on the carpet

852
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:53,339
and realizing that every single one is a stubbly,

853
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,820
head shaved, bearded dude with a giant gun

854
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,163
really makes you realize how similar all of the stories are.

855
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:03,204
So you choose a theme that's different.

856
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:06,766
You can also start from underneath.

857
00:49:07,937 --> 00:49:13,907
If you come up with a new mathematical relationship, a new rule set, ask yourself, what does this

858
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:15,309
mechanic mean?

859
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:19,256
Does this mechanic imply teamwork?

860
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,138
Does this mechanic imply persuasion?

861
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:25,119
Does this mechanic imply radicalization?

862
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,642
What are the implications of this particular mechanical

863
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:29,322
relationship?

864
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:32,824
Systems fit inside one another, since games

865
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:33,785
are made out of games.

866
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:37,987
You can ask yourself, if this mechanic ends up

867
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:39,968
being about friendship, let's say

868
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:43,651
I have two units that can only successfully move when they

869
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:45,072
are near each other and linked.

870
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:49,586
That's the core mechanic in eco, right?

871
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:52,428
You ask yourself thematically, what does that mean?

872
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:53,569
Oh, it's friendship.

873
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,072
Then you ask yourself, what is the system in which friendship

874
00:49:58,853 --> 00:50:00,074
is a key ingredient?

875
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,736
And what happens is you start to converge

876
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:03,797
your top and your bottom.

877
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:08,740
Ask yourself, what is a story I could tell about friendship?

878
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:12,863
Maybe I need to use that mechanic in the game

879
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,905
where my parent teaches me to ride the bike.

880
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,247
and suddenly you start meeting in the middle.

881
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:21,329
So I'm not actually a huge fan

882
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:23,270
of only coming at it from one end.

883
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,952
And I think in AAA, we tend to come at things

884
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:26,992
just from the top.

885
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:30,154
And I think down at the casual puzzle kind of end,

886
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:32,055
we tend to come at things only from the bottom.

887
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:34,536
And then we slap whatever skin we want on there.

888
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:36,578
But really interesting innovation

889
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:38,298
is probably gonna innovate on both levels

890
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:40,520
at the same time, right?

891
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:46,654
So this game, recently I was at a designer retreat and the question came up, how come

892
00:50:46,674 --> 00:50:48,195
there isn't a good romance game yet?

893
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:53,961
Well my wife has been trying to be a romance novelist, so it turns out they have like,

894
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:58,986
romance novels are down to a science, they know exactly the steps, exactly what goes

895
00:50:59,046 --> 00:50:59,306
in there.

896
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:04,972
And the core thing about romance novels, what they are about, is two people who have flaws.

897
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,182
and the other person helps them overcome them.

898
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:12,206
They're about the gift of completion, right?

899
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,028
And so I literally sat in this design group,

900
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:16,990
and I was like scribbling that.

901
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,272
And then I would move down and go, what is a mechanic?

902
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,254
Well, gifting, obviously.

903
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:22,175
It has to be gifting.

904
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:24,277
But they also have to get to know one another.

905
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:28,041
So that means I need to be gifting them resources,

906
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:30,043
only I don't know how many they have.

907
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:31,984
Then I move back up.

908
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:32,905
What are these resources?

909
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:34,266
Well, they're things like confidence.

910
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:36,227
They're things like independence.

911
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:38,008
They're things like commitment.

912
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:40,550
Because those are the typical themes of romance novels.

913
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,912
Then I move back down, and I'm back down in the system.

914
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,474
This game turned out fairly successful.

915
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:50,497
I would have brought it with me, but unfortunately it was so successful that when they shipped

916
00:51:50,517 --> 00:51:56,041
it from the printer, they shipped it to Hawaii, where I can only presume it was on honeymoon.

917
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:00,444
All right.

918
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:06,161
Those are all things that are very game specific. The rest of this is stuff you could pick up

919
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:11,526
from any random self-help book, so I'll just warn you right now. Creativity, since it is

920
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:20,134
a skill, also needs to be a habit. Do it habitually. I don't know how many of you have ever visited

921
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:26,500
agameaweek.com, but you should go to agameaweek.com and feel utterly and completely inadequate

922
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,120
as creatives.

923
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:37,333
This guy puts out a new unique game a week. Excellent habit. Just like working songwriters

924
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:47,738
try to write a song every day. They throw away almost all of them. It's a habit. Believe

925
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:49,779
it or not, having a messy desk is a virtue.

926
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:54,380
Why? Because a disordered environment forces you to make unique, rare connections.

927
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,423
Remember, creativity is about making unusual connections between things.

928
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,945
A very orderly desk is not going to generate fresh connections.

929
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:06,348
You want to accidentally spill your chocolate into your peanut butter,

930
00:53:06,388 --> 00:53:09,570
and the only way to do that is to have your working area be kind of messy.

931
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:15,163
This is also why it has been shown that working in a noisy,

932
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:16,824
slightly distractible environment,

933
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:19,867
and they actually know exactly how many decibels it should be,

934
00:53:20,827 --> 00:53:23,429
has been shown to increase the rate of idea generation.

935
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,871
So you can actually visit this website.

936
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,312
It'll generate coffee shop noises

937
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,533
for you in the background at the right volume level.

938
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:34,317
Exercise is extremely stimulating.

939
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:40,784
You should be doing it anyway. Clearly I'm not doing it enough. Stand up at least once

940
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:47,365
every hour for at least five minutes, that kind of thing. Stasis is a bad thing. Don't

941
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:53,826
do a kind of, like, not rock climbing where you might fall and die. It needs to be something

942
00:53:53,866 --> 00:54:00,947
where you can let your mind wander. Get enough sleep. Probably all of you have a smartphone.

943
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:02,768
That means all of you have a sleep tracker.

944
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:06,826
It's built into the motion detectors on your phones now.

945
00:54:07,507 --> 00:54:11,648
Super useful, particularly you want to pay attention to the amount of REM sleep you're

946
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:11,928
getting.

947
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:14,429
Worth a try.

948
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,711
You use your phone as an alarm clock, it will actually wake you up when you're naturally

949
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:19,211
waking up.

950
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,112
And then you won't feel as groggy in the morning.

951
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:25,434
Take notes by hand.

952
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:27,955
Not typing.

953
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,716
Handwriting has been shown.

954
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:33,807
I don't know why, maybe because it's slower,

955
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,469
maybe because it incurs different cognitive loads.

956
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,991
For whatever reason, retention is better

957
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,293
when you take notes by hand.

958
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:44,777
And a lot of novelists to this day say, you know,

959
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:47,019
I went back and I wrote that longhand

960
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:49,901
and won an award for it.

961
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:55,126
So I personally use a stylus on my tablet

962
00:54:56,227 --> 00:54:57,788
rather than typing on my tablet.

963
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:04,513
Don't be afraid to completely fail and fall on your face.

964
00:55:05,313 --> 00:55:05,593
OK?

965
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:08,615
I don't know how many of you have been doing brainstorming

966
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:11,096
meetings the classic way, but it's wrong.

967
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:14,417
The classic way of doing brainstorming meetings is to

968
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:17,058
say every idea is good, nobody criticize anybody.

969
00:55:17,999 --> 00:55:20,860
That outputs two ideas per person per hour.

970
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,441
If you allow the other people in the room to say, no, that's

971
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:28,323
a bad idea, and here's why, you get seven ideas per

972
00:55:28,363 --> 00:55:29,223
person per hour.

973
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:30,663
Go figure.

974
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:33,826
We were all taught incorrectly for a generation.

975
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:37,309
It's incredibly important to be OK with failure.

976
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:42,093
It's incredibly important to keep those failures around.

977
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:43,935
I had a game that I designed.

978
00:55:43,955 --> 00:55:46,617
It was a tabletop game that used little round counters

979
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:49,660
with colors on them, arranged in circles, where you were trying

980
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,643
to do set packing to get certain patterns of colors

981
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:53,263
into your hand.

982
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,086
And it was so damn fiddly.

983
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,087
It was a disaster.

984
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:03,411
It didn't work at all. We kept trying to play it. It just didn't work. I shelved it. Two

985
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:08,575
years later, I come back to it and I go, wait, if I put those on cards so I could actually

986
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:13,699
overlap the cards, now that game is going to be published by Boing Boing and Cards Against

987
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:19,544
Humanity and the Kickstarter will be later this year. Keep your fails around, because

988
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:23,547
you never know when they're going to turn out, moved into a new context, to be really

989
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:23,967
good ideas.

990
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:30,571
The myth of the angsty depressed artist is bullshit.

991
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,614
People are more creative when they're actually happy.

992
00:56:35,014 --> 00:56:36,575
This is why exercise works.

993
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,197
Just relaxing works.

994
00:56:40,257 --> 00:56:42,479
High stress is a creativity killer.

995
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:46,121
Just a warm shower helps, frankly, right?

996
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:48,743
Let yourself float in a swimming pool.

997
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,864
Whatever it is that you do to relax.

998
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:53,206
For me, often it's playing guitar.

999
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:55,407
I can sit and zone out with the guitar

1000
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:56,548
it doesn't matter what I'm playing.

1001
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,490
and it will lead to ideas in new ways.

1002
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:04,214
Play the movie to yourself in your head.

1003
00:57:04,695 --> 00:57:06,476
This is a classic creative exercise.

1004
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:08,358
Close your eyes.

1005
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:09,719
All of you.

1006
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:10,640
Close them now.

1007
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,520
Quit reading the slide.

1008
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:12,381
I see you reading.

1009
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:12,741
Stop.

1010
00:57:13,802 --> 00:57:15,023
And picture a wheelbarrow.

1011
00:57:16,425 --> 00:57:16,685
Okay?

1012
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:18,306
Classic creative exercise.

1013
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:23,464
People who are more creative supposedly see things like the pattern of rust on the side

1014
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:25,225
of the wheelbarrow and they know what color it is.

1015
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:30,109
They can see the little pile of dirt and maybe a little bit of straw and that one brick that

1016
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:31,150
is nestled in the corner.

1017
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:35,993
They know the way in which the handle, along the sides of the handle, it's actually that

1018
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:41,217
U-shaped curve of metal that then becomes round and the way the one screw always catches

1019
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:41,658
your hand.

1020
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:46,161
Being able to dive that deep is what drives the creativity.

1021
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:47,862
Play the movie in your head.

1022
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:49,487
You can open your eyes now.

1023
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:52,930
Supposedly those who are more creative

1024
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,192
are able to see more detail in those movies.

1025
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:57,634
It's one of the best ways of pushing yourself out

1026
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,294
of the context.

1027
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:02,998
The world is full of systems and relationships.

1028
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:06,040
So read like crazy.

1029
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:09,523
You wouldn't know it, but something like the AI

1030
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,045
in early MMOs was partially inspired by the fact

1031
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:14,587
that at MIT they were putting little robots on roller skates.

1032
00:58:16,183 --> 00:58:18,425
Ideas come from funny places, right?

1033
00:58:19,026 --> 00:58:21,307
Read about every subject you can think of,

1034
00:58:22,148 --> 00:58:24,209
because that's where you start making connections

1035
00:58:24,249 --> 00:58:25,390
that come out of context.

1036
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:30,494
Don't settle for the familiar.

1037
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:32,995
Don't settle for it among people.

1038
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:34,997
Mix up your teams.

1039
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:36,998
Don't settle for it among places.

1040
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:41,341
Try moving your desk every week to a different location.

1041
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:43,163
It will probably prompt ideas.

1042
00:58:45,046 --> 00:58:46,007
explain things

1043
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:54,214
Because it forces you to abstract it forces you to reduce things back down into essence and look at things systemically

1044
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:56,677
and then finally

1045
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:59,219
Realize that everything I said

1046
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,681
Doesn't mean you'll be successful

1047
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:07,927
Creative leaders are usually perceived as being worse leaders than people who do things by the book

1048
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:13,352
Usually, the people who invent a new game are not the ones who make the big bucks off

1049
00:59:13,392 --> 00:59:13,572
of it.

1050
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:16,334
So if you're financially motivated, this is not the way to go.

1051
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:17,915
It's risky.

1052
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:21,317
Even if you do all of these things, you'll probably fail more often than not.

1053
00:59:22,157 --> 00:59:23,038
So why do it?

1054
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:26,740
Well, it opens up other doors for you.

1055
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:29,582
It's fun.

1056
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:32,880
It's how you leave a mark.

1057
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,900
And I assume all of us are in this

1058
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,961
because we wanted to do that.

1059
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:38,842
There are lots of ways to make money

1060
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:40,362
in more reliable ways than this.

1061
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:44,504
If you execute, you can in fact own a Blue Ocean.

1062
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:46,104
So there is a business reason to do it.

1063
00:59:46,864 --> 00:59:50,066
And these days, especially, being creative

1064
00:59:50,526 --> 00:59:53,247
in your particular way, and everybody has a particular way,

1065
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:54,907
builds your brand.

1066
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,348
And that's incredibly important these days

1067
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,849
because marketing, as we know it, is dead.

1068
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:03,692
So here's the takeaway.

1069
01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:08,155
We're in a creative field.

1070
01:00:09,296 --> 01:00:10,437
This is a creative business.

1071
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,039
Make it a habit.

1072
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,660
Make it a skill.

1073
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:15,682
And be practical about it.

1074
01:00:16,082 --> 01:00:17,443
It's not rocket science.

1075
01:00:18,104 --> 01:00:18,824
It's just hard.

1076
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:20,946
Thanks.

1077
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:38,383
We're supposed to move to the overflow room, but it is, if we have questions, but it's

1078
01:00:38,624 --> 01:00:40,285
lunchtime, so I'm not sure it matters.

1079
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:47,292
So if anybody does have questions, or you can all leave for lunch, because you're hungry.

1080
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:56,440
I will post these slides on my website, rafkoster.com, probably over lunch.

1081
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:07,643
I have not found a place where you can buy blockus pieces

1082
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,443
without having to buy blockus.

1083
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:12,384
That said, if I were prototyping that,

1084
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:15,244
I would probably go buy wooden cubes, which

1085
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:18,545
are available pretty cheaply, both online at a craft store

1086
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:19,125
or they add up.

1087
01:01:19,485 --> 01:01:20,965
You can get cubes in various sizes,

1088
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:22,166
and I would glue them together.

1089
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:26,527
Way cheaper than buying blockus sets.

1090
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,467
and all of my substrate is not in the pond.

1091
01:01:31,928 --> 01:01:34,310
You can do an aquarium with no substrate in there,

1092
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,851
you withdraw to a filter box.

1093
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:38,593
That is connected into a singular ecosystem,

1094
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,255
so yeah, you're cheating, that's fine.

1095
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:42,937
You have a sump tank, that's fine.

1096
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:45,439
You need to have a substrate or a sump.

1097
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:48,581
Yeah, if you don't have a substrate, it won't work.

1098
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:48,862
Yeah.

1099
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:50,623
Any other questions?

1100
01:02:03,826 --> 01:02:13,694
I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow. Oh, an investor. If

1101
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:16,896
you're an investor, how do you find the right creative process

1102
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:21,540
for game? Are you looking for creative people? Yes. I would

1103
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,042
look for track record, frankly. I would look for people that

1104
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:26,984
have done it before. I would also look for people that have

1105
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:29,788
At the exact opposite end, a complete novices.

1106
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:36,716
Complete novices, have you ever noticed that when you listen to bands who are putting out their first album,

1107
01:02:37,317 --> 01:02:41,742
their first album is often startling, and then their second and third are not as interesting?

1108
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:45,504
It's because people who don't yet know what everything is

1109
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:48,825
familiar often invent completely new things because

1110
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:51,666
they don't have the context and it's not yet, you know.

1111
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:54,187
And then when they settle in, they just do things the way

1112
01:02:54,227 --> 01:02:56,428
they always have and they get less interesting.

1113
01:02:56,848 --> 01:03:00,489
So a team of veterans and novices might actually be a

1114
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:03,990
more interesting thing to invest in than a team of, you

1115
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:06,411
know, well-practiced people who've made exactly the kind

1116
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:08,472
of game that you've always made, you know, that kind of

1117
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:08,632
thing.

1118
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:14,191
Try to find people who both have a track record of exploring new areas and find people who

1119
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:19,876
will just bring fresh ideas. People who just haven't done this. Haven't done it that way.

1120
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:26,401
To force creative sparks. And if you're an investor, realize you'll probably be first

1121
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:35,109
mover and the second mover will eat your lunch. Right? So Minecraft was built on Infiniminer.

1122
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,671
Blizzard was built on...

1123
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:44,553
well, literally a half dozen other games that they cloned and improved and polished the

1124
01:03:44,593 --> 01:03:50,437
hell out of, right? I don't know that Blizzard has ever invented a game in their entire existence.

1125
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:55,581
What they do is be second mover very, very well. So if you're an investor, you might

1126
01:03:55,621 --> 01:04:01,725
not want to do creativity at all. A lot of games companies just do fast follow, right?

1127
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:07,489
They look for innovative new things and then they follow on it. Anybody else?

1128
01:04:10,425 --> 01:04:11,338
All right, thank you very much.
