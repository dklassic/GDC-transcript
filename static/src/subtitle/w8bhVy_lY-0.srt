1
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:09,022
All right, this is iterating design and fighting fires,

2
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:11,063
updating Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride.

3
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:12,983
My name is Luke Muscat.

4
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:14,944
Thanks everyone for coming along.

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,005
It's pretty exciting.

6
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:18,905
This room is way bigger than I thought it would be,

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,206
so I'm freaking out right now.

8
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:22,226
Thanks for coming along as well,

9
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,847
because I have a talk on Thursday,

10
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:26,727
and it's on at the same time as the crazy panel

11
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:29,408
with Sid Meier and Cliffy B and Peter Molyneux,

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,649
so I'm just assuming no one's gonna turn up to that one.

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,809
So it's cool that some people came along to this one.

14
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:36,518
Alright, we'll get started.

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:42,465
So yeah, my name is Luke Muscat, I'm the CCO at Halfbrick, which stands for Chief Creative

16
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:42,846
Officer.

17
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:49,033
I made these, which is Jetpack Joyride, Monster Dash, Fruit Ninja, and a bunch of other games

18
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,455
that no one knows about or cares about.

19
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:56,825
And so this talk is going to be all about, so it's kind of like a Fruit Ninja update

20
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,787
post-mortem, so a post-release post-mortem.

21
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:04,109
And you know, I'm going to be going through the goals of a lot of the updates we did and

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,372
the results and talking a lot about, you know, updating Jetpack Joyride and how that's been

23
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,113
different to updating Fruit Ninja.

24
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:16,517
So just to be clear as well, like I'm only going to be talking about Fruit Ninja iOS,

25
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,280
the SD version, so just the version on iPhone and iPod.

26
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:26,990
I'm not going to be talking about the HD version, Android, Bada, how we go about making sure

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,513
the updates move across all of those correctly.

28
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:34,716
That's a whole other talk altogether and frankly I'm not the best person to be doing that talk.

29
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:39,961
But yeah, so this will just be about Fruit Ninja SD, which has had over 15 million purchases

30
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:40,501
so far.

31
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:44,184
I haven't updated that figure in a while, it might be a little bit different now.

32
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:47,007
And over 40 million updates downloaded too.

33
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:53,448
So a bit of context to be a bit useful before I start this talk.

34
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:56,070
So Halfbrick is 57 people now.

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,331
We're a pretty big company.

36
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:59,712
We haven't put on all of those numbers since Fruit Ninja.

37
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,634
Like when Fruit Ninja came out, we were already about 30, 35

38
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:02,774
people.

39
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,056
But internally, we're broken up into teams.

40
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,018
This is my lovely, very attractive team.

41
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,579
We have seven guys.

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,562
And we actually work on two titles at once.

43
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:15,624
Right now, half the guys are working on Jetpack Joyride

44
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:15,964
update.

45
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:19,648
the other half are, you know, working on some prototyping for some new IP.

46
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,130
So, this is just kind of useful because, you know, when I'm talking about how we do our

47
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,911
updates and all that, people might be thinking like,

48
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,852
God, you've got 50 people, how can that update take so long?

49
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:30,873
We don't put all 50 people on the update.

50
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:34,535
All updates I'll be talking about were completed by 3 to 4 people.

51
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,117
So, Rocket Racing.

52
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,498
Hands up if you've played this game.

53
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:46,130
See how there's like no hands up? This game was a disaster.

54
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,974
This was a game we made a couple of years ago for PSP minis.

55
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:55,559
And this game was a hardcore, abstract racing game that we made.

56
00:02:56,179 --> 00:03:00,063
We spent eight months on this game. We really poured a lot into it and it

57
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,965
absolutely bombed.

58
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:07,109
It was, you know, it got an okay-ish critical reception but just, you know,

59
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,571
there was no market for it.

60
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:12,580
So it's because of this game that we had this new goal.

61
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,763
And this new goal was to ship lean,

62
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:18,048
you know, ship multiple games really lean, really quickly.

63
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,492
And if it works, we'll update it often.

64
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,476
And this way, we'll be lowering our risk of development.

65
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:24,918
I'm just going to move this here.

66
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,989
So that's where Fruit Ninja comes in.

67
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,690
Fruit Ninja is a direct result of Rocket Racing.

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,391
It was me trying to make the opposite game to Rocket Racing.

69
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:42,053
What we have here is like 80% of the design document

70
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:43,373
that exists for Fruit Ninja.

71
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:46,294
This is all there has been and all there probably ever

72
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:47,394
will be for Fruit Ninja.

73
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:49,535
You know, pretty simple.

74
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,075
Slice fruit, don't slice bombs.

75
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:54,016
And when we shipped, we shipped really lean.

76
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:59,265
almost crazy like you look at Fruit Ninja and if you're familiar with the game at the moment you

77
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:04,295
know it has you know like four modes and unlockables and achievements and leaderboards

78
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,860
and social features and all kinds of crazy stuff.

79
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,095
Version 1.0 had nothing.

80
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:11,936
It was so, so lean.

81
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:12,777
There were no modes.

82
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,799
There's only what now we know is classic mode.

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,341
There were no combos.

84
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,341
There were no unlocks.

85
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:19,824
There were very few devices we had to worry about.

86
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,426
There was no such thing as Game Center or Retina

87
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,407
or any of that stuff.

88
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,829
And because of all these factors,

89
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,091
we actually shipped the game in six weeks

90
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:31,195
from start to finish just with three guys,

91
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,996
plus a sound guy for a week as well.

92
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,103
I was looking for a screenshot of Old Fruit Ninja.

93
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,163
I couldn't even find that.

94
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,964
This screenshot has got multi-touch in it.

95
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,504
1.0 didn't even have that.

96
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,325
I just couldn't find an older screenshot than this one.

97
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,226
So when we launched, everything went really well.

98
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,747
We got a really good critical reception.

99
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:52,988
We got good reviews all over the place, which was very cool.

100
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,469
I couldn't find any cool screenshots of us

101
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,510
at our early stages of success, so you

102
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,110
have to make do with my artist's interpretation right here.

103
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,764
Yeah, I'm not an artist, I'm a designer.

104
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:09,917
And so the game is out, we have 1.0, and time for some updates.

105
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,281
So this is really, you know, what the talk is about.

106
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:20,244
Update 1.01. So this is our very first update and our goal was pretty simple. We wanted to roll an update

107
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:24,185
really soon after launch and show everyone that we were committed to this game, we were going to be

108
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:29,706
supporting this game and although this game is simple, there's more to come. We started working

109
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:34,287
on this before the game was even out while we were waiting for it to pass like Apple certification

110
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:37,128
and all of that stuff. So our current player base was zero.

111
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,964
And it's pretty simple, you know, we were going to add two new fruit, the mango and the pear,

112
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:46,424
which, you know, we add new fruit now, no one really cares because we've got such a large

113
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,585
roster, but back then we didn't have that many, so that was kind of a big deal.

114
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,866
We wanted to do multi-touch support, so that you could have multiple blades,

115
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:57,206
which seemed like it'd be a cool thing. And we wanted to just, we knew that the performance

116
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:01,047
wasn't that great, especially on the older devices. We knew there was a lot we could

117
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,728
do to make that better, so we were really focusing on that.

118
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:06,968
So I have a bit of a story here for you.

119
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,471
Fruit Ninja came out and it was doing pretty good, you know, it was moving up the charts

120
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,352
and in Australia it was doing really well.

121
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:19,814
So it's a Friday night and Fruit Ninja overtook Doodle Jump in the charts.

122
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:23,976
It was still way down in the American charts, you know, position 120 or something,

123
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:26,597
but it was doing really good in Australia and we were stoked.

124
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,498
So we were having our traditional Friday afternoon beers

125
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,161
and obviously because things were going well we were having a few extra beers to celebrate

126
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,862
and, you know, really getting into the spirit of things, so to say.

127
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,403
And it got to about...

128
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:44,772
11 o'clock or so and we got an email that came in, don't ask us why we were checking

129
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:48,599
emails while we were drinking, and it was an email from Apple telling us that they wanted

130
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:51,924
to feature us and that they needed the assets immediately.

131
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,552
So being in Australia, it was our Friday afternoon.

132
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:00,292
They probably sent it on their Thursday afternoon or Friday

133
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,752
morning, thinking that we would have time.

134
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:03,233
But because it was going to be our weekend

135
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,693
and no one was going to be there, we were like, right,

136
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,193
we're going to do these assets right away.

137
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:10,034
We entered full panic mode and kind of semi-drunkenly

138
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:15,215
got all these assets together, which was really cool.

139
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,756
You wouldn't want to do that again in hindsight.

140
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,696
But we're usually a lot more prepared than that now.

141
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:21,976
We learn our lesson from that one.

142
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:23,979
So then two things happen.

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,263
The very first update launches at the exact same time

144
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:29,565
that we get featured by Apple.

145
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:31,326
And we're stoked.

146
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:33,449
Featured by Apple, that's a huge deal.

147
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,210
It's going to help our sales dramatically.

148
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,952
We're going to get all this extra exposure, all

149
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,013
this extra attention.

150
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:38,794
Awesome.

151
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,336
And it's right when the update lands.

152
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:41,697
That's amazing, right?

153
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:47,767
Boom. This update was a disaster.

154
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:51,249
Unfortunately, when we were working on

155
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,371
the updates and the

156
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:59,573
performance fixes, we had obviously screwed something up pretty dramatically

157
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,474
and for some reason

158
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,395
about 15 percent of players could no longer play the game.

159
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,537
And this was the worst time, you know, we just sort of got this momentum going, we just

160
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,398
got featured and then this update came.

161
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:15,582
and all of a sudden the one star reviews are flying in and we're in full panic mode.

162
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,403
So we need to do a new update.

163
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,548
1.01.1. Pretty simple goal.

164
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,890
And we were fortunate enough, we got it fixed really quickly.

165
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,973
And it was actually really interesting, like, you know,

166
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:33,556
obviously when this happened and, you know, it's locking people out of the game,

167
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,838
we're thinking it's this massive disaster and,

168
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:38,700
you know, oh shit, the game is doomed forever.

169
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:43,324
But there was this, it was really interesting, we got it fixed, we

170
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,807
ended up kind of nicknaming these builds where we fixed the problem.

171
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:48,648
uh, firefighter builds.

172
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:51,069
Um, and we got this silver lining

173
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,070
where people really seemed to respond to the fact

174
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,971
that we took notice that we'd done

175
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:57,072
something wrong and that the game had sort of become

176
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,213
unstable, and we fixed

177
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,334
it really quickly. You know, we were communicating,

178
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,195
we were on forums, we were replying

179
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:04,776
to emails saying we're on it, and then

180
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,057
we did fix it. Certainly

181
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,178
we lost people because, you know, they

182
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,019
tried to play the game and it was no good and they felt

183
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,180
like they'd been jipped out of their dollar, but, you know,

184
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,140
we also, uh...

185
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,080
won some fans because you know they were watching us, they could see that we cared and that we were

186
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,982
you know doing our best to keep things going.

187
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:25,686
So we learn a few lessons pretty quickly on this one. You know updates can be

188
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,847
crippling, certainly

189
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:31,210
updates can enhance your game but at the same way it can take away from it.

190
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,734
I'm sure there's some other iOS developers that could attest to that one.

191
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:39,798
I think it was Minigore might have had a really bad one once that wiped progress and...

192
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:43,732
you know, it's certainly something to be careful of. And so, you know, we realized

193
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:47,173
that QA effort needed to be increased dramatically for these updates. We really

194
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,074
hadn't given the update the QA time it deserved.

195
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:54,195
We also needed to, you know, assess our risk associated with each update.

196
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,976
Adding new fruit? Easy. That's cheap. That's probably pretty low risk.

197
00:09:57,016 --> 00:10:00,237
But being in there, mucking around with the render code, trying to make it run faster?

198
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:05,221
getting in dangerous waters. We also realized that players are keeping score on us,

199
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,688
which was interesting. We really didn't think people would be paying

200
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,454
that much attention to Halfbrick, but it turns out they are.

201
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,920
So at this point we get to update 1.2.

202
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,481
Our player base has grown dramatically now,

203
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,982
145,000 players, which at the time

204
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,442
seemed like the entire world.

205
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:23,103
We were stoked.

206
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,884
And our goal was to release something big that

207
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:29,125
would warrant a second trailer and another round of media.

208
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:31,066
And we really wanted to capitalize

209
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,887
on this initial momentum we had going.

210
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,789
So we weren't really sure which way to go with this.

211
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:40,310
So it's tricky, because a game like

212
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:45,768
Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, a lot of those level-based games,

213
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:48,469
they have such a good way of updating the game.

214
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:51,031
Like, you like our game, you like playing levels, boom!

215
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,354
25 more levels. It's so simple, it's easy for them to add.

216
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:57,036
The value proposition for the players is obvious.

217
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,878
Like, there is now more of what you like to play,

218
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,399
and it's just so easy to communicate.

219
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,500
We didn't have anything like that for Fruit Ninja.

220
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,462
We really weren't sure on which way to go with it.

221
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,855
So our producer, Jason Harwood, had this idea.

222
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:14,019
And he went through every single iTunes review

223
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
we had gotten so far, and he collated it

224
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,602
into this massive Excel sheet.

225
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:23,187
And then he grouped up common suggestions that people had

226
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,208
and common problems.

227
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:27,551
So we had a section for bugs, a section for suggestions,

228
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,591
and all of that kind of stuff.

229
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:31,194
And this is what we ended up with.

230
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,700
So the very top one there is, you know, multi-slice and then we have

231
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,704
needs more game modes, needs some kind of endless mode,

232
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:43,928
that there's more fruit, so on. And it was all organized by the number of mentions it had.

233
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,671
So number one, multi-slice.

234
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:52,589
This still gets requested all the time,

235
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,351
and every time I am against multi-slice.

236
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:58,192
The thing is, right now in Fruit Ninja,

237
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,073
the fruit is either sliced or it's not sliced.

238
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:00,874
It's binary.

239
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,735
The call to action for the player is so obvious.

240
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,756
If the fruit isn't sliced, I need to slice it.

241
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,057
As soon as you introduce this idea of multi-slice,

242
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:09,498
things start to get trickier.

243
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:11,979
There's now, you know, it's been sliced,

244
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,800
but I could get more points if I don't.

245
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,201
There's an opportunity cost there.

246
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:19,905
And additionally, as the fruit gets quartered and maybe eighth or sixteenth,

247
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:25,689
it's actually getting smaller on the screen and it really stops becoming the optimal size for interacting with.

248
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,073
So, multi-slice is something that I've been very much against for a long time.

249
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:36,358
So, the second thing that, you know, second and third thing was, hey, more modes would be cool.

250
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,380
And how about an infinite no-bomb mode?

251
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:42,568
People really hated the bombs in classic mode.

252
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,388
So we were like, OK, I get it.

253
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,289
Bombs are kind of tricky.

254
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,429
Let's try making this infinite no bomb mode.

255
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,110
And it was interesting.

256
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,130
We started working on it.

257
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,651
We got it working really, really quickly.

258
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,172
And for the first five minutes, it was really cool.

259
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:58,533
And then slicing fruit all of a sudden lost its meaning.

260
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,351
you it was really weird you kind of played in your life cool no bombs then

261
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,235
there was no pressure and there was no kind of constraints

262
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:10,141
and he sort of burnt out on slicing fruit which is bad news for a game that

263
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,723
is only about slicing fruit

264
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,222
We tried some other things to really spice it up as well.

265
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,803
We made this thing called critical waves,

266
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,824
where all the fruit would come up and they would, you know,

267
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,184
definitely be a critical.

268
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:26,467
And the blade would turn blue and it would have sparkles on the back

269
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,127
and that's how you knew that it was going to be a critical.

270
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,669
And even that still didn't feel quite right.

271
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,610
Just the points were meaningless and, you know,

272
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,091
it really just wasn't clicking.

273
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,973
Fortunately, we were able to use that blade stuff a little bit later on.

274
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,143
So while we were working on this, we started mucking around with the idea of putting combos in.

275
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:48,005
That was another common thread that had been in our iTunes reviews.

276
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:52,488
I love this GIF just showing what the combos look like in slow-mo.

277
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,768
I always think it looks really neat.

278
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,872
And we put that in and we got a benefit from that straight away.

279
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,794
It worked in classic mode.

280
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,896
You could just slice the fruit or you could try and take bigger risks.

281
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,139
One of the big things that we did was like rather than

282
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,840
the score going up exponentially, so a four fruit combo being worth five points

283
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,461
and a five fruit combo being worth ten points or whatever,

284
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,362
we really wanted it to be as simple as possible and

285
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:22,683
make it so that people would understand what score they got and why immediately.

286
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:27,164
So we kind of made some sacrifices to the gameplay

287
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:32,246
in order to increase how clearly the game was communicating with the player.

288
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,288
And then we added a time limit to Zen mode.

289
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:40,511
And all of a sudden, it all kind of made sense.

290
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,311
It was so weird.

291
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,852
We added the 90-second time limit.

292
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,913
And it was just this kind of like, well,

293
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,674
it's annoying because it goes on forever

294
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:48,055
and you have to hit the pause button.

295
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,716
And then that's how you get out of the game.

296
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,678
So maybe we'll just add a time limit, and that was it.

297
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:52,998
We added this time limit.

298
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,219
Next thing you know, you look around,

299
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,461
and all the guys are trying to beat each other's high scores.

300
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,622
And this weird thing happened where Zen mode was now like both the most relaxing mode,

301
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:03,723
or that's what it was intended to be, was this relaxing mode

302
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,184
where you didn't have as much stress and pressure,

303
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:10,945
to this extremely hardcore, competitive, everyone trying to beat each other's high scores,

304
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:13,746
which was absolutely fantastic.

305
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,407
And all of a sudden it felt Fruit Ninja again.

306
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,747
It felt like it had a place.

307
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:22,929
And a lot of the times it was just this kind of intuitive sense that it belonged in the game.

308
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,452
We went through and we tuned the waves in Zen mode to make them

309
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:31,335
play off that as well and they're all combo-able in different ways.

310
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:36,780
The other thing we added was the coming soon fruit. We wanted people to know, yes, this is a

311
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,083
big update, but we're not done yet. We're not even close to done yet.

312
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:43,546
We wanted everyone to know that we are still working on more stuff.

313
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,340
So when we released, everything seemed to go pretty good.

314
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,644
We got quite a bit of coverage around the place, which was neat.

315
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:53,948
You know, everything kind of worked how we expected.

316
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,375
We said we wanted to warrant doing a second trailer and a big media blitz,

317
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,376
and that definitely happened.

318
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,560
Got really widespread coverage, which was great.

319
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,772
And then this is the graph for what happened.

320
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:07,095
So the orange line is updates, the blue line is sales.

321
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:09,538
They're not necessarily on the same scale,

322
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:10,579
they're just kind of compressed

323
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,780
so you can see what's going on.

324
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,502
Otherwise, the blue line is really flat and at the bottom

325
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,705
because the update volume is always so high.

326
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:20,568
And you can see, you know, we were on this downward decline

327
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,371
and we did this update and it helped.

328
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,156
But not a great deal.

329
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,097
You know, we spent a long time on Zenmode.

330
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:28,377
Well, relatively long time.

331
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,838
We spent three or four weeks on it,

332
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,859
which is almost as long as it took to make the game.

333
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,600
And, you know, we got this bit of a bump

334
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,841
and it stabilized us,

335
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,843
but it certainly wasn't this big boom like we were expecting.

336
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,905
So, again, lessons learned.

337
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:47,159
We need to listen to the fans but read between the lines.

338
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,680
And I mean, this isn't even something that's specific to,

339
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,201
you know, iTunes reviews and community feedback.

340
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,101
This is just playtesting in general, right?

341
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:57,942
You know, one of the ones I always remember is

342
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,063
back when I was working on an old licensed game,

343
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:03,344
we had some kids come in and we'd designed this puzzle game.

344
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,985
And these kids were coming in and they were playing the game

345
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,405
over and over and over and, you know,

346
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,865
just kind of playing through the first part.

347
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,486
And the kid got about 20 minutes in and he's going,

348
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:12,566
you know what this game needs.

349
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:14,527
I said to him, what does this game need?

350
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,028
He goes, this game needs a tank.

351
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:17,948
I want to run over things.

352
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,189
I want to blow up the walls.

353
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,709
And that's what I really want to do.

354
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,910
And so the interesting thing about that

355
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,751
was obviously we're not going to add a tank to this puzzle game.

356
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,712
But what it really said to us was, OK, this game

357
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:30,692
needs variety.

358
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,773
It needs a greater sense of empowerment.

359
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,274
And the same thing can be said for iTunes reviews,

360
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,755
community feedback, and community engagement.

361
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:43,283
We really need to read between the lines and be smart about what we do.

362
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,766
They know what the problem is, they don't specifically know what the solution is always,

363
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,887
although there are often some really great ideas.

364
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:55,410
And the other thing was just that updates can help keep the momentum, but they're a

365
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,890
lot of work.

366
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,932
I mean, I'm sure a lot of people who've done iOS updates know that they take a while to

367
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:00,352
get right.

368
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:02,854
So update 1.2.1.

369
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:08,230
current player base has grown to 350,000, so that's pretty cool.

370
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,952
And we had this idea for this update.

371
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:14,655
We kind of had taken inspiration from the very first update

372
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:15,736
where we botched things up.

373
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,638
We said, OK, we're introducing a new mode.

374
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:20,572
that's a pretty big change.

375
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:22,552
That's probably a pretty big risk.

376
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:24,893
So let's do this update, and we're gonna call it,

377
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,594
the way that we kind of internally phrase this update

378
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:28,734
is a chaser update.

379
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,115
So the idea is this, there's gonna be an update

380
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,356
that drops again, really quickly

381
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,996
after the major release update,

382
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,077
and it's gonna have a couple of new interesting things,

383
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,298
nothing major, not like another mode or anything,

384
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:43,619
just some nice little extra bits and pieces,

385
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:46,880
and we're also gonna roll all of the bug fixes

386
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,280
and all the problems that come up into this update.

387
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:54,647
The other thing we really wanted to do was, you know, spark some community engargement.

388
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,171
Hmm. Okay. There's no spellcheck in Photoshop. I apologize.

389
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:04,675
So what we did is we got some minor stuff ready beforehand.

390
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:09,038
We added some coconuts and, you know, fixed a couple of bugs that we already knew of.

391
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:13,341
And we had this stuff ready to go before Zenmode even dropped.

392
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,057
The other things we added were rate us.

393
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:20,701
So, really simple thing, comes up every now and then,

394
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,003
you know, hey, how about you rate us?

395
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,526
We were a bit smarter about it

396
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,868
than just putting it in randomly.

397
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,511
It waits till you've played a whole bunch of games.

398
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,859
because then we can assume that the player is engaged.

399
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,340
And then, you know, if they get a pretty good score,

400
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,281
or even their best score,

401
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,822
then we think that might be a good time to let them know

402
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,443
that now's a good time to raid us.

403
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,184
If they had it, like, right after a crummy run,

404
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,084
then that's not so good.

405
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,605
Also, if they hit no thanks, we never bug them again.

406
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,627
I don't see any point pestering people into it.

407
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,547
I don't see, like, when they see it for the ninth time

408
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,328
that they're gonna have a change of heart

409
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,809
and give us a five-star rating.

410
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,030
The other thing we wanted to do,

411
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,411
so this was to meet our...

412
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:03,515
user engagement and community engagement was the dragon fruit.

413
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,536
So the dragon fruit is this really, really rare fruit.

414
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,959
It has a 1 in 40,000 chance of coming up with each fruit spawn,

415
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
only in classic mode.

416
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,882
There's some other kind of probability clamping,

417
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,044
and we fudge with the numbers quite a bit to, you know,

418
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,166
make sure it doesn't come up too often or too rarely.

419
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,048
And, yeah, we put that in as well,

420
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,130
just as a nice little thing to try and get people talking.

421
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,032
And the really cool thing was once it came out...

422
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,357
people really were talking about it.

423
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,278
These are some comments that I just copy-pasted

424
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,859
straight off the Touch Arcade forums.

425
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:36,340
And it kind of started to bring on this mythos,

426
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,741
like people weren't even sure it was real or not.

427
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,682
And people would claim that they'd seen it.

428
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:42,803
It was amazing, the dialogue that we had going.

429
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,383
And this is my favorite one.

430
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,785
People speculating about what the dragon fruit does.

431
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:51,006
Speculating that maybe it avoids your swipes.

432
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:56,309
It most certainly does not, but that was just so cool that people were coming up with that.

433
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,551
So it really felt like we met our goal there.

434
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,713
The other thing that happened is, you know, our ratings...

435
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:06,438
went way up with just adding that little rate it now thing.

436
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:09,161
No longer were people going to rate us to let us know

437
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:11,363
that they hated us or that it was broken.

438
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:12,924
You know, we were getting a lot of one...

439
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,667
We were sitting at about four stars previously,

440
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:17,449
and a lot of that was, you know,

441
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,871
a lot of five stars and a lot of one stars.

442
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,393
We wouldn't get many in between.

443
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,515
And all the time in the one stars, it was people telling us

444
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:24,736
about it's broken, which is great.

445
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:27,358
We need to know when it's broken and under what conditions

446
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:28,680
and what needs to be fixed about it.

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,063
But there was no one, not that many people going there to tell us that they liked it.

448
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:36,386
And it was great, we did this, and all of a sudden people were on our side.

449
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:39,349
They were there and letting us know that they liked the game.

450
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:40,950
Sometimes they do things like,

451
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,392
awesome game and give you one star.

452
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,536
Often accompanied by, this game is terrible, five stars.

453
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:51,259
Sometimes I wonder if like maybe they're confused and it's like golf.

454
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,143
So, lower score is better. Hole in one, good job guys, one star.

455
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,106
So yeah, and then this is what happened.

456
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:03,629
So the orange spike on your left there is the Zenmode update,

457
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,470
and then this is the Chaser update.

458
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,791
So you can see it dropped pretty quickly afterwards.

459
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:11,633
And our sales went way up.

460
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:13,954
You can see there it's made a really obvious,

461
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:15,916
a really dramatic difference on sales,

462
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:17,396
which was absolutely fantastic.

463
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:20,178
And I really attribute that mostly towards the ratings,

464
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,459
not so much the dragon fruit.

465
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:23,844
So that was really excellent.

466
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,804
And we also managed to address all of the bugs.

467
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,865
That really helped stabilize our star rating as well.

468
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,465
And so the people who downloaded it,

469
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,406
who got the Chaser update, who had been having problems,

470
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,147
had all their problems addressed really quickly.

471
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:36,867
So they were happy.

472
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:38,947
And then the people who weren't having problems,

473
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,328
everything was working fine, they got some extra new stuff.

474
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:42,928
They got the dragon fruit and the coconuts.

475
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,549
So they were happy as well.

476
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:47,890
So we were really happy with this.

477
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,110
We really felt like the Chasers was a good model.

478
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:56,723
It was important to make sure that we had the content side of the chaser ready to go before the previous update even landed

479
00:22:56,783 --> 00:23:02,048
So we could respond to the bugs in a timely fashion. This is a model that we've been using a fair bit

480
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:07,072
I won't cover any other kind of chaser updates because they follow the same sort of model that we even use it for jetpack

481
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:12,937
Joyride and monster dash and all of our iOS games now and also we learned that ratings matter

482
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:16,260
It's probably no great revelation there

483
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,631
So now we move on to update 1.3.

484
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,552
At this point, our player base has grown to about half a million people.

485
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:26,853
And our goal was really to make the game more sticky.

486
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:30,854
We really wanted people to spend more time playing Fruit Ninja.

487
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,256
It seemed like, you know, people loved the game.

488
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:35,496
They told us how much they liked it,

489
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,737
but they would kind of play it for about an hour or two,

490
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:39,137
and then they would burn out on it.

491
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:42,838
You know, maybe some friends would get some really competitive stuff going on,

492
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,619
and they'd be really socially driven.

493
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,100
But we certainly weren't getting people spending a huge amount of time

494
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,360
in the...

495
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,282
So to make it sticky, we figured, hey, we need some long-term goals with rewards,

496
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:56,744
which pretty much sounds like every shop system ever made in every game.

497
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,945
So we started working on that.

498
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:05,889
We already knew what we wanted people to be able to buy and unlock.

499
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,792
We already had these funky blades from when we worked on the critical waves for Zen mode,

500
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:15,355
where we could easily color the blades, add particle effects, do kinds of funky stuff with that.

501
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,416
So that was a no-brainer.

502
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,538
And again, adding backgrounds, that's a nice easy one as well.

503
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,614
It was easy pre-retina days at least.

504
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:26,456
It gets a bit trickier now with how much space it takes up on a retina display.

505
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,738
So we had that sorted quite quickly.

506
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:34,341
What we weren't sure about was whether people should be allowed to have custom backgrounds.

507
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,791
Just yesterday in my hotel I realized that I didn't have a screenshot for this background.

508
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,132
So I got on Skype and I talked to Woody, one of our programmers back in Brisbane.

509
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,792
I said, hey, can you just hack up a Fruit Ninja build

510
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:52,974
and, like, hack in some random stupid background and send me a screenshot of it?

511
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,175
This is the first screenshot he sent me.

512
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:58,416
It's like, is this one alright? I'm like, that is perfect.

513
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,250
And really what we decided was, you know,

514
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,671
we didn't want to allow people to do their own custom backgrounds

515
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:09,273
because we really felt like it kind of took away from the vibe and the feel of the game

516
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:13,074
and sort of people were obviously going to do all kinds of crazy stuff.

517
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:18,017
We had, you know, you can kind of imagine the stuff that's going to end up in Google image search.

518
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,599
And not only that, but we spent a lot of time mucking around with the backgrounds we had

519
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,360
to make sure that they, you could, the fruit was really visible on there.

520
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,981
Like there's a lot of contrast with the fruit.

521
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,682
And we often use really dark, plain backgrounds

522
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:32,703
because it provides a lot of contrast with the juice,

523
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,124
which is a really important part.

524
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:37,826
So we wanted to maintain some authorial control over that.

525
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:42,428
So then we started working on the shop.

526
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,189
And the shop was damn tricky.

527
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,210
We'd come up with this really clever novel design

528
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,071
for our menus that everything is sliceable.

529
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:54,358
and there are no shops that involve slicing a pineapple to buy things.

530
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:57,499
The thing is, people had come in and they'd bought Fruit Ninja

531
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,239
and they'd done it in the iTunes Store,

532
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,760
and that uses such a different interface convention to what we were using.

533
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,841
This was just so crazy, kind of off track,

534
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:09,742
and it was really a massive, massive challenge for us to do,

535
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:13,303
something that would intuitively rely mostly on swiping and slicing.

536
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:15,363
We really didn't want it to go into, you know,

537
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:18,164
some kind of finicky, picky, touch-based thing.

538
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:19,824
We wanted to keep it very Fruit Ninja.

539
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:25,886
So this is what we came up with. I couldn't find any work in progress from those, unfortunately.

540
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:29,527
Although, rest assured, there were plenty of terrible, horrible designs.

541
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:33,069
Maybe it's good I'm not showing you. It might be a little bit embarrassing.

542
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,450
But this is what we came up with in the end.

543
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,070
You know, we made a couple of little concessions as well.

544
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,652
We were like, okay, there might be people that are still kind of expecting it to work, like...

545
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,141
the app store. So we actually made our icons for the things that you could unlock, glossy

546
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:52,202
and rounded corners, and if you tap on them, then it would automatically scroll up to there

547
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:59,505
as well. So then, one of the really big problems we had then was, you know, we had it in there,

548
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:05,167
it was selectable, that was fine. Originally we had it that instead of the current system

549
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:09,308
where it is now, where you unlock it by completing tasks, it originally worked.

550
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:12,898
like a shop, you know, by playing you would kind of earn currency

551
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,541
and then you would spend that currency, you know, unlocking things.

552
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,965
And again it was this weird thing where, you know, we're playing it, the whole team's

553
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,507
playing it and they're like, yeah, it works, but

554
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:27,751
for some reason it just doesn't feel Fruit Ninja. We kind of had this same

555
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:28,671
problem again where

556
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:31,574
something that we expected to work and that seemed fine

557
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,677
really wasn't working for our game. It just didn't feel

558
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:37,239
quite right in there, it didn't feel like it belonged.

559
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,463
So after a lot of mucking around, we ended up coming up with this system where, you know, basically like achievements.

560
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:50,307
We spent a long time tuning it so that you would unlock them kind of in a fairly progressive manner.

561
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:55,451
Early on you would do it and if you were a really good player, you would unlock like five blades in the first game

562
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,453
and then you'd have this big drought where nothing happens.

563
00:27:57,473 --> 00:27:59,034
So we spent quite a lot of time tuning that.

564
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:04,416
And then on release, we had a really solid reception again.

565
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:05,376
We were really happy with.

566
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:07,838
The iTunes reviews instantly changed

567
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:12,580
from asking us to add multi-slice and new modes

568
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,741
and things like that to just, I want this blade,

569
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,062
I want this background, I want custom backgrounds.

570
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,903
It really dramatically changed the way

571
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,284
people were thinking about the game

572
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:21,324
and what they wanted out of it.

573
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:24,105
And we didn't have any analytics at this point,

574
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,086
but we just know anecdotally that people

575
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,787
were sticking with the game for longer.

576
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:28,968
So we were really happy.

577
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,628
We felt like we'd achieved our goal with that.

578
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,946
We also got our ratings crept up a little bit higher again,

579
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:35,606
which was great.

580
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:39,190
And this is what the release looked like.

581
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,773
So again, it's kind of similar to this Zenmode one

582
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,395
where it has a bit of a bump, and you

583
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,277
can see the sales kind of get pushed up there.

584
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:49,140
But really, it hasn't done much at all.

585
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:51,082
And again, this is a lot of work.

586
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:51,923
It kind of bummed.

587
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,005
We were hoping, again, for it to explode up there.

588
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:58,099
The good thing is, is we weren't in that downward decline like we were.

589
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,380
The updates were coming pretty thick and fast,

590
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,401
and we kept on adding a lot of value to the game,

591
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,042
and as a result, it was holding quite steady.

592
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:08,524
So, yeah, we were happy about that, but, you know, we had been hoping for more.

593
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:12,786
So, the lessons we learned was, you know,

594
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:16,028
while we were achieving our goals of, you know, making the game sticky,

595
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,209
it was really important for us to not compromise

596
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:20,390
what had made the game successful in the first place.

597
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,737
you know, we could go through and hack things up and change it around, but, you know, if

598
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:29,180
Fruit Ninja doesn't remain what Fruit Ninja is about, then that's going to be a huge disaster,

599
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,664
a huge mistake. And also, again, you know, updates are not a magical silver bullet.

600
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:36,586
So, update 1.4.

601
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,904
Our current player base is now at about one million players.

602
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:42,885
It's time to make another mode.

603
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:44,526
That worked out pretty good last time.

604
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:47,288
Zen mode got a lot of media coverage, so that was cool.

605
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,729
And we figured this time we could do another mode,

606
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:52,431
but this time it would be bigger and better and more badass

607
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:53,171
than Zen mode.

608
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:58,835
So what everyone was saying, and I mean it was pretty obvious,

609
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,556
like a lot of people were saying it in the office as well,

610
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:03,097
was power-ups, right?

611
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,459
Like, hey, let's have a mode with power-ups in it.

612
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,060
We'll make them bananas, because it's a mystery banana mode.

613
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:10,377
That seemed cool, so we started working on that.

614
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:14,500
At the time, we were kind of influenced a bit by Bejeweled Blitz,

615
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:17,423
which is ironic, because I think they were right before me in this room.

616
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,286
And we took a bit of inspiration from there, we had a 60 second time limit,

617
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:24,588
and we started adding power-ups galore.

618
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:29,792
So you can see there a screenshot of an early build that had the frenzy banana in it.

619
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:35,206
and we had the freeze banana and the score multiplier banana which is all stuff that is still in the game

620
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:41,027
but we had all kinds of crazy shit in there. We had this gravity well banana where you would slice it and it would make this black hole

621
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:47,628
and then the fruit would come up and kind of get sucked into the black hole and all just sit there so you can swipe it all at once and get like a hundred fruit combo.

622
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:58,871
We had crazy waterfalls of fruit and time traveling bananas that would rewind the game but not your score and all kinds of wacky crazy stuff.

623
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:02,352
but somehow it felt like it needed more.

624
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:07,373
So again, kind of, you know, at this point we were drawing things from

625
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:11,294
Bejeweled Blitz and taking a lot of inspiration from that, because I was just like

626
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:14,756
hopelessly addicted any time I wasn't working on Fruit Ninja, I was playing that.

627
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,977
We came up with this idea of Starfruit, when you slice Starfruit,

628
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:21,758
coins would come out, and then at the end of the game, if you had enough coins, you

629
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:22,858
could buy these power-ups.

630
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,759
So, you know, like turning off bombs and things like that.

631
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,140
So we were working away on that for a while.

632
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:32,055
And at this point we're at about six weeks worth of work,

633
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:36,176
so again, about how long it took to make the first version of Fruit Ninja,

634
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:37,016
which is kind of nuts.

635
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,617
And things are looking good, but it's just not quite popping yet.

636
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:41,937
It still needs some love.

637
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:44,318
So, you know, we're still working along on it.

638
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:48,459
And then, this happened.

639
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:52,700
We'll get to the office one day, and surprise!

640
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,820
Game Center is a thing.

641
00:31:55,134 --> 00:32:00,218
and it has all these crazy cool features like inviting friends and matchmaking and you know

642
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,580
real-time multiplayer and leaderboards and achievements.

643
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:09,804
So, we changed our mind on what we were doing.

644
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,093
And even though we had this kind of half-complete mode that was getting there,

645
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:14,974
it was starting to feel good.

646
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:16,976
We were like, right, screw that.

647
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,537
Let's put that on the back burner.

648
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:22,921
Let's be one of the first real-time multiplayer games out using Game Center.

649
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,244
Let's do that. Let's strike while the iron is hot.

650
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:26,225
Let's be those guys.

651
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:32,209
So here's a screenshot. I don't have any work in progress shots of this because

652
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,811
somehow, someway, this mode was designed in four days flat.

653
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:40,513
This is right off the back of spending six weeks on a mode and only getting

654
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,414
halfway there. Multiplayer was knocked out in about four days

655
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:47,356
and implemented in just over that as well because we were kind of implementing and

656
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:48,757
designing at the same time to

657
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,338
to really get it to market extremely quickly.

658
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:59,339
It was kind of cool because the multiplayer was so novel, it was kind of almost easier to design for.

659
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:05,062
It kept everyone's fruit on the same screen, just to kind of create that sense of connectedness,

660
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:09,884
like you're really interacting with someone else and you're kind of sharing that spatial location.

661
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:14,165
We did a lot of tricks to kind of hide how much lag there was in the system,

662
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:15,126
because it was pretty early.

663
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:20,487
And, you know, yeah, the coverage we got for that was just mental.

664
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:23,368
We got a huge amount of press for being one of the first.

665
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,609
We had really positive reviews on the mode, which was encouraging,

666
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,970
because we hadn't spent that long on it.

667
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,251
But, you know, definitely that kind of novelty factor of playing against people

668
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:34,652
and being, I'm better than you at Fruit Ninja, really, really worked.

669
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:38,933
And most importantly, we got a lot of love from Apple for doing this.

670
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:44,041
because you know as soon as they release something new they really want to promote and tell everyone

671
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:48,082
about how good it was and we were there right at the front right at the beginning when it first

672
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:53,004
launched so you know we got re-featured they did a game center category and we were right near the

673
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:58,066
top of that and a multiplayer category and we were in that and you know we got so much attention for

674
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,027
it which was fantastic.

675
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:05,030
So this one here, the very first spike on the left, that is multiplayer.

676
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,052
And the second one is when we brought in achievements and leaderboards.

677
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,875
We actually left that off the first implementation of Game Center,

678
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:14,677
just so we could hit market fast and, you know, almost first.

679
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:18,487
And then, you know, we also put in a couple of tweaks to multiplayer in there.

680
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:20,511
Again, not unlike the kind of Chaser model.

681
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,417
And you can see this had a profound long-term impact on the game.

682
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:27,442
It really did lift it up and the amount of exposure

683
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,446
just really helped Fruit Ninja immensely.

684
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:33,963
So we learned a few lessons at this point.

685
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,964
You can't plan everything.

686
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,106
This is obviously not part of the game plan, game center

687
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:39,566
coming out.

688
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,987
The mobile market is crazy, and sometimes we

689
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,887
feel like we've got to be crazy to keep up with it.

690
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:46,729
Even though we kind of dropped what we were doing,

691
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:49,290
and we did this mad dash, and it was all this kind of insane

692
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,811
scenario, we definitely feel like we made the right decision

693
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:52,511
in doing that.

694
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:55,753
And you know that top-level visibility matters when

695
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:59,715
when you're there and you're getting massive amounts of coverage across the

696
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,395
sites. That made a huge difference.

697
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:06,278
There's absolutely no doubt about it. So where were we?

698
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,800
Oh yeah, Arcade Mode. So Arcade Mode is now 1.5.

699
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,003
We now, you know, we spent quite a bit of time on the

700
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,025
supporting the multiplayer update. We're at about 2.1 million player base.

701
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:23,347
We really want to finish off arcade mode and we want to completely blow everyone away.

702
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:25,028
We're starting to feel the pressure, right?

703
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:27,630
Like, this mode, we've been teasing for a long time.

704
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:30,713
And people are starting to get a bit sketchy about, you know,

705
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,755
whether when we promise there's going to be another mode,

706
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:35,317
this banana mode, whether it was a real thing or not.

707
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,949
So at this point the mode kind of looks like this.

708
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,470
There's some interesting things you'll notice about this

709
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,791
that are different from the actual version of arcade mode

710
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:45,291
that's in there.

711
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,412
First of all, the combo blitz is there.

712
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:48,252
It's down the bottom.

713
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,593
There's actually a bar that ran along the bottom as well.

714
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,194
It told you how much blitz you had left.

715
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,214
We have frenzy text up the sides.

716
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,815
And then up the top, we have a bar

717
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,216
that shows you how much frenzy you have left as well.

718
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:02,217
And it's just not quite.

719
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,592
popping. You know, again, it's that weird, like it's, yeah, I mean, it's good, but we

720
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:11,433
really feel like it could be better. There's, it's got to, we can do better than this. And

721
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:16,915
we had, we have our sanity testers, so, this is, um, Nat, Emma and Chloe, who are all partners

722
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:18,936
of, um, you know, people working on the game.

723
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:24,528
They've always been kind of our foundation for playing it, our casual testers.

724
00:36:24,628 --> 00:36:27,289
None of them are gamers in any way, shape or form.

725
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,492
And, you know, they were really big supporters of Fruit Ninja before it had even come out

726
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,513
and, you know, through all of the updates.

727
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:36,693
And they were just not quite liking it.

728
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:40,515
Like, they were saying to us in that way where you're trying to tell, you go up to them and

729
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:41,856
say, oh, what do you think?

730
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:42,496
Do you like it?

731
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:45,677
And they're, like, trying to be polite, being like, yeah, it's pretty good.

732
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:48,659
But you could tell, you know, their heart wasn't quite in it.

733
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:49,739
They weren't really feeling it.

734
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:58,146
And we had this kind of division, right, where somehow this casual bloody game we'd made

735
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:00,987
had this hardcore fan base.

736
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:04,628
I'm sorry, that's not a really fair representation of our hardcore player base.

737
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,789
Because the hardcore players are great, right?

738
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:11,050
Like they're the ones on the forums telling everyone how great this game is and how everyone

739
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,410
should play it.

740
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,571
They're our evangelists.

741
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:17,174
At the same time we have this casual market which obviously makes up a huge amount of people

742
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:22,839
and this mode right now is satisfying the hardcore players but the casual players just aren't quite

743
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:25,961
getting it, you know. It's become too complicated.

744
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:30,305
So it's time for us to start cutting, start removing some stuff.

745
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:33,505
So we removed a fair bit of stuff.

746
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:37,627
The whole kind of shop back end and the currency system,

747
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:38,368
gone.

748
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:39,749
Got rid of all of that.

749
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,471
It was just kind of making our results screen too clunky,

750
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,272
too complicated.

751
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,393
Whenever a casual player would get to that screen,

752
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,215
you'd just see their eyes kind of glaze over.

753
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:52,537
And there's a lot of buttons and a lot of interactions

754
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:53,218
going on there.

755
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,320
The other thing we did is we started kind of stripping back

756
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,581
the amount of information that we were presenting the player

757
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,422
to make it a bit more vague.

758
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:06,748
So, like, one of the big things we did was, you know, the frenzy bar at the top, we actually

759
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,851
removed that bar and we just let it play out for about seven seconds.

760
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,794
And we weren't telling people how far they were through it.

761
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:17,519
We started relying on people to just kind of intuitively get a sense for how long these

762
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,300
things were going to last.

763
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,522
We did the same with the combo blitz as well.

764
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,326
And once we cut things...

765
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,786
there was all of a sudden it felt like this kind of new life and this,

766
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:30,626
these new opportunities before things have been complicated

767
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,607
and we kind of been missing these, these interactions we could do.

768
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:39,448
As soon as we cut these bars, we could stick like freeze and frenzy bananas together

769
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:40,748
and that was awesome.

770
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:45,349
All the fruit pouring in from the side and it's in slow-mo and it was totally badass

771
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,630
and just by stripping things back and simplifying,

772
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,530
we'd allowed all these new opportunities.

773
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,811
The other big thing we did was, you know, we made the blitzing visibility.

774
00:38:56,165 --> 00:39:02,268
really different. Before we had bars counting up, and again we were trying to do so much to explain to the player exactly how it worked.

775
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:06,911
And instead we came with this new philosophy of, let's kind of hide it from the players a bit.

776
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:10,492
Casual players might not ever get a combo blitz, and that's fine.

777
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:16,275
We don't need to have like this kind of empty bar on the side that's just sort of taunting them, telling them they're not doing very good.

778
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:18,136
If they don't ever know about it, then that's fine.

779
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:24,136
So we kind of, rather than having bars, we have these lines in the background that are kind of quite faint,

780
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:27,479
and they fade away and slow down, and that's how you know how much you have left.

781
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,164
We bring the score right up in your face because we wanted people to know the reward they were getting,

782
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,185
but not necessarily how it worked or why.

783
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:38,428
And the great thing is, is casual players now, they're just playing along, that's fine.

784
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:42,952
As they get better, as they start stringing combos together, they start to see this stuff pop up.

785
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:45,464
They're like, hmm, okay, I really want to get a better score.

786
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,665
I'm going to learn this system.

787
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:50,247
And, you know, they spend a little bit of time figuring it out,

788
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,409
and, you know, for an advanced player, it's fine.

789
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,389
They've got it understood.

790
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,691
And so by changing the visibility

791
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:58,332
and how much information we were presenting the player with,

792
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,113
it really, really improved the design.

793
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,638
And then we couldn't imagine the game without it.

794
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:07,381
At some point, we were just spending all of our time playing arcade mode.

795
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:10,964
We were taking screenshots and, like, sending it to the QA guys

796
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:12,225
and having these massive battles.

797
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:15,027
All of a sudden, the productivity on the mode started to plummet

798
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:18,110
because we spent six hours a day competing.

799
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,333
And it's kind of, that's when it struck us that that's how we knew that it was ready.

800
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:26,236
And now, whenever we add another major update to the game...

801
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,316
That's kind of our measure for whether it's ready or not.

802
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:32,277
Once it's at the point where we can't imagine it without it,

803
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,398
where we go home and I use my phone that has the store-bought

804
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:37,459
version on it, and I go straight for that mode,

805
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm like, ugh, damn, it's missing feature 1, 2, and 3

806
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,521
in the new version.

807
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:45,102
That's our metric for, OK, this thing's ready to go.

808
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:47,023
Let's get this out there and get this out to people.

809
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,804
Yeah, if we finally released it.

810
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:53,919
Yay, it took so long.

811
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,701
It took almost three times longer than to make Fruit Ninja,

812
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:57,322
which is crazy.

813
00:40:57,362 --> 00:40:59,463
So we poked a bit of fun at ourselves in the trailer.

814
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:02,865
I only noticed when I grabbed this screenshot

815
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:04,727
that the arcade mode trailer somehow

816
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,668
has five times more hits than the release trailer, which

817
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:08,369
is kind of nuts.

818
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,292
And this time, we got a really, really good reception.

819
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:15,914
Again, you can see a significant sales bump there,

820
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:20,717
and then some really good sustained, held velocity

821
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:20,897
there.

822
00:41:22,387 --> 00:41:25,730
I know now from using analytics that, so there's four modes in the game.

823
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,574
Arcade mode makes up 50% of the total time played on Fruit Ninja iOS.

824
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,617
So we learn a lot of lessons here as well.

825
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:41,181
We took a large risk by investing so heavily into this update, and it ultimately paid off

826
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:41,441
though.

827
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:44,283
We really feel like it was a better result than kind of, you know...

828
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:48,413
eking it out and putting a version out there and then iterating our way to success.

829
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,258
Which is ironic, because that's exactly what we did with the very first version of Fruit Ninja.

830
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:59,808
But player expectations were changing and, you know, the app store is just so crazy and so fast-moving that that was changing as well.

831
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:06,579
The other lesson we were learning at this point was the bigger and the more complete the game is,

832
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:12,124
the harder it is to create a substantial update that adds to the game and doesn't detract from it.

833
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:16,087
So I have a picture of the pomegranate here, I'm just going to color this quickly

834
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,988
rather than going through every single update we did.

835
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:23,967
We got to the pomegranate and that was, oh geez, maybe our 10th or 11th update total.

836
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:29,909
And our only spec really was add something to the game which will, you know, reinvigorate

837
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:30,709
it and refresh it.

838
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,870
And this took us ages.

839
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:38,271
Everything that we tried adding detracted from the game or didn't quite feel right.

840
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:40,532
Even though, you know, the pomegranate is such a simple addition.

841
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:45,048
a fruit that you can slice a couple of times and then it explodes, you know, there's not much to it.

842
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:49,990
The game felt so full and complete and, you know, had such a sense of identity,

843
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,151
it was really difficult to add anything without disrupting the balance that was already there,

844
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:57,733
because the game was, you know, feeling like such a complete package.

845
00:42:58,153 --> 00:43:02,675
All of the low-hanging fruit, sorry for the pun, was already taken at this stage.

846
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:10,427
So this is sales and updates breakdown for the life of Fruit Ninja.

847
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:14,551
So again, blue being sales, orange being updates.

848
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:17,534
The scale on the side there, I'm not sure if you can read it.

849
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,316
Maybe if you're up the front is the number of updates.

850
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:22,998
You can see the blue, there's like these two massive spikes.

851
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:23,859
That's Christmas Day, 2010, 2011.

852
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:25,200
Christmas Day is a good days.

853
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,477
And you can sort of see the spikes in the updates.

854
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:36,560
Right down the very bottom left corner,

855
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,142
there's like this tiny little orange dot,

856
00:43:39,262 --> 00:43:42,785
and that was our very first update that completely freaked us out.

857
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:47,228
And now you can see how much the stakes have been raised on every update.

858
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:50,231
So that last update right before the second Christmas,

859
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:53,173
2.4 million downloads in one day.

860
00:43:53,954 --> 00:43:57,495
And that is a lot of stress and a lot of pressure for us when we're creating these updates,

861
00:43:57,515 --> 00:44:02,157
because, you know, especially when we're QAing it and it's got to work on Retina and iPad

862
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:06,778
and all the different OSs and all the different game center cases and all that.

863
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:11,220
It's like, okay, if there's a use case in here that has like a 1% chance of crashing the game...

864
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:17,205
1% cross to cross that many users, that's going to be a lot of one-star reviews, that's

865
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:18,386
going to be a lot of complaints.

866
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:23,270
And you know, we really do our best to keep everyone happy, which drives us slightly mad

867
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,792
at times, but you know, that's just kind of our thing.

868
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,196
So this is a really interesting scenario.

869
00:44:30,637 --> 00:44:33,759
I'd be really interested to hear, like, after the talk, if anyone wants to come and have

870
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:34,660
a chat to me, I'd be really...

871
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,812
curious to hear about this, but for us we hit this problem where

872
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:42,335
we're working on it and it's been the same team

873
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:45,678
working on Fruit Ninja updates, and by same team I mean like same three guys

874
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:48,760
working on the Fruit Ninja updates for

875
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,904
I don't know, 14, 15 months now and we're just completely shattered, like we're

876
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:57,907
fully de-Fruit Ninja'd, we don't have very good ideas anymore on

877
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:01,970
you know, easy ways to make the game really good and you know, new exciting kind of

878
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,771
inspiration

879
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:04,292
and because the

880
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:09,876
market again has changed so much. There's so many platforms, so many devices, so many,

881
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:14,119
you know, trying to update it so it works with multitasking and then iCloud. And we're

882
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:18,623
really, you know, my team, we're really good at making gameplay and UIP, but engineering

883
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:22,686
side of things, eh, not so good. You know, that's really not where our strength is. And

884
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:27,430
we're putting all of our time into managing the tech. So we eventually kind of made the

885
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,253
decision that we were going to pass Fruit Ninja along to another team.

886
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:36,811
to work on. So another team to do the tech stuff and another team to come up with the content updates.

887
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:41,272
And that was a really hard decision for us. We definitely felt like Fruit Ninja was our baby.

888
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:46,753
We'd grown very attached to it, but at the same time it was clear that we were no longer the best people for the job.

889
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:49,594
Our hearts weren't quite in it anymore.

890
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:54,615
It really needed fresh blood, so we passed that along to some other teams inside the company.

891
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,115
And again, I'd be really interested to hear whether other people have

892
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:01,016
had that similar problem and how people have dealt with it.

893
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:05,095
So that kind of leads me into Jetpack Joyride.

894
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,976
Originally when I got asked to do this talk,

895
00:46:07,036 --> 00:46:09,397
they wanted me to talk about the Jetpack Joyride updates.

896
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,677
And I was like, I don't know that you're

897
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,779
going to get an hour out of me for Jetpack Joyride updates.

898
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:16,440
Because we were making Jetpack Joyride,

899
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,301
and we knew how important updates were.

900
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:18,381
But.

901
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:24,068
there were a lot of new problems. We couldn't ship Lean anymore.

902
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:28,309
The app landscape was so different in the time that Fruit Ninja had been out.

903
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,971
Not only that, but you know all the press and everyone's expecting something

904
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,751
amazing from us because you know this is the

905
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,973
the next biggest game we've released since Fruit Ninja, so the pressure was on.

906
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,775
Because of that, you know, we spent nine months in development on Jetpack Joyride

907
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:46,016
and it came in at really close to 20 meg, like 19.7 meg.

908
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:51,034
Fruit Ninja originally shipped at 9 meg, we had heaps of room.

909
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:55,200
So, you know, we were right up against that ceiling of how much stuff we could add.

910
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,884
We tried to make it easy to update and really extensible.

911
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:01,368
You know, we were like, oh cool, we'll do this vehicle system,

912
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:04,792
because then we can add new vehicles, and this level system, so we can add new levels.

913
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:12,779
missions and we really kept that in mind while we were working on it, but the pure size and scope of the game made it so difficult to update.

914
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:16,222
It's exactly like where Fruit Ninja or it, you know, had eventually gotten to.

915
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,745
The game was so full, so complete, it was really difficult to add things.

916
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:24,368
We were shit out of space to do it, to keep it in under 20 meg.

917
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,031
And we'd spent all our times fighting fires.

918
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:32,795
We had this currency system and it connected to the internet and all that and that was a huge drama.

919
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:35,797
We spent all of our time chasing down problems.

920
00:47:37,918 --> 00:47:39,900
So we actually announced an update.

921
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,901
We just announced it yesterday here at GDC,

922
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,983
called the Gadgets update for Jetpack Joyride.

923
00:47:46,023 --> 00:47:49,005
We have spent four months on this update.

924
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:53,227
And I think that really shows how different it

925
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:54,528
is to the early days.

926
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:56,909
It sounds like it was so long ago,

927
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:58,510
even though it was less than two years ago.

928
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:03,325
for managing updates. And the way that we're doing these updates

929
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:07,547
now, you know, this is a major, major release for us. We're almost treating it like another

930
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:12,111
game release. We've got trailers coming, we've got previews, press releases,

931
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:15,193
release date, all this kind of crazy stuff. So,

932
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,995
that's kind of where we're at now with our updates.

933
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:22,758
And that's what we feel like we're getting the most out of, as well as, you know, doing a lot of

934
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:26,560
minor kind of chaser updates in between, because we don't want to have

935
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,162
too long a gap between them.

936
00:48:30,185 --> 00:48:31,967
And yeah, I mean, we've got continued support.

937
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:34,248
We're still working away on other updates.

938
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:36,970
There's so many more things now that we're

939
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,752
trying to keep up with, adding languages,

940
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:39,892
adding new platforms.

941
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:45,176
We have this crazy one we just worked on recently with Mattel,

942
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:47,118
this apptivity thing where you've actually

943
00:48:47,138 --> 00:48:49,179
got a sensei that interacts with the screen,

944
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,261
and the iPad knows that it's this particular figurine

945
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,062
touching the screen.

946
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:56,104
That's all pretty crazy and really good fun

947
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:58,466
to develop for because it's just so oddball and different.

948
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:00,676
But we're still learning.

949
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:05,879
You know, the way of updating games is so complicated,

950
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:08,661
it's so specific to the game, specific to the company.

951
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:12,683
We've got a lot of answers, especially early days.

952
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,984
You know, we kind of figured things out.

953
00:49:14,004 --> 00:49:15,965
But again, it's changing so much with time.

954
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:18,066
We're constantly learning, constantly coming up

955
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:19,847
against new problems and new challenges.

956
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:23,469
We certainly don't have any hard and fast rules

957
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:24,889
that we feel like everyone should follow.

958
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:28,392
hopefully by going through some of these key updates

959
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,616
and sharing with you guys how we went about doing it

960
00:49:30,736 --> 00:49:33,221
and the successes and problems we had with it,

961
00:49:33,862 --> 00:49:34,844
you all got something out of it.

962
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:37,169
So, yeah, thank you very much.

963
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:49,285
And we actually have 10 minutes for questions.

964
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:51,147
So if anyone's got any questions, by all means,

965
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,369
please use the microphone so it comes up

966
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,972
on the recording for the GDC Vault.

967
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:59,616
Yeah, I was wondering how much worry

968
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,159
do you have about the announcement tomorrow

969
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,300
and how much that's going to factor

970
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,802
into your plans moving forward?

971
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,698
I would be really worried about it if I hadn't been in like a permanent

972
00:50:10,118 --> 00:50:13,500
stressed state about doing this talk and my talk on Thursday.

973
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,202
But yeah, I mean, you know, it's tricky and there's already

974
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:21,483
people on Touch Arcade and all that showing their games at

975
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:25,024
iPad Retina resolution without knowing for sure that's what it is.

976
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:28,486
It's hard. Maybe that'll work and maybe that'll pay off for those guys.

977
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:33,268
But, you know, we have to wait and see what happens and take it as it comes.

978
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:33,768
Right now.

979
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:37,504
we're so deep in development for a bunch of different things

980
00:50:37,524 --> 00:50:40,306
that we have on the boil that it's going to be difficult for us

981
00:50:40,346 --> 00:50:42,627
to be super reactive to that sort of thing.

982
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:43,548
But, yeah, hopefully...

983
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:46,069
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what comes.

984
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,910
It's hard to know until it happens.

985
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:49,591
Yes?

986
00:50:50,051 --> 00:50:51,112
Hi, thanks for the great talk.

987
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:55,434
I was wondering about the multi-platform endeavors from Halfbrick.

988
00:50:55,795 --> 00:51:00,557
Are you using any of the multi-platform engines for Android?

989
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,739
So the question is, how do we handle multi-platform development?

990
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:07,526
And we actually have our own in-house engine that we use,

991
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:08,546
which is called Mortar.

992
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:10,107
Bricks and Mortar?

993
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:10,847
Come on.

994
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:12,188
I think it's kind of neat.

995
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:18,230
And yeah, it's tricky.

996
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,871
I don't have that much to do with the multi-platform side

997
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:21,251
of things.

998
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,492
I'm really focused on the design side.

999
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:26,693
But yeah, it's a constant challenge,

1000
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,734
because the platforms all have their differences

1001
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,794
and their kind of quirks.

1002
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:34,216
it definitely is a big challenge and you know we're doing our best to

1003
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:37,559
keep things multi-platform but yeah it's always a challenge.

1004
00:51:53,442 --> 00:51:57,924
How has it changed your process to begin using analytics as part of your design?

1005
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:02,126
And was it heavily influential in terms of how you approached things with Jetpack Joyride?

1006
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:07,868
Yeah, we use analytics and I mostly use them because they're interesting

1007
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:10,690
rather than using them to inform my design processes.

1008
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:16,392
You know, there's like the old saying, there's lies, damn lies, and statistics.

1009
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:19,057
I'm definitely very much in that camp.

1010
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,998
I'm sure there's a lot of good uses for analytics.

1011
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:24,959
I tend to prefer to design, like, quite intuitively.

1012
00:52:25,419 --> 00:52:28,101
Sometimes we'll get some interesting insights out of analytics.

1013
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:31,142
A really excellent one that we did get was when we were

1014
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:34,623
setting the score cap on the light version of Fruit Ninja,

1015
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:37,404
having analytics there was a good way to know, like, you know,

1016
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:39,385
what is the average score people are getting,

1017
00:52:39,445 --> 00:52:41,006
where should we set that, should we set that 200?

1018
00:52:41,346 --> 00:52:43,467
No, that's too high, not enough people get there.

1019
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:49,021
But yeah, really it hasn't influenced our design that much at all.

1020
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:52,283
Sometimes it'll be a very specific problem that it's good at addressing,

1021
00:52:52,323 --> 00:52:56,285
but a lot of the times it's interesting and it can be used to inform our decisions,

1022
00:52:56,305 --> 00:53:01,409
but we don't use the analytics to really drive anything.

1023
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,721
Just with the graphs when it had the updates versus the sales,

1024
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:14,724
there seemed to be spikes about once a week for sales that would,

1025
00:53:15,284 --> 00:53:17,546
like, there'd be a big increase and then it would drop off.

1026
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:20,267
I'm just wondering, how did that occur? What was it?

1027
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:22,189
Yeah, I mean, we see that across all of our apps.

1028
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:25,251
I'm sure a lot of other app developers see it as well.

1029
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:28,132
Straight up, there's a big spike on Fridays and Saturdays,

1030
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,234
and to a lesser extent, Sundays as well.

1031
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:34,417
I guess, you know, weekends, people have got more free time, more likely to...

1032
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:39,764
to get the game so yeah it's uh... it's interesting and it's so uniform like you

1033
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:42,184
see it across all those graphs that's so pronounced

1034
00:53:46,826 --> 00:53:50,667
so you mentioned how uh... earlier version of Fruit Ninja had the store

1035
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:53,908
system with currency and what not and what's funny is that Jetpack Joyride

1036
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:54,809
incorporates that

1037
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:55,669
so

1038
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,172
pretty sure, like I don't know, me personally I find that system successful in Jetpack Joyride.

1039
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:05,555
Have you guys ever considered bringing it back in Fruit Ninja and actually having some sort of

1040
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:11,619
cross pollination like support to where currency in Fruit Ninja can affect Jetpack Joyride and

1041
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:17,382
vice versa? Basically something that can run as a scan to, you know, how many other half brick

1042
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:21,965
games that that individual has on their device at that moment. Have you guys ever, you know,

1043
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,006
came across that thought?

1044
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,160
In terms of using currency in Fruit Ninja,

1045
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:31,003
it's certainly, you know, something that we're willing to play around with and figure out.

1046
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:37,388
When we did it last time, we were unsuccessful and, you know, we didn't manage to get it right.

1047
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:40,751
That's not to say there isn't a right way to do that implementation.

1048
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,432
I just don't know what it is yet.

1049
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,954
Yeah, it definitely felt like it worked really well in Jetpack

1050
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:49,297
and Jetpack's such a different kind of beast that it just sort of felt right for it.

1051
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:52,860
In terms of cross-pollinating currency between apps...

1052
00:54:54,145 --> 00:54:59,332
I don't know, maybe. It would be cool, I mean, there's probably some pretty wild stuff you

1053
00:54:59,352 --> 00:55:01,715
could do, but it's honestly something I've never even considered before.

1054
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:03,878
Sweet, it's all yours. Run with it.

1055
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:12,432
I think you said you are a game designer, not an artist?

1056
00:55:12,772 --> 00:55:13,112
Yeah.

1057
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:14,413
And so I was wondering if you could

1058
00:55:14,453 --> 00:55:15,933
talk about the makeup of your teams,

1059
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:20,074
and just like who contributes to code,

1060
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:23,075
and who has sort of the art direction,

1061
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:24,716
and whether that influences things.

1062
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:25,656
Sure thing.

1063
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:29,157
Well, yeah, so basically the makeup of the teams is a.

1064
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:33,554
Steve, what are you doing up at the microphone?

1065
00:55:33,854 --> 00:55:37,955
So the programmer of Fruit Ninja is that guy who's standing up at the microphone just now.

1066
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:47,557
So it's pretty simple, we have a designer, an artist and a programmer who all fill those roles.

1067
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:53,618
But the thing is we're so small, like three or four guys working on it, we get a lot of cross-pollination.

1068
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:57,919
We all have a say on the art style, I had a lot of things that I was really kind of...

1069
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:05,723
really wanted to do. And you know, these guys who aren't designers often have really good design ideas and implementations and you know,

1070
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:13,568
it's a very collaborative process. And you know, that's across all of our teams at Halfbrick as well. We really encourage everyone to get stuck in and help out and

1071
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:24,294
you know, sometimes some programmer art might make it into the game if the programmer's got a bit of a gift. We have some guys that are extremely kind of multi-talented and do a bit of everything, so

1072
00:56:24,654 --> 00:56:26,475
yeah, it really depends on the team and the project.

1073
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:29,799
Steve?

1074
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,722
I was just wondering if you could talk about how you decide

1075
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:35,404
what date to release each update?

1076
00:56:37,866 --> 00:56:40,909
Because I know there are certain things that we think about when

1077
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:41,289
we do that.

1078
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,712
Yeah, I mean, in terms of setting

1079
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:46,014
the date for when we want to release the update,

1080
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:46,794
it really depends.

1081
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,157
If it's a firefighter build and we're just

1082
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,078
trying to knock out bugs, we try and make sure

1083
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:52,540
that happens as quickly as possible.

1084
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,803
If it's a major update, then we want it to kind of.

1085
00:56:56,763 --> 00:57:01,845
you know, go with the, we might want it to coincide with some other major releases or

1086
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:05,486
you may be looking for a quiet time, quiet patch to release it in.

1087
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:10,107
It really depends on the exact time and the nature of the update, but it's certainly something

1088
00:57:10,147 --> 00:57:11,668
we don't just pull the trigger willy-nilly.

1089
00:57:11,688 --> 00:57:16,509
A lot of the time we'll have updates, especially major updates, ready to go far in advance,

1090
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,450
give it a lot of time to go through our internal QA and then it'll even be ready and, you know,

1091
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:20,750
ready to...

1092
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:25,808
press the big green go button on for a little while as we set the dates and you know really

1093
00:57:25,828 --> 00:57:28,209
do it properly, do them like a proper game release.

1094
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:35,352
I'm a huge fan of Jetpack Joyride and Fruit Ninja as I'm sure many others are and so whenever

1095
00:57:35,392 --> 00:57:39,414
I played Jetpack Joyride I just was thinking about the design process that went into doing

1096
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:40,494
it because it feels like

1097
00:57:41,013 --> 00:57:45,856
three or four games melded together. You have the slot machine, all the different vehicles

1098
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:49,919
have different gameplay. Can you talk about the iterative process or whatever it was that

1099
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,900
did that?

1100
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,005
Sure. So we announced Jetpack Joyride last year at GDC and I went to a talk, because

1101
00:57:57,025 --> 00:58:00,928
it was my first GDC last year, I went to this talk and someone, I don't remember which talk

1102
00:58:00,948 --> 00:58:06,432
it was, but they were talking about this process called JSI-RSO, which stands for Jam Shit

1103
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:07,372
In and Rip Shit Out.

1104
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:09,614
And when I was hearing this talk, I'm like,

1105
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,695
oh my God, that's Jetpack Joyride.

1106
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:14,236
And that was really it.

1107
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:16,297
Like, it was really a lot of ripping things out,

1108
00:58:16,337 --> 00:58:17,178
putting things in.

1109
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,380
That's actually, like, a really good time

1110
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,681
for the last question, because I can use it to pimp my talk,

1111
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:25,622
which is all about the design process of Jetpack Joyride,

1112
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,964
which is in this room Thursday, 11.30.

1113
00:58:28,284 --> 00:58:33,387
But yeah, I mean, it was a lot of ripping things in,

1114
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:34,127
putting, you know...

1115
00:58:34,655 --> 00:58:38,600
taking things out and you know a lot of hacking and slashing design wise to get it there.

1116
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:42,925
So yeah thanks everyone for coming along and uh yeah thank you.
