1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:06,907
My name is Gil Hova.

2
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,328
I am a board game designer, and I'm

3
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:12,729
going to tell you about indirect and zero player interaction.

4
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:17,170
So before I start, I want to remind you to please fill out

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,231
the feedback forms.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,791
That's really important in deciding

7
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,332
who gets to speak next year.

8
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:22,692
So that would be really, really great

9
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,652
if you could fill that out.

10
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:27,413
Also, if we have time, we're going to have a Q&A session.

11
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:27,733
Though.

12
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:30,975
It's going to be pretty tight, so we might have to take it to a wrap-up room.

13
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:32,817
Okay, fantastic.

14
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,158
So, let me tell you a little bit about myself.

15
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,121
I have four games, three of them on the market, one on Kickstarter.

16
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,303
The Networks is one of my games about running a TV network.

17
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,084
Wordsy is another one.

18
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:48,446
Wordsy is a word game that rewards longer words.

19
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,568
High Rise is on Kickstarter right now.

20
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:51,248
Please back it.

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,792
And Bad Medicine is a party game about pharmaceutical companies making awful drugs.

22
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:03,039
I'm also co-host of the Ludology podcast with Jeff Engelstein, which is, yeah, woo!

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,524
And that's a real thrill to be on.

24
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:08,927
But I'm not here to talk about any of that.

25
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:12,591
I'm here to tell you that I am a total care bear.

26
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:18,317
when it comes to games. I don't like mean games, I don't like nasty games, except when

27
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:25,225
I do, but that gets more complicated. Overall, I really do prefer games with a little less

28
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:26,406
direct interaction.

29
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,231
I mention this because I see a lot of prototypes,

30
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,572
especially from new designers,

31
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:36,294
sometimes from people totally new to game design,

32
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:40,236
sometimes from people who are from the digital space

33
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:41,897
and this is their first tabletop game.

34
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:44,278
And their impression a lot of times

35
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,880
of what a tabletop game should be like is more like this.

36
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,819
And they put in direct interaction,

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,702
not because it's a conscious choice,

38
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,865
but more because they feel like,

39
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:57,028
well, this is a board game or a card game,

40
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,531
so you need to beat up the other players, right?

41
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,954
And that's what this talk is gonna be about.

42
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:04,638
We're gonna talk about board and card games that.

43
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,779
that don't have direct interaction,

44
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,660
what makes them work, what makes them not work,

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,921
and how they could be used as a design tool in your games.

46
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,523
So I want to start with some clarifications,

47
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:22,224
because it could be really easy for me to be misunderstood,

48
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,285
so let me get a few things out of the way.

49
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,966
First off, at no point am I going to say

50
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:29,207
that direct interaction is a bad thing.

51
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:29,807
It's not.

52
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:33,949
Direct interaction could be the perfect thing for your game.

53
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,591
It's not always bad, and a lot of times it's good and it's the right choice.

54
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:43,194
On the flip side, indirect interaction is not always the right choice for your game.

55
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,835
Sometimes you will need that direct interaction.

56
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:51,737
Clarification number three is we're going to focus mainly on competitive, multilateral,

57
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:52,997
three-plus-player games.

58
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:58,199
And because two-player games, interaction is very special.

59
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,300
Any of you who have ever worked on a two-player game, you'll know that they have a special

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,000
kind of dynamic.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,301
And we're going to focus on competitive games,

62
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,202
because cooperative games, it's a lot more subtle

63
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,542
how interaction works in those.

64
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,264
And lastly, we're really here to expand your designer toolbox

65
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,365
and to open up the kinds of games

66
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:20,106
that you can make so that you're not always

67
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:25,068
doing the heavy metal, fry, vocal, scream all the time.

68
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:30,270
How many of you attended Cole Worley's talk earlier today

69
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,132
about king making?

70
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,093
That was a fantastic talk.

71
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,275
This talk is not here to contradict his talk.

72
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,756
I think it's gonna compliment his talk

73
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,657
because I think we're looking at the same thing

74
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:42,538
from different angles.

75
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,399
It's sort of the difference between a comedy

76
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,660
and a drama in a lot of ways.

77
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,761
So what is interaction?

78
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,883
Interaction is, to me, the ability to affect

79
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,444
another player's game state.

80
00:03:54,407 --> 00:04:00,230
So, when Cole talks about kingmaking in his games, he's talking about actually being able

81
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,312
to affect one player being able to affect a bunch of other game states to the point

82
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:08,414
that one player can decide the winner of the game, and that winner would not be them.

83
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:12,636
That allows the politics of the game, the politics of the real world, and the politics

84
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:15,757
of the group to start to seep through into the magic circle.

85
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:18,459
he talked about how that can actually enhance a game.

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,642
And if you didn't see that talk, look it up in the vault.

87
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,562
It's really, really good.

88
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:28,806
Whereas for me, the interaction that we're gonna talk about

89
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:32,028
is still affecting another player's game state,

90
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:35,210
but we're gonna talk about how it works

91
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,072
even when it's limited or positive

92
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:39,413
or not even there at all.

93
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,955
So I think we're going to start with this graph over here.

94
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:45,316
This graph is going to help me visualize,

95
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,578
help us visualize what I'm talking about here.

96
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:51,000
So we've got an x-axis, which has less interaction

97
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,020
and more interaction.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,882
And then we've got a y-axis, which

99
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:58,364
is positive interaction and negative interaction in games.

100
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:00,485
So let's look at some sample games here.

101
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:01,866
We're going to start with Mealborn.

102
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:05,787
The classic Take That game, this is actually

103
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,048
the first Take That game out there.

104
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,908
You can play a card on someone,

105
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:12,789
because you're all racing cars,

106
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,069
it's like a distance race.

107
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:17,470
So you can play cards to show how far you race,

108
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,151
but then you can play cards on other people

109
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,831
to tell them you can't go faster than this.

110
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,992
So there's a lot of meanness in the game,

111
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,733
there's a lot of, as we say, Take That,

112
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,633
a lot of direct negative interaction.

113
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,274
And again, there's no criticism there,

114
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:31,114
that's what the game is.

115
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,735
It's been around for decades.

116
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,818
It's an incredibly successful game that people adore.

117
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:39,301
So direct interaction and negative interaction

118
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,002
is absolutely a feature of the game.

119
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:45,205
But let's talk about positive interaction, even

120
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:47,607
positive direct interaction, because you may not

121
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:48,688
visualize that.

122
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,109
So let's talk about Bonanza.

123
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,951
Bonanza, to me, is the prototypical trading game.

124
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,032
So this is a card game where you're trading,

125
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,573
and the things you're trading are beans.

126
00:05:58,193 --> 00:05:59,854
And if you're a little skeptical about that,

127
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,035
know that it was designed by Uwe Rosenberg,

128
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,057
who also designed games like Agricola and Feast for Odin.

129
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,718
This was a much earlier game of his.

130
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,199
And it is an absolutely phenomenal game.

131
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,180
Bonanza is just a gem,

132
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,161
even though it is about trading beans.

133
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:14,782
So it could be hard to get to the table,

134
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:16,903
but once you get it to the table, man, it's fantastic.

135
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:19,625
But let's talk about the positive player interaction,

136
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,266
because you are trading beans.

137
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:25,009
You get a hand of cards, and the interesting thing

138
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:27,931
about Bonanza is your hand is actually a cue.

139
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,593
You're not allowed to rearrange your hand.

140
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:34,516
So you must plant the front card of your hand

141
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:35,717
into one of your two.

142
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,065
bean fields in front of you.

143
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:42,306
And if you have two bean fields and a totally different bean to plant into it,

144
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:44,827
you've got to choose one of your bean fields to harvest.

145
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:48,928
And bean fields will only give you points if you have X number of cards to harvest.

146
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,870
And if you don't, well, too bad. You pretty much lose that bean field.

147
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,411
So there are times when you've got a card in front of the card you want to plant

148
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,751
and you've got to get rid of it.

149
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:00,993
How do you do that? By trading it to another player, by offering it to other players.

150
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:05,254
and when it's another player's turn, trying to get rid of it before it comes around to your turn.

151
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:11,636
So a trade in this game is very positive for you and a lot of times very positive for the other player.

152
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:16,778
In fact, there are times when you just want to give away your bean,

153
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,499
not even get anything in return, because what you're getting in return is the opportunity to plant your next bean.

154
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,042
So, to me, this is a great example of positive player interaction.

155
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:30,306
It's direct interaction, but you're saying, you, this other player, and me, you know,

156
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,989
we're going to each improve our game states and try to get each of us closer to winning

157
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,210
relative to the other players.

158
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,472
So I think there's a...

159
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,574
This is a great example of positive interaction, even though it's direct.

160
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:45,337
So let's talk a little bit about indirect interaction.

161
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,179
I'm going to bring up Seven Wonders.

162
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,421
This is another absolutely wonderful game.

163
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,122
This is a card drafting game.

164
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,984
where the players are all simultaneously picking cards,

165
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,466
putting the card they're chosen in front of them,

166
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:57,807
and getting the effect,

167
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,988
and then passing their entire hand to the left,

168
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:03,551
and obviously getting the hand from the player to the right,

169
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:05,492
and then choosing a card from there.

170
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:09,115
So everybody is choosing a card one at a time.

171
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:12,838
and playing it, but you never actually play a card on anyone else.

172
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:15,360
Your cards pretty much only affect yourself.

173
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:20,305
So Seven Wonders doesn't really have a great deal of negative interaction.

174
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:25,449
There's a tiny, tiny, tiny bit in that if you know the player to your left or the player

175
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,011
to your right if you're passing in that direction.

176
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,452
If you know they're working for a certain kind of card,

177
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:30,613
you can choose it.

178
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,275
And there's ways to bury cards in the game

179
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,476
to make sure they never see them.

180
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,118
So there's a little bit of interaction,

181
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,859
but it's not that pronounced.

182
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,301
And there's quote, unquote, military in the game, which

183
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:44,223
is pretty much just if you reach a certain number of points

184
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,905
and you're higher than your opponents, you get a bonus.

185
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,706
And that's pretty much that.

186
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:53,249
It's not really military as we would expect it mechanically

187
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,690
in a game.

188
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,111
So again, very much a Care Bear game.

189
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,053
very indirect interaction.

190
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:02,017
But there's all this space to the left,

191
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,399
and what could be there?

192
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,501
I mean, could there be anything past this?

193
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:08,904
Is there anything in this little singularity on the side?

194
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:12,527
So, can we have a game with zero interaction?

195
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,088
And we can.

196
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,131
I'm gonna use Take It Easy as an example,

197
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,113
and I love showing this game to students,

198
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,456
because a lot of these students have

199
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:25,881
not actually seen games with zero interaction.

200
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,824
And it's kind of surprising to them.

201
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:31,309
They kind of assume that you have to have some sort of interaction

202
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:32,630
with another player's game state.

203
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,132
So take it easy.

204
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,616
You've got a board in front of you with a bunch of hexes,

205
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,558
and you've got a bunch of hex tiles.

206
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,041
one player is going to shuffle their tiles

207
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,342
and choose one randomly

208
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:45,842
and announce what numbers are on the tile

209
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:48,584
and everybody else chooses exactly that tile

210
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:51,705
because everybody has exactly the same mix of tiles.

211
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,406
And then everybody places that tile somewhere on their board.

212
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:57,447
And then that first player draws another random tile,

213
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,548
shouts out the number, very bingo-esque,

214
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,328
and everybody else grabs that tile

215
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,649
and puts it on their board.

216
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:05,570
And it's very quick in the game

217
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,291
that everybody has their own setup.

218
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:07,891
Everybody has...

219
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,092
place their tiles in their own pattern.

220
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,355
And if you arrange the tiles in a certain way, you can get a ton of points.

221
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,417
But at no point are you interacting with the other players.

222
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:22,580
You are all playing simultaneously and in your own little worlds.

223
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,822
So when I place a tile, I cannot affect anybody else.

224
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:28,884
And then once everybody fills up their boards...

225
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:30,726
the game is over and you score.

226
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,749
There is zero interaction with anyone.

227
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:36,133
And with this, it's very much a feature and not at all a bug.

228
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,896
Like, this game works beautifully because of it.

229
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:40,638
And because of that, there are things

230
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:44,642
that you can do with this game that you can't do with others.

231
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,424
Like, for example, there are conventions.

232
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:50,589
that tell attendees, okay, everybody, if you have a copy of Take It Easy, bring it,

233
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,873
because we're going to have a hundred-player game of Take It Easy.

234
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,176
We're going to put as many people in a room as possible.

235
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,399
We're all going to play exactly the same game.

236
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,101
So one player is going to read out the numbers,

237
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,923
and everybody's going to play along.

238
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,788
And you can't do that in a game that has player interaction.

239
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,529
And that totally fascinates me.

240
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,312
Now, I show this as an example of a game with zero interaction.

241
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:15,614
And there's a bunch of other games that have similar mechanisms.

242
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,095
If you've heard of the whole roll and write movement,

243
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:21,757
a lot of these games have zero or very, very indirect interaction.

244
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,260
And again, there's things you can do in those styles of games

245
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,380
that you can't do in others.

246
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:30,654
Like, for example, I just read about a friend of mine who had a birthday party.

247
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,955
So they got out nine roll-and-write games and they played them all simultaneously off

248
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,576
of the same roll of the dice, which is a little mind-melting.

249
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:43,997
But again, it's something you can do when you have games with very low player interaction.

250
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:51,118
So this shows just the doors you can start to unlock when you have low interaction.

251
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,443
And I'm going to throw in a couple more examples.

252
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:59,065
Catan is a game that has a bunch of interaction levels.

253
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,707
I mean, you've got positive interaction

254
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,667
because you've got trading.

255
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,269
You've got some negative interaction

256
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,670
with a robber depriving people of goods.

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,351
And you've got that really, really mean monopoly card,

258
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,693
which you can absolutely hose another player with.

259
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:16,034
So I gave it a pretty big range on this board.

260
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,916
it trends mostly positive for this game.

261
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,156
And then we have Munchkin.

262
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,317
Munchkin is a game that gives you the opportunity

263
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:27,417
to trade with players and negotiate with players.

264
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,658
So there is some positive interaction,

265
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,299
but at some point the interaction starts getting

266
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,519
really negative really fast.

267
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,820
And again, negative not being a downside to the game.

268
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,561
That's what the game lives and breathes on.

269
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,501
It really breathes off that backstabbing and betrayal.

270
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:47,423
So I have friends in the game designers in North Carolina,

271
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,324
and they came up with an amazing model

272
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:50,525
that I really, really like.

273
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,426
And they call it decision scales.

274
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:56,468
So they've identified these three decision scales,

275
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,248
personal, global, and adjacent.

276
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,869
And I think they really help when

277
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,051
it comes to understanding exactly what interaction is

278
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,232
and how a move can affect another player.

279
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,914
So prepare to be wowed by my amazing graphic design skills.

280
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,415
So let's say you've got a fictional three-player game.

281
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,323
and I want to get $5.

282
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:19,325
So I play red, so obviously I'm all the way on the side

283
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:19,925
with the red there.

284
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,026
So here's three ways that the game could let me get $3.

285
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,347
So one way is maybe there's an action

286
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,128
where I just take $3 from the bank.

287
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:31,149
Now, assuming that the bank never run out of money,

288
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,870
this is totally personal scale.

289
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,331
So I take the five bucks, I put it in front of me,

290
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,452
and now I've got five bucks,

291
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:40,033
but I haven't affected the other player's game states one bit.

292
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,955
Of course, there may be implications to my move,

293
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,537
maybe down the line that $5 will let me do something

294
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:46,858
that does affect the other players,

295
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,601
but for the purposes of this description,

296
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,784
we're just gonna look at the immediate effects of the $5.

297
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:56,187
So that's personal scale.

298
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,829
Now, perhaps there's the space in the middle of the board

299
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,831
that says I can move my pawn

300
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,532
and take $5 from the bank that way.

301
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,874
And if I do that, the other players can't take $5.

302
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:10,618
That's global scale, because I've just affected the game

303
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:11,559
state for everyone.

304
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,620
So not only have I taken $5, I've

305
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,363
deprived the other players equally of the opportunity

306
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:17,623
to take $5.

307
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:21,126
And again, this may affect different players

308
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:21,846
different ways.

309
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:25,129
But overall, the effect is a global effect.

310
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:27,916
And the third one is adjacent.

311
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,877
Maybe there's a way that I can take $5 directly

312
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:31,677
from someone else.

313
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,319
So in this case, I have done just that,

314
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,440
and the poor yellow player is down $5.

315
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,301
I am up $5, and blue is completely unaffected.

316
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,603
So again, you're going to see that this is either

317
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,765
the trading or the take that model that we've

318
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:47,745
seen in other games.

319
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:55,829
So speaking of those other games, we can run through them again with this personal, global,

320
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:01,372
and adjacent model that we have, with Mealborn having a mix of personal adjacent scale, but

321
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,693
very little global scale.

322
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,434
Either you're improving yourself or you're hurting one specific player.

323
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:16,058
Bonanza, on the other hand, is similar, but you're either helping yourself or helping

324
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,259
one particular player.

325
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:22,680
Seven Wonders is almost completely personal with just a hint of adjacent scale.

326
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,161
Take it easy.

327
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,322
Completely personal again, because you're working off your boards.

328
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,410
And then when you get to Catan and Munchkin,

329
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,551
you've got a mix.

330
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,052
Catan has the global dice rolls with adjacent trading

331
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,852
with a little bit of personal state, but not much.

332
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,393
You have some cards you have in hand.

333
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:44,333
And Munchkin, you have a global opportunity

334
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:47,394
to negotiate, which winds up with adjacent trading.

335
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,655
And again, very little in that is personal.

336
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:53,776
So I find this model really, really useful to work with,

337
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,936
because I find that there are real implications to these game

338
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,717
states, like games.

339
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,598
that have a lot of personal state

340
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,881
tend to scale really, really well via player counts.

341
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,263
So that's why you see games like Seven Wonders

342
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:08,644
saying they can scale from two to seven players

343
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,146
because it has so much personal scale.

344
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:14,028
Whereas you see other games that say

345
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,430
this really only works with four players

346
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,712
because it's got such a specific balance of scales

347
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:21,013
between adjacent and global.

348
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,014
A lot of times a game with global scale

349
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,797
It accounts for the specific chaos of a certain player count.

350
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,879
If you don't get that chaos, the game does start to suffer.

351
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:34,242
So I find the scale model really, really helps me.

352
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:39,766
So knowing all this now, when do we go indirect?

353
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:40,946
When's a good time to go...

354
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,867
to indirect interaction?

355
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,268
Well, a lot of it depends on your theme.

356
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:48,389
I think your game should do what it says on your tin,

357
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,332
and I think you set yourself up for some unintended dissonance

358
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,793
if you have theme and mechanisms that don't match up.

359
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,834
Like, for example, if you have a game about, say, koi ponds,

360
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:01,235
or

361
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,357
cake baking or farming and your game is all about

362
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,459
blowing the other players up, there's a dissonance there.

363
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,700
And I'm not saying that dissonance is necessarily bad.

364
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,061
If you're conscious of it, you can play off it.

365
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,342
It can be a feature of the game.

366
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:16,063
But if you're not conscious of it,

367
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:18,945
if you're just sort of arbitrarily mashing the two together,

368
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,526
you're gonna get players who are gonna be very confused

369
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:22,867
over the first couple of rounds.

370
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,269
I speak from personal experience here

371
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,410
that it can be a really awkward thing.

372
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,114
On the other hand, if your game promises some sort of direct interaction,

373
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:38,358
perhaps it's got pirates or zombies or soldiers or,

374
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:39,839
what do I have here, dragons,

375
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:43,322
a lot of those do imply conflict and fighting,

376
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:46,384
and if the game winds up being a dry auction game,

377
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,186
you wind up with a little bit of dissonance again.

378
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,408
You wind up promising something

379
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:54,150
and giving the players a different experience.

380
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:57,033
There's a Kinezia game called Zombiegeddon.

381
00:17:57,513 --> 00:18:01,334
that's a reskin of a game that was about hunters and gatherers.

382
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:06,556
And it's a very strange experience because it's supposedly about zombies,

383
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,876
but it plays like this very dry kinesia game.

384
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:13,458
And to me, it's one of my hallmark examples

385
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:17,199
of some unintended ludonarrative dissonance.

386
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,020
So I'd say in terms of indirect interaction,

387
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,720
listen for your game, be the game whisperer,

388
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,181
and look for the kind of game that your theme is calling for.

389
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,482
Also, if your game has very indirect

390
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,642
or zero player interaction, keep an eye on the clock

391
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:37,723
because a lot of times your game state

392
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,763
is going to be very, very small,

393
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,004
especially with a lot of roll and writes.

394
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,604
They work because they're 20 minutes,

395
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,564
but if you wind up with...

396
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:47,145
say, a 90-minute or a two-hour roll and write,

397
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:49,326
you can get players going a little stir-crazy

398
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:50,587
because of that.

399
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:54,228
So player interaction is really, really good

400
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:57,270
at providing really surprising changes to the game state.

401
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,672
So if your game is a little long, the longer it is,

402
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,432
the more likely you're gonna want

403
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:05,073
some form of interaction in there.

404
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:09,175
I think this is where we want to bring out some Stefan Feld games,

405
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,175
because I think he's a fascinating example.

406
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:15,296
A lot of his games have very personal game scales,

407
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,177
and most of the game is extremely personal.

408
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:19,778
Looking at games like, for example, Notre Dame

409
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:23,079
is a great example of a game that is, again,

410
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,719
almost completely personal scale,

411
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,220
with very little you can do to affect the opponents.

412
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,661
But the reason he can extend the game over an hour

413
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,962
is because the game is very mean to you.

414
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:36,615
and the game can do all sorts of nasty things towards you.

415
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,417
And that's a hallmark with a lot of his games,

416
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:42,779
is that while the players don't directly interact with one another,

417
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,320
the game certainly gets up in your face.

418
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,683
And I think the reason his games get away with that

419
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:52,485
is because you don't have the players interfering with it.

420
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,327
There are some games that have players interfering with each other

421
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,968
and the game interfering with each other.

422
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,869
but it's very hard to pull that off.

423
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,130
Only Splatter, I've seen, can really get away

424
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,130
with stuff like that, with a game like Antiquity,

425
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,871
for example, is a game where the game is very mean to you

426
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,291
and the players are very mean to you,

427
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,892
but that's a game that has a very niche appeal

428
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:18,513
and it's not exactly gonna be a mainstream game.

429
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,574
So it's something you're gonna have to watch out for.

430
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:22,914
If your game has a lot of direct interaction

431
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,674
and the game is out to get you as well,

432
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,775
that can wind up being a little bit cruel.

433
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,543
And how important is planning in your game also?

434
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,265
That's another consideration.

435
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,569
If you wind up with a game where...

436
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:43,277
the real meaning of the game is that you're planning

437
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:45,458
over the course of several rounds,

438
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,241
and then somebody just gets in with some adjacent scale

439
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:49,402
and blows up your plans,

440
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:54,045
that can wind up being frustrating and not in a good way.

441
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:55,086
And it depends.

442
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:57,808
If you've heard Cole's talk,

443
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,270
he talked about some examples

444
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,951
where you could get away with it,

445
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,513
like how High Frontier can get away with it, for example.

446
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,076
But a lot of times this can be bungled,

447
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,517
and it's very, very easy.

448
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,530
to do that, to have a game that on one hand

449
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,530
incentivizes planning, and on the other hand,

450
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,331
incentivizes players to mess up each other's plans.

451
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:17,931
So what's the incentive?

452
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,231
Like what's the game experience?

453
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:20,772
What are you trying to get us to do?

454
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,532
Because if the fun is in the planning, then let us plan.

455
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:25,093
And don't mess with our planning.

456
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:28,194
So the more planning is in your game,

457
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,554
the more likely that indirect interaction

458
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:31,894
may be the way you want to go.

459
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,375
Again, this is not an absolute rule.

460
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,055
There are going to be tons of exceptions.

461
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:38,136
But it really all depends.

462
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:44,020
So I think another good thing to look at is psychographic profiles,

463
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:48,324
because this comes down to what kind of players are out there.

464
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:50,666
Like, what do people actually want in games?

465
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:53,609
Because players aren't monolithic.

466
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:58,153
There's not this one single scale of this is fun, this is not fun.

467
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:00,915
I'm sure as game designers you've all found games,

468
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,679
some players that do not enjoy the games that you find incredibly fun.

469
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,444
So this is a psychographic profile that the folks at Magic, especially Mark Rosewater,

470
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:14,048
the lead designer over at Magic, have put together.

471
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,452
And there's a ton of psychographic models in addition to this.

472
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:20,775
Quantric Foundry has an amazing model.

473
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:26,060
My friend Chip Beauvais has a very sophisticated model with six personalities.

474
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,362
But magic has boiled it down to these three personalities.

475
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:33,745
There's one named Timmy or Tammy, who wants to experience something.

476
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:37,247
There's one named Johnny or Jenny, who wants to express something.

477
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:40,149
There's one named Spike, who wants to prove something.

478
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:43,831
And those are the three basic archetypes that they found.

479
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,813
And over time, they've refined this model.

480
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:50,715
They look at hybrids like a Tammy and Jenny hybrid, for example.

481
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:56,619
They have some extra models, like they have a couple of new ones like Vorthos and Mel

482
00:22:57,219 --> 00:23:03,603
who are more into the mechanisms of how the game works or the socializing around the magic

483
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,003
circle.

484
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:10,307
But I think studying why people play games will give you a better understanding of whether

485
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,368
indirect action.

486
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:14,188
indirect interaction is really good for your game.

487
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:17,849
Because that way, if you understand that playtester X,

488
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:22,190
well, this playtester X is totally a Tammy over here.

489
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,891
And they really want an experience over here.

490
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,572
But you want a game that's more about mastery than experience?

491
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,992
Well, now you know how to filter their feedback.

492
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,793
Not to say that you should ignore their feedback.

493
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,594
but you know where it's coming from.

494
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,335
And a lot of times it's so much easier

495
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:41,816
to process playtest feedback with that.

496
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:45,979
So in terms of indirect interaction,

497
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,600
knowing why people are playing is so important.

498
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,561
Because ultimately, it comes down to this.

499
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,463
There's a big button that your game offers.

500
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:55,044
that just has meaning.

501
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,305
And for a lot of us, that meaning is fun.

502
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,906
But it doesn't always have to be fun.

503
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:03,528
The meaning button, when you hit it, could release anger.

504
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,969
It could release exhilaration.

505
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:08,090
It could release frustration.

506
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:13,732
It could release a whole dizzying set of emotions, from laughter to pure, seething rage.

507
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:16,733
But no matter what, there's some sort of meaning

508
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:20,073
that your game has to deliver in order for your players

509
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:22,094
to find the game valuable and interesting.

510
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:26,415
Indirect interaction to me is one way that I find

511
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,495
I can best get meaning out of my games,

512
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,756
both the games that I enjoy playing

513
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,136
and games that I design.

514
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:36,177
Now, if it turns out that the meaning button for you

515
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:38,437
is gonna be something that you're gonna need

516
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:40,417
direct interaction for, by all means,

517
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:42,658
put that meaning button in and let players.

518
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:46,509
hit it by attacking each other, that's totally fine also.

519
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:52,932
But knowing how and what your meaning button delivers, I think, is very, very important.

520
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:58,175
Ultimately comes down to what kind of game are you making and who are you making it for.

521
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:01,416
And that's pretty much everything I'm here to talk about.

522
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:05,318
If there's any questions, we have a few minutes for questions.

523
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,125
Please line up to the microphone right over there.

524
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,636
And tell me your name and where you're from.

525
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,699
I'm gonna steal that from Cole.

526
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,611
Thanks for your great talk. My name is Ira Fay. I teach game design at Hampshire College.

527
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:31,272
Great. I appreciated your model or your friend's model on personal, adjacent, and global scale.

528
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:38,134
I was curious to hear you say that Seven Wonders and Notre Dame, which have a drafting mechanic,

529
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:42,535
is only personal. So I'm wondering if you could speak more about drafting mechanics and how that

530
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:50,443
Yes, so the question is, Notre Dame and Seven Wonders, which have drafting mechanisms, and

531
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:52,626
do they really have a personal scale?

532
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:56,550
Well, the focus of the game I think is the personal scale, but there's absolutely an

533
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,972
adjacent scale in the drafting.

534
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:01,693
But it's not as impactful, in my opinion.

535
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,554
The drafting mechanism is important,

536
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:07,334
but there's only so much you can do to hose the other player.

537
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:09,295
Like, for example, in Seven Wonders,

538
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:11,435
if the player to your left is collecting science,

539
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:13,516
and you get two science cards in your hand,

540
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,056
there's not a lot you can do.

541
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,536
You can't get rid of two science cards,

542
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:18,697
you can only get rid of one.

543
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,717
So it doesn't give you as much freedom

544
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,878
to really mess with the other player's game states.

545
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:26,518
So that's why I really look at it as mainly personal,

546
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,321
But obviously, this is not something that is absolute.

547
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:32,164
It's not like a game can only have personal scale or only

548
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,806
adjacent scale, et cetera.

549
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:35,047
So it's a mix.

550
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,989
But to me, the dominant feature of the game

551
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,930
is the personal scale.

552
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:38,791
Thanks.

553
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:39,272
Thank you.

554
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:43,457
You knew I was going to ask a question.

555
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:44,417
Yeah, please do.

556
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:48,679
So as I listened to your talk, there

557
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,821
is this weird point of communion between our two talks, which

558
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:56,462
is you want to be clear with prospective players

559
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:57,442
about what they're going to get.

560
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:00,763
And that seems like such a simple thing,

561
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:02,744
but as I was listening to your talk,

562
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:03,785
I was sort of wondering.

563
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,188
how we actually do that communication.

564
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,910
Because if you think about the critical discourse

565
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,972
around games, like a game is brilliant,

566
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,734
or it's not brilliant, or it's really good,

567
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:14,716
or it's not good, it's an eight or a 10.

568
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,438
And that doesn't really speak to any of the things

569
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:19,040
that actually really matter when it comes to

570
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,203
whether or not a person is going to like a game.

571
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,046
And so, you know, as someone who has...

572
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:28,901
brought games to market and knows that song and dance.

573
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,045
Like, what are the ways that you go about communicating

574
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,228
what you're offering to your players?

575
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:36,653
And are there things that you try to avoid for that reason

576
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:38,375
so that they don't get the wrong idea

577
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,537
about the game that you're offering them?

578
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,244
So Cole's question is, what do I do as a designer and publisher

579
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,686
to communicate the possible experience,

580
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,168
the potential experience for players?

581
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:52,571
And how can I best address it?

582
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,874
And this is so important for publishers, I think.

583
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:57,256
And there's a bunch of ways you can do this.

584
00:27:58,057 --> 00:28:00,160
Obviously, the artistic style is the first thing.

585
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:06,647
I've seen games that are about, they have art that's very kid-friendly and the game

586
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,989
turns out to be a two-hour resource management game.

587
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,854
And to me, that's an example of unintended dissonance.

588
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,817
I certainly fell into the trap myself once.

589
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:20,784
my game Battle Merchants was originally about fighting robots,

590
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,108
about building and selling fighting robots.

591
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:25,852
You see I did it right there, because I would go to people and say,

592
00:28:25,892 --> 00:28:28,556
hey, do you want to play my game about building and selling fighting robots?

593
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:31,140
And they would say, sure, I'll play your game about fighting robots.

594
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,342
And you see there's a difference there.

595
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,254
It's a little difference in expectation.

596
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,916
And they would enjoy the game by the second round,

597
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,757
but that first round was all dissonance.

598
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:39,918
That's not what I expected.

599
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:43,900
So art, theme, just understanding.

600
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,381
A lot of this is socialized.

601
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,763
It's not like it's an absolute thing.

602
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:50,745
At some point, we have come to understand

603
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:53,846
that when we see this very light medieval fantasy theme,

604
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:56,789
We know that there's gonna be like castle building

605
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:58,851
and cubes and pigs and that sort of thing,

606
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:04,576
and brick and some weird ingenious German mechanism

607
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:08,219
that will somehow convert resources into VP.

608
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,301
And we're okay with that, you know?

609
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:13,724
And I think while there's a lot of room to innovate,

610
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:18,007
if you innovate too much or if you're unaware

611
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,150
of this sort of metalanguage that's kind of been built up,

612
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,012
you really do risk this dissonance that can wind up sinking a game.

613
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:30,193
It's 4.19, so I can't talk about Monkeys on the Moon, which I'd love to do,

614
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:35,174
but I think we should go and take it to the wrap-up room at this point.

615
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,895
I'd love to talk more about this subject. I could talk about it all day.

616
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:40,836
Thank you, everybody, who came over. This was a lot of fun.
