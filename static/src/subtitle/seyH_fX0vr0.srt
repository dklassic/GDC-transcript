1
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:05,712
I'm gonna have you all here.

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:07,614
So I'm gonna go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,177
This is what cats can teach you

4
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,878
about empathic game design.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,780
I know, it's a weird title, it's also great.

6
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:17,362
My name is Willem.

7
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:19,524
I am the founder and CEO of a little company

8
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:20,284
called Mew and Me.

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,706
Basically we make video games for cats.

10
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:24,908
I'm gonna get more into that in a second.

11
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:26,829
Let's get started with the talk first.

12
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:29,604
I'm gonna start with a moment that I think

13
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,705
all of you are familiar with,

14
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:31,966
and I wanna do a little exercise here.

15
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,667
I want you to, I'm gonna read this story,

16
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,288
and then once I finish reading it,

17
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,809
I want you to raise your hand

18
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,650
if you've had a moment like this, okay?

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,671
And participate, come on, it's more fun that way.

20
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,653
Here we go, so this is from The Art of Game Design.

21
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:44,753
It's a good book if you haven't read it.

22
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,275
There was once a racing game

23
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,296
that was about halfway through development

24
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:51,297
when the client came in for a review.

25
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:54,199
After toying with the prototype for a few minutes,

26
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,560
he looked at the team and said,

27
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,317
These cars need more chrome.

28
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:01,340
The lead engineer was panicked.

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,201
The performance was tough as it was,

30
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,083
and adding shiny chrome meant more drain

31
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:06,664
on an already overworked CPU.

32
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,507
He could have said yes, and he could have said no,

33
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:12,950
but instead he said the only wise thing, why?

34
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,492
Why do the cars need more chrome?

35
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:17,794
And what the client said was surprising.

36
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:20,627
Well, as I was playing, I kind of felt like the cars

37
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,108
weren't as fast as they should be.

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,649
I know changing the car speeds would probably be

39
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,749
a lot of work for you guys.

40
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,451
So I was thinking that if you just put more Chrome

41
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,652
on the cars, well, it would make them look faster.

42
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,393
Okay, do this with me.

43
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,094
How many people have had a moment like this?

44
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:37,375
Right, everyone, okay.

45
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:39,936
So communication with the client,

46
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:40,936
communication with the user,

47
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:43,418
communication in your team is difficult

48
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:44,798
and fails a lot of the time.

49
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,151
I'm just going to get straight to the point,

50
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,094
because I can be a very blunt person.

51
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:52,178
My thesis for this talk is basically

52
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,880
that relying on that verbal communication

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,462
is making you a worse game designer.

54
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,805
That there are so many moments where

55
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,028
unless you're digging deeper and actually getting

56
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:01,330
to the bottom of what somebody is saying,

57
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,893
you're going to miss out and design something worse.

58
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,222
All right, so to give you some context,

59
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:09,143
this is Mew and Me.

60
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,884
This is a little company that I started back in 2017.

61
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,425
As all the best companies go,

62
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,306
it was started just as a fun side hobby.

63
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,627
You'll be seeing a lot of my cat Fez.

64
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,308
He's my first indoor cat.

65
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,610
And my first cat who was a single cat, no buddies.

66
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,891
So I felt guilty.

67
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:24,851
I made him some games.

68
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:25,892
People thought it was cool.

69
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,132
It got more serious.

70
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,568
to tell you about the product

71
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,950
so that this talk makes a little more sense.

72
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,752
These are automatic games for tablets

73
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:37,993
that you leave on for your animal while you're out of the house,

74
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:39,374
vacation or work or whatever.

75
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,996
These games automatically cycle throughout the day.

76
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,116
You just leave it running.

77
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,898
And they're experimenting and learning about your cat while they do so.

78
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,460
They're tracking that data and showing you that data,

79
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,962
giving you that connection to your animal that you wouldn't have had before.

80
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,804
So, this is our first prototype.

81
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,477
It is Cocos-based, if you know what Cocos is.

82
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,359
So that means it runs on web.

83
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,260
So you're opening up a website to open this up.

84
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:08,144
It is entirely designed because we had some people

85
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:09,385
who were watching YouTube videos,

86
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,527
putting on YouTube videos of birds and stuff like that.

87
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,909
And so I was like, okay, I'll fill that hole, right?

88
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:15,570
So take a second here.

89
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,232
Do you think that this worked?

90
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,754
You don't need to say it, just think.

91
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:20,975
Okay.

92
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,276
Here's our first user tester.

93
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:42,376
So, that's my cat. That's Fez. My little dude. He is the, to this day, one of the least engaged

94
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:46,658
cats that I have ever tested with. Which is just so typical.

95
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,466
So, yes, it did not go very well.

96
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,828
This first test did not go very well.

97
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,549
And as I said, this is a hobby at this point.

98
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:55,750
It's not working for the one purpose

99
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,071
that I was building this for,

100
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,133
to keep Fez Company, to give him something to do.

101
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:02,095
So I started doing it a little bit more seriously.

102
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,037
I started testing with some actual users.

103
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,159
And I just sent it around to some friends and family.

104
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,340
Still very hobby-esque.

105
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,441
Nine people tested this.

106
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:10,582
Nine cats tested this.

107
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:14,166
It's a web prototype, no actual physical interaction, no touch.

108
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,691
Two cats watch the device, one cat interacts,

109
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:19,613
doesn't really stay engaged.

110
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,679
So this leads us to a 33% engagement.

111
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,862
Which is, I don't know, that's okay, maybe.

112
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:32,283
33% of your, if you can hit 33% of your target audience,

113
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,605
maybe you're doing all right, but we knew we could do better.

114
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:36,365
33% is not exciting.

115
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,067
And this led us to our first discovery.

116
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,948
This is just standard playtesting at this point, right?

117
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,349
Which is that cats get bored without feedback.

118
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:44,610
It makes a lot of sense.

119
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,311
If you think about your own human motivations.

120
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,111
when you are fighting a big bad boss.

121
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,792
If the big bad boss doesn't lose HP when you touch it,

122
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,053
why are you fighting the big bad boss, right?

123
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:55,573
Unless you're masochistic maybe,

124
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:57,154
maybe you're a Dark Souls fan.

125
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,055
So cats get bored without feedback,

126
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,576
we knew we had to give them some form of touch interaction.

127
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:05,217
This is also, I don't think Laura is in the audience,

128
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:08,198
but we talked to somebody else who had built some cat games

129
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,939
and they tipped us off that cats actually think

130
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,479
they are hunting while they are playing.

131
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:13,980
We're like, okay.

132
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,505
We need them to think they're hunting.

133
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,466
So we're gonna build some new prototypes.

134
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:18,867
We're gonna make them touch-based,

135
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:20,789
so that way they'll actually get some interaction,

136
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,070
they'll get to kill the prey.

137
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,312
And just for the sake of testing,

138
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:26,493
we made three different prototypes,

139
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:27,394
all a little bit different.

140
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,915
We were kinda hoping we were gonna see like cat segments.

141
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,537
And we went and tested these prototypes.

142
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,720
So here's footage of a couple of these tests.

143
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,541
Once again, don't need to do it verbally.

144
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:39,062
Tell me if you think this worked.

145
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,325
Well, the answer is kinda.

146
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:54,766
Yeah, it went better.

147
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,587
So this is a touch prototype now.

148
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,447
The art is still pretty much the same.

149
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,208
We went to cat cafes.

150
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,608
We were getting a little bit more serious here.

151
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,751
And we had, of the 29 cats we tested on, seven cats only watch, and then separate segment,

152
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:12,751
six cats actually engage, actually attack the device.

153
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:14,552
Zero cats gave us their thoughts.

154
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:15,933
So it's getting better.

155
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,313
Six plus seven out of 29,

156
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,175
we're looking at 45% engagement now.

157
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:21,816
That's good, right?

158
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:23,757
45% engagement overall is pretty good.

159
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:26,999
Now, the problem with this number

160
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,382
is that we were entirely focusing on analytical data.

161
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:33,603
You can't communicate with the cat,

162
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,984
you can't be like, hey, is it better now?

163
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:36,925
So we went and talked to users,

164
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:39,446
and the users told us something very important.

165
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,187
It was not getting better.

166
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:47,724
Of the users we talked to, the pretty much unanimous answer

167
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,526
was that watching doesn't count.

168
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,547
That a cat sitting and watching this device,

169
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,229
even though to us, makes sense as some form of stimulation,

170
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,789
it's like looking out a window, maybe.

171
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,591
To the users, it doesn't actually count.

172
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,431
This is a video game.

173
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,072
They wanna see some physical action, right?

174
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,994
So our actual engagement is like 20%, much less exciting.

175
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,973
Now, around this time, we had gone to a conference

176
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,154
called Wisdom 2.0.

177
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,015
If you don't know it, it's a pretty interesting

178
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:13,415
little thing.

179
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,837
Sort of goes over the emerging conscious landscape

180
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:17,317
of business.

181
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,059
And we saw this woman there named Danielle Kretik.

182
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,881
She is the head of the Empathy Lab at Google.

183
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,843
Her whole thing is that she thinks she can use empathy

184
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,445
to improve Google's products, and more interestingly,

185
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:30,945
improve their AI.

186
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,747
So she's trying to learn about empathy

187
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:34,147
so that she can make her AI better.

188
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,869
And she brought up empathic design, emotional-based design.

189
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,349
And we thought that was kind of interesting.

190
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,969
So we went looking, we did some research.

191
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,350
If you Googled empathic design,

192
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,731
this is probably the example that you would run into.

193
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,352
So this is this Italian company named Milano.

194
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,233
They make all kinds of things,

195
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,913
but they decide to enter the baby bottle marketplace.

196
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:58,915
They immediately start testing in homes.

197
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,677
So the definition for empathic design,

198
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:02,597
if you didn't see it up there,

199
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,259
is experiencing what your end user experiences

200
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,279
with your end user.

201
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,461
And as far as definitions go,

202
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,602
that's not that much different from standard play testing.

203
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,602
And I'm gonna talk about that more.

204
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,204
So they go and they do in-person tests with kids,

205
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:16,704
and in-person tests with parents.

206
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,625
And with them, they bring some child behaviorists,

207
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:22,706
and just do some of their own research,

208
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:25,446
and they start noticing something pretty quickly.

209
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:30,067
One, intellectually, they notice that no one prototype

210
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,348
seems to really work for all the kids.

211
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:35,408
and through this, the child behaviorists that they have

212
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,570
and through the information that they know,

213
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,796
they start to identify that different developmental stages

214
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,221
for children simply need different bottles.

215
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:45,038
The next thing they notice is more emotional.

216
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,800
They're talking to parents.

217
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,981
This is more unexpected.

218
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,023
Through the parents, they're trying to figure out

219
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,445
what features, what products are gonna get

220
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,365
the parents excited, right?

221
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,207
And what they discover is ultimately,

222
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,548
the thing they actually care about,

223
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:59,249
the thing that the parents actually care about

224
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:00,950
is very emotionally based.

225
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,272
It is that they want their kids to be independent.

226
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,353
In this specific example,

227
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,375
they want their kids to be using cups, right?

228
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,216
And they wanna get their kids to using a cup

229
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,097
as fast as possible,

230
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,538
because then they can feel good and special

231
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:12,359
and their kid is independent.

232
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,566
So they have this intellectual side

233
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,207
and they have this emotional side

234
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,927
and they combine it to make a really simple solution.

235
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,648
They create three different baby bottles,

236
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,849
each one for a different developmental stage,

237
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,250
each one moving more towards using a cup.

238
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,872
So I was like, okay, yeah, that's cool, I like it.

239
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,013
A little more in depth than standard playtesting.

240
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,074
How does it apply to game design?

241
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,215
And that was when I found empathy mapping

242
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,396
and from anything else that you might take away

243
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,237
from this talk, this is by far the most useful tool

244
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:40,818
that I have found.

245
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,252
Really, really straightforward, really simple.

246
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,053
There are more complicated examples

247
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,153
if you wanted to go looking.

248
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,394
I found this to be adequate.

249
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:52,755
All you do, you make a square per user test, per user.

250
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:53,556
Okay?

251
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:56,137
In the center, you put a picture of your user,

252
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,178
maybe not an 8-bit dude, and you put their name.

253
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,419
That way, you just keep them a little more human.

254
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,899
You're thinking more about the user

255
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,720
and less about the numbers.

256
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,921
And during this test, you're recording

257
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,362
everything they're saying, doing, thinking, and feeling.

258
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:10,883
If you're looking at a standard user test,

259
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,605
I would say 90% of what you're actually gonna be recording

260
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,507
is probably on the left side of that square.

261
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,148
You're gonna be thinking about

262
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,389
what they're actually saying to you

263
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,010
and what they're doing, right?

264
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,233
And if they said, hey, I'm kind of feeling defeated,

265
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,474
you might write that down.

266
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,256
But most of the time, you're not going to spend the moment

267
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,958
to get in depth there emotionally.

268
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:32,559
And that's why I love this tool.

269
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,821
It's so straightforward, but it forces you

270
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,082
to experience things a little bit more emotionally.

271
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,063
Okay?

272
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:39,965
Here's the problem.

273
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,613
I'm designing games for cats.

274
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:48,437
And of the four categories that is in this empathy map,

275
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:49,678
we think the empathy map is cool.

276
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:50,959
We're like, oh, OK, that might work.

277
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,762
But of the four categories, three of them

278
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,704
rely on verbal communication.

279
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,046
So the only thing that we actually

280
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,768
get out of our play test with cats is what they're doing.

281
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:03,930
The only thing we can actually experience with our cat

282
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,152
is what they're actively engaging with

283
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,193
and how they're actively engaging.

284
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:07,994
But we have no idea why.

285
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,755
So communication is our big problem here.

286
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,977
Verbal communication has broken down, we cannot use it,

287
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,878
and therefore, we're pretty weak game designers.

288
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,940
We get a fourth of what a standard game designer might get.

289
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,402
So understanding has to replace communication.

290
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:21,283
This was our approach.

291
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:23,164
We decided, yeah, okay, we have no idea

292
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:23,824
what the cat's thinking,

293
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,245
and we'll never be able to confirm that,

294
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,007
at least not in the foreseeable future.

295
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:29,388
But we can learn a lot more about them

296
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,530
and get more in depth, just like that Milano example.

297
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,042
So we did three things.

298
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,043
One, we did a lot of research.

299
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:35,624
If you need a good book on cats,

300
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,986
Cat Sense and Cat Wise, two of my favorites.

301
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,250
We found a lot of experts, some cat behaviorists

302
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,351
who we still work with today.

303
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,873
And then we just spent a lot of time with them,

304
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:46,134
and that's your standard user testing.

305
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,857
So from the research, we discovered

306
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:50,538
some really important things about cat vision.

307
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,500
One is they're semi-colorblind.

308
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,762
They have poor vision from within about a foot away from their face,

309
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:59,223
which, fun fact for you, if you ever bring something close to a cat's face,

310
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:03,065
you'll notice at some point it stops actually looking and its whiskers come forward.

311
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,466
That is to compensate for that lack of vision.

312
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:08,547
They're feeling with their whiskers instead of actually seeing.

313
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,748
They are motion-based as far as vision goes,

314
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:15,049
and they see at 60 frames a second, some high-fidelity cats.

315
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:21,056
Um, the experts, they confirmed that watching is some form of engagement.

316
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:23,057
It's like looking out of a window or watching TV.

317
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,959
It's something, some form of mental stimulation.

318
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,481
And, uh, vision is only part of hunting.

319
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:33,064
So vision is a, not an insignificant part of hunting for cats, but smell and

320
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,785
hearing especially are super important.

321
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,403
And then spending time with cats,

322
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,023
we had some interesting moments here.

323
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,924
So one, just a fun fact again,

324
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:42,905
we found that different cats actually do

325
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:43,985
prefer different kinds of games.

326
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,826
So at some point, maybe next year,

327
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:47,507
I'll tell you about my cat segmentation guide.

328
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,369
And the other thing was we had very few,

329
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,609
like maybe three cats

330
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,931
that we had this really interesting, weird moment with.

331
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:58,571
So I'm gonna step back to the Empathy Map

332
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,132
and try to show you why it's a useful tool.

333
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,473
So these cats, these like literally, maybe three cats,

334
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,631
We're interacting, we're noticing movement,

335
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,793
we're responding to movement, we're attacking,

336
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,814
and completely missing the prey.

337
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:15,416
And the first time that happened, we were like, well, that's a broken cat, you know?

338
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,436
But it happened two more times.

339
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,739
And so if you, this is a hyper-simplified empathy map,

340
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,399
just to be clear.

341
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,101
They're normally covered in chicken scratch,

342
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,162
you want that to be the case.

343
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,584
But with this hyper-simplified map,

344
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,346
if we're just mapping out that one cat,

345
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,647
and of course taking liberties, because it's a cat,

346
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,210
we're noticing that it is missing the screen

347
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:37,411
when it attacks, right?

348
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,194
We are definitely seeing that they're feeling this sense,

349
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,176
this predatory behavior, they're actually attacking.

350
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,547
And they definitely think there's movement.

351
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,528
They're responding to it.

352
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:51,071
But what it's saying is, where is it?

353
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,472
It's missing the prey.

354
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,234
It's sometimes completely missing the device.

355
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:55,355
It's really weird.

356
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,998
So I'm gonna give you a second here again.

357
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,639
This is the original prototype, nothing new here.

358
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,481
Given the information that we've learned about cats

359
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,402
and the research that we did,

360
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,444
can you try to tell me, in your head,

361
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,986
what you think is going wrong with this prototype?

362
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,871
Yeah, basically our art style was awful.

363
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:24,776
So we were relying really heavily,

364
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,098
leaning really heavily on this

365
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,680
cats think they're hunting thing.

366
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,121
And so if the cat thinks it's hunting,

367
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,683
then we want it to look as much like it's hunting, right?

368
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,605
We want these really realistic art styles.

369
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:36,786
It was what we thought was a strength

370
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,007
because all of the other cat games

371
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,168
are really cute and stupid looking.

372
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,808
I mean if you make cat games, I'm sorry.

373
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:42,769
I take that back.

374
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,872
So we learned a couple things from our research

375
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,534
and applied it to a new prototype.

376
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:55,337
One was we had to simplify the heck out of our art style.

377
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,299
We completely took out a lot of the textures,

378
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:58,840
we made the textures really minimal,

379
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,302
we made the foreground and background really easy to differentiate.

380
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,305
And then one of the more important things is we did colorblind studies.

381
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,429
So cats see in a particular way that's kind of hard to put your finger on,

382
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:13,831
but it's pretty similar to red colorblind people.

383
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,732
So we just used red colorblind filters.

384
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:19,155
And you can see now that that foreground and background blend together

385
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:22,457
and that the actual thing it's supposed to be interacting with

386
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:23,678
really clearly stands out.

387
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,281
And that worked really well.

388
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,574
We tested once again on 42 cats, still cat cafes,

389
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:32,476
some people in person.

390
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,620
11 of these cats are now sitting and watching.

391
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:38,504
18 cats, once again this is a separate segment,

392
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,828
are actually engaging, actually attacking the device.

393
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:42,891
Zero cats told us why they liked it now.

394
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:45,418
So to compare those numbers,

395
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,359
that meant that our percent watch didn't really change,

396
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,419
but our percent engage went from 20% to 43%.

397
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,060
And these are, of course, smallish numbers,

398
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,501
hard to really use this as hard evidence, but still.

399
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,121
We're looking at twice the engagement.

400
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,483
Okay, so here's where it gets a little more interesting,

401
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,563
a little more applicable to you.

402
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:07,923
If it works for cats,

403
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,560
It's probably going to work for people too, right?

404
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:14,144
So we started doing this exact same empathy mapping,

405
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,827
emotional design with our people, with our humans.

406
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,430
And the first thing we did was we started talking to them.

407
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,592
If you have verbal communication, you might as well use it.

408
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,117
And it didn't go so hot right at first.

409
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,931
This is from a woman named Kristen.

410
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,435
She is our absolute super user.

411
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:35,901
She is a foster cat mom, has tested somewhere between 60

412
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:38,845
and 80 cats with our tablet by herself.

413
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:39,727
She's amazing.

414
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:43,071
And what she said about our data screen.

415
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,693
is that she doesn't use it, but she likes it.

416
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,394
That's why she tells people about the app.

417
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,474
So just to be more clear, make sure you understand,

418
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,075
we have this app that is running automatically,

419
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,216
tracking what your cat is up to,

420
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,496
and then our whole selling point,

421
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:55,977
the whole thing that we thought was really cool,

422
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,257
is that it teaches you about this cat, right?

423
00:16:59,058 --> 00:16:59,938
We were like, yeah, that's awesome.

424
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,138
Users weren't using it.

425
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,259
So let's step back to our empathy map again.

426
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,440
Once again, hyper simplified.

427
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,281
But, what we're hearing from Kristen

428
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,102
is that, first of all, she plays in person.

429
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,014
This is an automatic app, it's like our whole thing.

430
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,575
And she's playing in person.

431
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:16,935
She's switching the games manually.

432
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:18,256
She's actually getting annoyed

433
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:19,977
that it automatically switches sometimes.

434
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:23,499
She is thinking, yeah, the data's neat.

435
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,040
And I put that in parentheses for a very specific reason.

436
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,901
It's neat.

437
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,502
You know, it's worth looking at.

438
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:29,502
It's like, yeah, it's kind of cool

439
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:30,883
that the cat was active at 2 p.m.

440
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,205
But I have no actual connection to that information, right?

441
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,926
She's saying and continuing to say

442
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,148
that watching doesn't count, which sucks.

443
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,796
And she's feeling, and this is where the,

444
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,656
I'm not convinced I would have gotten here

445
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,977
without this empathic design.

446
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,678
She's feeling that she misses her cat.

447
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,239
And that alone is not very novel,

448
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,261
but what that wound up leading into was pretty important

449
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,022
and was a huge pivot for what we were building.

450
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:01,103
We were selling an intellectual product,

451
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,283
something that tracks data, teaches you about your cat,

452
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:04,544
to emotional people.

453
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:09,329
So these are people that care desperately about their cats.

454
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,772
They care so much about their cats

455
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:11,854
that they're sitting in a room listening

456
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:12,896
to a guy talking about them right now.

457
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,114
And I don't just mean that cat people are emotional.

458
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:19,755
Everybody is emotional.

459
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,496
We are emotional beings, right?

460
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:25,199
Simon Sinek's one of the most famous TED Talks to date.

461
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,781
And his whole thing is that people don't buy what you do,

462
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,121
they buy why you do it, right?

463
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,562
They buy the emotional connection.

464
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:32,123
And so what we were scratching at

465
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,965
was a way to negate the guilt

466
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,326
that you had about leaving your cat alone.

467
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,907
We are scratching at some emotion there.

468
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:39,989
But we weren't really empowering it.

469
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,470
We were giving them this intellectual hook.

470
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,831
We were like, yeah, you can learn about your cat,

471
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,612
rather than actually giving them the emotional things

472
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,974
that they need from their animal, this fluffy love, right?

473
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,436
Everything that a person actually cares about with their cat

474
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:51,476
or with any animal.

475
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,658
So we came up with some solutions, tried to empower them.

476
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,820
First thing we did, this is the least exciting one,

477
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:00,282
we tried to convince them that watching does count.

478
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:05,358
This is a very MVP solution right here, so it's just a pop-up that appears at the beginning,

479
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,139
try to instruct you.

480
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,863
The next thing we did, and this is my favorite name for a settings screen that I've ever

481
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:13,365
created in my life, is the parental controls.

482
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:18,228
So we empower the user to play the app, use the app however they want, so they can turn

483
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:21,431
on and off the automatic capability, they can turn on and off which games actually run.

484
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:25,034
And yes, pray squishing means pray death.

485
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:29,242
We literally had to PGFI our app if users asked for it.

486
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,226
We had people complaining about killing mice.

487
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,545
And then the last one, these are emotional people, right?

488
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,909
Then the last one is we didn't want to throw out the data entirely

489
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,954
because it seemed like people were sharing it due to that interesting factor.

490
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:48,036
Like this is kind of cool, this is kind of neat, this is unusual.

491
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,877
But no one's really using it.

492
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,639
It doesn't have the emotional connection that it needs.

493
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,701
So where is that middle ground,

494
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,083
that solution between intellectualism and emotionalism?

495
00:19:56,924 --> 00:20:01,668
For us, it was basically to take a picture of your cat's art

496
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,970
when it's engaging when you're away,

497
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,392
or of the cat itself through the camera,

498
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,173
and then just to email it to the user.

499
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:11,556
So you're sitting at home, or you're sitting at work, or wherever,

500
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:14,479
and missing your cat, you need some fluffy love,

501
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,680
and you get an email in that says,

502
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,022
Hey, Fez just played the game,

503
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,784
and look at this amazing Da Vinci artwork that he just created.

504
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,518
So these are our people results.

505
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,519
This is why human-centered design works.

506
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,121
This is why emotional design works.

507
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,963
This is about 400 beta testers who were surveyed

508
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:34,664
like right before release.

509
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,147
Of the 400 or so people, we're having over 75% of them

510
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,648
call it high quality, at least, for an MVP product.

511
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,150
This is a little bit of data about a month after release.

512
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,251
We're seeing pretty great word of mouth here.

513
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,162
And then to talk about the cats again,

514
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,583
because I like cats if you didn't notice,

515
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:54,284
why cat-centered design worked,

516
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,686
but really just why emotional design works.

517
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,689
Of the 124 users that we're actually tracking

518
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,410
who have signed up, we've had 2,000 games played

519
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,553
and over 30,000 kitty taps, or individual interactions,

520
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:08,794
where the cat is tapping the screen.

521
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,076
Interestingly here, we are seeing each of the games

522
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,258
have a pretty healthy population of cats who play it,

523
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,199
so we are seeing that cat segmentation.

524
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,067
And then this is what's actually really exciting,

525
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,328
and I breathe such a sigh of relief at this moment.

526
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,329
So upon pulling the data and looking

527
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,989
at all of the individual games that have been played,

528
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,230
we're seeing 62% of games have at least some interaction.

529
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,211
So 62% engagement.

530
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,591
And this is pretty much the same prototype

531
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,912
that people were playing, I was playing in person,

532
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:36,612
at that 45%.

533
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:36,892
Now it's 62.

534
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:42,339
This is not also including cats who watch,

535
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,480
because we can't track that, right?

536
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,862
So take us with a grain of salt,

537
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,264
because it's very possible humans are playing this.

538
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,748
But we actually figure that's no problem.

539
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:53,849
We will want to differentiate,

540
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,591
but we actually figure that's no problem.

541
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:56,832
Engagement is engagement, right?

542
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:01,316
Okay, so you've sat through a whole lot of stuff.

543
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:02,597
I'm gonna give you a reward.

544
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,018
I know why you're here.

545
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,181
It's cute cats.

546
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:15,238
So another interesting fact here is you can see that most of these cats are really getting

547
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:16,058
excited are young.

548
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:19,342
Young cats are consistently our most engaged animals.

549
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:22,545
So the joke I always make is cats are millennials too.

550
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:25,728
Okay.

551
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:27,189
All right.

552
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,191
So these are my key takeaways for this.

553
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:31,934
One is, and this is something you all know.

554
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:35,078
but everybody still falls into this trap all the time,

555
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,580
is to empower their use cases.

556
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,062
You have to leave your ego out of design.

557
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:41,304
You can suspect what your users want,

558
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:42,525
but ultimately you're designing for them,

559
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:43,626
you're not designing for you.

560
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,449
We had so many pivots that I would not have called

561
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,332
without experimenting with my users.

562
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,335
The second is to research your target audience.

563
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,637
That's not something I really thought of doing.

564
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,740
And I find a lot of people, a lot of my own students

565
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
don't choose target audiences, right?

566
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,581
That's a very newbie mistake.

567
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,581
Make sure you've got your audience.

568
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,782
And then research them, learn about them,

569
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,363
find experts if there are experts.

570
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,084
And then three is to use empathy mapping.

571
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,004
It is such a simple, straightforward tool,

572
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,265
and it forces you to get deeper with users

573
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,626
and find things that you may not have found.

574
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:16,926
But really, what I'm hoping I've convinced you of

575
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,727
by this point is to spend the time to understand your user

576
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:21,068
and not just talk to them.

577
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:22,268
That's it.

578
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:30,952
Thank you.

579
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:34,493
So we have six minutes for questions.

580
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:37,875
Feel free to reach out to me through email.

581
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,196
I also write about weird stuff like this on my blog.

582
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:43,618
I'm gonna hang out here until 30 minutes

583
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,159
and then I'll head over to 204 and hang out there

584
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,660
if anyone wants to talk to me individually

585
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,640
or doesn't get a question in.

586
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,801
So yeah, feel free.

587
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,682
So you said there's a couple of limitations that cats have.

588
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,624
One is how they can't really see things

589
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:00,405
that are a foot away from their face,

590
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,367
color blindness, and then refresh rate,

591
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,348
or how fast they see.

592
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,750
Have you got any metrics on how they work

593
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,770
with different devices?

594
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:12,712
What is the best device for them to play these games on?

595
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:14,999
You're talking about like different tablets?

596
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:15,340
Yes.

597
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,581
Actually I don't.

598
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:17,482
That's an interesting one.

599
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:18,623
I haven't checked in on that.

600
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:19,564
That's a curious question.

601
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:23,308
What I keep saying about the tablets is that it's not really the ideal solution.

602
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:25,210
It's just the accessible one.

603
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:28,254
Everybody has tablets and so many people have tablets they don't use anymore.

604
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:33,259
So eventually we'd actually like to step into physical stuff, physical toys that kind of

605
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:33,800
do the same thing.

606
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,260
I see.

607
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:43,385
Are adult cats better than kittens at your game, or vice versa?

608
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:43,545
No.

609
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:52,031
Adult cats, so we're actually working with the VCA to do a study on all of this, which

610
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:57,614
is amazing, but so we find that pretty universally adult cats at best are going to sit and watch.

611
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,095
There are definitely some cats that'll play.

612
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,035
This is a total shot in the dark,

613
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,596
but my guess there is something to do with plasticity,

614
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,136
basically, that the cats have already,

615
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:08,117
cats pretty much established their personality

616
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,297
by like one and a half years in.

617
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,238
And so if they haven't experienced a tablet

618
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:16,758
and this is a fun toy, within a year and a half,

619
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:18,679
they probably just, it just doesn't get learned

620
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:19,179
later in life.

621
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,959
That was a very good answer, thank you.

622
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:30,386
I'm curious to know, you also said that cats rely on hearing when hunting.

623
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:37,408
Did you guys try to introduce sounds to maybe for them to early engage with the game and maybe keep them focused?

624
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,669
Yes, I neglected to mention that in fact, I meant to.

625
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,110
My sound designer is sitting right there.

626
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,832
So we hired a professional sound designer to try to make 3D enabled sounds.

627
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:51,313
We did see some engagement increase from that.

628
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:53,895
Another one?

629
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:55,716
Have you tried it with big cats?

630
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:56,857
No.

631
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:58,018
One day.

632
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:00,980
We need some big tablets.

633
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:05,643
Anybody else?

634
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,885
Cool.

635
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,126
So I'm gonna hang out in 204, like I said.

636
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,427
I'll be there if anyone wants to talk.

637
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:12,508
Otherwise, thank you for coming.
