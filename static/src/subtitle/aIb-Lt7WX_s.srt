1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:10,296
I'm sure many of you have already seen some of my amazing colleagues' talks.

2
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:15,178
Everybody's been sort of crushing it this year at GDC, and it's super exciting.

3
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,079
But it was a little bit more pressure on me.

4
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:21,981
So it says out there that the talk is reinventing God of War, but I realized as I was writing it...

5
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,324
that I was covering a lot of stuff that really smart people

6
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,826
and really good people were already going to cover

7
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,768
in their talks in a much better way than I was.

8
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:32,790
So I was trying to figure out

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,611
what would be a really good talk

10
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,212
that would be much more specific of the things

11
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:38,294
that I do on a daily basis.

12
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:38,975
So.

13
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,116
I'm doing something about pitching and doubting,

14
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,998
which is pretty much what I do the entirety of a project.

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,179
I talk to people and beg and sell,

16
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:53,081
and then try to either quell doubt from other people

17
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,622
while the whole time experiencing

18
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:57,582
a tremendous amount of doubt myself.

19
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:00,143
It is fantastic, it is exciting.

20
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:02,304
It's not a very glamorous job.

21
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:03,305
Everybody thinks it's glamorous,

22
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,025
but really it's just constantly stressful.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,975
So in April of 2013, I started talking to Shanna Studstill.

24
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:16,881
And I initially had a pitch for the game.

25
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,684
And it was a little bit like this.

26
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:21,585
I don't even know if this is the exact thing I said,

27
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,887
but this is essentially what it was.

28
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:25,929
I want to do something really huge and bold.

29
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,371
And the arm gestures?

30
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:31,953
are extremely important when you are talking about shit you have no idea about.

31
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,915
So when I'm telling people I'm moving my arms around it's going to be huge and bold and

32
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:39,157
you raise your voice every once in a while and you know we're going to turn everything

33
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:40,858
upside down and just freak people out.

34
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,781
There was nothing of substance to that initial pitch but she was still interested in actually

35
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:50,103
continuing to work together because she figured eventually you're going to figure it out and

36
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:50,663
you're going to get it.

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,624
So I came back to the studio in June.

38
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,625
of 2013, right?

39
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:00,667
It was like the first 15 days of June that I came back

40
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,208
and started working with a bunch of people

41
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:06,709
and tried to formulate what it is I wanted to do

42
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:09,830
with this game that wasn't just huge and bold

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,070
and lots of arm gestures.

44
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:15,662
And after four weeks, I put together a pitch,

45
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,524
and I was going to be pitching Scott Rohde.

46
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,905
So the way the organization works is,

47
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,666
Shannice Dudsdill, who I had mentioned earlier,

48
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,327
she's heading up Santa Monica.

49
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:27,409
She's sort of the first gate that I went through, right?

50
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:30,691
And then Scott Rohde is sort of overseeing

51
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,052
all the studios within North America,

52
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,613
so he's kind of the next gate,

53
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:37,714
the person I have to pitch on that list.

54
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,796
And then you have Shuhei Yoshida,

55
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:43,178
who is kind of like the scary gate that I have to pitch.

56
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,260
And then after that, it gets up to Sean.

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,961
And by that time, I pretty much probably

58
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,443
have it figured out, so it's a little bit less scary.

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,224
But something I realized

60
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,586
when I was putting this presentation together

61
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:58,309
is that everybody above me has a fucking S in their name.

62
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,191
They all work for Sony.

63
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,620
Their names begin with S, and I realized, like, you know,

64
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,781
progress upwards in this company is all related

65
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,542
to whether or not you have an S in your name.

66
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:16,084
So today, I'm going to change my name.

67
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,069
And I added a few S's at the end.

68
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,470
That way, there's nobody that's going to overtake me.

69
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,691
And I will be the vice president.

70
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,939
of vice-presidenting.

71
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,020
So if you have any questions about vice-presidenting,

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,760
I am the person you're going to come to.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,981
I'll probably outsource it to somebody else

74
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,081
so that I can probably finish Red Dead most of the time.

75
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,662
That's not a real email, so don't try to contact it.

76
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,742
It won't get you anywhere.

77
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:52,143
So moving on to a really smooth segue like I just did.

78
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,583
So what I'm gonna do is something

79
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,843
that nobody outside of the company has seen.

80
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,804
It is the very first pitch that I did.

81
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:05,288
for Scott Rohde that kind of kicked this entire thing off.

82
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,890
And I ended up doing variations of this pitch

83
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,352
throughout the duration of the game.

84
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,333
So I'm gonna break a little bit in the middle

85
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,075
and then switch to one that was from a little bit later.

86
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:17,377
And then I'm gonna talk a little bit more specifically

87
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,460
about doubt, about the doubt that I was feeling

88
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,201
throughout all of this and kind of encapsulated

89
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,443
in a very long winded story that I'm gonna tell.

90
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:26,685
So this is going to have director's commentary.

91
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,807
So I'm not really going to do the pitch officially,

92
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,450
mostly because it was like five years ago, and I'm old,

93
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,131
and I really can't remember every single thing.

94
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,113
But I can kind of poke fun at all the stupidity

95
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,655
that I had at that moment.

96
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:39,518
And you can all see how something like this game

97
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,040
started out really.

98
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:43,979
Really bad.

99
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,981
So starting off right away, we're using the old logo

100
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,402
because it was four weeks.

101
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:50,364
And I even put that at the bottom of the presentation.

102
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:51,765
That was to repair, Scott,

103
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:53,686
that I'd only had four weeks to work on this.

104
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,928
So please lower your expectations.

105
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,265
So it was August 14th, 2013, and this next image

106
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,026
was not actually in the original presentation.

107
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,086
I would just do a verbal description of this,

108
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:06,267
but I added it in, so there's a couple images

109
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,167
I had to switch out to make this thing work.

110
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,628
But what I would talk about was the idea

111
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,908
that all the mythologies of the world

112
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:16,429
are kind of like this Hubble telescope image.

113
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:19,690
They are like galaxies individually spread out

114
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,770
throughout a complete universe.

115
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,217
The world is the universe, and all the mythologies are sort of origin stories of various cultures

116
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,402
throughout the world, beginning at the beginning of time and stretching all the way out.

117
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:39,367
So at any given time, all the mythologies exist together concurrently, and they are

118
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,409
simply separated by geography.

119
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,354
So it was important because some people had the conception that, hey, Kratos at the end

120
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:46,796
of God of War III destroyed the world.

121
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,621
Well, he destroyed what they believed the world was in Greece, which was their world.

122
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,443
Everybody believed their world was the only world.

123
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:53,745
In fact, we still believe that today.

124
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:53,805
So

125
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,565
Initially we were talking about this concept,

126
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,547
I didn't have a really good word for it.

127
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,288
So I was calling it a reboot,

128
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:05,150
but I knew that I didn't want to continue to call it a reboot

129
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,391
because keep calling it a reboot,

130
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,293
a lot of people would have these misconceptions

131
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:11,315
and all this baggage that comes along with what a reboot is.

132
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:14,378
So I wanted to explain what a reboot was

133
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,219
by using one of my favorite things

134
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,401
in the entire world, Star Trek.

135
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,959
So the Star Trek fans, it's fantastic.

136
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,383
So I would talk about this concept of Star Trek Nemesis,

137
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,826
right, had that classic sort of familiar,

138
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,688
high-end TV-focused appeal.

139
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,470
It didn't really broaden the audience.

140
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,791
It was sort of appealing to people

141
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,353
who were already Star Trek fans.

142
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,955
And then the new reboot, the J.J. Abrams one in 2009,

143
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:41,257
kind of brought in that sort of new feel, the cutting edge.

144
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,037
And honestly, the thing that was most important,

145
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,618
the thing I put in orange was this idea

146
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,539
that theirs was an origin story.

147
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,442
So they were telling the story of Spock and Kirk

148
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,763
and kind of going back to the days of the Academy.

149
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:01,567
You can see I, at the beginning, was calling it God of War IV,

150
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:04,190
because I didn't have any idea what we were going to call it.

151
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,031
I thought I was going to put a subtitle at the end of it.

152
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,853
So I was like, whatever, we'll just call it God of War IV,

153
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:09,274
because I didn't want to confuse anybody

154
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,556
if I called it just God of War.

155
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:13,938
And then I ended up just calling it God of War.

156
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,239
It's fantastic.

157
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,700
So what does this mean, right?

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,383
It means that directors are the worst artists on the planet.

159
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,785
And I just grab an image off of the internet

160
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,607
and I actually have a, it means a reset, right?

161
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,889
It means we're going to reset everything

162
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,550
but in a different way, right?

163
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,611
We're not gonna go back and say,

164
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,052
well, what we're gonna do is tell Kratos' new origin story.

165
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,374
No, we're gonna actually continue the timeline

166
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,555
and reinvent the feel.

167
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:46,018
And the important part of this was to say that we did so much work developing the character of Kratos,

168
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,479
why would we throw all that out and start on a new character?

169
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,719
Because you just have to build all that backstory again.

170
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:56,761
So we're sort of treating the first seven games like the chapter one of this character's life.

171
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,462
But he still needed as a character to grow.

172
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,015
We wanted to grow the character, we wanted to grow the world.

173
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:05,618
Everything needed to expand out and give you a sense

174
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,741
that something was going to be different.

175
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:12,045
And wanted to, in the initial pitch,

176
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,206
because I didn't have a lot,

177
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,569
I wanted to talk a little bit about the studio as well.

178
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,711
So talking about how the studio was gonna play

179
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,433
to our strengths, because we were really good

180
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,634
at making action adventure games.

181
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,716
We wanted to make sure that we stayed on that track

182
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,837
of making action adventure games,

183
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,020
but we wanted to broaden our skills, open things up,

184
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:30,243
and feel like we were progressing forward.

185
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,466
Because for a long time, we kind of

186
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:36,169
got stuck in this rut of doing, hey, we did the last game.

187
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,171
Let's pile some more stuff on top of that.

188
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,934
So we wouldn't really go in and just kind of rip things up.

189
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:42,195
And then.

190
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,943
When you are asking executives for money,

191
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,229
usually you do things like the next two points.

192
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,252
I'm a little embarrassed about them,

193
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,594
but I'm gonna show them anyway.

194
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:57,239
You say things like, own the action adventure genre.

195
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,218
And I, at the time, was just like,

196
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,679
I was like cringeworthy when I was saying it.

197
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,561
I was like, you know, it's that aspirational goal.

198
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,082
Man, we're gonna do something great.

199
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,223
And I think for me, and I think for the rest of the team,

200
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:12,406
the concept was that we were going to own

201
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:14,247
the work that we had done, that we were gonna

202
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,248
really, truly stand behind everything that we had done

203
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,850
and really try to excel at all of that.

204
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,894
And then this one, this truly is the one that you say

205
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:25,735
when you want people to give you money.

206
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:28,177
Create Game of the Year.

207
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:32,590
This is four weeks in, and we said we were going to do that.

208
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,174
And even I thought that was total bullshit.

209
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,136
But I was like, all right, we're going to do this.

210
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:43,838
And it was that level of enthusiasm,

211
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:46,339
even though inside I'm going like, yeah, right.

212
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,161
This is not going to happen.

213
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,562
But it will get people really excited.

214
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:54,644
So moving on to the narrative, continuing the timeline,

215
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,524
growing the character, continue to sort of hammer

216
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,225
that same point home that we're not restarting anything.

217
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:03,186
It is the same Kratos that you know,

218
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,166
except we're gonna figure out how we're gonna change it.

219
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:07,287
And while I was sort of on my travels

220
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:11,528
after having left right before three fully started,

221
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,808
something I had learned from a bunch of different directors

222
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:18,729
was this adage of simple story, complex characters.

223
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,870
And.

224
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:24,184
Full disclosure, I did not listen to this first rule.

225
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,085
So the first year, there are several points in here

226
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,706
that I ignored that I was telling other people,

227
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,487
we need to do this, and then I totally screwed up.

228
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,349
So I ended up having to reboot the reboot of the script.

229
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,471
So we wrote a script for a year, and it was the wrong script.

230
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:41,372
I was sort of realizing that, OK, I wasn't paying attention.

231
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:44,213
I wasn't making this about the main characters.

232
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,214
And the story sort of meandered a little bit.

233
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,048
And Kratos, seeking a fresh start.

234
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:53,332
So this picture right here is sort of what people thought of Kratos.

235
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:58,419
before we sort of released the demo in 2016, right?

236
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,960
It was like angry Kratos, the guy who killed somebody

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,101
at the beginning of a cinematic

238
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,921
and just kind of stood there until the cinematic ended.

239
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,923
He was just an angry, violent, scary guy.

240
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:10,004
And not only did he need a fresh start,

241
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,845
but I think the player needed a fresh start as well.

242
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:13,726
They needed a new perspective on this character.

243
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,047
And in a way, I'm getting older,

244
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,107
the studio has been around for a lot longer,

245
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:19,568
so I was looking around at all the people

246
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,509
that I've been developing games with for like 10 years.

247
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,471
and we were all old.

248
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,954
And the interesting thing was this concept

249
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:28,956
of breaking the cycle, right?

250
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:30,618
And it was so multi-layered,

251
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,402
because it was breaking the cycle for us as a studio,

252
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,784
kind of getting caught in that rut of saying,

253
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,085
well, you know, we did the last game,

254
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,747
let's just keep putting things on top of it

255
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,669
instead of really digging in and saying,

256
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,930
we're just gonna rip this thing up

257
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,931
and figure something new out.

258
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:52,299
It was me as a developer sort of having some sort of confidence in what I was doing and trying different things,

259
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,804
having a little bit more confidence to try those things even though I would experience doubt all the way through all of this.

260
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:07,251
But it's also Kratos kind of raking this cycle, this cycle that he had since the beginning of the gods sort of screwing with his life,

261
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,034
him being an absolutely crap.

262
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:14,575
father, him sort of blaming the rest of the world.

263
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,276
That was one of the big aspects of Kratos' character

264
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:18,776
was it's everybody else's fault.

265
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,597
This isn't my fault, it's other people's fault.

266
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:21,697
That's why I'm such a jerk.

267
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:24,438
And the key to breaking that cycle

268
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,078
was gonna be this father-son story.

269
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,879
Here's another point in which I completely lost the plot

270
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,340
for the first year of the game

271
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,781
and ended up writing a story that assumed

272
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,061
you already knew the relationship of the father-son

273
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,662
and we sort of had to go and reboot that.

274
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:42,519
Now this was an important aspect.

275
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,622
This was really trying to cement the concept

276
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:48,325
that this isn't a new Kratos.

277
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:52,289
This is the same Kratos who's just a lot older.

278
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,252
So that means he still has this monster inside of him.

279
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,995
I was using the example of the Hulk a lot.

280
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,338
So I would basically say that in the previous games,

281
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,180
the Hulk was out all the time.

282
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,883
It was all 100% the whole kill, kill, kill, kill, smash, right?

283
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:07,405
No Bruce Banner whatsoever.

284
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:10,727
And in this one, I really wanted to experiment with the idea

285
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,829
that he was primarily Bruce Banner,

286
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,832
and he was struggling to actually keep the Hulk inside.

287
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,154
So this monster that he was keeping inside,

288
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,756
this monster of the Kratos that everybody knew,

289
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,959
was going to be something that he struggled and failed,

290
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,702
because failure is such a huge part of what we do,

291
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,144
that everything in my life just sort of ended up

292
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:29,944
in this damn game.

293
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,166
And he would struggle throughout all of this.

294
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,867
And something I was really excited about

295
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:37,308
was this concept of teaching in the narrative,

296
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,529
experiencing the narrative in the play,

297
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,490
so that you were kind of training your son,

298
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,712
you were teaching him about your life, right?

299
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,193
You were teaching him how to be a god,

300
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,413
and he was kind of, in turn,

301
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,374
teaching Kratos how to be a human being,

302
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,315
something he had forgotten so long ago.

303
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,896
And to some degree, we succeeded.

304
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,177
There was a lot of things that I really wanted to do.

305
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:01,178
I remember I was constantly talking about the teaching

306
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,098
and making that the focal point of many of the pitches.

307
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,679
And everybody always said, but yeah, how are you going to do it?

308
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,220
And I was like, I don't know.

309
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,521
We'll figure it out later, which is what we all do.

310
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:11,501
We just figure it out later.

311
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,536
And another just stellar graphic.

312
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:18,881
I mean, if anybody wants me to do any sort of side hustle

313
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,623
artwork for them, I'm free.

314
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:22,165
That's so good.

315
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:25,089
So the game pillars were not sort of the traditional

316
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:26,130
game pillars that we were talking about.

317
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,973
This was kind of the aspirational goals

318
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,735
of what we were gonna do with the game.

319
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:34,459
And starting off something that in the beginning of God of War

320
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,881
all the way back in 2003 when I was there,

321
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:40,044
we had always talked about this concept of the pick up and play

322
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:42,346
game, the fun and accessible game.

323
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:43,687
And it seems obvious that you say

324
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,568
we're going to make a game that's fun and accessible,

325
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,572
because who wants to make a game that's completely obtuse?

326
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,895
But I realized that we needed to say that.

327
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:55,476
There's a lot of things that we needed

328
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,998
to just sort of reinforce and tell each other constantly

329
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:58,839
to sort of.

330
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,141
change the way we were thinking.

331
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:04,204
And the next thing was really important in that.

332
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,286
I remember all the way back at the beginning,

333
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:09,848
we used to use two words to describe this game

334
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,873
in literally every single instance, brutal and epic.

335
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,035
And I was like, we can never say those damn words

336
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:21,278
ever again, because what we would do

337
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,340
is using those words would help us sort of fall back

338
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,961
on our old habits, our old ways.

339
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,483
So I made an attempt to try to figure out

340
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:27,644
how do you replace brutal?

341
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:29,836
Well, unflinching, of course.

342
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,118
The idea of the sort of unflinching close

343
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,519
and personal combat was also my early programming

344
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,720
to seed the concept of the no-cut camera.

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,041
So four weeks in, I was not bold enough to tell people

346
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,541
that I wanted to have a single camera shot

347
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:45,022
throughout the entire game, because I knew it was crazy.

348
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,624
But I was starting to at least seed this idea.

349
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:49,724
So throughout the presentation,

350
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:50,824
I was actually putting things in,

351
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:51,745
so eventually I could say,

352
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,105
see, we already talked about this,

353
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,906
so you agreed, it's fine, right?

354
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,116
And then this one is, again, another one of those,

355
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,137
hey, give me some money.

356
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm going to say something that literally

357
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,901
every freaking game does.

358
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,864
We're going to make an interactive and immersive world.

359
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,206
Yeah, everybody does that.

360
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,709
But again, wave the arms, say it loud,

361
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,973
and then people are like, all right, here you go.

362
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,293
The next one, this was another very, very obvious,

363
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,656
like seamless narrative, seamless play

364
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,657
and character development.

365
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:23,779
This was where I started telling people about this idea

366
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:27,223
of constantly going, you know, in one sort of experience,

367
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:28,825
always feeling you can't even tell the difference

368
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:29,466
between any of it.

369
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:31,027
So in the early God of War games,

370
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,267
the big thing that we had done was the no loading screens,

371
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,468
which was a giant hassle.

372
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:38,010
On the first game, a lot of arguments over that one,

373
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,351
because so many things that you have to do,

374
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,352
so many unseen problems, and so many people

375
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,973
have to contribute to try to make that work.

376
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:47,534
And the no-cut camera was the same thing.

377
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:51,215
It was just me assigning a lot of work to the entire team.

378
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:52,816
It was insane.

379
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,717
And here's an awesome failed point.

380
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,074
I couldn't not use the word epic.

381
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:00,756
I couldn't find another word

382
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:01,837
that actually worked really good.

383
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:03,319
In fact, throughout the entire game,

384
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,780
I ended up just giving up and saying,

385
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,923
all right, fine, epic is the one I'm just going to accept

386
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,485
because operatic was not working

387
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,427
and most of the other things were not working.

388
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,510
And what I really wanted to highlight.

389
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,031
was this idea that in the previous God of War games,

390
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,152
we had exploration.

391
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,195
So we had a chest on the main path that you were at.

392
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:21,976
We had a hallway with a chest,

393
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,198
or a hallway that would go to a room with a chest.

394
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,500
But I wanted to really broaden the exploration.

395
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,763
I wasn't really admitting how big I wanted the game

396
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:31,603
to be at this point,

397
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:33,064
because I thought it would freak people out.

398
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:34,145
So I was just like,

399
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,666
oh, it's gonna be a little bit bigger, don't worry.

400
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:36,147
It's all good.

401
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:38,008
It's like 10 hours, 10 hours, man.

402
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:39,769
I'm not crazy, all right?

403
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:46,195
And something that Eric Williams and I had talked about in this early, early time was

404
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:49,877
this concept of simple and honest, right?

405
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:56,260
And this idea of being honest with ourselves, being honest with the team, and really getting

406
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,944
back to this concept of the simple mechanic being fun, finding many ways that something

407
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:08,466
individual can have different purposes, and getting back to the basics.

408
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,107
Right, getting back to the basics,

409
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,968
not only for the studio of focusing on the things

410
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,189
that we're really good at, but really getting back

411
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,630
to the basics of what this franchise was,

412
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,271
tearing everything out and kind of finding the things

413
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,532
that were sort of the load bearing walls of everything.

414
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,216
And the next thing was the play pyramid.

415
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:30,840
And this image, I am shocked that legal let me keep this in.

416
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,342
But I'm super excited about it because the road was

417
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,644
a really big influence for me.

418
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:36,866
I had written a short story early on that

419
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:39,188
was kind of a tone piece that helped people understand.

420
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,270
It was kind of the foundation of what

421
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,351
the beginning of the game was.

422
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,032
And

423
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:45,934
It was written in the way that it was just saying

424
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:46,655
the father and the son,

425
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:47,776
so even in the entire short story,

426
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,298
I never mentioned the name Kratos.

427
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:51,360
And I didn't mention Atreus because I hadn't figured out

428
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,704
the name until the end of 2016 or something like that,

429
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,567
because I'm super lazy when it comes to coming up with names.

430
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:58,788
I'm terrible at that.

431
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,331
But the play pyramid is this concept of saying,

432
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,793
what is making up your moment to moment gameplay?

433
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:04,554
Right?

434
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,876
And in a way, it's basically saying

435
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,776
that any time you're playing the game,

436
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,418
if you're not doing one of these sort of three core things,

437
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,919
then you need to evaluate whether or not

438
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,200
you should put a ton of effort into what

439
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,280
it is you're currently doing.

440
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,043
It's a way to evaluate, want to add something to the game.

441
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,824
Is it contributing to these sort of core concepts?

442
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,126
But I wanted to add another element inside of it.

443
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,447
which was this sort of central piece,

444
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:29,187
so that the game was about either narrative,

445
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,368
combat, or exploration.

446
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:34,449
And every one of those things fed into character development

447
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:35,910
so it didn't matter what we were doing,

448
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,371
everything had to help further the arcs of the characters.

449
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,791
Everything had to help get you

450
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,352
into the minds of the characters

451
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:44,072
so that you would never feel like,

452
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,813
oh, this is the time where you're telling me the story.

453
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:47,433
This is the time where I hit things.

454
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:50,390
And this image looks really bad.

455
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,774
And in all defense to the artists who helped me,

456
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,438
I asked them 10 minutes before I had to meet with Scott Rodey

457
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,279
if he could do something.

458
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,362
So this is better in 10 minutes than I

459
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:00,824
did in probably four weeks.

460
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:05,510
But I'm going to skip ahead now to the 2014 God of War

461
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,852
pitch for Shuhei Yoshida.

462
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,040
Okay, so this one was a little bit more refined.

463
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,461
I had already made the mistake of writing the wrong story

464
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:17,702
and telling the writers that we had to throw that story out

465
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:19,283
and that did not go well.

466
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:22,684
And then we started over, I kind of needed to buckle down

467
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,444
and figure out the skeleton structure

468
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:26,885
of what the entire game was so that I could then spend

469
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:30,265
the next three years doing these three hour long pitches

470
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,386
of walking people through the story

471
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,347
and then having them look at me at the end

472
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:36,627
and go like, how many teams are gonna work on this game?

473
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:37,999
This thing is huge.

474
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,681
So now we have a little bit fancier PowerPoint, right?

475
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:46,024
And also you can see that instead of narrative,

476
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:47,285
this is father-son.

477
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,627
And this was a reminder to myself,

478
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,169
the person who originally came up with these rules,

479
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,791
to follow the damn rules that I had actually set out to do.

480
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,034
And the father-son was to say the whole game story

481
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,635
was supposed to be about the relationship

482
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,036
between these two characters,

483
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,438
not necessarily about all these plotty elements

484
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:05,259
that we were really excited to explore.

485
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,319
So.

486
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,184
All of that sort of fed into the concept of character growth.

487
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,048
And the father-son story really is this kind

488
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,591
of relatable human story.

489
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,614
So much of the moments in this game

490
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,896
are just ripped from the lives of people on the team,

491
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,037
the writers, myself.

492
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:28,123
And this rule, the second one, is really something that

493
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,301
that I picked up while I was working with George Miller,

494
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,563
and he knew and had sort of been reinforced

495
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,704
by so many other people.

496
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,306
But I didn't really get it the first time he told me.

497
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:39,908
He's like, you always gotta dramatize your exposition.

498
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,149
I was like, okay, cool.

499
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,650
It just seems like that's what everybody does.

500
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,952
And that is absolutely not what everybody does.

501
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,492
It's insane.

502
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:46,853
So he gave me this example,

503
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,575
and it is a play that he went to go see.

504
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,017
And there are these two women on stage sitting on a couch,

505
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,799
and in between them is a phone.

506
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,522
And they start talking, and the phone begins to ring.

507
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:01,528
And it rings a couple of times before one of the women goes,

508
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:03,291
oh, well, aren't you going to answer that?

509
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:06,835
And she says, no, no, no, no, it's probably my son.

510
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:07,655
I don't want to talk to him.

511
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:09,636
And they continue talking for a little bit,

512
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:10,676
and the phone keeps ringing.

513
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,497
And the other woman finally says, you know what?

514
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:14,797
Maybe you should answer that.

515
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:15,657
What if he's sick?

516
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:16,297
What if he's hurt?

517
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:17,878
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

518
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:20,518
You know, we're not really good right now.

519
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:21,658
She starts talking about the fact

520
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:24,539
that they got into an argument, and the phone keeps ringing.

521
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,219
And this is pre-answering machines,

522
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,500
which is why that phone is going to keep fucking ringing

523
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,660
until somebody answers it.

524
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,022
And as it's going, the audience, you find yourself kind of

525
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,244
creeping up on the edge of your seat a little bit

526
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,184
and it's agitating you.

527
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:39,085
You're getting agitated like the other character

528
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,786
because you want her to answer the damn phone.

529
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,309
And they go and go, and what you find out

530
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,991
is that you are getting all of the exposition

531
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,532
about this character's relationship to her son

532
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,274
that normally, if we were lazy,

533
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,235
like a lot of the times I am very lazy,

534
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,917
you would get from Irving the explainer,

535
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,878
who just comes onto the scene and tells you,

536
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:00,979
here's all the backstory,

537
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,201
this is the sort of situation that I had.

538
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:05,222
But in that moment, what you got

539
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:09,847
was a feeling of empathy and a feeling of connection

540
00:23:09,907 --> 00:23:11,809
to a character because you were under stress.

541
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,111
You were taking part in the drama

542
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,612
and finding out about all of this

543
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,313
sort of boring backstory information.

544
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,096
And that stuck with me hugely,

545
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:21,677
because in what we do,

546
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:24,760
we can kind of translate that to play versus watch.

547
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,364
And there was so much in the game that we wanted to create in a play experience, right?

548
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:33,085
But it's really, really expensive.

549
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,567
You have all these sort of fail states and everything that you need to do.

550
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:41,011
So we did a lot, but there was still a lot more I felt like we could have done.

551
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,293
We just kind of continued to run out of time and said, all right, we have to pull these things out.

552
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:47,756
But then compensated and then every once in a while some other things got interactive.

553
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:51,699
So now the combat aspect, really the most important part

554
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,801
of this one, because I continue to love referencing Marvel,

555
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,623
is this idea of Marvel Comics versus Marvel Film.

556
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,484
So Dave Jaffe, when he was pitching the original game

557
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,205
back in 2000, well I came in 2003,

558
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:06,986
but he was doing it in 2002 before that,

559
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,308
would always talk about God of War

560
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,789
as heavy metal magazine meets...

561
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:13,910
Clash of the Titans, right?

562
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,872
It's sort of this bombastic comic book,

563
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:19,334
very mature adult, fantastic sort of experience.

564
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,236
And what we were trying to do

565
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:25,619
is bring it into the modern era, right?

566
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,040
And the games that we were playing,

567
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,521
the games that are exciting us of today,

568
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,162
we wanted to bring this in there.

569
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,284
We were looking at the way that Marvel

570
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,826
would translate comic books into film, right?

571
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:37,307
My mom would not read a Thor comic.

572
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,569
But she'd be damn sure she's gonna go see

573
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:41,731
Chris Hemsworth as Thor, right?

574
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:45,298
So I was like, as long as I cast Chris, I'm good, right?

575
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,098
My mom will play the game.

576
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,680
But that transition really showed

577
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,501
that you can take something fantastic

578
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,362
and bring it and expand the audience

579
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,324
and get them to connect to the work that you're doing.

580
00:24:57,624 --> 00:25:01,125
And the context in the drama was also another important thing

581
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:01,486
of saying.

582
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,147
A lot of us make games that have combat in them.

583
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:04,967
You know, it's fun.

584
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:08,029
It's very sort of frenetic and exciting

585
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,249
to have combat in your game,

586
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,450
but a lot of the times you don't have any context

587
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,992
of this combat within the drama of your game, right?

588
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:17,973
To actually feel like, oh, the combat means something

589
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:20,415
in the overall goal, and coming up with that simple goal,

590
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,616
at this time I had known that we were going to

591
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,357
take the ashes to the top of the mountain.

592
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,838
Everything started to feed into this goal that was simple.

593
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,322
Everybody understood it very quickly in the game,

594
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:31,526
and you were able to feel like each one of these fights

595
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,229
meant something even more.

596
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,932
And to a certain degree, we succeeded.

597
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:38,098
Certain degrees, we can continue to do better in all of that.

598
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:46,332
The exploration was a whole new thing for this game because I wanted it to be so much bigger than anything that we had done.

599
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:52,255
And at the time when I was pitching this, talking about the mechanics that would encourage discovery and exploration,

600
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,658
we didn't have those mechanics. We were still figuring a lot of stuff out.

601
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:58,079
In fact, the engine wasn't completely ready.

602
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,542
A lot of things were like Lego pieces all over the floor, and I'm trying to...

603
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,603
hey, we need to come up with new verbs of how to make puzzles.

604
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:07,164
And it's like, OK, but how?

605
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:09,085
We can't even build anything in the engine right now.

606
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,646
So that was very stressful.

607
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,567
This time, especially when we were doing exploration,

608
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,548
was one of the more stressful.

609
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,548
In fact, honestly, the whole damn project was stressful.

610
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:20,310
But there was a tremendous amount, for me,

611
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,391
of this doubt in wondering, are we

612
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,292
going to be able to finish any of this stuff?

613
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,513
Because there is just so much to get done.

614
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:32,333
And the character growth, everything feeding into that one,

615
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,214
I had really started to cement what this meant,

616
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,294
continue to say teach, right?

617
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:39,595
Even though I had no idea how teaching

618
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,056
was gonna take place in the game,

619
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,516
I had that fallback of like, okay,

620
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:43,957
well, upgrading is kind of like teaching.

621
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,257
Your kid gets better throughout the game.

622
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,358
But thankfully, working with the team,

623
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,600
they end up kind of contributing so many different ideas

624
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,582
that make that initial kernel of something a lot better.

625
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,724
But it was important to actually see these characters change,

626
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,706
not just in their dramatic art,

627
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,847
but in their sort of visual as well as their play,

628
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:03,070
so that it actually feels like what you're doing

629
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,932
is growing with these characters, experiencing their lives.

630
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,064
So the pitching of all this stuff,

631
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:13,248
I would be pitching all the way through the end of the project.

632
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:15,612
It would just continue ad nauseum.

633
00:27:15,772 --> 00:27:16,593
That's really all you do.

634
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,878
It's like selling cars to the team every day, over and over.

635
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,160
And nobody buys a damn car.

636
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,241
That's what's fucked up about it.

637
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,242
But the doubt also continues throughout all

638
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,183
of this experience.

639
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:31,865
And I know that everybody in here who makes games,

640
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,467
we all experience failure every day.

641
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,969
We all experience doubt every four minutes.

642
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:39,390
It's science, man.

643
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,310
I totally looked that up.

644
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:41,591
It's every four minutes.

645
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,453
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna tell a story now

646
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,735
because I fucking hate PowerPoint presentations.

647
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:49,738
And I'm gonna talk about the E3 2016 demo.

648
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:56,483
So this story encapsulates so many versions of doubt,

649
00:27:56,803 --> 00:28:01,247
so many areas of failure that we experienced on this project

650
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:05,030
and is kind of, for me, one of the most interesting

651
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,151
clips of game development.

652
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:12,095
So initially, we knew that we were gonna do a reveal.

653
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,897
We had honed in on E3 2016 as being the time

654
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:17,178
we were gonna do that reveal.

655
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:20,861
But I had no clue what it was gonna be.

656
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:22,142
Was it just gonna be a logo?

657
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:26,404
Were we just gonna show a quick clip of the game?

658
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,827
Were we gonna try to show a cut video together, right?

659
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,988
I was gonna try to sell people on a no-cut camera

660
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:33,289
and cut a bunch of shots together.

661
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:33,950
That wasn't gonna work.

662
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,991
Or were we gonna actually try to do a demo,

663
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,432
which was insane, right?

664
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,872
Like the first time you're gonna reveal your game

665
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:42,513
and you really don't have all the pieces together

666
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:43,093
and what are you gonna do?

667
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:45,814
You're gonna actually play a demo live on stage?

668
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,474
I totally chose that one,

669
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,676
because the thing was far away.

670
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,736
It was like nine or 10 months away.

671
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,677
So I was like, yeah, let's do the hardest thing.

672
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,598
And I feel like I do that all the time,

673
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:59,518
which is I agree to do something really hard

674
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,099
and then write when it comes time to do it.

675
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,508
it all, all my chickens go home to Ruth.

676
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:04,789
I'm like, what the hell, man?

677
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,191
Why did I agree to this?

678
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:09,714
So I started writing up different demo ideas,

679
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:12,016
just really jotting stuff down quickly.

680
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:14,418
And at the time, we had not figured out

681
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:15,119
the beginning of the game.

682
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,441
I had written the short story back then,

683
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,422
but we had not settled on,

684
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:19,703
hey, that's gonna be the beginning of the game.

685
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:22,425
We were focusing a lot on the middle section of the game,

686
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:25,087
so some stuff in the mountain, if you've all played the game.

687
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:27,308
you'll understand this part, inside the mountain.

688
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:29,449
And so I said, oh, you know what, I'm gonna do that.

689
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,729
I'm gonna write a demo up, it'll be inside the mountain.

690
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:35,530
It'll end at the elevator, kind of going up,

691
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,350
and there'll be a big scary monster reveal at the end

692
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,131
that screams, and then you go to black

693
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:42,291
all fucking dramatically.

694
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,491
It's so cheesy.

695
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,432
But I thought it was really great.

696
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:49,312
There was a part of me that was saying,

697
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:51,092
mm, this isn't so good.

698
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,693
So I was sending it to people on the team.

699
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,194
And I think they were just being nice, and they were like,

700
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:56,294
oh, yeah, sure, that's cool.

701
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:58,956
Oh, sure, that's cool is not the response

702
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:00,917
you want when you send somebody a demo writer.

703
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:01,857
You want them to be like, yeah.

704
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:06,620
So I got some notes from people and sort of settled on it.

705
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,141
We were like, all right, this is good.

706
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:10,342
But there's always something inside of me that was saying,

707
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:11,463
I don't think this is very good.

708
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,204
But to be honest, there is always

709
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:16,686
something inside of me that is saying, this is no good,

710
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:17,206
and you suck.

711
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,987
So I was like, all right, whatever, I'm going to ignore that.

712
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:22,909
And we were going to have the events people,

713
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:24,729
the PR people, and the marketing people

714
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,210
all coming down to the studio,

715
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,511
and I was going to do the pitch for them.

716
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,192
And it's kind of the same thing as this,

717
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,253
where you just get up and you wave your arms around a lot

718
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,274
because you're asking for money,

719
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:35,495
and you draw on the board,

720
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:38,856
and it looks really great in photos, right?

721
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,918
So I get in, I start doing the pitch,

722
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:44,059
and I realize like five minutes in,

723
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:47,059
that everybody's starting to fidget in their seats.

724
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,361
Some people are checking their phone.

725
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,982
I'm really losing them.

726
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:52,423
And I start to speak louder

727
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,785
because that totally makes the audience come back.

728
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:57,467
And that did not work.

729
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,149
And about halfway through the pitch, I realized.

730
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:02,837
this is absolute crap.

731
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:05,820
And you were right to think it was crap, because it's crap.

732
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,281
But I'm still giving the pitch.

733
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,584
So in my mind, I'm starting to think of ways to eject.

734
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,586
Like, OK, what can I do here?

735
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:14,867
I need to come up with a better solution.

736
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:15,668
This is not working.

737
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:18,590
And I start having a few ideas of potentially

738
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,972
the beginning of the game, a few visual ideas that are coming up

739
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,714
while I'm just running on autopilot on the pitch,

740
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:24,035
because I figure, why try?

741
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:25,136
It sucks.

742
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,197
They're not having fun.

743
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,258
I get all the way to the end of the pitch,

744
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,920
and everybody's, yeah, cool.

745
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,260
All right.

746
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:30,660
Yeah.

747
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,301
Nobody outright says it sucks.

748
00:31:33,782 --> 00:31:35,263
That's usually only on the development side.

749
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:36,524
We're very honest with each other,

750
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,245
but people in the PR and marketing groups,

751
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,926
they're all very nice, they're very good people.

752
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:43,128
And they will just say it sucks when they leave the room,

753
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:44,168
or when you leave the room.

754
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,290
So I was like, all right, thank you, everybody.

755
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,592
I left the room, and I think somebody had talked

756
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:52,313
to Shannon immediately afterwards and said,

757
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,619
Yikes, that was bad.

758
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,722
You know, it's not terrible, it's just not that exciting.

759
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,704
We've sort of seen it before, and they're right.

760
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:02,146
Everybody does that exact same demo for E3.

761
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,109
So I was like, all right, I was not feeling good.

762
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,911
I went to Shannon and I said,

763
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:08,252
I want to take another crack at this

764
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:09,834
because I don't think we've nailed it.

765
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:12,677
I don't think we have the idea down.

766
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:14,639
And she was like, oh, thank God.

767
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,170
And I was like, feelings, come on.

768
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:20,711
No, she was really cool about it.

769
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,591
She was like, all right, Barlog,

770
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,412
because she never calls me by a first name.

771
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:24,833
She said, all right, Barlog, go ahead.

772
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:26,254
Figure something out.

773
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:31,918
I wrote up a quick sort of skeleton of what it would be,

774
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:35,000
what ended up being the demo that we were doing.

775
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:39,824
And we got on a conference call with the events and PR people

776
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,605
because they were like, dude, the first one sucked.

777
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,866
I'm not coming down for that.

778
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,768
Just do it over the phone, which really sucks.

779
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:48,450
Pitching people in person, you get the big arms thing.

780
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:52,367
That carries like 50% of the work most of the time.

781
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,570
And then you could draw on the board, which is like another 25%.

782
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,194
So I really don't have to do a lot of work verbally.

783
00:32:57,855 --> 00:32:59,818
And then when you're on the little speakerphone thing,

784
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,322
it's pretty much just all what you're saying.

785
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,647
Surprisingly, the really rough pitch worked.

786
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,907
And they were like, okay, this is really good.

787
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,988
Thank you for taking our notes to heart.

788
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,889
And I was like, I'm not gonna tell you

789
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,270
that it wasn't your notes, but yes,

790
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,470
thank you for giving me notes.

791
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,831
And I took them all to heart,

792
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:21,132
and I redid everything based on what you were saying to me.

793
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:22,773
So they were like, all right,

794
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,233
well, we're gonna come down in another two weeks,

795
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,714
and we'll talk a little bit further

796
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:26,934
about what we're gonna do.

797
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,936
So they come down, I give them the full pitch

798
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:32,458
with the big arms thing, and that goes over really well

799
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,720
because everybody loves in-person pitches.

800
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:37,322
And at the end, I couldn't resist,

801
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:40,085
I threw in a little joke, and I said,

802
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:43,287
and then we can get Bear, and he can play live orchestra,

803
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:43,868
the whole thing.

804
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,149
And I was like, ha ha ha, and then one of the guys

805
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,212
who was in charge of throwing these events,

806
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:51,514
he's like the guy who does all the stage stuff

807
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:54,076
and everything, his eyes just get really big.

808
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:58,215
Like super excited and I was like wait, what happened?

809
00:33:58,275 --> 00:33:59,395
And then he looks over at somebody

810
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:01,496
and you could tell there was a conversation

811
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:04,398
that had happened about this before I threw that joke down.

812
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:06,619
And I was like, oh interesting, all right.

813
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:09,180
And then they basically did not talk about it

814
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,361
any further than that and then said,

815
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:11,922
what we're gonna do, we're gonna do the stage show,

816
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:12,742
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

817
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,363
And they said, we'll be down in another couple of weeks,

818
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:15,564
we'll show you a little bit more.

819
00:34:16,384 --> 00:34:17,725
So then another couple weeks go by,

820
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:18,725
I almost forget about this,

821
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:20,265
because we're starting to really figure out

822
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:22,266
how to structure this entire demo, how to build it.

823
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,046
And when they come down,

824
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:27,808
the guy whose eyes got really big had this little diorama.

825
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:31,209
He had created this little mock-up of a theater stage,

826
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:33,109
and it had these little slots

827
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,730
where you could put transparencies in

828
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,030
to show you what the things like the curtains

829
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,971
or the stage things that they would put in.

830
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,351
And he was so excited.

831
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,752
He was like, it's like when I get excited about something,

832
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,733
he's just pitching this, and he says,

833
00:34:45,173 --> 00:34:47,334
We're really excited about doing the live performance

834
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:48,836
to the live orchestra.

835
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:51,537
And I was like, wait, what?

836
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,240
And he was like, this is really good.

837
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,121
And we were talking about this, so we're really

838
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:57,722
going to make it happen.

839
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:58,582
We already talked to Bear.

840
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:01,484
And I'm like, inside, going, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

841
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,065
fuck, fuck, fuck.

842
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,247
But outside, I'm going, like, cool.

843
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:07,869
Let's do this, right?

844
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:11,014
So they give the whole breakdown of all this stuff.

845
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:12,697
And again, it's still pretty far away.

846
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:13,998
So I'm all right.

847
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,481
I'm like, all right, fine.

848
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,382
We'll figure this out.

849
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:19,827
But at the time, we're going through really stressful times

850
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:21,610
because one, engine's still getting built.

851
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,894
Two, the lighting was maybe 35% to 40%

852
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:28,055
of what it was gonna end up being in the final game.

853
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,617
And that was actually what we were gonna end up using

854
00:35:29,657 --> 00:35:31,498
for E3, so there was just no way

855
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:32,339
we were gonna get that done.

856
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,122
Art direction, we hadn't really been able to figure out

857
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:38,144
exactly what our art direction was going to be.

858
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,665
We were arguing back and forth a lot.

859
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:40,566
We had some ideas.

860
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:42,168
I had some specific things.

861
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,109
The art director at the time had some specific things.

862
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,251
And we were just really trying to hash that out.

863
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,553
At the same time, trying to figure out the combat.

864
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:50,135
trying to figure out the enemies.

865
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,997
We were literally, every aspect of the game

866
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:52,919
that you could try to figure out,

867
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:53,880
we were trying to figure out.

868
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,163
So we were trying to take an inaugural flight in a plane

869
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,345
while we were building the plane

870
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:59,227
and also drawing the blueprints of the plane.

871
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,211
as it was taking off.

872
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:04,713
It was fantastic and incredibly, incredibly stressful.

873
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,774
So as we're going closer, it starts to hit

874
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,836
that I'm gonna have to play this thing live, right?

875
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,536
And it's gonna be nine minutes.

876
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,137
So I start rehearsing,

877
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:16,918
and I'm gonna rehearse for like two months, right?

878
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,299
And I think, and there's a bunch of members

879
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,460
of the team here, so they'll probably agree with this,

880
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,740
I hope.

881
00:36:23,301 --> 00:36:24,841
This is probably the greatest time for the team

882
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,262
because I was basically playing for the team

883
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:28,822
while they all shouted notes at me

884
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,502
and then like wrote long emails of like,

885
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,763
you need to do this, you're doing this wrong,

886
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,583
you did this, you suck, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

887
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:38,444
And it was fantastic because I had to perfectly hit

888
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:39,964
all of these moves in an order

889
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:41,085
while we were also trying to figure out

890
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:43,045
which moves were going to be the best moves

891
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,765
to put in order while we were also designing them

892
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,106
and animating them and make them work.

893
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:49,306
And bless them, they figured out several tricks.

894
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:52,848
to sort of put the bumpers in the bowling lane,

895
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,188
the director version of it,

896
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:55,569
so I couldn't screw it up too bad.

897
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,870
So they had removed some of the potential

898
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,691
catastrophic failures that an idiot like me could do

899
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,172
if I hit the wrong button.

900
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:04,433
But still, I had to time everything,

901
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,513
I had to use the sticks,

902
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,214
I had to actually do all the combos

903
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:07,854
and everything like that,

904
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:09,255
I had to position myself correctly.

905
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,936
So I still had an opportunity to mess it up.

906
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:14,177
I had many, many, many opportunities

907
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:14,937
that I could mess it up.

908
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,440
And in a lot of my playthroughs, I would mess it up,

909
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,903
which was the face palm for everybody on the team.

910
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:22,465
Every time, I'd be like, I think I got it this time.

911
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:23,366
And I'd play for everybody.

912
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,508
And they'd be like, no, you're rushing this part.

913
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:26,289
You're not doing that part.

914
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:27,470
I was like, ah.

915
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:29,813
It was like the entire team was the director at that point.

916
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:30,854
And I was just like, take a note.

917
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:31,655
OK, yeah, that's good.

918
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,415
All right, all right, good.

919
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:35,948
Very, very stressful, but it was so much work

920
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,288
that I was like, all right, you know,

921
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,289
I think I can handle this, no big deal.

922
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,070
And as we're getting closer,

923
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,051
now in previous God of War games,

924
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,112
the thing I was remembering so much about E3

925
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:46,232
was like on God of War II,

926
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:49,274
we were burning demo discs at like 6 a.m.

927
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:52,095
the day of the show to drive them down

928
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:53,356
and put them in the machine

929
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,896
so people could play them on the floor.

930
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:57,958
So we really went right up against the edge.

931
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:01,879
But in this E3, we had to be done two weeks before.

932
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,163
So two weeks before E3, we had to be finished,

933
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:06,087
which felt weird, I think, to most of us,

934
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:07,570
going like, man, E3's not for two weeks.

935
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,532
This feels weird.

936
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:09,113
We're done.

937
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:10,697
What do we do with ourselves?

938
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,901
Make the rest of the fucking game, right?

939
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:16,484
But I was also then just rehearsing over and over

940
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:20,326
and over again and stressing about, OK, I have to hit this.

941
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,307
And then we had a couple of rehearsals with the orchestra.

942
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,628
But it was all leading up to the day of the show.

943
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:31,191
And throughout all this time, I am constantly just in my head

944
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,092
having this voice of, you're going to screw it up,

945
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:37,474
and having all these potential mess ups that I could do.

946
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:38,654
And on the day of the show, there

947
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,095
was going to be a dress rehearsal.

948
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,177
And then immediately after the dress rehearsal,

949
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,197
you had a little bit of a break,

950
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,558
and then the actual show would start.

951
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:46,638
So you'd kind of do it twice.

952
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:51,940
And I went down, and I'd like to go in that

953
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,961
we had not told anybody about the game.

954
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,922
So it was a complete surprise that God of War

955
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,423
was gonna be at this show,

956
00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:00,664
on one of the PSXs I might have said,

957
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,125
yeah, we're working on a God of War game.

958
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:04,084
But nobody paid attention to that.

959
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:08,667
And I basically had to put a hood on and nobody,

960
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,668
like anybody would fucking recognize me anyway.

961
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:12,809
Like at the time, I don't think anybody had any idea

962
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:14,990
who the hell I was, but it was all for me.

963
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,810
I was just like, yeah, I'm so,

964
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,832
I gotta go stealth in the back entrance.

965
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:21,653
And so I get in and I am just like,

966
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,774
I hadn't slept the night before.

967
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:26,056
I maybe slept 20 minutes, I was so freaking nervous.

968
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:30,258
And just constantly going over the demo in my head.

969
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,102
On the drive down there, there was a care man in the car interviewing me.

970
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:42,787
And I was already nervous, but every damn question he asked me made me more nervous.

971
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,808
Because it was really like, so you're afraid you're going to screw up?

972
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:46,950
How specifically do you think you'll screw up?

973
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:51,873
And when you do that screw up, what do you think is going to happen?

974
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:53,094
What do you think people are going to say on Reddit?

975
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:56,997
And I was like, you know, I hadn't gotten that specific in my neurosis to say,

976
00:39:57,037 --> 00:39:59,559
like, what is Reddit going to say? But I'm there now, dude. Thanks.

977
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:04,686
So I get in there and we do our dry run,

978
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:07,767
and this is the first time we did the fail run, right?

979
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:11,129
And that is that you have a kit, a backup kit,

980
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:13,730
and then the sort of ultimate fail,

981
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,051
the catastrophic sort of fail,

982
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:17,312
is you have to stand up and they turn on your mic,

983
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:19,853
and then you sort of apologize to the audience

984
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:22,354
that you suck and that you're gonna just roll a video.

985
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:25,155
And that hadn't been real for me until that moment.

986
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:27,115
I talked about it, but when we rehearsed it

987
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:29,135
and I had to like stand up in that empty theater

988
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:31,276
and say, sorry, it didn't work.

989
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,536
I was like, man, I do not want to do this again.

990
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:34,957
This is a one and done thing.

991
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:36,617
Because that's scary.

992
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:39,638
Like, not only is it screwing up the demo is scary,

993
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,938
but the fact that it doesn't crash, you know,

994
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,858
is something that you're hoping and hoping and hoping.

995
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:45,959
And if it crashes, that's just, it's normal.

996
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,039
That's game development, right?

997
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,120
It's no big deal, but it's still.

998
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,662
Crashing in front of a whole audience of people sucks,

999
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:53,002
right?

1000
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:54,423
And I did not want to do that.

1001
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,345
And it's a testament to our incredible team

1002
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,927
that our game was pretty darn stable at that point.

1003
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,688
So thank you to them.

1004
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,770
So I did the thing.

1005
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,692
And then Kevin Scharf, who was the producer at the time,

1006
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:07,133
and I went back into the green room.

1007
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:09,095
Now, the green room was basically just like curtains,

1008
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,616
like a box of curtains backstage.

1009
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:14,739
Had a couple tables and a little bar in there with some water.

1010
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,499
No booze.

1011
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,640
Searched everywhere.

1012
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,061
No booze.

1013
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,396
Which I think was a good thing.

1014
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,877
I probably really would have screwed up

1015
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:21,658
if there was booze there.

1016
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:26,021
So we're sitting there for, I guess we had 45 minutes

1017
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:27,902
before the show was gonna start, the actual show.

1018
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:29,463
And we're just kind of hanging out

1019
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:30,924
and I'm going through everything in my head

1020
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:32,666
and he's trying to keep me calm

1021
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,227
but anybody who tries to keep me calm

1022
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:35,568
is just making me less calm

1023
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:38,170
and I'm stressing more and worrying about all the things

1024
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,250
that could potentially go wrong

1025
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,812
when the curtains pop open

1026
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,435
and a Japanese man pokes his head in and looks around.

1027
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:47,604
And then he just quickly closes it.

1028
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:50,226
And I'm like, weird.

1029
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:52,849
It's like, that was weird, right, Kevin?

1030
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:54,090
And he's like, yeah, that's strange.

1031
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,572
And I'm like, whatever, it's Los Angeles,

1032
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:57,353
whatever, that's normal.

1033
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:01,096
So we're sitting there for another couple of minutes,

1034
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,479
and all of a sudden, in extremely dramatic fashion,

1035
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,761
the curtains burst open,

1036
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,463
and this group of people files in.

1037
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:13,487
And at the back of that group of people is Hideo Kojima.

1038
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:15,566
Right?

1039
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:16,867
Bathed in light.

1040
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:22,089
Fucking Magneto tiles below his feet.

1041
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,030
Right?

1042
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,771
And I was just like, oh, oh, wow.

1043
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,752
And then I suddenly became like five-year-old me.

1044
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,853
I was like, this is great.

1045
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:33,935
And he does the Hideo Kojima head nod.

1046
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,796
And then I do the whole like, so.

1047
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:43,039
Then they just walk in, sit down at the other table,

1048
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,640
as they're talking amongst themselves.

1049
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:46,593
And I was spending like the next five minutes

1050
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:48,495
trying to think of an opening line, right?

1051
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:49,775
Like to go over there and be like,

1052
00:42:49,796 --> 00:42:51,036
so you come to E3 often?

1053
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,240
I came up with nothing, but it distracted me away

1054
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,022
from being stressed out and then I realized

1055
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,403
I'm not gonna go over and talk to this guy.

1056
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,265
So I'm just gonna go back into my own little world.

1057
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:04,927
And about five minutes after that,

1058
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:08,509
one of the guys stands up, walks over to our table,

1059
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,694
and says, hello, we are going to eat Panda Express.

1060
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:23,570
It is going to stink.

1061
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:27,473
We're sorry.

1062
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:31,136
Then he bowed and walked back to the fucking table.

1063
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:40,344
Then I really thought it was weird.

1064
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,167
And I actually at that moment contemplated

1065
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:46,629
whether I was having some fucked up fever dream

1066
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,171
and that I had not yet gotten up.

1067
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:52,841
Unfortunately, they had called,

1068
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:55,683
I actually, interestingly, I actually asked Kojima

1069
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:58,205
if I could tell this story, because I thought,

1070
00:43:58,285 --> 00:43:59,526
oh, I should get permission

1071
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:01,287
before I can say this publicly.

1072
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:05,671
And I contacted somebody that I know that works with him

1073
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,413
and asked him about it, and he said, yeah, okay, hold on.

1074
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:10,835
Then he got back, and he said,

1075
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:13,837
yeah, Kojima doesn't even remember that.

1076
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:18,300
And I was like, oh, that's sweet, fantastic.

1077
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,362
I make a hell of an impression, right?

1078
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:28,514
So, they basically, curtains open again, time to go, right?

1079
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,956
Then it's the heart beating like absolute mad.

1080
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,537
I'm like, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap.

1081
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:35,119
So Kevin and I get up and they're escorting us back

1082
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,542
to the thing, he powers on my lav mic

1083
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,803
which just reminds me that oh,

1084
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,665
potentially we could have a catastrophic failure.

1085
00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:42,345
That sucks.

1086
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,307
And we're going up the stairs.

1087
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:47,389
And as we're going up the stairs to the balcony,

1088
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:50,746
Everything's going to start, right, very soon.

1089
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:52,268
People are already in the theater.

1090
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:53,449
The orchestra's all there.

1091
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,432
I realized that I forgot everything about the whole demo.

1092
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:01,087
And that was a horror story of mine going like,

1093
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:03,589
oh man, it's like going and taking a test

1094
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:04,430
and you forget everything.

1095
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,351
But I didn't think that would actually happen.

1096
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:07,592
And it legitimately happened.

1097
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:09,073
I was so amped up about this.

1098
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:10,574
I was so scared about all this

1099
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:13,676
that I legitimately forgot what I was supposed to do.

1100
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:14,837
I couldn't remember the first button.

1101
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:15,637
I couldn't remember the cue

1102
00:45:15,657 --> 00:45:16,678
that I was supposed to come in on.

1103
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:17,779
And I was like, oh crap.

1104
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,400
And we're sitting down and Kevin's sitting next to me.

1105
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,041
And I'm like, do I tell Kevin

1106
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:22,201
that I don't remember any of it?

1107
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,470
Because maybe he'll remember the first thing,

1108
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,370
and that'll get me started.

1109
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,591
But if I tell him, that makes it real.

1110
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,333
So if I just keep it inside, then maybe everything

1111
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,273
will be fine, right?

1112
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,534
So I'm just stressing the whole time, like, oh my god,

1113
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:35,555
oh my god, what's the first thing?

1114
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:36,355
What's the first thing?

1115
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,677
And I literally can think of almost every game

1116
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:41,618
that I'd ever played, except what I was supposed

1117
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,539
to be playing at the time.

1118
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:45,965
And at a certain point in the overture,

1119
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,527
I had been able to see the kind of tablature screen

1120
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,369
that was playing for Baer as he was composing

1121
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:53,529
or as he was conducting.

1122
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,331
And I was like, oh, it just came back to me.

1123
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,393
Like an image on the screen made me realize like,

1124
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:01,734
oh, I gotta hit start at that point when it says 110.

1125
00:46:01,874 --> 00:46:03,575
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1126
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:07,037
And then it kind of just started to slowly fall into place.

1127
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:10,322
And it turned out, I think several people on the team

1128
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:11,803
had said that I did pretty good.

1129
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:12,523
I didn't screw it up.

1130
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:14,323
I think it was the best I can get.

1131
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,024
That it actually worked out really well.

1132
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:20,165
And in the end, it actually did work out really well.

1133
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:22,005
People responded very positively.

1134
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:25,106
That reveal of Kratos, we were really excited about Kratos

1135
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:26,786
coming out of the shadows, but I don't think any of us

1136
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:28,807
had any clue the kind of response

1137
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,527
we were going to get for that.

1138
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,747
So that was super overwhelming and awesome.

1139
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:35,528
And I think the important thing about all of that

1140
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:41,360
about the entire thing besides the fact that I hung out with Kojima while he ate Panda Express.

1141
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:43,548
And he was not kidding.

1142
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:45,249
It fucking smelled like orange chicken back there

1143
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,249
for like an hour.

1144
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:47,250
It was crazy.

1145
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,491
Was that throughout all of it,

1146
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,932
all of us, and me especially,

1147
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:56,193
I was experiencing doubt at every single step of the way.

1148
00:46:57,334 --> 00:47:00,555
It was this sort of imposter syndrome times a thousand,

1149
00:47:00,915 --> 00:47:03,616
this feeling of what I have to say isn't valid,

1150
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,657
what I'm doing isn't all that good.

1151
00:47:06,697 --> 00:47:08,258
And pushing through that,

1152
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:10,399
breaking through each one of those walls

1153
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:11,339
kind of led to...

1154
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,243
Well, sadly, another wall of doubt that would be there.

1155
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:17,585
But that was sort of the process.

1156
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:19,867
That was the process of pushing through all of that

1157
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:22,809
and ensuring that we could get to that end result.

1158
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,810
And there was times even.

1159
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:27,785
right before, in that two week span before E3,

1160
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,907
where we're kind of refining last bits of things

1161
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:32,427
in the play experience,

1162
00:47:32,948 --> 00:47:34,248
where there was even members of the team,

1163
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:37,750
very good people, you know, not malicious whatsoever.

1164
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,812
They weren't being mean about it, but they were nervous.

1165
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,253
They were telling me, oh my God,

1166
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,234
I think you're gonna screw up the franchise.

1167
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,555
Like, this is a terrible way to present it.

1168
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:48,836
One person told me, why don't we have a boss fight

1169
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:49,216
at the end?

1170
00:47:49,537 --> 00:47:50,718
We should have a big boss fight.

1171
00:47:51,098 --> 00:47:52,339
I think another person even suggested

1172
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,900
we should have Balder on a dragon

1173
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,922
kind of come up when they're at the deer and be like,

1174
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,003
I've been looking for you.

1175
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:01,767
All these crazy last minute suggestions that I was like,

1176
00:48:01,827 --> 00:48:02,747
oh my god, no.

1177
00:48:02,827 --> 00:48:04,829
And I was basically just saying, don't worry.

1178
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,832
Everything will be fine, even though inside I'm going,

1179
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,034
oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

1180
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:15,358
And it's something to remember, I think, for all of us

1181
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:16,479
in what we do.

1182
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,259
at any time, the next time probably,

1183
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,700
which is five minutes from now,

1184
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,601
you're gonna be hearing that voice in your head,

1185
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:26,942
or the voices directly around you,

1186
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,822
the people that you work with that say

1187
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:34,104
that you're wrong, you have nothing good to say,

1188
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:36,425
you're going in the wrong direction,

1189
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:40,326
why are we doing this, you suck, you're a jerk,

1190
00:48:40,366 --> 00:48:42,147
well, the last two are just me talking to myself.

1191
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:43,988
Remember.

1192
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,632
that those voices are wrong.

1193
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:50,713
And sometimes they're right.

1194
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:53,494
Because if you remember all the way back at the beginning,

1195
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,736
I was actually right to doubt that crappy demo

1196
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:58,697
because it was crap.

1197
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,558
And that's the messed up part about doubt in general,

1198
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,999
is that it's right as much as it's wrong.

1199
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,181
And it is up to all of us individually

1200
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:10,603
for each individual situation to be honest with ourselves,

1201
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:11,703
to trust.

1202
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:17,667
ourselves to trust the people around us because they're the ones who really do all the great

1203
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:24,212
stuff anyway. I just sort of bask in the limelight of their awesomeness. And really endeavor

1204
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:31,157
to push through every one of those fucking doubt walls because on the other side is always

1205
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:37,121
something better than where you were at from the beginning. So there you go. That is my

1206
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:40,604
little chat at GDC. Thank you, everybody.

1207
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:45,546
How much time do we have?

1208
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:50,727
Ah, perfect.

1209
00:49:54,488 --> 00:49:54,828
Oh wait.

1210
00:49:57,568 --> 00:49:58,049
Thank you.

1211
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:00,169
See, I got a slide for thanking you.

1212
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:04,330
Okay, so we have 10 minutes and we can do questions.

1213
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,211
So, feel free to ask any questions

1214
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:10,211
except the following two questions.

1215
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:12,810
What are you working on right now,

1216
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:14,472
or is there going to be another God of War?

1217
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,154
I can't answer that.

1218
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,183
Two, don't ask who blew the fucking horn.

1219
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:28,086
Because we're not going to tell you.

1220
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:29,727
That's like the polar bear in Lost, man.

1221
00:50:29,747 --> 00:50:30,748
I'm not going to say anything about that.

1222
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:32,110
All right, great.

1223
00:50:32,894 --> 00:50:33,795
Fire away, my friend.

1224
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:34,856
Hi.

1225
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:34,916
Hi.

1226
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:38,318
You talked about a situation with the E3 demo, which

1227
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:40,580
was great, where you listened to some intuition

1228
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,161
that you had to change it preemptively.

1229
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:43,642
I was wondering if you could also

1230
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:46,644
give an example of a time when other people's feedback,

1231
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:47,965
other people's notes, were actually

1232
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:49,206
really informative in you changing

1233
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:50,166
your mind in the process.

1234
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:53,589
Oh, that's a lot of examples.

1235
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,830
My mind was changed many times.

1236
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,793
OK, there's a really good point in the game

1237
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,916
the son becomes a jerk, right?

1238
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:06,837
And we had a whole slew of gameplay

1239
00:51:07,157 --> 00:51:09,338
that we needed to build around that.

1240
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:11,358
So there was about an hour of gameplay where he was a jerk.

1241
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,239
And we had to cut it.

1242
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,440
So there was a point where production-wise, time-wise,

1243
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,461
no more big arms were gonna give me more money,

1244
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:22,142
that I just had to, I had to get rid of it.

1245
00:51:22,702 --> 00:51:25,923
But that meant that a huge chunk of the story

1246
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:27,863
was getting cut out, and we needed to figure out

1247
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:29,064
how to put it back in place.

1248
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:31,004
And I was like, OK, you know what?

1249
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,825
We're just going to do something really quick.

1250
00:51:32,845 --> 00:51:33,825
We'll do this small piece.

1251
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:34,865
We'll do a small cinematic.

1252
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:37,506
Because I had been selling people for so long

1253
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:41,427
and begging people for so long to put more effort in, do this,

1254
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:43,487
can add this extra thing, that I figured

1255
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,467
this was the thing that's going to break them

1256
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:46,768
if I asked them to go too far.

1257
00:51:47,368 --> 00:51:49,848
And the animators, the cinematic group,

1258
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:53,609
were actually the ones that went far beyond the initial ask.

1259
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,270
So I thought, oh, we'll be fine if we just

1260
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:55,970
do this one little thing.

1261
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,550
They're like, no, no, no.

1262
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,730
I think we can do something even better.

1263
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,750
And they worked with Eric Williams.

1264
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,532
they actually came up with the moment

1265
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,254
that something that we talked about way early on in the game

1266
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:05,375
which was I wanted to see Atreus try to be rage mode.

1267
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:07,157
Right, but we ended up not getting it.

1268
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:08,578
Had I not cut that stuff,

1269
00:52:08,998 --> 00:52:11,860
we would not have had the animators be superheroes

1270
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,182
and actually make that cinematic when Modi returns

1271
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:16,824
and then Atreus gets all raged out, right?

1272
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:18,766
They brought all that back

1273
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,427
and it was sort of their contribution,

1274
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:23,269
their pushing that added something,

1275
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,511
I think, that was so critical to the arc

1276
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:26,852
that I was not even able to see.

1277
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:27,872
Thank you.

1278
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:30,042
Fantastic.

1279
00:52:30,222 --> 00:52:30,482
Yes.

1280
00:52:30,802 --> 00:52:31,203
Hi, Corey.

1281
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:32,183
Thank you so much for the talk.

1282
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:33,404
Thank you.

1283
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:33,805
Question.

1284
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:35,146
I'm an audio guy a little bit.

1285
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:35,906
Hello, audio guy.

1286
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:36,747
Hey, what's going on?

1287
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:38,508
I can't hear you.

1288
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:40,029
Oh, really?

1289
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:41,690
Oh, my god.

1290
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,451
My biggest fear.

1291
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:46,174
So as a big fan of the series, one of the biggest things

1292
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:48,796
that shocked me was when you went from the voice

1293
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:50,717
actor of TC Carson to Christopher Judge.

1294
00:52:50,857 --> 00:52:51,598
Yes.

1295
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:54,560
I mean, I hated it for the first three hours of gameplay,

1296
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:54,960
honestly.

1297
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:59,705
Three hours it took you three hours to not hate it. All right, I'm

1298
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:03,509
I feel like PC Carson was Kratos. He is amazing

1299
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:08,193
Yeah, so like how did you like but then I ended up really loving Christopher judge

1300
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:11,897
I like wow, this guy's he made the new Kratos. What made you like decide to make the switch?

1301
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:14,686
It was a complex series of decisions.

1302
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,868
So in the early portion of the game,

1303
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:20,671
we had used TC in Ascension, a game that I did not work on,

1304
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:23,773
but I had heard some of the stories of how it worked.

1305
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,754
And TC was actually in the suit, right,

1306
00:53:25,814 --> 00:53:27,916
so that they were shooting a lot of these scenes on there.

1307
00:53:28,296 --> 00:53:31,679
TC is a smaller guy, he is a classically trained dancer,

1308
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,601
and when he moves, it is almost impossible

1309
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:36,843
for him to not move fucking gracefully.

1310
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:38,824
He just floats.

1311
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:40,946
He's magical, right?

1312
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,610
And it created a lot of work for the animators afterwards

1313
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,613
to have to kind of reanimate to make him feel like Kratos,

1314
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:49,314
this big, imposing guy, right?

1315
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:53,138
TC was absolutely sort of a product of the PS2 era

1316
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:55,040
where you could do all the animation

1317
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,661
and then you could record the voice afterwards.

1318
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:58,863
But to get the scenes that I wanted,

1319
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:00,986
I knew I had to have all the actors on stage.

1320
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,435
because we were doing that one single camera shot.

1321
00:54:03,935 --> 00:54:05,596
We experimented a little bit early on

1322
00:54:05,636 --> 00:54:08,237
where we got a stand-in person that was large

1323
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:10,859
and they would be Kratos, they would perform on the stage

1324
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:13,300
and then we would go after the fact and record TC.

1325
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,402
So we started to run the numbers on that one,

1326
00:54:16,442 --> 00:54:19,384
we started to run the time and apparently like 2036

1327
00:54:19,484 --> 00:54:23,506
was when we'd finished the game if we did it in this method.

1328
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:25,927
It was insane how much work it would end up being.

1329
00:54:25,987 --> 00:54:29,069
So it was very, for me, a difficult decision

1330
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:30,610
because.

1331
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:34,469
He's such an intrinsic part of the franchise,

1332
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:36,489
but I knew like, okay, if we're gonna do this,

1333
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:37,549
we're just gonna have to do this.

1334
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:38,770
I'm gonna have to commit to recasting,

1335
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,250
and it turned out to be one of the hardest things, right?

1336
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,931
Two people that were hard to cast, Balder and Kratos.

1337
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,491
Both of those characters took almost, you know,

1338
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:47,952
three, three and a half years.

1339
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:50,152
I found a kid, like, in the first set of auditions.

1340
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:50,933
It was ridiculous.

1341
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:53,153
So I thought everything would be that easy.

1342
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:53,693
It was not.

1343
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:56,234
Thank you so much, appreciate it.

1344
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:56,734
Thank you.

1345
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:58,784
Yes, sir.

1346
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:00,406
Excellent talk, excellent game.

1347
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:00,986
Oh, thank you, sir.

1348
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,128
Congratulations on all the awards.

1349
00:55:02,288 --> 00:55:04,190
You are awesome, and I think we all here agree.

1350
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,393
No, my head is just getting huge now.

1351
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:07,574
Thank you.

1352
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:08,295
Thank you.

1353
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:15,898
You mentioned that you originally pitched the game in June 2013, right?

1354
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:21,001
Which a game that some of us may know came out around that time, The Last of Us.

1355
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,042
I haven't heard of that. What's it about?

1356
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:24,823
Yeah, it's very cool, very cool.

1357
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:29,226
There are some, I mean obviously there's like a lot of similarities between the two,

1358
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:31,527
even though both games stand on their own and they're very unique.

1359
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:35,950
Were you worried at any point that people would draw the comparison

1360
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,291
and whether there could be negatives to that or not?

1361
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:40,650
I think a little bit.

1362
00:55:41,352 --> 00:55:42,635
There was a little part of me that said,

1363
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:46,964
when I played that game, it was this sort of.

1364
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:50,877
awakening moment, I think, for this industry.

1365
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,779
Now, prior to this game, a lot of great games

1366
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:58,144
have been doing very dark and very intense subject matter.

1367
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:00,206
So it's not as if they were the first ones to do it.

1368
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:01,307
I don't think they claim it either.

1369
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:04,850
But they were the first ones to have a broad audience for this,

1370
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:07,973
to show me, to show everybody else in the industry

1371
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:10,175
that people wanted this kind of content.

1372
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:15,158
that people actually were interested in something that challenged them emotionally.

1373
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,799
And I thought, okay, this is the opportunity.

1374
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,181
This is the opportunity now that people are actually claiming for content like this.

1375
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:26,763
I did fear a little bit that people were going to make the comparisons and boy, howdy, was I right.

1376
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:29,745
The first like year after the announcement was basically just like the

1377
00:56:29,865 --> 00:56:34,307
Last of Us of War and every other variation on that one.

1378
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:36,329
Although I really did like all the gifs that

1379
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:39,470
were created after we released, sort of making fun

1380
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:39,991
of all of that.

1381
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:42,873
But I think as we were developing,

1382
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:44,353
we all realized that we were going

1383
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:45,494
in a very different direction.

1384
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,896
The two games are so, so very different.

1385
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:51,458
But the fact that we were in close, we were personal,

1386
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:54,119
and we were trying to tell this story about two characters

1387
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:55,920
struggling to have a relationship,

1388
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,681
you're never going to be able to escape that.

1389
00:56:58,162 --> 00:57:04,804
Right? That is the same way that, you know, many movies that have very high level concepts that are similar are always going to have the same comparisons.

1390
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:08,185
But I think each thing sort of always stands on its own.

1391
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:09,405
Right. Thank you.

1392
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:10,665
Thank you. Yes, sir.

1393
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:12,486
There are people in both.

1394
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:13,826
Oh my gosh, sorry.

1395
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:17,207
What's your favorite thing that you had to cuss or that got cussed?

1396
00:57:18,128 --> 00:57:19,528
What? My favorite thing that what?

1397
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:23,129
What's your favorite, like, feature or thing that you had to cuss in order to get to this?

1398
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:24,330
Oh, my favorite thing that I had to cut.

1399
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,897
Does everybody remember the eagle in the background of Helheim?

1400
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:32,179
Yeah, yeah, that one, there was,

1401
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,361
that one was in all the way from the beginning.

1402
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:36,283
When I had to write the story, the skeleton of the story,

1403
00:57:36,303 --> 00:57:38,204
I just added some eagle into the story

1404
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:39,385
because I couldn't figure out how to end it

1405
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:40,906
and I had to pitch the whole story to the team,

1406
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:42,007
so I just threw something in there.

1407
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:44,669
And I wanted to figure out a way to how to keep this eagle in

1408
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,570
and the art director actually had fallen in love

1409
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,052
with the eagle as well, so he was pushing

1410
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:50,873
to put it in and animate it.

1411
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:52,594
even when we had to cut it as a boss.

1412
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:53,595
So we had to cut it as a boss,

1413
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:55,756
we ran out of like so many bosses that we were planning,

1414
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:57,777
we just had to cut because it takes so many people,

1415
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:01,700
so much money, so much time to do one of these bosses

1416
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,801
because we are crazy people, perfectionists,

1417
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:06,022
and we wanna make them awesome and big.

1418
00:58:06,643 --> 00:58:08,284
And there was actually a moment.

1419
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:11,445
where the eagle sort of randomly appeared

1420
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:13,826
in one of the levels, like skunk work style.

1421
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:16,166
So I was like, oh man, it's making a comeback.

1422
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:19,248
And I think one of the producers had referred to it as,

1423
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:21,608
oh man, that eagle is like a giant fuck you to production.

1424
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:22,329
Right?

1425
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,230
And I love everybody in production,

1426
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,311
but I also really love that phrase.

1427
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:29,031
That was hilarious.

1428
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:30,071
Thank you.

1429
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:31,192
Wait, over here.

1430
00:58:32,572 --> 00:58:32,912
No more?

1431
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:35,733
Let's do one more, because I totally messed these guys up.

1432
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,534
I skipped them, so there you go.

1433
00:58:39,325 --> 00:58:42,270
Hi, I was wondering about the E3 demo.

1434
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,815
You were talking about how they tried to add bumpers

1435
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:50,001
to make sure you try to mitigate the chances of failure.

1436
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:51,844
What were some of those bumpers that were added?

1437
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:59,499
They had situations where I wouldn't be able to do certain wrong moves in certain areas

1438
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,064
so that if I enter a zone or an area they would make sure that the combo would click

1439
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:09,488
the way that I needed to click it, but I still had to position properly and time each one

1440
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:12,891
of those, but I couldn't accidentally suddenly pull out a special move or anything like that.

1441
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:17,675
They had put some sort of invisible collision bumpers

1442
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:20,858
that kind of helped me cutting corners or times

1443
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:22,820
when I had to walk and rotate the camera.

1444
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,041
So there's a lot of times where I was walking around

1445
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,463
and I'd have to do these like really smooth camera sweeps

1446
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:29,425
to kind of give people the feeling of, ah, so majestic.

1447
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:32,688
So we found all these ways to kind of make it just

1448
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:35,371
a little bit easier without automating anything

1449
00:59:35,411 --> 00:59:37,172
because we still wanted that feeling of, oh yeah,

1450
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:39,494
it's actually me on the sticks doing this.

1451
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:42,136
All right.

1452
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,949
I think that's it, thank you, thank you.

1453
00:59:45,513 --> 00:59:47,041
Everyone's saying, the red shirts are saying we're done.
