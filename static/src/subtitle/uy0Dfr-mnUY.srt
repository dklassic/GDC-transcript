1
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:06,883
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:10,464
We're back here after lunch.

3
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:12,705
Welcome again to the Independent Game Summit.

4
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,066
My name is Yon.

5
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:17,247
I'm one of the advisory board members of the Independent Game

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:17,487
Summit.

7
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,048
And I have the pleasure to introduce you

8
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,509
to Eric Johnson, who's going to be talking

9
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,850
about knowing your market.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,950
Let's give him a big round of applause.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,693
I'll say one more quick thing.

12
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,413
Real quick, make sure your phones are on silent.

13
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:33,694
Don't jiggle your badge too much.

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,195
And make sure you fill out your evaluation.

15
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:35,475
Thank you.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,270
Thank you.

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,391
So yes, knowing your market, making games that sell.

18
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,752
Apparently this is a popular topic.

19
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,832
Who knew people would be interested in paying

20
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:46,193
their rent?

21
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,074
I want to start by telling you a little bit about how

22
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,414
I got into this topic.

23
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:54,796
I'm a developer.

24
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,416
I worked on a game called Life Goes On.

25
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,997
And this is a puzzle platformer where

26
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,858
you have to sacrifice your knights

27
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,718
and use their dead bodies to solve puzzles.

28
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:11,856
And so we released this on Steam in 2014, and then in 2016 we did a major content expansion

29
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,616
and a release on the PlayStation 4.

30
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:19,277
And during development we had a lot of indicators that maybe we had a hit on our hands.

31
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:24,859
We got media coverage, we won awards, we got on Steam back when that was a more difficult

32
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,299
thing to do.

33
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,440
But if you've heard this sort of story before, you know where this is going.

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,292
Neither the initial release nor the 2016 follow-up

35
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,192
ever really lived up to our expectations.

36
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,953
And in trying to understand the sales performance

37
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,414
or the lack thereof, I've developed an interest

38
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,555
in market analysis that borders on the obsessive.

39
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:47,215
And so I've done lots of research

40
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,316
to try to understand this stuff,

41
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,316
the factors and what drives game sales,

42
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:52,397
and I've learned a lot of things

43
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:54,518
that I wish I had known before we started on Life Goes On.

44
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,456
And because of all of this, I have developed a shocking amount

45
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:02,097
of enthusiasm for data analysis and statistics.

46
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,479
So, I'm not saying that you should be looking at everything

47
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,839
from the point of view of making money.

48
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,300
And if you're making games to get rich,

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,940
you are probably in the wrong industry.

50
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:17,801
And there's also lots of non-commercial reasons to make games.

51
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,743
But if you're planning on selling a game, you have to at least look

52
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,603
at it from a business perspective to some extent

53
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:24,683
and be aware of this stuff.

54
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,606
So what causes games to sell?

55
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:32,570
I want to present the argument that it's not just luck.

56
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,212
It's not just how good the game is.

57
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,715
It's not just your connections and who you know.

58
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:39,498
It's not just your ability to promote and advertise

59
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,259
and market your game.

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,142
These are all super, super valuable factors,

61
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,205
but they don't account for market fit,

62
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,386
which I think is also something

63
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:48,588
that is super, super important.

64
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:54,309
And so a lot of what I'm talking about here is trying to figure out what people want,

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,618
and particularly if enough people want what you're making to justify your making it.

66
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,142
And this is something that we never really thought about it

67
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:06,283
from this perspective when we were working on Life Goes On.

68
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,184
We knew we had this sort of clever idea.

69
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,965
We knew it was really cool to work with

70
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,246
from a game design perspective.

71
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,186
And we knew that people thought it was neat.

72
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,647
But we never really gave a lot of thought

73
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,008
towards whether this was something

74
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,209
that people were going to be really excited to actually buy.

75
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,751
To give you some context, I'm talking about indie games

76
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,472
on SIGGYM and selling them.

77
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:31,796
And what I'm going to say is going to get less applicable the further away from that you get.

78
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:39,882
So free-to-play is different. The consoles have a different marketplace. Mobile is even more

79
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:47,007
different. And factors like Steam Direct and the growth of the Chinese audience on Steam

80
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:51,671
have really changed things in the last year and things might be very different a year from now.

81
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,339
So let's start with tools and techniques.

82
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,600
How do you keep on top of this stuff?

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,441
How do you know what has sold and what hasn't?

84
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,023
Turns out there's loads of information readily available.

85
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,244
And if you're interested in this stuff at all,

86
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,925
you probably already know all about Steam Spy,

87
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,386
which is a service that scrapes Steam

88
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,427
and creates a statistical estimate

89
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,648
of how many people have a game in their Steam library.

90
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,510
Steam Spy is an absolutely fantastic resource,

91
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,511
super, super useful, but you have to be aware

92
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,831
that owners on Steam Spy are not the same thing as sales.

93
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,872
There's lots of different ways a game

94
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:26,633
can get into a user's library.

95
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,474
You've got bundles, giveaways, free weekends,

96
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:30,395
all sorts of stuff like this

97
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,495
that can inflate the owner count.

98
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,816
And also that accuracy is low for new games

99
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,337
and games that don't have very many owners.

100
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,459
Something that turns out to be surprisingly useful

101
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,620
is the review system on the Steam store page itself.

102
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,996
Particularly, it shows you a count of reviews

103
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,617
by Steam purchasers versus other sources.

104
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,478
And this gives you a lot of insight

105
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,379
into how well a game is actually sold, on Steam at least.

106
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,961
There's a technique called the box lighter method,

107
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,422
where you can estimate the number of people

108
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:02,143
who bought a game on Steam and played it

109
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,743
by multiplying the reviews by 50.

110
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,685
Though some games might have a much higher

111
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:07,785
or lower multiplier than that,

112
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,046
so this is a pretty rough estimate.

113
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,640
And in addition to Steam Spy and the review counts,

114
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,901
you can get discount and bundle history

115
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,062
from Is There Any Deal?

116
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,283
You can get concurrent player history from Steam Charts.

117
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:22,445
You can get regional price differences

118
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,926
and loads of package details from SteamDB.

119
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,688
Okay, let me talk about what I've learned

120
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:29,869
from all of my obsessing.

121
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,330
Have you heard this before?

122
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,051
If your game didn't sell well,

123
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:35,672
you just need to make a better game next time.

124
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,234
Quality certainly does matter.

125
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:45,273
But to think that game quality is the only factor, or even the dominant factor, in a game's success

126
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:50,836
is the fallacy of believing that the world is fair and just. And this isn't always the case.

127
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:56,919
In the context of Life Goes On, I want to say that it is far from a perfect game. There are

128
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,942
many things that I wish we had done differently. There are a hundred things that I wish I could

129
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:06,045
change and improve on right now. But we did have some external indications that people might like it.

130
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,205
And there was something that really came as a surprise to us,

131
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:13,788
and that was that when we did the 2016 content expansion

132
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,688
and PlayStation release,

133
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,150
we significantly improved the quality level of the game,

134
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,931
but we didn't see sort of a corresponding increase

135
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,072
in sales or revenue.

136
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,873
And this contradiction was one of the big factors

137
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,814
motivating me to try to better understand the market.

138
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,696
Okay, time to get into the numbers.

139
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:30,997
I hope you like stats.

140
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:36,709
I've done some rough revenue estimates for every non-free-to-play game on Steam.

141
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,553
This is based on the Steam Spy data, plus some additional data I've collected from

142
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:42,414
Steam Store pages.

143
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:48,699
This estimate is rough, but I think for broad sort of trend analysis it's very useful.

144
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,082
Something to note, this doesn't include DLC or in-app purchases.

145
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,624
This is estimating initial purchase revenue only.

146
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,845
The revenue is shown on the y-axis here on this chart.

147
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:02,147
And this is shown on a log scale,

148
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:03,888
so points at the top of the graph

149
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:05,930
have several orders of magnitude more revenue

150
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,810
than the points at the bottom.

151
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:11,254
And this chart in particular is comparing this revenue

152
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:12,475
to Steam user score.

153
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,857
So I've computed Spearman's rho,

154
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,298
which is a correlation measure

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,221
that basically measures if x goes up, does y also go up?

156
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:25,825
And a 1.0 would indicate perfect correspondence,

157
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,426
whereas a zero would say that we're looking at random noise.

158
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:32,308
With a 0.31, this means that we're sort of looking

159
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,909
at medium to low correlation.

160
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,610
So, but we do have some correlation

161
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,771
between user score and revenue.

162
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:40,192
So hooray, there is some justice in the world.

163
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,151
But this isn't a super strong correlation,

164
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,673
but maybe we shouldn't be surprised by that.

165
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:50,376
GTA V has a 68% positive user score.

166
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:52,958
PUBG is only a 56% positive.

167
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,660
These are incredibly popular games,

168
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,761
but they have these somewhat unhappy player bases.

169
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:01,784
And so while I'm very proud of Life Goes On's 96% positive,

170
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,966
I really can't argue against PUBG's success.

171
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:10,257
Let's look at a similar data set related to Metacritic score.

172
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:13,077
This time we see a stronger correlation with a row of .44,

173
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,779
which is getting into sort of medium to strong territory.

174
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,680
And so we are seeing evidence that game quality does matter,

175
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,181
both with player and critic reviews.

176
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:25,701
So if you do make a better game,

177
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:28,042
you will probably trend towards making more revenue.

178
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,594
The next thing I want to talk about is genre.

179
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:36,835
This is sort of the far out view of how viable

180
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,176
different types of games are.

181
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:42,238
Or should you make a puzzle platformer in 2018?

182
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:44,720
The answer is no.

183
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:50,283
So once upon a time, games like Fez, Braid, and Limbo

184
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,384
sort of defined what indie success was.

185
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,545
But the market has dramatically shifted since then.

186
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,447
There've been really very few breakthrough

187
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,188
puzzle platformer successes since about 2014.

188
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,133
Inside and Never Alone are a couple of notable examples

189
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:06,195
that I'm aware of, and these both have

190
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,776
really incredible visuals, excellent marketing stories,

191
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:11,038
and had, I think, fairly large production budgets.

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,783
I did some genre analysis based on the Steam tag set.

193
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:20,184
This is super, super noisy data,

194
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:21,545
but I did some filtering and cleanup,

195
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:25,588
and I've taken the median estimated revenue

196
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,949
for puzzle platformers on Steam.

197
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,790
Excuse me.

198
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,148
And I've defined this as the metric standard unit

199
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,130
of my disappointment with the games marketplace.

200
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:38,954
So we're comparing it to other tags and genres here.

201
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,036
And puzzle platformers are near the bottom.

202
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:46,720
Action RPG has a median revenue 24 times the median puzzle

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,181
platformer.

204
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,440
There's some other indie favorites here,

205
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,662
Roguelike and Metrovania, and they're only at three

206
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,462
and a half times the revenue of puzzle platformers.

207
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,163
So I think we can see evidence

208
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:59,704
that different genres have dramatically

209
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:00,745
different market responses.

210
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,708
So sometimes we get the impression

211
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:10,550
that visuals might be less important for indie games.

212
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:14,626
We have, you know, pixel art and low poly styles and that sort of thing.

213
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:18,547
And it's not all about the cutting edge tech and the photorealistic visuals

214
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:19,808
like you get in the AAA space.

215
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,170
But I think visuals still matter a ton when someone's looking at a store page

216
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,951
and deciding what to buy or what not to buy.

217
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,553
I think there's no coincidence that my two examples

218
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,354
of recent successful puzzle platformers both had incredible visuals.

219
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,336
And we got a lot of positive comments about how Life Goes On looks,

220
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,977
but we also got some criticisms about it looking generic.

221
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,820
And so I think that visual quality isn't the only factor.

222
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,982
There's also something to be said for distinctiveness.

223
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,663
So are you showing something players unique or new?

224
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,606
There's a master's thesis done by Michael Trenet

225
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,328
where he developed a machine learning model

226
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:00,609
to predict success from Steam Store pages.

227
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,632
And he found that a screenshot's average saturation

228
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,113
and distinct colors was one of the top factors

229
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:09,014
in predicting success.

230
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:14,826
Unfortunately, I've read his thesis and it doesn't say either way whether having more

231
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:19,912
colors and more saturation is good or bad, so I guess more research is needed there.

232
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:27,360
An idea that I've encountered sort of from other indie developers is that the Steam audience

233
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,822
wants dark and gritty games.

234
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,204
So do we have any evidence for this?

235
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:36,795
Valve has shared the top 100 games of 2017 by revenue on Steam.

236
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:42,081
And when you look at this list, I would say that these games are pretty dark and gritty.

237
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,944
There are some obvious exceptions to this.

238
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:48,508
Rocket League and Cuphead are bright and cheerful, at least in appearance.

239
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,632
But I think they also have a seriousness in their tone in some ways.

240
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:54,614
They aren't goofy or silly games.

241
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,797
And I think this is a factor that made it more difficult

242
00:11:58,817 --> 00:11:59,658
to sell Life Goes On.

243
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,499
We have this really dark concept

244
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,940
with sacrificing your characters,

245
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,122
but we approached it in kind of a goofy, silly way.

246
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:09,226
Let's look at the data.

247
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,849
Here we see ESRB recommended age.

248
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,812
And again, this is a log scale revenue estimate.

249
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,643
And here we've got a row of 0.45.

250
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,204
So this is about the same correlation

251
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:23,864
that we saw with Metacritic score.

252
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,685
So getting a higher Metacritic score

253
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,866
seems to have about as much predictive power for success

254
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,646
as getting a higher ESRB rating.

255
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,588
And so this is comparing median revenue by ESRB rating,

256
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,569
and this time we're looking at a linear scale

257
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,009
because it's multiples of the median.

258
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,290
And...

259
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:50,740
You can see that the median mature game has 36 times the revenue as the median e-game on Steam.

260
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:57,364
So, Rocket League, Planet Coaster, Kerbal Space Program, these are all e-rated games,

261
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:00,866
and they are some of the top-selling games on Steam. So, it is possible to

262
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:06,469
go against this trend, but sort of the typical e-rated game has comparatively little revenue.

263
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,368
And when you consider that Steam is an online store,

264
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:12,069
mostly driven by credit card purchases,

265
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,970
it's a lot easier for adults to buy games

266
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:14,811
than it is for kids.

267
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,513
I wanted to look at this by tags,

268
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,115
and again, comparing to puzzle platformers.

269
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,857
And so Family Friendly has a medium revenue of 0.84.

270
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:28,859
So if you think puzzle platformers are in a tough spot,

271
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,340
Family Friendly has it even worse.

272
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,303
Crime, on the other hand, is at 23 times puzzle platformer.

273
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:40,845
Somewhat less directly related tags like war and military are even higher.

274
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:45,008
We can see colorful at 1.3 versus dark at 5.9.

275
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:48,490
And if you need a more direct comparison than that, I'm not sure I have one.

276
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:54,934
I also want to note again to remember that this research is focused on Steam.

278
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:59,257
The story for family-friendly games is probably very different on the Nintendo Switch.

279
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:07,097
So a really big factor in commercial success

280
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:08,838
is how long people play a game for.

281
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,538
Is a game sticky?

282
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:11,699
Is there a lot of content?

283
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,859
Is it highly replayable?

284
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,360
Is there multiplayer?

285
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,881
Steam systems reward long play times.

286
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,242
For example, I can't tell you how many times

287
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:21,503
I've seen Steam pop up a window

288
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,103
telling me my friend is playing Spelunky.

289
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,384
And I think, maybe I should play Spelunky.

290
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,909
If we look at average playtimes for some classics like Braid, Fez, and Limbo,

291
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,152
and you compare these to more recent hits like Stardew Valley, RimWorld, Factorio,

292
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:43,954
people are playing these newer games for 10 to 20 times as long as they played those older games.

293
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:48,196
Sadly, Life Goes On's playtime is with the first groups, not the seconds.

294
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,744
OK, let's look at average play times plotted against revenue.

295
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:57,847
This time, our x scale, which is the average play time in minutes,

296
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,068
is also on a log scale.

297
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,630
So play times are increasing exponentially

298
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,450
as we move to the right.

299
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:07,634
With a row of 0.55, this indicates a super strong correlation.

300
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:10,656
This is the strongest correspondence that we've seen.

301
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,494
So if you're looking at this chart,

302
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:16,116
you are probably wondering what's up with that cluster,

303
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:18,097
that strange vertical line that we see.

304
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:21,400
And this sits at the three hour and 20 minute mark.

305
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,101
And these games all have lots of players,

306
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:27,884
but it looks like relatively few sales directly on Steam.

307
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,387
So this is the same data,

308
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,129
but this time the games in red

309
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,050
are games that have Steam trading cards.

310
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,838
So this shows evidence for the games that are created

311
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,820
for exploiting the Steam trading card system,

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,962
and this was a problem that Valve cracked down on

313
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:46,562
about a year ago.

314
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:50,726
So this is a super neat thing to see in the data,

315
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,448
but don't let that vertical blob distract you

316
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,850
from the really strong trend line

317
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,392
going sort of up and to the right,

318
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,534
where as revenue goes up,

319
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,337
sorry, as play times go up, revenue goes up very directly.

320
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,467
this row value is really significant.

321
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:08,989
And that's somewhat of a scary trend.

322
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,650
You know, there's a lot of new games

323
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,932
with ever more increasing games entering the market,

324
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,254
while at the same time, the most successful games

325
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,656
are holding onto their players for a very long time.

326
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,663
So, we know that YouTube and Twitch are huge for marketing.

327
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:31,677
and for indie visibility.

328
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,179
But not all games benefit equally from streaming.

329
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,521
When a player watches your game, watches someone else

330
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,862
play your game, do they say, oh, I

331
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:42,943
have to play that for myself?

332
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,684
Or do they come away from it thinking, I've seen enough.

333
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:46,805
I've seen what this game is.

334
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:47,786
I don't need to play it now.

335
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,348
And I think that short, narrative-heavy games

336
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,689
and puzzle games that have consumable content

337
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,030
might actually be hurt by streamers and Let's Plays.

338
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:58,625
I can share some examples.

339
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,588
PewDiePie is the number one YouTube channel,

340
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,569
and he played the extremely awesome

341
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:04,570
Crypt of the Necrodancer.

342
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:07,573
This video has about 2.4 million views.

343
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,216
JackSepticEye played Life Goes On.

344
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,738
Jack doesn't have quite as many followers,

345
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,680
and his video sits at about 1.8 million views,

346
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,263
but I think these are sort of ballpark comparable.

347
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,635
Ryan Clark, Crypt of the Necrodancer's developer,

348
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:27,937
shared that the PewDiePie video resulted in direct revenue

349
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:28,898
for his game of about $60,000.

350
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,700
Comparatively, Jack's video for Life Goes On,

351
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,541
we saw a revenue bump of about $500.

352
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:41,725
Another example comes from XGen Studios.

353
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,412
YouTuber Matt Shea did six episodes on their game,

354
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:46,132
Super Motherload.

355
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,513
Xgen estimates this drove about $10,000 to $15,000

356
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,173
in revenue for them.

357
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:53,673
The same YouTuber played their new point-and-click adventure

358
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:54,414
game, The Low Road.

359
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,174
They saw zero results.

360
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,115
So Crypt of the Necrodancer and Super Motherload

361
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:01,955
both feature procedural generation.

362
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,395
They're both highly replayable games,

363
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:07,436
whereas Life Goes On and The Low Road are far less replayable.

364
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,856
So next thing I want to talk about is community.

365
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,275
Can a community get involved in your game?

366
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,276
Do you have level editors?

367
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,136
Do you have mod support?

368
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,076
Do you have leaderboards?

369
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:21,217
Is there multiplayer so that players can drag their friends

370
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:22,277
into the game to play with them?

371
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,338
Life goes on, has none of these things.

372
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,259
You may be noticing a trend here.

373
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,580
Looking at this question in the tag data,

374
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,381
we see some of the top tags that I found.

375
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,922
Moddable sits at almost 140 times

376
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,582
the median revenue of Puzzle Platformers.

377
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,703
This is a bit of an outlier,

378
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,043
but I think it is indicative of the trend.

379
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,150
Level editor doesn't look great in this chart,

380
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,332
but it's still double the median puzzle platformer.

381
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:49,993
You also have to be careful though,

382
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:54,336
at .43, four player local is one of the lowest

383
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:56,737
revenue tags I looked at on Steam.

384
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,158
Game designers seem to really love

385
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,639
to make four player local games,

386
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,180
but it seems like they're really hard to sell on Steam.

387
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,743
So the factors that I've just reviewed

388
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,964
aren't the only contributors to market fit.

389
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,025
These are just the ones that I could show you good data for.

390
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,655
And I'm not saying that it's impossible to buck these trends.

391
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,178
If you want to make your own short, colorful,

392
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,580
family-friendly puzzle platformer, please feel free.

393
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,303
But you will be fighting an uphill battle.

394
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,408
And there are lots of super successful games

395
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,469
that don't match these trends.

396
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,471
So if you're going to try to defy them, though,

397
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,874
be aware of what you're doing and approach it thoughtfully.

398
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,764
So you might think that I'm just looking at the top sellers list and just chasing the hits and chasing the big bucks.

399
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:43,147
And that's not what indie games are about.

400
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:49,412
The indie game should be targeting a niche, finding an audience that really loves what you're doing and going after that audience.

401
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,375
And so yes, finding a niche is absolutely important.

402
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:58,080
But buys indie games on Steam turns out to be a surprisingly narrow niche to begin with.

403
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,467
There's an article titled,

404
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:02,528
Your Target Audience Doesn't Exist,

405
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:05,189
by Sergei Galyankin, the creator of Steam Spy,

406
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:08,430
where he estimates only about 1% of Steam's user base

407
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,131
regularly buys new games every year.

408
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:13,553
So you have to make sure your niche is viable.

409
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,474
And if you can tell me that there's this target audience

410
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:20,176
out there that really wants more puzzle platformers,

411
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,496
and you know how to reach them,

412
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,917
please, please come talk to me.

413
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,378
I have a game, I would love to sell them.

414
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:30,206
Home to give an example of a narrowly targeted but viable

415
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:31,927
niche, let's consider Zachtronics games.

416
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:35,450
These are basically engineering challenges for programmers,

417
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,471
which seems about as niche as it gets.

418
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,154
They recently launched their new game, Opus Magnum,

419
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,615
and I saw it near the top of the global top sellers

420
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:44,316
list on Steam.

421
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,317
That's a good sign that a niche is viable.

422
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:49,800
And it turns out that the medium programming tag game

423
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,742
is almost 11 times as successful as our standard puzzle

424
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:53,182
platformer.

425
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,771
So yeah, programming seems like a little bit more viable

426
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:00,092
despite its very niche appeal.

427
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,136
I'm also not saying that you should not

428
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,177
be looking at the top selling games and trying to clone them.

429
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,438
Again, if you're just making games to make money,

430
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,479
go do something else.

431
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:11,760
It will be easier.

432
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,082
Most designers have a lot of different ideas.

433
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,203
So when you're choosing between your ideas,

434
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:18,604
evaluate them for market fit.

435
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,806
Look at the factors that correlate with success

436
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:22,687
and make something unique based on that.

437
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,330
For example, are you targeting a genre that's in demand?

438
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,952
Or if you're breaking new ground,

439
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,675
does your design at least align with the trends for success?

440
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:34,077
Like, remember the strength of correlation

441
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,080
between success and play times.

442
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,702
Will people want to play your game for a long time?

443
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:40,604
What would it take to make long play times

444
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:41,345
part of your design?

445
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:44,589
Also...

446
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,868
Can you find games that are doing similar things

447
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:48,628
to what you're doing?

448
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,329
Can you explain the successes?

449
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,510
Can you explain the failures?

450
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,031
Do you think these games that you're looking at

451
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:56,712
had comparable marketing and development budgets to yours?

452
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:01,875
To give you a bit of a epilogue for Life Goes On,

453
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,577
we've continued to put a lot of hard work into the game.

454
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:05,777
We've continued to support it.

455
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,459
Localization has been really big for us,

456
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,280
particularly in Asia.

457
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,200
We got kind of lucky.

458
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,161
We didn't have a lot of text,

459
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:14,802
and so localization turned out to be cheap.

460
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,951
We'll probably never really get our investment back out a bit, but we've done much better

461
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,092
than we expected to based on our launch, even though it's been a bit of an uphill battle.

462
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:29,415
If you want to learn more about this, Ryan Clark, the Crypto the NecroDancer developer,

463
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:33,037
used to run a regular Twitch stream where he would do market analysis for a couple of

464
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:33,398
hours.

465
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:38,600
Unfortunately, he's no longer regularly streaming, but you can find back episodes on YouTube

466
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,981
and they are definitely worth your time.

467
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:44,889
Lars DeSette, the developer of Defender's Quest, has a project called Steam Profit,

468
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:50,352
which looks at upcoming Steam releases and tries to pick which games will be successful,

469
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:54,134
which is a very useful approach to try to test your understanding of the marketplace.

470
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:57,736
And you can also watch TotalBiscuit's co-optional podcast.

471
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:03,319
This features popular streamers and a regular segment is where they look at upcoming games

472
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,801
on Steam and you can just sort of see their reaction to their trailers, their concepts,

473
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,802
their screenshots and see what they think of them.

474
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:11,143
This can be very informative.

475
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:14,567
So thank you for your time.

476
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,649
If you want to talk about this stuff,

477
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,391
hit me up on Twitter, Eric E. Johnson, Eric with a K.

478
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,534
If you want help, if you want to talk,

479
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,417
if you want just to nerd out about stats, I would love to.

480
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:26,678
Please, please reach out to me.

481
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,900
And I think we have some time for some questions.

482
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,081
Sounds like we have time for two or three questions.

483
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:42,042
If you could line up at the mics on either side.

484
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,984
You look like you're there first, so please go ahead.

485
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,045
Yeah, quick question.

486
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,686
Hi, I'm Dave from No One Cares.

487
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:57,015
You mentioned that replayability was an indicator of revenue, possibly, correlated.

488
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,697
But then you also mentioned that roguelike is like way down as far as tag goes, which is interesting.

489
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,378
Do you have any sort of insight on that?

490
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,760
Roguelike isn't popular with AAA.

491
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,342
And roguelike is a pretty broadly applied tag as well.

492
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:14,643
And so I think I would say that would be a big driver there.

493
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:16,204
On the left.

494
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:21,621
The two categories which seem to rank the lowest in the data you collected are puzzle

495
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:23,423
platformers and rated E for everybody.

496
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,289
Could that possibly just be a result of how many games fit those categories?

497
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,472
Like, puzzle platformers are something you could bang out in an hour.

498
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:35,288
Whereas a action RPG or a mature game is not likely,

499
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:37,190
you know, most indie games are E for everyone, right?

500
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,032
Yeah, so I would say that there is certainly an element

501
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:44,454
of not just do people want these things,

502
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:47,216
but also how saturated are these areas?

503
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,917
How many people are already filling that need?

504
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,958
And how easy is it to, yeah, there are people

505
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,099
who love puzzle platformers,

506
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,980
but they are drowning in selection

507
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:58,823
versus the people who want the top end AAA crime action,

508
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:00,864
you know, it's harder to meet their needs.

509
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:02,675
So I think that is certainly a big factor.

510
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:06,772
Oh.

511
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:07,873
Can I?

512
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,294
Oh.

513
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:09,794
Hi.

514
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,817
Do you have any tools or tips on how to counter

515
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:15,759
survivorship bias and find the games that are not successful?

516
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,222
How do you counter survivorship bias

517
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:20,744
and find the games that are unsuccessful?

518
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:23,346
So, I mentioned Steam Profit,

519
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:27,149
and playing Steam Profit is the process of looking at

520
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,212
basically every new game that is coming out on Steam

521
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:33,575
every week, and you will very, very, very quickly find

522
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:37,477
innumerable examples of games that don't succeed,

523
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,817
that don't generate revenue.

524
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:41,238
And I found looking at all of these games

525
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,858
that there would be many games that I thought,

526
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:45,019
you know, maybe they won't be the next hugest hit,

527
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,559
but certainly they will see some reasonable amount of revenue

528
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,780
and it turns out that, you know,

529
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,741
their revenue is within margin of error of zero.

530
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,622
So yeah, I would say just looking at the game store

531
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:59,162
will very, very, very rapidly dissuade you

532
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:00,163
of the survivorship bias.

533
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:01,683
One more, I think?

534
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:02,283
Sure.

535
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:11,040
Do you have, have you done, and are they existing somewhere, and if they are, will you post

536
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,541
them somewhere?

537
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:19,808
Have you done time and money adjusted comparisons, like take into account how, you know, development

538
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:22,650
costs and price point for selling it?

539
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,191
Yeah.

540
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:23,531
So.

541
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:28,354
There's no public data set on development budgets.

542
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:33,778
You might be able to do some interesting data based on, like you say, price point.

543
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:36,040
Higher price games probably were more expensive to develop.

544
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,683
Something that you will certainly see as a trend on Steam is that games below $10

545
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,605
very rarely have any sort of significant revenue.

546
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:46,007
And, yeah.

547
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:47,928
Okay, thanks.

548
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,650
Thank you. I think we're done? I think we're done.
