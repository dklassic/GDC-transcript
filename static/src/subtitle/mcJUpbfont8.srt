1
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:11,714
Alright, looks like everybody's pretty much in. Um, welcome to the killer portfolio or

2
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:18,126
portfolio killer talk. Uh, just to start off, can you please silence your cell phones?

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,276
All right.

4
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:24,916
So today we're going to be talking about portfolios

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:29,178
and the practices that we use to evaluate them

6
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,778
and the best way for people

7
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,319
who are looking to get in the industry to get in.

8
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,960
My name is Greg Furch.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm a senior art director at Firaxis.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,642
We have some extra guests here.

11
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,802
Do you want me to start?

12
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:45,702
Yeah, jump on by.

13
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:46,363
I'm Wyatt Johnson.

14
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:48,483
I'm a tech art lead at Epic.

15
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:55,021
I've also been a lead artist and an art director at Epic and have been there for about 11 years.

16
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,863
And we just shipped Robo Recall.

17
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:06,812
Hi, I'm Lissette Tichi-Montgomery and I'm art director here at Ubisoft San Francisco.

18
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:14,159
And we are currently working on South Park, The Fractured But Whole.

19
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:22,553
Sean Robertson, I'm art director at Ghost Story Games,

20
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:24,293
previously animation director at Irrational,

21
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,954
and I wish our game had the word butthole in it, but.

22
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,155
No such luck.

23
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,955
I'm Gavin Goulin, I'm the lead character artist

24
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:35,256
at Insomniac Games, working on Spider-Man.

25
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,317
Before that it was Sunset Overdrive.

26
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:38,477
Awesome.

27
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,545
All right, so just also to remind you guys,

28
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:49,365
after we're done, 1.30 to 4.30 down the hall,

29
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:52,146
we're gonna be doing portfolio reviews.

30
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,046
We've got a whole nother crew of art directors as well

31
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:56,366
to help with that, so if you're interested

32
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,587
in getting some time and getting some advice

33
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,267
on your portfolio, please come by and see us.

34
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:05,468
All right, so let's start with your origin stories.

35
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:09,189
How did you guys stumble into this career?

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,571
Oh gosh, I guess I'll start.

37
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,833
I got kind of lucky, I'd started in graphic design,

38
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,254
and I had, and this is probably a good story,

39
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:21,897
just because you can get in from any which random way,

40
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:23,478
and that's something interesting

41
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,759
and kind of unique about our industry,

42
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,500
but I was a graphic designer,

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,582
and I had just volunteered to test a local game.

44
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,143
I was in Dallas at the time.

45
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,804
I wrote a local developer and said,

46
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,805
hey, do you need anybody to come in

47
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,306
and play your game and test?

48
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:36,086
They said,

49
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:37,708
Sure, why not?

50
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,811
Out of 300-some people who had emailed at that point, they picked me.

51
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,473
I just got lucky or wrote a good email.

52
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:46,555
And then once I was there, I just made an impression on the people at the company.

53
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:50,119
And they were curious, what do you do?

54
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:50,399
You know.

55
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:56,303
outside of coming and giving your time for free to play this random game.

56
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:59,508
And I showed him my portfolio and before too long I had a job.

57
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:05,216
Totally circuitous and this was 16, 17 years ago so things have changed a lot but the core

58
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,699
philosophy of

59
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,759
it.

60
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,160
You never know what's important, I think,

61
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,461
is the reason I tell that story.

62
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,702
Because you never know what effort and what strings

63
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:14,823
you're putting out into the world that

64
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,604
are going to be valuable, that are going to tie you back

65
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:17,424
to the thing you want.

66
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:20,106
So you're constantly being judged on your presentation

67
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:20,566
out into the world.

68
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,706
And you don't know which of those threads

69
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,627
are going to come back to be valuable to you later.

70
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:23,827
Great.

71
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,428
I actually got into the industry somewhat by accident.

72
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:26,489
I was actually inspired by Pixar.

73
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:40,321
and then I was looking for an end to the film industry.

74
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,502
So I graduated from school in Miami,

75
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,664
and I quickly realized that there were no jobs

76
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,706
in Florida for me at the time.

77
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,688
So I moved to California with my suitcase

78
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,649
and the workstation I built by myself,

79
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,151
and I was lucky enough my portfolio got me a job

80
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,412
within the first month.

81
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,714
So I started with my first PS2 project

82
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,576
as a character artist.

83
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,758
So I was just mostly pursuing my passion

84
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,300
for character art and character design.

85
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:06,858
and I think that that translated over from film into games.

86
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,861
I went to Ringling School of Art and Design

87
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:14,043
and graduated with an illustration degree,

88
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:15,364
thinking I was gonna change the world

89
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,085
with my editorial illustrations.

90
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,167
And when that didn't happen,

91
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,629
I was lucky enough to get an internship

92
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,991
at the old phone company 9X Science and Technology,

93
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,533
where they helped me bridge the gap

94
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,875
between all of the traditional art that I had learned

95
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,017
and moving over into the digital side.

96
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,081
Once I was comfortable with the digital platform,

97
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:41,442
I moved over to a small children's edutainment company

98
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:44,183
doing like 8-bit story,

99
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,764
like click the page and turn the page stories.

100
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:52,186
All the while really at home working on my real portfolio,

101
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,847
going home every night and just grinding and grinding.

102
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:58,428
And finally getting my big break at Looking Glass Studios

103
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,889
working on one of their flight simulators.

104
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,889
So way way back

105
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,834
I thought the only way to get into the games industry was to be a fine artist

106
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,318
And I was a terrible fine artist and I didn't get into fine art school

107
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:13,260
so after

108
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,428
Crushing rejection I ended up going to game art school. I dropped out which I might not recommend to the room but

109
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:21,773
It kind of worked out.

110
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,975
So, dropped out, moved across the country.

111
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,976
Ended up doing contract UI work

112
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,317
while doing some just day jobs.

113
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,758
And sort of like Sean, I just ended up grinding away

114
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,099
on my character art portfolio,

115
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,699
got into some indie companies,

116
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,860
and then moved on to the bigger ones.

117
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,101
Seems like the story is moving.

118
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,622
One thing I'd like to add to that

119
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,303
is that I've worked with two other artists

120
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,224
that I consider really high caliber.

121
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,685
One was in pre-med.

122
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,273
and dropped out of pre-med and again, self-taught

123
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:50,433
and really just grinded away.

124
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,293
And another guy came straight out of airline industry.

125
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,094
Like, he was a legit airline pilot

126
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:57,314
and he was just working on his portfolio

127
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,655
and he just went straight from like airline pilot

128
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,755
onto working as an artist on Bioshock.

129
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:04,415
So, there are many different paths.

130
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:07,596
I've worked with some great architects

131
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:09,016
turned level designers.

132
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,537
Yeah, that's a common thread.

133
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,857
A lot of architects and people who learn CAD

134
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,017
are sort of transferred in.

135
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,480
All right, so this is the one that always comes up.

136
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,841
You know, we always hear you've gotta have,

137
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,082
you know, five pieces, 10 pieces, 30,

138
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:25,383
whatever it is in your portfolio.

139
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:29,205
There's always somebody putting a magic number

140
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,206
on what people expect in a portfolio.

141
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:32,667
What do you guys think about that?

142
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:34,466
I'll start.

143
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:37,967
I think the best number is take whatever you have,

144
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,508
divide it in half, and subtract two.

145
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:43,329
That's the correct number for a portfolio.

146
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,190
It's just, people put too much stuff

147
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,271
in their portfolio all the time.

148
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,163
Seeing the variety of somebody's skills is awesome,

149
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:55,487
but the thing is is that your portfolio is only as strong

150
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,729
as the weakest piece in it.

151
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,631
And so if we get, you know, there's some strong stuff

152
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,553
and then we get to the end and there's something

153
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,135
that's maybe, you know, not as fully well thought out

154
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,318
or fleshed out or whatever it may be.

155
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,162
we wonder if you have great taste, right?

156
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,283
Because we're starting to kind of wonder,

157
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,145
like, did you see those flaws?

158
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,988
Were you able to understand why maybe this piece

159
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,910
that you hid in the back just because you felt

160
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,212
like you needed to have a gun in there

161
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,474
or some other random kind of false belief

162
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,716
about your portfolio?

163
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:25,839
we start to question whether or not you're bringing

164
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,720
that same quality bar to all your pieces.

165
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,322
So if you could get somebody who's not you

166
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:33,464
to look at them, give you some advice on the fidelity

167
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:34,805
of the stuff that you're doing,

168
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,926
be really, really critical,

169
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,647
and then if you feel like something is weaker,

170
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:40,049
cull it from the herd, get it out of there,

171
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:42,151
your whole portfolio is gonna be better.

172
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,292
We've hired people at Epic

173
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,493
that had three pieces in their portfolio.

174
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:48,135
A junior artist that made three amazing environments

175
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,317
and took three screenshots each, and we hired him.

176
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,296
Yeah, I would definitely stress quality over quantity.

177
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,537
I think what you first have to ask yourself is what kind of games you want to make.

178
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,958
Because I think one of the biggest traps is trying to do all the styles in your portfolio.

179
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,240
I think that is sort of spreading yourself a little thin,

180
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,420
and it's also muting your voice.

181
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,842
So I would sort of approach it from, like, what kind of games do I want to make,

182
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:15,063
what kind of art do I want to make, what kind of voice do I want to make,

183
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:16,923
and what kind of position do I want to fill.

184
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:20,459
because we're most likely looking for a very particular position

185
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,759
and a very particular set of skills,

186
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,820
and we're not looking for the jack-of-all-trades.

187
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,821
Maybe small studios are looking for that,

188
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,342
but mostly we're looking for someone who can come in

189
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:33,642
and hit the ground running and do one thing very well.

190
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:33,962
Awesome.

191
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:40,684
Speaking of that, too, what about importance of a presentation?

192
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:44,485
How does that impact your thoughts on a portfolio?

193
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:46,345
So, I think this is ...

194
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,946
you know, very much related to the previous question,

195
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,367
like you're an artist and your entire job

196
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,328
is to present things, whether it's in the video game,

197
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,589
in the end product of the game,

198
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,769
you're presenting things to the audience,

199
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,290
whether it's in your portfolio,

200
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,051
you're presenting your work to a potential employer,

201
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,211
it's all about the presentation.

202
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:10,733
Part of that presentation is the quality of the art

203
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,714
that's in your portfolio, it's also how you present it.

204
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:14,054
How many,

205
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,223
Hoops, do I have to jump through to see your art?

206
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,904
One of my favorite examples of the worst portfolio

207
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,506
I've ever seen.

208
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:26,109
Back when, you know, back in the mid-90s,

209
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,430
I hate to say how old I am,

210
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,092
Ed Looking Glass got a portfolio on a CD

211
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,333
when they still came on CDs,

212
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,416
and I was supposed to open a CD and put it in the computer,

213
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,218
and it was all tied up,

214
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,079
like it was supposed to be a presentation,

215
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,740
like they tied it up with like...

216
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,997
dental floss and it was like a bow and it was like opening one of those bubble packs

217
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:54,438
with the, by the time I spent ten minutes trying to open this thing I threw it away.

218
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:59,640
So that presentation completely worked against what you really want is get me to your images

219
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,822
and show me what you have and present them in a clean and simple way.

220
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,413
I think I just echo what Sean said.

221
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:08,175
I mean, I think we're at a time where all you really need

222
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,398
is ArtStation and then a handful of really good images.

223
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,179
But in those really good images,

224
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,661
if you're making a character, you've got to pose them,

225
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,722
like drop them out of T-pose,

226
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:18,043
get them in a good lighting situation.

227
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,004
If you're making an environment,

228
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,786
tell a story, light it well,

229
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:24,628
set an atmosphere in that environment,

230
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:26,389
and it makes it easier for us to hire you.

231
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,152
If I could just piggyback on that comment about atmosphere.

232
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:35,064
just for those of you who are aspiring environment people,

233
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:37,866
that's the biggest single missing thing

234
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,307
for me that I see all the time

235
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,748
is people focus so much on the props

236
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:44,290
and the creation of the assets

237
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,971
that they forget that they're trying to message something

238
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,552
and elicit a feeling from the person

239
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,974
who's looking at the image.

240
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:55,978
games are is just a series of images that we're composing and presenting and we're using those

241
00:10:55,978 --> 00:11:00,221
languages to guide the player and tell you where to look and where to go and what to see.

242
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:07,327
And the soul of the environments get lost inside the pursuit of making a really awesome fire hydrant

243
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,791
and we don't care about the fire hydrant. In fact, I would much rather have somebody who is a little

244
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:16,395
bit weaker on the technical sides of the art because we'll teach you the tool, that's fine.

245
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,857
If you tell an amazing story with an image then...

246
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:19,818
You're great.

247
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:20,838
That's the point, you know?

248
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,980
So it was a great comment, I totally agree.

249
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,041
Yeah, I agree, definitely telling a story,

250
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,583
and I wanna get a sense of your aesthetic and personality.

251
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,344
What are you gonna, what sort of story are you gonna tell,

252
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:34,266
what sort of personality are you gonna bring to the product?

253
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,388
And having a strong style and perspective

254
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:39,429
also helps drive that story home.

255
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,731
So where do you guys actually look for talent?

256
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:46,313
Like when you're looking for an employee or something,

257
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,534
if say a job comes up and you're like,

258
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:50,296
hey, I need to go find somebody, like I've done this.

259
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:51,556
I also kind of keep tabs on people,

260
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:54,317
like I'll actually go ping somebody and see.

261
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:55,197
But like where do you do that?

262
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,418
And also like kind of also looking

263
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:59,458
so that you also know what your bar is,

264
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,279
like as you guys are artists as well.

265
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,380
So where do you guys look for to find like potential talent?

266
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,400
I mean, I think there's like a few,

267
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,361
the most common resources would be something

268
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,941
like ArtStation or like Polycount.

269
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,422
And you can just kind of.

270
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,537
go through the more popular people

271
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:15,960
who are searching keywords and stuff like that.

272
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,403
But beyond that, it's also building a network.

273
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,987
Like I'm, as some of you might know,

274
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:22,799
I love the attention of Twitter,

275
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,340
so I'm just an active social media guy.

276
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,282
And through that, I'm building connections

277
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,364
with artists of different disciplines and stuff like that.

278
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,627
So when a spot opens up, I have it in my head,

279
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,268
because I was just talking to this person online.

280
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,050
I was just talking about a game that I'm playing

281
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,390
or something, right?

282
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,412
So I can kind of see the work that they're doing

283
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,633
through social media, like beyond.

284
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:45,994
I think Twitter's a really interesting thing.

285
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:47,415
It's the art station and...

286
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,498
you know, Polycount, those are like easy go-to's,

287
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,360
but I don't think enough people think about,

288
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,781
you know, Twitter as a vehicle.

289
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,863
It's like, it's a resume you're sending out

290
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,224
with every image you may send,

291
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,305
just make sure you send good ones,

292
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,326
but like, that's a good point.

293
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,528
Yeah, I mean, with your social media,

294
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,189
I mean, I think I said this like last year too,

295
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,731
but you're effectively managing yourself as a brand.

296
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,933
So if you have Twitter or Instagram

297
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11,876
or your own like art Facebook account or something,

298
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:12,016
you're...

299
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:17,498
facing your audience and kind of showing your work and people are watching, you know, and

300
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:21,426
it can lead into opportunities for jobs or just contract gigs.

301
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:30,429
Sometimes the people that I'm really attracted to are people who are intrinsically driven toward being teachers as well as having talent

302
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,750
That's super appealing especially for the field that I'm in now

303
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,090
Which is kind of where the technical art side where there are a lot of big unanswered questions

304
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,211
And it's a confusing mishmash of art and technology

305
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:44,712
and so that can be an appealing thing too if I see people who keep bubbling up by answering threads on forums and

306
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:49,873
Providing tutorials and putting out hey, I have good taste and I'm talented and here's something

307
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:50,953
I know that maybe you don't

308
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,094
That can, for me anyway, that can be really powerful.

309
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,835
Yeah, I think I come across talent in a similar way.

310
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:00,977
Besides using my network of people that I know,

311
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:02,657
I'm also looking on social media.

312
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:05,619
So it's really important what kind of voice you have

313
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:08,240
when you're on social media.

314
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,740
I think we like to use social media

315
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,101
as a way to vent at times,

316
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,581
but if you're mixing that in with your art,

317
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,102
that may not be the best place

318
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:17,003
to kind of have two different conversations.

319
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,584
So I would try to really focus on maybe having

320
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:21,718
you know, a Tumblr that is focused on art

321
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,740
and an Instagram that's focused on art,

322
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,683
and you know, driving, you're using your Twitter

323
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:27,766
to drive that sort of traffic around.

324
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,109
But if you are, you know, just going on their event,

325
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:32,232
that may not be the best place to do it.

326
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:36,177
So do you guys see any new...

327
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:43,291
Trends emerging like what our specializations and what's coming? I mean, I think there's a lot of

328
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:49,874
Stuff with procedural generation that's influencing this as well. But vr like what what do you guys see? How does that change?

329
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:50,274
uh

330
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:54,235
career paths and what people are kind of kind of learning

331
00:14:56,367 --> 00:15:00,329
Well, I just shipped a VR game, so it's fresh on my mind.

332
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,171
But virtual reality is clearly marching forward

333
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,972
at a really, really amazing pace.

334
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,053
And there aren't a lot of people

335
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,774
that have knowledge in that area.

336
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,075
VR is kind of unique because we're using

337
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,937
all the same tools that we used to use.

338
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,538
Obviously, being at Epic, we're using Unreal

339
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,379
to build all of the bones and guts,

340
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,300
and then we're using some DCC packages

341
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,321
to create assets outside of those.

342
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:27,465
But the way you assemble them and the problems you have in the presentation

343
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:34,650
Issues that you have around seeing something virtual reality way different from a lot of the traditional problems translating 3d images to a 2d screen

344
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:41,416
So that could be an area that's emerging and it's up-and-coming and they're gonna be a lot of jobs in that space if you could

345
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:48,101
Find a way to contribute some of those projects that probably would you know up your value quotient a little bit for the near future

346
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,303
And even if you get into teams doing work like that,

347
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:52,764
eventually you're gonna spread out

348
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,245
into other disciplines as well.

349
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,587
So, kind of brings me back to that original point,

350
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,329
just find something that makes you attractive,

351
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,131
that sets you apart, and then once you're in,

352
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,232
you can move around inside that bubble.

353
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,834
So is there anything you guys find is like deficient?

354
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,836
Like there's more demand than supply?

355
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,457
Like tech art is a great one,

356
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,338
it's also a very ambiguous one, but like.

357
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:16,160
I think from my personal standpoint, level builders,

358
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,081
I think they're,

359
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:22,562
From where I'm sitting, there's a more rare unicorn

360
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,943
to try to find someone who is interested

361
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:29,126
and can really, has the ability to assemble a world

362
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:32,649
with a story and atmosphere.

363
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,831
And not, you know, you see a lot of people building props

364
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:39,333
and you can go on ArtStation and see a ton of concept art.

365
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,337
And there is a lot of talented level builders,

366
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,819
but a lot of the talented level builders are hired.

367
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:45,959
So I think that's that.

368
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,740
So when you say a level builder,

369
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,481
are you expecting that person

370
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:50,942
to also do their own scripting as well?

371
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,523
No, I'm talking mostly from a standpoint,

372
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:55,984
I mean, that'd be nice, sure.

373
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,905
I'm talking like artistically building out a space,

374
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:01,547
like from an architecture standpoint and mise en scene.

375
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,548
There is one thing I'd like to add

376
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,908
that's kind of tangent to this.

377
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:08,830
New things that I see on the horizon.

378
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:13,277
We are a smaller studio, we have about 25 people.

379
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:16,258
We are using a lot of freelance artists,

380
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,879
a lot more than perhaps we did on Infinite,

381
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,899
where on Infinite we would just hire somebody full-time.

382
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,360
And I think you're gonna see a lot more

383
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,641
mid-sized studios emerging

384
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:29,462
that are taking on freelance artists.

385
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,562
because it's a cheaper way to make games.

386
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,644
And I think a lot of people are looking at AAA

387
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:37,847
and maintaining a 400-person studio is very expensive

388
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:41,370
and there's a few studios who can afford to do it,

389
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,851
but there's a lot that can't.

390
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,013
So I think you're gonna start seeing a lot of more

391
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,935
medium-sized studios propping up

392
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,037
that are looking for freelance artists

393
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:51,318
and talented freelance artists.

394
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:55,082
And I think looking at how you're presenting yourself

395
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:55,722
on the internet.

396
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:57,593
is even more important in that case,

397
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,194
because that's where people are looking

398
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,755
to bring in that talent and bring in those freelancers.

399
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,857
I think working on a project like South Park,

400
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:08,619
we ran into sort of a bit of a disconnect in this industry

401
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:09,580
when we were looking for talent,

402
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,902
especially when we were looking for animators.

403
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,183
Because of the style of the show,

404
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,684
we really needed some people

405
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,745
with very strong traditional skills

406
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,306
who knew how to do performance.

407
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:24,116
who knew how to really sell personality.

408
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,658
And we got a lot of portfolios

409
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:28,381
with a lot of mo-cap slidey animations.

410
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:32,064
And that sort of skill set is just not gonna translate over

411
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:35,568
to a game that's very stylized and performance based.

412
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,671
So we had a really hard time finding talent for animation

413
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:42,915
that could actually do that strong hand key.

414
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:47,446
The schools are really pushing mocap, motion builder,

415
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,747
you know, very like procedural animation.

416
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:50,867
But on the other side,

417
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:53,888
these very stylized personality-based games,

418
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:56,209
we're starving for animators who really know

419
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,290
how to do performance-based animation.

420
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,910
Super quickly, I'll just add,

421
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,371
if you want to be guaranteed a job in the game industry,

422
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:04,391
learn visual effects.

423
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:09,252
There are zero effects artists available.

424
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,213
And probably UI as well.

425
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,275
And I was just about to add UI to that.

426
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,036
UI, VFX, and tech art.

427
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,418
They're incredibly hard to learn,

428
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:20,341
they're tough to master, but you will get hired

429
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,103
if you are any good.

430
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:24,625
I would say definitely anyone who can come in

431
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,847
with some technical ability is also gonna

432
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,588
kinda come up ahead.

433
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,810
So if you can write tools and scripts,

434
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,792
if you're really strong at VFX and doing dynamics,

435
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:34,913
writing expressions.

436
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,150
Anything we can do to kind of push the tech forward

437
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,114
and improve efficiency, we're gonna be looking

438
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,336
for people who can help out with that.

439
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:47,014
So moving on, what workflows, this is probably an easy question,

440
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:49,316
but it may not be an easy question, it's probably fairly simple.

441
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:54,319
What workflows or common pipelines do you expect applicants to actually have?

442
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,840
What are some of the contemporary standards?

443
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,683
I think there are more, there may actually be some more standard things

444
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:03,526
that are just now very common over the past couple of years,

445
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,968
especially when it comes to materials that we kind of expect.

446
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:09,310
Yeah, I mean, I think the most...

447
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,608
obvious answer is going to be substance,

448
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:14,250
like learning a material authoring tool

449
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,212
versus painting, like hand painting textures

450
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,413
or doing it the old school way or something like that.

451
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:22,696
But I think the key thing to keep in mind

452
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,177
isn't necessarily the program that you're learning.

453
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:29,701
It's the methodology behind why you're doing it.

454
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,962
You're trying to make things more consistent

455
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,624
so they render more properly.

456
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,465
You're reducing like tedious workflows.

457
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,967
You're not hand painting a spec texture anymore.

458
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,207
It's just.

459
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:43,489
it's there is because it's part of your material palette.

460
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:45,770
Yeah, I think that'd be the most upcoming thing,

461
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,431
from my perspective.

462
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:53,286
Maybe one thing I would add is generally we don't care that much what tool you know.

463
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:57,069
And that's something maybe I should just touch on for one second, which is I think I see

464
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:03,054
a lot of students who hyper-emphasize, okay, I know Max, I know Modo, I can do simulations

465
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,696
in Houdini, I know Unreal, I know Unity, I know this, I know that.

466
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:07,977
None of that matters at all.

467
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:08,658
I don't care.

468
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,360
I don't even wish to see it on the resume.

469
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,901
I truly don't care.

470
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,964
If you're talented, I will teach you a tool in three months.

471
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:17,344
Any tool.

472
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,768
So I would much rather see your taste level

473
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,330
and the expression of mastery as an artist

474
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,254
or as a designer, an animator, whatever that may be.

475
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:28,315
I don't care what tools you know.

476
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,098
That being said, there are a couple of advantageous things

477
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:33,280
like common game engine, substance,

478
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,481
the main modeling packages.

479
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,362
Those are good to know.

480
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,128
I second that for sure.

481
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,649
The thing with that too is that you're looking at concepts, right?

482
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:46,291
You're looking at how does substance work and understanding that workflow

483
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,671
more so than which buttons you click.

484
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:47,891
Totally.

485
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,733
And I think that's the takeaway when it comes to the software packages

486
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:55,274
and understanding those workflows

487
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,934
and how they'll probably evolve over the next couple years in particular.

488
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:04,056
And frankly, all the different packages work together so well now anyway

489
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,517
that it's not an issue.

490
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:06,785
Yeah.

491
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,205
Yeah, I would definitely emphasize

492
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:11,107
not focusing so much on tools unless you are actually

493
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:14,088
trying to get into tool development in tech art.

494
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:17,089
But I keep stressing this with my artists

495
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:19,791
and that I train in my studio that the computer is just

496
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,752
a tool like a pencil or a pen.

497
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:25,053
So it's really the art history, all your skills,

498
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,635
all of your talent that's going to come through,

499
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:32,017
and the tools are just an avenue for that.

500
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,312
people really get focused on learning one particular program,

501
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:39,533
or I'm going to do this really high-res, amazing ZBrush model,

502
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:43,315
but if you can't translate that into something I can use in a game engine,

503
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:45,997
then it's just a pretty set piece.

504
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,418
It's not going to be something that we can actually move around

505
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:51,520
and work with a decent frame rate and a performance

506
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,381
that's going to actually make gameplay fun.

507
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:56,442
So, less tools, more talent.

508
00:22:56,857 --> 00:23:00,140
That's a perfect segue to the next question.

509
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,004
Do you guys expect to see content in Engine now?

510
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:05,427
Like, you know, I know years ago it was like,

511
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,589
hey, here's my awesome ZBrush sculpt with,

512
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:13,396
you know, whatever, how many millions and billions of polygons.

513
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,398
Now, is that really still applicable?

514
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,653
You know, like what are your expectations when you see it?

515
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:19,673
I...

516
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:21,155
If I see like a...

517
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:23,717
I'm just so over seeing really nice sculpts,

518
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:24,558
to be honest with you.

519
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:25,939
Like, and I'm a sculptor, like I...

520
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:26,740
That's what I do.

521
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,924
But seeing a portfolio of like just really high detailed sculpts

522
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:36,208
and then it just stops there is the most useless thing for my team imaginable.

523
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm not trying to be mean about it, but like...

524
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,172
There's so much more beyond that the sculpting is the easy fun part

525
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,553
Then you have to make the low poly you have to bake it properly

526
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:49,435
That's the light properly materials have to read well color theory all that stuff

527
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:52,056
And you don't have to I mean as much as I love unreal

528
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:57,018
You don't have to put it in unreal. You don't have to learn shader networks and stuff like that. You can use marmoset

529
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:05,162
There's a plenty of of great tools that make it easy to show something in content. How dare you sir?

530
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:09,455
I said I loved it though. I love you can use more besides fun, but

531
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:13,617
But yeah, just the game development goes beyond sculpts, and I know that it's fun

532
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:18,620
But yeah, you gotta you gotta go further sculpts still have a place obviously right like yeah

533
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,824
Where they used to be like the pinnacle of your piece? Yeah, like it's the dressing now. Yeah, it's like the fun part

534
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,246
It's kind of like concept art

535
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:33,549
You know 90% of that is sketching and then you have the nice beautifully rendered thing right and it's like everybody wants to do the nice

536
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:34,270
beautifully rendered

537
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:41,916
Thing but the reality is your job is actually making like a game model. It's like making something that the team works with it's not

538
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:48,702
You know getting front row on zebra central the the boring hard part is the job. Yeah. Yeah, it's the job

539
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:52,525
It's 90% of your day is the boring hard stuff

540
00:24:52,525 --> 00:25:00,532
It's the UVs that you hate and it's the low poly and the optimization and making the LEDs and getting the materials right and all

541
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,633
That other stuff that's the job

542
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,157
It's nicer to see that stuff in Engine, yes.

543
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,438
Whether it's Marmoset or whether it's Unreal,

544
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:10,619
because that shows us that you've gone through the process,

545
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:11,940
that you've gone through the workflow,

546
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,741
and you understand how to translate the Materials

547
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:17,081
that you're trying to create into what the Engine

548
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:18,122
is actually going to show.

549
00:25:18,122 --> 00:25:19,042
Okay, so the next one, this is pretty easy.

550
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:26,525
I think it's a constant question that we always face.

551
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,906
Everybody wants to know, should I specialize?

552
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:31,946
Should I be general? Should I try everything?

553
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:35,850
What do you guys think?

554
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,050
Yes.

555
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,672
I think the answer to this one is know your audience.

556
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,952
Who are you applying to?

557
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:44,193
Is it a large company?

558
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:47,294
You'll probably want to see specialization.

559
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:48,774
Is it a small indie startup?

560
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:54,256
They'll probably want to see a lot of jack of all trades.

561
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,897
I think the answer to this is know

562
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:59,418
who you are sending your stuff to and know

563
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:01,338
who you want to be as an artist.

564
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,376
Lisette made a perfect point talking about the animation stuff on South Park, because

565
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:10,821
those people that were applying with mocap reels might have had a chance if they had

566
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,104
customized their work for the job, but they didn't because they just kind of blindly sent

567
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:16,745
out stuff out there.

568
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,046
It's a perfect example.

569
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:24,131
Yeah, we always are looking for someone to fill a particular role, so specialization

570
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:25,192
is important in that way.

571
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,841
I got into the industry because I specialized in characters.

572
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:30,322
And then as I grew my career,

573
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,224
I started to learn VFX and environment

574
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:32,904
so I could be a lead.

575
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:36,207
But it was through that channel

576
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,928
that I was able to gain expertise

577
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,949
in how to use a game engine, how to get my art to work,

578
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:42,051
how to get, learn rigging.

579
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,792
And it sort of branched from there.

580
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,554
But so you're going to really most likely get in

581
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:47,795
because you're very good at one thing.

582
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:52,098
There are studios who look for generalists,

583
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:53,379
but as at like a.

584
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,399
I'm getting in the industry level,

585
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,360
that's a lot harder for you to fill that role.

586
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,442
I will also say we can all smell from a mile away

587
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:04,724
the student portfolio that is just full

588
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:07,106
of the various assignments to teach you

589
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:08,747
the various aspects of making stuff.

590
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:11,348
And it's so common, and please, please,

591
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:12,629
please don't make that mistake,

592
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:15,691
but it's like, here's the one gun we did in gun class.

593
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:16,992
You know, it's like stuff like that.

594
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:18,833
And you just smell it.

595
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,754
You just open the portfolio,

596
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,076
and you flip past the one mediocre character,

597
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:23,096
the one average gun.

598
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:26,638
you know, the poorly textured AK-47 from the thing,

599
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,659
you know, it's like, it just shows,

600
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,421
you're just going through the motions instead of-

601
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,122
And unfortunately, they're all kind of going out

602
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:32,742
at the same time.

603
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:33,923
They totally- Graduation rolls around

604
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:35,444
and you're seeing the same assignment

605
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:36,404
like from the same schools.

606
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,805
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:41,487
So I would highly recommend to make your own vision

608
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,789
of that stuff for yourself outside of the scope

609
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,009
of the class assignments,

610
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,591
because they never make for a good portfolio, ever.

611
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,612
So this is another really common question.

612
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,333
What format is appropriate?

613
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:59,896
If I'm an environment modeler, do I have a demo reel?

614
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,898
Is that the right way to?

615
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:07,622
How do you decide how you present your portfolio, I guess?

616
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,984
I'm staunchly against demo reels unless it's animation.

617
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:20,376
But a lot of it is because if you're trying to show a character and you have a 360 degree turnaround,

618
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:27,419
I have to wait for it to slowly pan around so I can see its back or something.

619
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,880
All of that can be accomplished in just one shot.

620
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,102
I can just look at one image and be like, okay, that's the full character. I don't need...

621
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:37,425
four minutes to see a thing turn around,

622
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,707
or I don't want to skip around and miss something

623
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:42,189
that you wanted me to see, but I'm impatient

624
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:44,390
because I am, I don't know.

625
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,812
And I skip past something that's vital

626
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:49,614
and could have been good, but you know.

627
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:52,997
And again, it goes back to presentations.

628
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,080
Show your best possible image, right?

629
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,342
And if it's based on a demo reel, I could miss it.

630
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,582
I think that surprises a lot of people because I hear a lot of professors and stuff in the

631
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:10,684
game programs constantly pushing the video reels and we all hate them.

632
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:15,366
But it's really common with people, they bring their characters with turnarounds and they

633
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:21,970
have big crazy spine-blazed, I'm going to get sick watching your fly-through video thing.

634
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,210
None of us want it.

635
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,491
So I couldn't agree more.

636
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:26,292
And they really enjoy your music choice too.

637
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:31,099
Yeah, I have to say I turn off the music most of the time.

638
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,861
Unless you're actually animating the dialogue

639
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:36,823
and I need to understand that you're hitting the points

640
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:38,544
and selling the personality.

641
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,847
So yeah, don't spend an entire week composing a song

642
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,229
because most likely I'm going to turn it off

643
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,210
so I can actually just focus on the content

644
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,031
that you're creating.

645
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,942
You don't get extra points for choosing Tom Waits instead of a techno song.

646
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:56,084
And I think for modelers,

647
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:57,825
images and stills are fine.

648
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,686
You don't have to do the 3D turnaround.

649
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:03,928
I do enjoy new techniques that they're using, like Sketchfab,

650
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:07,070
where you can upload a model and I can rotate it around and take a look at it.

651
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,811
It's pretty cool.

652
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:12,773
As long as it's not a billion polys and I have to wait ten minutes for it to load.

653
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:14,253
So you have to think about...

654
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:15,827
the art director on the other side.

655
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,447
Like I've got 20 portfolio reviews to go through

656
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,388
in an hour, maybe hour and a half

657
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,968
between all the meetings and the scheduling

658
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,728
and all the planning that I have to do.

659
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:27,969
So I wanna get in, get out, understand what you're about.

660
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:29,729
And then if I think you're talented,

661
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,009
I wanna call you back immediately.

662
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:34,130
I don't wanna have to wait five minutes for your model load.

663
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,750
I don't wanna have to wait 10 minutes for your video

664
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,211
because I just don't have that time.

665
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,511
So I'd like to add to that,

666
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,852
the being respectful of our time.

667
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,779
I think also goes back to the presentation,

668
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,859
a clean and quick presentation.

669
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,441
It's, again, can't say how much we appreciate,

670
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:52,381
like if we get a portfolio

671
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:55,062
and we can immediately be into the art

672
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,103
and see, like forget all the fluff, all the intro stuff,

673
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:00,564
you know, the 20 second, like card

674
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:01,784
at the beginning of the reel,

675
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,645
like we just wanna see the art

676
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:07,546
and you have more of a chance of us seeing your art

677
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:08,487
if you just get right to it.

678
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:12,720
So I guess the basic rule of thumb is if it moves,

679
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,341
it probably dictates a demo reel.

680
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:19,643
If it doesn't necessarily move, don't do it.

681
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,064
All right, so let's talk about rejection.

682
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:25,505
This is always the best part.

683
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:25,885
Sean.

684
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,306
We all look at Sean.

685
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:28,721
There we go, Sean.

686
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,822
It's there, it's up on the screen.

687
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,162
I got plenty of those.

688
00:31:31,162 --> 00:31:39,245
So back in the day when I was trying to apply to video game studios, I got a lot of these

689
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:44,727
and I just kept updating my portfolio, sending it out, get rejection letters, repeat, repeat,

690
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:45,728
repeat.

691
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:53,371
And finally, it culminated with me getting two offer letters on the same day from Looking

692
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,592
Glass and another company called Reality Bites.

693
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:59,823
And at the time when I was doing this,

694
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,644
I was kind of bopping around.

695
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:02,325
I was freelance.

696
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:04,547
I was not necessarily in the games industry.

697
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:08,329
So I had a job, and then I was putting in the time at home

698
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,931
because I knew that the portfolio I had from school,

699
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,593
which was really illustration heavy,

700
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:13,673
was not going to cut it.

701
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:16,335
So I knew I had to put in extra work.

702
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:18,677
But I originally told this story back when,

703
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:19,818
the first year we did this panel,

704
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:23,581
to show that just because you do get rejected,

705
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:25,682
and even if you do get rejected multiple times,

706
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:26,583
it's not the end of the world.

707
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,283
It just means.

708
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:29,882
maybe you aren't good enough,

709
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,864
or maybe you're not the right candidate

710
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:33,905
for the job at the time.

711
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:37,307
Sometimes we look for very specific things

712
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,949
from a candidate, and especially in the art world,

713
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:41,550
very specific styles.

714
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,432
So you may be a fantastic artist,

715
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:48,935
but you may not be the style that we're looking for

716
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:49,476
for the particular project.

717
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:53,438
Yeah, I definitely think there's a great.

718
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,352
mindset that a game developer has to have.

719
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:00,893
I like to say 90% of the times we fail,

720
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,094
and then maybe 1% we do well,

721
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:05,115
and then 10% we're just kind of all right.

722
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:07,796
So getting in the habit of just failure

723
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:09,457
is kind of the default state.

724
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:11,078
You're going to try to get things in engine

725
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:13,199
and they're not going to work 90% of the time

726
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,780
until you figure out your pipeline.

727
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,541
And it's going to be the same thing

728
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,301
when you're trying to get in the industry.

729
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:20,082
You're going to just continue to get rejection

730
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,423
until you get the yes, but it's the yes that matters.

731
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:28,702
But if you let that first few no's discourage you, you're pretty much dead in the water.

732
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:32,604
And it's sort of that grit and mentality of just kind of persisting and pursuing your

733
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:38,248
interests and just keep pushing forward through those no's.

734
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:42,430
I've been in the industry for 16 years and I have a very stylized portfolio and I get

735
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,272
rejection letters to this day.

736
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,374
And it's just sort of, I'm not the right fit for every position and that's okay.

737
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:52,629
Sean loves that we show his rejection letter, by the way.

738
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:57,051
I wish you'd show the one of the studios that are no longer around.

739
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,671
Would you say...

740
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:59,232
Nice.

741
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:03,513
Would you say you found exciting employment?

742
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:04,754
They watched you a lot.

743
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,494
Oh yeah, is that what it says?

744
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,186
Alright, so what are some avenues that can help get somebody in the industry? So if your

745
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:22,653
portfolio isn't ready for Epic or for Ubisoft or whatever, what are some avenues that

746
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:30,100
people can pursue that exist now that may not have existed 15 years ago to help people

747
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,581
find their way in?

748
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,341
We can't talk a little bit about it.

749
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:40,245
I like to chime in on this because I do a significant amount of outreach outside of

750
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,108
the industry to bring more people in.

751
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:47,712
So one of the things I try to stress with new students is don't wait until you're looking

752
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:49,133
for a job to look for a job.

753
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:53,438
There are different ways to make connections in the industry.

754
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:57,902
There are a lot of game developers who are actually looking for mentees and want to help.

755
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:01,946
So you are better off building relationships with people in the industry,

756
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:03,827
and then when you're ready for a job you can say,

757
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:06,168
hey, by the way, I'm looking.

758
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:09,030
That way you're not just coming up with the give me a job,

759
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,211
give me money sort of stress,

760
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:12,272
because you may not be ready,

761
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,833
and it's a different relationship

762
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,374
than building a relationship with someone over time.

763
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:19,605
Yeah, it's great advice.

764
00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:21,766
Also, you're not going to come at it with that sense of desperation.

765
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:27,188
You're going to come at it with a little bit more of a quiet, learning-style confidence.

766
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:30,149
For somebody on the hiring end, that's really appealing.

767
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:34,691
You can smell that confidence and that kind of satisfaction in your trajectory and that

768
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,172
you're trying and you're slowly growing.

769
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,493
You can just smell that.

770
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:42,194
Yeah, and you're giving someone on the other side an opportunity to get to know you, and

771
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:44,895
it's not just about gimme gimme.

772
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,536
And see you grow over time.

773
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:50,825
You know, that's, you start in that relationship early,

774
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,646
you may not be ready, but if you're showing your portfolio

775
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:55,566
and showing artwork and it's out there,

776
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,607
and we see that it's steadily getting better and better

777
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,427
and you're improving and you're putting in the hard work,

778
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:01,588
that's also helpful for us.

779
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:03,989
Yeah, I mean, if you just sit in, like, your room,

780
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,450
like, making art or whatever, and never show anybody,

781
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,991
no one's ever gonna know who you are, you know?

782
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:12,952
So if, you know, you make contacts, show your work often.

783
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:17,442
you know, plant the seeds for future jobs.

784
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:17,522
Yeah.

785
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:22,124
So that kind of also goes, like, I think freelance,

786
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:23,645
you kind of touched on that as well.

787
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:24,225
Yeah.

788
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:28,867
Like, and I think more companies are actually

789
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,908
going to individual freelance artists,

790
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,850
and then we are, as opposed to outsourcing houses,

791
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,531
and so we're partnering with individuals.

792
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,492
So I think that also is an avenue in,

793
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,673
going back to that.

794
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,669
what are some qualities that, you know,

795
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,430
since you were just talking about doing it extensively

796
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,051
and so were you, what are you looking for?

797
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:51,412
The individual artist definitely appeals to me more.

798
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,712
I mean, we've used outsourcing houses in the past.

799
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,973
The problem with outsourcing houses is that

800
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,214
you kind of have to be like, I want, you know,

801
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:00,295
I know who your good artists are,

802
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,635
and I know who your mediocre artists are,

803
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:04,876
and I know we're hiring the outsourcing house,

804
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:07,117
but I want this person and this person on the project,

805
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,597
not these people.

806
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:11,538
And as an outsourcing artist, you're always, you know,

807
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:12,078
having that.

808
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:17,146
conversation with like, I want this person, not this person, as opposed to if I just go

809
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:21,330
to an individual, I'm hiring that person because of their portfolio and I like their work and

810
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,432
I think they're strong, so I can deal directly with them.

811
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:28,396
But beyond their portfolio, like what is it you're looking for?

812
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:33,341
Well, first of all you want someone that's going to show up virtually, you know.

813
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,798
not in the office, but if they're working remotely,

814
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:37,840
that they're gonna put in the work.

815
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,901
And there's a lot of trust to be put in

816
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,863
if I'm hiring you and you're in a different country

817
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:45,444
or you're on a different coast than me.

818
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:49,166
So we need to know, mostly through communication

819
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,687
and just how the beginnings of the project go,

820
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,148
that you're gonna put in the work

821
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:57,091
and that you're going to take direction,

822
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,933
that you're gonna listen and communicate with us.

823
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:05,879
Things happen, as far as communication goes, it's great.

824
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,741
It's like, hey, I can't deliver this

825
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:08,581
because I'm down with the flu,

826
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:12,064
so I'm gonna be out for like three days.

827
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:13,846
Little things like that that let us know,

828
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:16,868
because these are people that are not in the office,

829
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,249
are great, like on top of like,

830
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:20,471
I hired this person because they have a great portfolio.

831
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:22,173
This is not at all a sexy answer,

832
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:25,195
but my experience is that people that are freelance,

833
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:26,957
especially the individual people,

834
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:28,398
need to be way more anal.

835
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,941
than normal.

836
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,322
Just that sense of always communicating,

837
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:35,963
always expressing the state of their work,

838
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,443
knowing, you know, asking when they don't have

839
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,444
the information rather than just sitting there

840
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,585
doing nothing, and then when they're delivering files,

841
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:45,465
they're delivered to a really, really high quality,

842
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:48,426
not just the asset, but also the source files,

843
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,687
the organizational structure, all of that stuff

844
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:52,047
matters a lot more when you're working,

845
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:55,308
you know, as an external partner.

846
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:57,349
So I definitely look for people who are anal.

847
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:04,377
Yeah, I'd say the mentality, especially when you're a freelancer, is that you are providing a service.

848
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,598
You're not just providing art, you're providing a service.

849
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,699
So what that means is that you're working with your client,

850
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:15,440
you're communicating very rapidly, you're turning things over very quickly,

851
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,841
you're listening to our feedback and responding to it,

852
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:21,422
you're not getting defensive when we tell you to change something.

853
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:27,404
Simply because there are factors that may lead to that request.

854
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:31,847
So just thinking of yourself as a brand and a service rather than just an individual artist.

855
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:37,891
I think that's probably one of the bigger problems I'm meeting a lot of freelance artists or contract artists or whatever.

856
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:46,557
Is that they don't realize that they're actually a company competing against the monoliths across the ocean or whatever, right?

857
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,378
So you're not just a person with...

858
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:52,621
your Wacom and you paint stuff and people give you money.

859
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,402
It's like you need to be professional,

860
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:56,644
need to be on top of your work,

861
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,285
your quality speaks for future work.

862
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:00,527
Like you, even if you're just one person,

863
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:01,687
you're still, you're a company.

864
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,949
Like you're up against bigger studios.

865
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:06,391
Yeah, I would say if you, especially,

866
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,633
I think attitude is a big one for me as well.

867
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:12,115
You know, I was touched on not being defensive,

868
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:15,378
but there's just a number of revisions

869
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:16,799
that we're gonna have to get to to get to good.

870
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:17,860
And if I'm

871
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:23,911
Constantly fighting the client just or constantly fighting with the artists to kind of get them to get to that point

872
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:26,053
It's just so much more work

873
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:31,858
To get there and it's I'm less likely to hire them on the next time because I'm just trying to get the game done. Yeah

874
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:38,605
So this is an interesting question. I think a lot of people that are probably here

875
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,086
Would like to at some point be an art director

876
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,102
What do you guys think is expected in an art director?

877
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:45,983
And of course, that'll change over the next several years,

878
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:50,346
I'm sure, but what do you guys think is expected

879
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:51,767
in that kind of portfolio?

880
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,009
And it's not something that at 35 or 40 years old,

881
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:55,470
you're like, hey, I'm going to be an art director.

882
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,312
It's something that you probably start planning for earlier.

883
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:04,396
So what do you guys think needs to be done there?

884
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:08,179
Again, this is one of those really subjective,

885
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,460
each studio is going to have a different answer.

886
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:15,634
You look at a smaller company like Campo Santo,

887
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:19,976
who used Ali Moss, who had never really done games before,

888
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:21,517
but he has such a striking style

889
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,678
that he kind of fit naturally into that.

890
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:27,459
Versus if we were looking for another art director,

891
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:29,000
I would be looking for someone

892
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,721
who has shipped a lot of games,

893
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,582
and that I'm actually looking at the end result of.

894
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:40,369
the titles and the experience that put together those titles

895
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,631
for a role because we're looking for more senior people.

896
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,673
So that's a difficult question, I think,

897
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:49,616
to answer, like what's the meaning of life, I don't know.

898
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,856
I know we want to get to questions, but just to chime in really quickly, art direction

899
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:58,142
is about why, it's not about pretty pictures.

900
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:03,629
And so as you start thinking more in your career about how to drive maybe to a place

901
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:06,093
where you're doing some direction or some leadership.

902
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:09,774
All that centers around the purpose of the art

903
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:12,816
and how does it serve the goals of the project.

904
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:16,237
And it's never about whether it's pretty.

905
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:20,419
Pretty is a outcome of doing a good job satisfying the why.

906
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,980
So if you can find a way to represent that in a portfolio,

907
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,401
that's an interesting problem.

908
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:27,442
It's probably a whole nother talk.

909
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:30,263
But that's fundamentally what direction is.

910
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:32,104
It's satisfying the master of the why.

911
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:32,884
It's not pretty pictures.

912
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:36,064
Yeah, I think there's a glorified view of what an art director is.

913
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:39,646
Most of the time you touch everything and own nothing.

914
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:43,647
Like you are constantly communicating to artists,

915
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,328
trying to get them to bring things up to a certain level of quality,

916
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:51,370
trying to get them to understand why you're asking for a change,

917
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:57,312
asking them to push forward what they would normally do to a different level.

918
00:42:57,312 --> 00:43:00,653
So a lot of it is communication and a lot of it is people management skills.

919
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:02,113
So you're spending.

920
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:06,410
less and less time making art and more and more time communicating.

921
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,993
So we're down to our last slide and while we're on this if you guys want to get the questions sooner,

922
00:43:11,993 --> 00:43:15,414
feel free to start lining up at the mics, but we're going to kind of toss this one around.

923
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:18,776
I think it's a nice one to end with.

924
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,877
What is your best applicant success story?

925
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:25,680
Like is there an unusual story you've got where somebody got hired that you know about

926
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,041
and how that worked and how it went down?

927
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:32,733
Do you want to add anything?

928
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:34,474
Sure. I keep remembering my first intern,

929
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:36,215
one of my first interns that I got on my project.

930
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:38,797
His name was Chris Emerson.

931
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:41,278
I hired him because he was one of the few candidates

932
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:43,800
who applied who had a really strong art portfolio

933
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,681
and technical skills.

934
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:48,723
So, he came on board, and he was able to write quickly,

935
00:43:48,723 --> 00:43:51,545
create test levels with shaders

936
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,306
so we could test our characters

937
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:56,127
that we were getting from outsourcing.

938
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:58,729
He would say, hey, by the way, I just wrote this tool.

939
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,084
I didn't even ask him to do that.

940
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:03,726
So for me, it was having someone who came

941
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:07,588
with a little technical ability and just a lot of drive,

942
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:10,489
and seeing him grow very rapidly

943
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,710
from being just an intern to being hired,

944
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,171
and now he's at Sony and doing extremely well.

945
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:15,992
I think it was his attitude and his mindset

946
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:17,212
and his skillset, and I'm really happy

947
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:19,633
I was able to bring him in and give him that chance.

948
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:19,733
Cool.

949
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:20,454
Early on, on Bioshock Infinite,

950
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:21,174
the first animator I hired.

951
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:34,048
His name was Matt Boehm and I believe he was a shoe salesman.

952
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:38,991
He'd been cranking on his portfolio and he's working at Payless Shoes and he'd gone through

953
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:40,392
the animation mentor program.

954
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:45,456
Now he works over at Blizzard and he just did a talk on first person animations in Overwatch.

955
00:44:45,456 --> 00:44:45,797
Awesome.

956
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:47,458
Not bad for a shoe salesman.

957
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:56,472
Let's get to some questions. We've got people lined up. Let's start over here.

958
00:44:56,472 --> 00:45:01,960
So you guys were talking a little bit about VR earlier. I'm a VR developer and one of the

959
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,726
things I'm struggling with is finding a way to effectively show that.

960
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:12,949
without just relying upon the first person's perspective?

961
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:15,150
Do you have any advice on how to shoot?

962
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,030
Yeah, it's really hard.

963
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,911
We struggle with that, too, when we're thinking about

964
00:45:17,911 --> 00:45:19,952
how do we take marketing shots for this stuff?

965
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:20,613
How do we do it?

966
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:22,013
And honestly, what we ended up doing

967
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:25,895
was composing some shots using a really wide FOV

968
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:27,756
and just trying to be representative

969
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:29,717
of what the player would see

970
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:32,478
without having this really distorted, foveated, you know.

971
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:39,863
View of what's going on that could induce nausea and was compressed and all the other things that can happen if you're not careful

972
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,725
So we ended up honestly faking it

973
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:46,588
But we were trying to do service to the and elicit the same mood

974
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:51,571
So if you look at the marketing stuff that we did for the game, we're using all the same assets the same animations and stuff

975
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:57,635
We're just presenting it in a kind of manufactured way to elicit that same feeling that you would get if you were actually in the headset

976
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,057
It's an unsolved problem. I don't have a perfect answer for you

977
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,211
Thank you.

978
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:01,832
Awesome.

979
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:03,993
Let's go over here.

980
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:04,053
Hi.

981
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:07,855
Firstly, I want to thank you guys for all the advice you've done so far.

982
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:10,976
I really appreciate it.

983
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:17,459
I've gotten a lot of inconsistent feedback from art professors and video game professors

984
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:20,661
about including fan art in your portfolio.

985
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:23,482
What is your guys' opinion on doing so?

986
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:30,406
From our perspective, we had a few artists showing fan art from Black Shock.

987
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,928
It doesn't hurt, but it can't be your entire portfolio.

988
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,490
Like, it's fine if there's like a piece in there

989
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:41,634
that it's nice to see like, oh, this person is a fan.

990
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:42,995
Have they done something different?

991
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:45,497
Or is it just like a straight up copy of a screenshot?

992
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:48,740
So if it's in there, it still has to say something new.

993
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,384
And so it'd be, you know, something that you've expressed

994
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:53,864
and something unique.

995
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:56,666
There's nothing wrong with doing fan art, but.

996
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,322
if you're applying to a company doing fan art of the game that they worked on,

997
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:05,023
I mean, you have to realize that people have been staring at this thing for five years,

998
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:08,004
so you're getting a way more critical look at something,

999
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:11,985
so unless it's the best fan art humanly possible,

1000
00:47:11,985 --> 00:47:15,006
it might get a little risky.

1001
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:19,068
I think it's always good, like you said, to do an adaptation of it,

1002
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:22,469
like do something where you evolve it, because then you get out of that,

1003
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:25,170
but you're still paying some homage to something you like.

1004
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:30,989
You are opening up yourself to a certain level of scrutiny if you are applying with fan art.

1005
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:31,810
Yeah.

1006
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,532
So that is the double-edged sword.

1007
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:33,772
Thank you.

1008
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:34,013
No problem.

1009
00:47:34,013 --> 00:47:35,394
Okay, let's go over here.

1010
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:40,480
Hi, well just real quick. I really enjoy you being by the way.

1011
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:42,885
Glad to hear it.

1012
00:47:42,885 --> 00:47:46,588
But, so I was curious about expanding upon

1013
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:48,610
what is the relationship between the freelancer

1014
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,333
and the studio itself and is the pipeline

1015
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,495
between the studio and the freelancer

1016
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,958
faster than having in-studio people?

1017
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:00,922
For us, a lot of the freelancers that we have,

1018
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:04,105
like we have a few modelers that we have off-site.

1019
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:11,370
Basically we ship them a computer that has the entire IT set up so that Perforce is on it, the

1020
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:17,472
entire build is on it. They can VPN in and sync to the build. So we give them something that's

1021
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:23,054
ready to go and that they're delivering their assets directly into the engine and that's where

1022
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:28,956
we're going to look at them. They're not emailing us or FTP stuff. Depending on the time zone

1023
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:33,158
that they're in, this could be something that comes in overnight so it's just ready for us to

1024
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:34,078
look at in the morning.

1025
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:37,905
For people that aren't as integrated,

1026
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:42,209
we have a few artists that aren't hyper-integrated

1027
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:45,991
into the system like that, or like concept artists.

1028
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:50,395
Generally that would be FTP or email exchange.

1029
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:54,238
But it really depends on how tight you want that to be.

1030
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:57,580
And for the modelers, we really just wanted to see

1031
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,623
the stuff right in engine so we could critique it in context.

1032
00:49:01,134 --> 00:49:03,375
in the levels that we want it to be in,

1033
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,595
and it's a much quicker turnaround.

1034
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:08,657
So with IP confidentiality,

1035
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:13,819
does, do you ever run into any issues with that?

1036
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:14,219
Not yet.

1037
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:17,781
Lawyers have good NDAs, and then we make people sign them.

1038
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:17,961
Yeah.

1039
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:21,662
It would probably, I don't think an illustrator,

1040
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:24,683
or an illustrator, like a freelance artist.

1041
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:27,203
would make that mistake, because I don't...

1042
00:49:27,203 --> 00:49:29,545
It probably wouldn't work in the industry again,

1043
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:31,005
because that's really...

1044
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:32,046
Like, the companies...

1045
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:32,887
You know...

1046
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,908
If you're going to betray that trust,

1047
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:37,629
then I don't think there's going to be somebody else

1048
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:38,890
who would want to hire you.

1049
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,571
Well, not from a betray trust standpoint,

1050
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:43,372
but whenever you're in a studio,

1051
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:46,534
I'm just curious, do you have people who are there,

1052
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,315
who keep your servers secure,

1053
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:51,457
while freelancers don't necessarily have that?

1054
00:49:51,457 --> 00:49:51,677
Yeah.

1055
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:54,660
Well, I think it depends on the studio.

1056
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,640
Like, certain studios, the larger ones

1057
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,961
are gonna have certain security requirements from you

1058
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:03,222
and you need to meet those security requirements.

1059
00:50:03,222 --> 00:50:06,102
Whether that's having your laptop encrypted

1060
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:07,043
so that if it does get stolen,

1061
00:50:07,043 --> 00:50:10,043
you know our artwork isn't exposed.

1062
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,904
So I think it depends on the client

1063
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:12,724
and their level of security.

1064
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:14,264
I mean, there are some studios

1065
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,405
that are a bit more transparent

1066
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:16,865
in their process than others.

1067
00:50:16,865 --> 00:50:17,885
Okay, thank you.

1068
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:18,105
Good.

1069
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:28,197
So I've been working as an art director for the last six months and since I've been working that way,

1070
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:34,219
my portfolio has really suffered because I've been working with other people

1071
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:42,862
and I'm curious how do I get my portfolio up to speed and can I show what I've learned about collaboration

1072
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:49,164
and all those other things working as an art director and how to help my portfolio.

1073
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:53,059
This kind of goes to the AD question.

1074
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:58,202
Yeah, I mean, that's a difficult one because what...

1075
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:00,744
I think the question is, like, what are you trying to show?

1076
00:51:00,744 --> 00:51:02,465
Like, what do you want to do with your portfolio?

1077
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:06,788
Like, you know, do you want to go and be a modeler?

1078
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:10,391
So, for example, for me, I want to be a texture artist.

1079
00:51:10,391 --> 00:51:11,792
Like, that's...

1080
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:17,656
So, I mean, yeah, I think being an art director

1081
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:19,797
is not really a direct application of...

1082
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,682
being a texture artist, to me, my immediate response,

1083
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:25,823
having thought of it for two seconds,

1084
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,543
we kind of have to put in the work

1085
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,884
outside of what you're doing as an art director

1086
00:51:29,884 --> 00:51:32,444
and building up your portfolio in the time that you have

1087
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:34,545
that when you're not at work.

1088
00:51:34,545 --> 00:51:37,826
I mean, that's not an easy answer, but.

1089
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:39,866
Yeah, going back to my

1090
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:44,088
you touch everything and own nothing statement.

1091
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:45,648
I think part of being an art director

1092
00:51:45,648 --> 00:51:47,108
is selling the vision of what you're making.

1093
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:53,907
So if you can find specific examples of how you directed something, that would help.

1094
00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:56,828
But you're also going to have to do some key pieces on the side.

1095
00:51:56,828 --> 00:52:01,750
Especially if you're thinking about maybe focusing a little bit more on a different area,

1096
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:06,412
then that's the area you should be spending your free time working on things.

1097
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:07,712
So it is that challenge.

1098
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:11,374
It is you touch everything and own nothing, and you may say...

1099
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,706
I drove the vision for this entire scene,

1100
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:16,366
but everyone else did the work.

1101
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,207
So it's a different conversation,

1102
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:21,009
and it's a different way of selling your skills.

1103
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:24,211
How would you put that into a portfolio?

1104
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,772
Like if I'm, can I show other people's work

1105
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,273
and then just have...

1106
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:28,753
Credit them.

1107
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:31,034
You definitely want to credit the people who did the work.

1108
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:32,875
In my portfolio, I give examples

1109
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,197
of how I push things to quality,

1110
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:37,378
whether that's me showing paint overs

1111
00:52:37,378 --> 00:52:39,239
of what I did to improve textures

1112
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,980
and the kind of feedback I gave people.

1113
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:44,627
like giving examples of the process of art direction

1114
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:45,187
may also help.

1115
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:49,528
You could also, if you're looking to do a texture art

1116
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:53,009
kind of path, like doing materials and stuff like that,

1117
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,609
you could also do material treatments

1118
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,590
for environment art direction, right?

1119
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,970
So if there's an environment,

1120
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,191
and you're like, this is all the materials that I designed,

1121
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:03,391
you're kind of doing both in that way,

1122
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:04,711
you know what I mean?

1123
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:07,632
So you're kind of becoming more of a tech art director

1124
00:53:07,632 --> 00:53:08,992
versus like, you know.

1125
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:12,035
vision and politicking and stuff like that.

1126
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:13,695
Whatever it is you guys do.

1127
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,956
Cool, thanks guys.

1128
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:16,936
For animation portfolios,

1129
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:23,758
besides character performance as you mentioned,

1130
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:29,179
do you expect to see animation in the game engine?

1131
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,060
Or something like that?

1132
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:34,487
So for animation, do you guys expect to see animation in the game engine, correct?

1133
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:42,791
It certainly helps because ultimately that's the end product that the audience is going to see.

1134
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:47,333
And again, it's not 100% necessary, but if you're selling like,

1135
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:53,197
oh, here are my combat animations that I did, it's okay to see some, like maybe some Maya

1136
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:57,999
Play Glass, but ultimately we want to see how it translates in the game.

1137
00:53:57,999 --> 00:53:59,080
It also shows that.

1138
00:53:59,913 --> 00:54:03,036
you're aware of the entire process, the entire workflow.

1139
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:05,598
I mean, sometimes seeing a Maya Play Blast

1140
00:54:05,598 --> 00:54:09,241
is the equivalent of a sculpture or a ZBrush sculpt

1141
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,143
that hasn't been taken through all the hard process of UV

1142
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:12,624
mapping.

1143
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,686
And so you want to see that the hard work has been done

1144
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,208
and that you understand the limitations that

1145
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,630
get imposed on your animations when you

1146
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,771
have to put them into games.

1147
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:25,018
Yeah, I want to see how you break up animation,

1148
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:29,121
simply because it's great to have a strong portfolio,

1149
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:32,624
but there's the other side of we may need animations

1150
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:34,766
broken up in a different way to get them to work

1151
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,047
with our animation system.

1152
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:39,369
So I want to see that you can go from run cycle

1153
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:43,732
to jumping over a fence to blending between animations

1154
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:46,515
that are needed to a combat scene,

1155
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:49,597
and maybe just showing that strung together in an engine.

1156
00:54:50,144 --> 00:54:54,626
and then calling out the separate animations as they happen,

1157
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:58,207
will show me that you know how to kind of set up animations

1158
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:00,708
so that they work within an animation system.

1159
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:00,968
Thank you.

1160
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,529
Good. Hello.

1161
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:05,210
Okay, so I am a 3D generalist.

1162
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,390
I do, I like doing a bunch of ...

1163
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:13,231
I like doing a bunch of this stuff and I would actually prefer to work at a smaller indie studio.

1164
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:21,716
So my question is, would you suggest I continue doing everything to make the best generalist portfolio I can?

1165
00:55:21,716 --> 00:55:28,601
Or find something specialized, then get into AAA, and then go down to something where I can do everything?

1166
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:29,862
What would your suggestions be?

1167
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:41,391
It's kind of a hard one. I mean, the chance that you're taking a risk because chances are you're not equally strong in all of those areas.

1168
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:46,777
Just from the lack of having put in the 10,000 hours it takes in any of those given disciplines to achieve that mastery.

1169
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,999
So you're taking a bit of a gamble.

1170
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,305
not narrowing in a little bit, maybe just if you have 10 interests, narrow it down to three and try to represent those well

1171
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:02,108
or something, that can still express that you have generalist capabilities without

1172
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:07,732
having that kitchen sink syndrome of the one gun, the one character, the one environment, the three props,

1173
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:14,177
the one terrible UI. We see the same stuff over and over again, right? It's all the same story.

1174
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:17,699
So everyone on this stage probably would have a different answer, but I kind of...

1175
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:20,200
If it were me, I would narrow the scope just a little

1176
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,320
to the things you really love so that you can try

1177
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,341
to express your mastery in a couple of fewer areas.

1178
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:26,541
And then just in the hiring process,

1179
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,542
expressed, hey, I want to be a generalist.

1180
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:31,302
If you really want to be a generalist,

1181
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:35,663
maybe it's about narrowing the scope of execution.

1182
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:39,904
So if you're going to do, for example, a game demo or a level

1183
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,685
with a character running around with animation systems

1184
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:46,566
in a level that's very well lit and textured,

1185
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:47,586
and possibly.

1186
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,385
showing the effects, if that's what you want to show,

1187
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:54,046
but you're going to have to make sure that one scene is very well executed.

1188
00:56:54,046 --> 00:56:58,127
So no pressure there, but instead of trying to do

1189
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:02,008
everything in separate pieces, maybe showing them together in context

1190
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:04,868
or telling a story and conveying an emotion.

1191
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,449
People rarely pull that off.

1192
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:08,229
Yeah, they do. It's very hard.

1193
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:10,870
They're the reason why they're game teams,

1194
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,410
not game persons.

1195
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:17,557
Thank you

1196
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:27,086
Hi, I'm currently going with through excuse me. I'm currently going through what Sean's going through right now. I don't like you my voice

1197
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:34,634
I'm an editorial illustrator. I've been working in editorial illustration for a little while and I'm moving

1198
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,651
into concept art, particularly 2D.

1199
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:42,153
And I wanted to ask if you had any tips

1200
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:45,615
for easing that transition,

1201
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:48,037
basically translating the skills

1202
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:51,579
of generating concepts, et cetera,

1203
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:53,861
all that stuff that comes with that.

1204
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:58,964
I mean, editorial illustration's a very specific thing.

1205
00:57:58,964 --> 00:58:00,145
Back when I was in school,

1206
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,346
it was always little men doing stuff,

1207
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,647
little men holding up dollar bills.

1208
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,805
Brad Holland was like the king.

1209
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:07,646
Did you go to school in the 1920s?

1210
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:09,486
Yeah.

1211
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:09,767
Lab coat.

1212
00:58:09,767 --> 00:58:13,968
I mean, there's a set of skills like being

1213
00:58:13,968 --> 00:58:16,909
able to render a person, understanding color theory,

1214
00:58:16,909 --> 00:58:18,910
understanding how to do a composition.

1215
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,091
Like all those things apply across the board,

1216
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:24,012
whether you're doing concept art or editorial.

1217
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:28,013
Concept art is really about getting ideas out quickly

1218
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:31,094
that serve the project that you're working on.

1219
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:36,900
and telling a story within that project.

1220
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,580
So I mean, you could argue that editorial's

1221
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,281
also telling a story, but the compositions

1222
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:46,222
are much more, I don't wanna say highbrow.

1223
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,162
I'm losing the word.

1224
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:50,542
I would say fixed?

1225
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:52,323
Yeah, it's not as dynamic.

1226
00:58:52,323 --> 00:58:54,283
In concept art, you're definitely

1227
00:58:54,283 --> 00:58:55,603
gonna have to work quicker.

1228
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:57,484
You're gonna have to be less in love

1229
00:58:57,484 --> 00:58:59,604
with each drawing that you do and be willing.

1230
00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:01,909
to do 10 drawings, throw them away,

1231
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:05,291
to get to that one idea that you want to pitch

1232
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,132
and you think is going to be right for the moment.

1233
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,233
Concept art is not pretty pictures.

1234
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:11,634
It's all about ideas.

1235
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:12,835
It's just ideas.

1236
00:59:12,835 --> 00:59:15,876
It's in the job description, conceptualization.

1237
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:17,597
It has nothing to do with how pretty it is at all.

1238
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:21,339
Maybe I can help you answer the questions

1239
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:24,141
by telling you what we use concept artists for.

1240
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:24,621
Okay.

1241
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:28,923
We use concept artists to, one,

1242
00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:35,395
At the beginning of a project, set the visual bar of what we think the vision of the game will be.

1243
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:39,078
So, what is the story of this space?

1244
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:41,020
What is the personality of this character?

1245
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,862
How does this fit within this world and story?

1246
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:49,448
And then during production, we regularly use concept art as a language between

1247
00:59:49,448 --> 00:59:53,112
the art team and the design team to kind of get them on the page of where we're going.

1248
00:59:53,658 --> 01:00:02,267
So, for example, we'll use concept art to kind of envision what a combat attack or a combat sequence may look like.

1249
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:08,893
So that the artists and the animators know what we're going for and the visual effects artists know what we're trying to achieve.

1250
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:15,120
And then we can then take that concept art, give it to those artists and then they can get a vision for the final.

1251
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:22,824
goal is. So when you think about concept art, it's not, as you said, pretty pictures.

1252
01:00:22,824 --> 01:00:25,967
It's solidifying and bringing a team unified around an idea and a concept.

1253
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,589
Guys, we're out of time, but thank you all for coming. If you guys still have questions,

1254
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:35,054
I'm sure we can, we'll be around. We're also doing the portfolio review, so, but thanks again for

1255
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:42,560
coming. Please be sure to fill out your reviews so we come back and do this again next year, and

1256
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,540
good luck with everything.
