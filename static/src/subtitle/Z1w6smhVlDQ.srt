1
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:11,287
So today I'm going to tell you about Puzzle Strike. I'm David Serlin, by the way, president

2
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:16,352
of Serlin Games. And here is Puzzle Strike, which is a tabletop game I designed. And it's

3
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:22,717
kind of unusual, a little bit of a weird game. It's sort of like the video game Puzzle Fighter

4
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:25,559
and it's sort of like the card game Dominion.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,901
And oh, geez.

6
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:32,782
Yeah, okay, so it's sort of like Puzzle Fighter and sort of like Dominion.

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,883
Are any of you familiar with the video game Puzzle Fighter, by chance?

8
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,743
Anyone? Yeah, a lot of you. Okay, great.

9
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:42,425
So I'm going to tell you my thoughts on these two games

10
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,186
and why I would ever put them together

11
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:47,527
and what happens when you do and what some of my design goals were

12
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:50,448
and a little bit about how the strategy of the game works

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,688
and then some of the design problems that I had.

14
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:58,471
along the way. So let's start with Puzzle Fighter. So in this video game, on

15
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,773
your side of the screen, gems will fall and you put them together into big gems and then you

16
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:08,054
break them and send them to the other side. And when you fill up the other side of the screen,

17
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:13,076
the opponent's side, then you win. And that is a pretty standard thing.

18
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:17,458
It works the same way in other puzzle games like Puzzle Bobble or Tetris.

19
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,215
But in my opinion, Puzzle Fighter really stands head and shoulders above all the other puzzle

20
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,917
games when it comes to being a competitive game.

21
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,299
And I want to touch on some of the reasons why.

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,622
So one of their innovations, maybe the main one, are the circular gems you can see on

23
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:34,683
the left side of the screen.

24
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,605
And when a red circle gem touches...

25
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,386
other red gems, that is what breaks them and sends them to

26
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:44,888
the other side. So it's not like a match three game where you

27
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:47,129
get three reds that would automatically break. You're

28
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,790
actually able to build up as big of a red gem as you want, and

29
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:56,252
you can break that when you want by touching that circle gem to

30
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:59,933
it. So what that does is it allows you to control the timing

31
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,474
of your attacks as well as how big they are.

32
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:07,918
That's on the offense side. On the defense side, when gems fall on the opponent's side of the

33
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:15,223
screen, they don't fall randomly. They fall in a very predictable pattern. And it allows your

34
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:19,886
opponent to build their side in a certain way so that they don't get too wrecked by your

35
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:20,206
offense.

36
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,129
So those two things together, that you can control

37
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:26,391
the timing of your attacks and how big they are,

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,013
and that defense really counts and matters,

39
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,196
are sort of the basic elements that you would hope

40
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,758
to have in a strategy game, and that's good,

41
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,321
but that's not why this game is so memorable

42
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,221
and so notable.

43
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,863
The thing that's so unusual about it

44
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,824
is actually its comeback mechanic.

45
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,507
Comeback mechanics are common,

46
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:45,528
and we see them in many games,

47
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,830
but I haven't seen anything like how it works

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,451
in this game anywhere else.

49
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:51,807
So why is that?

50
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:55,511
Well, when your side of the screen is almost full,

51
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,192
that means that you've almost lost.

52
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,415
But it also is when you're at your most powerful.

53
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,817
And that's a crazy situation to be in,

54
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:04,058
because when you're almost full,

55
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,600
you're actually like right on the edge

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,142
of winning and losing at the same time.

57
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:09,523
So why is that?

58
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:09,723
Well,

59
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:15,333
partly because when your side is full, you have all the ammo,

60
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,854
you have all these gems that you could potentially send to

61
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:18,474
the other side.

62
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,195
And you can realistically send them because of the way those

63
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,135
circular gems work.

64
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:25,435
You can kind of hide them here and there on your side of the

65
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:25,775
screen.

66
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,236
So you have a lot of ammo.

67
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:30,396
You can realistically use it.

68
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,517
And there's another rule called the height bonus.

69
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,997
And what that says is that when gems are higher up on the

70
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:37,158
screen, when you break them, they will send

71
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:38,458
more to the opponent.

72
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:41,138
So in other words, when you are about to lose, you have

73
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,757
the most ammo and every shell of that ammo that you fire does more damage.

74
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,995
The effect is so powerful that it's like a greed test.

75
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:55,700
It's like how greedy do you want to be to get right up close to losing just so you can

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,963
be really powerful and send a ton to the opponent.

77
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:04,349
There's another fun rule where if you send just a ton to the opponent, more than enough

78
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,172
to fill their side of the screen, it doesn't drop on them instantly and end the game.

79
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:11,896
Instead, it puts a number over their side of the screen and they have one more turn.

80
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:17,778
that they can use to try to counteract that, to break gems on their side, to nullify what's

81
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:25,159
going to fall. And taken together, what all this means, that you can control your offense,

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,761
that there is pretty good defense, that being so close to winning and losing looks the same,

83
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:38,142
is that a common dynamic that happens is like I almost beat you and fill you up really close

84
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:41,923
to the top and then you're really powerful and you almost do it to me and then I ‑‑

85
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,140
more than enough to fill your side,

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,943
but you have that one more turn to stay back in

87
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,485
and you dig yourself out.

88
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,148
And there's this back and forth, back and forth,

89
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,813
edge of the knife kind of gameplay.

90
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:56,879
Where it's at any moment someone's gonna lose and it's so intense

91
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:06,325
So that's it's very exciting and I played this game a ton. I've won a tournament in it in Chicago once I

92
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:14,510
talked to another GDC attendee here many years ago about about some of these nuances and someone overheard me and

93
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,872
said hey you seem like you know what you're talking about with game design and

94
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,273
and gave me a game design internship,

95
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,395
and that was my first job in the game industry.

96
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:25,356
It was because I said some things about Puzzle Fighter.

97
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,198
I later went on to be lead designer

98
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,080
of Street Fighter HD Remix

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,541
and Puzzle Fighter HD Remix with Capcom.

100
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,002
So I have a long history with this game.

101
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:38,964
But I don't have a long history

102
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,666
or any history with Dominion or any connection to it.

103
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:43,827
It's just a game out there in the world.

104
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,068
And some people said,

105
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,029
hey, Serlin, you should really check out this card game.

106
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,781
So I checked it out and I didn't really like it.

107
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:54,624
What I did like is that you build your deck as you play

108
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:58,586
and I think that was a natural evolution of card games.

109
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,067
It's the kind of thing I was working on too.

110
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,048
So I really liked that.

111
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,749
But what I didn't really like

112
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,951
is that it's too much multiplayer solitaire.

113
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:08,893
It's too much like I build my deck and you build your deck

114
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,274
and we kind of just do our things

115
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,796
and we compare scores at the end.

116
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,939
And that just isn't for me.

117
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,561
And so my knee-jerk reaction was like,

118
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,523
well, what if it was a little more like Puzzle Fighter?

119
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:26,627
And it wasn't that I thought the ideas of Dominion

120
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,408
combined with the ideas of Puzzle Fighter

121
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,631
would be just the ultimate best game in the world.

122
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:34,353
It was more that it was actually just my knee-jerk reaction.

123
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,754
I said that sort of thing all the time.

124
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:37,736
Years earlier, I worked on a...

125
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:42,620
a third-person shooter, and it was like a third-person shooter that used puzzle fighter

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,345
mechanics. I also worked on a shmup, like a top-down shooter like Raiden DX, and again,

127
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:53,250
let's get some back and forth from puzzle fighter in there. Now, neither of those games

128
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,114
ended up being made, but you can check out the game Twinkle Star Sprites if you want

129
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,696
to see a little bit of the direction I was going in.

130
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,678
I even had a friend who was working on a dancing rhythm game, and I was like, what about a

131
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,939
dancing rhythm game that's like Puzzle Fighter?

132
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,141
So I was just trying to sneak it into anything, just all the time.

133
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:14,082
So it's no surprise.

134
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,703
I was like, okay, there's not a lot of interaction here, what if it's like Puzzle Fighter?

135
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,125
But then I started thinking, okay, what would that actually be like?

136
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,650
Maybe this lines up, and then I was thinking about

137
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,091
what I consider a good competitive game

138
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,572
or some of the elements that I want.

139
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,994
So I want a game, if it's gonna be a competitive game,

140
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,394
to be highly interactive.

141
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,895
I wanna interact with the opponent

142
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,436
so that I can outplay the opponent,

143
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:40,037
have the opportunity to do that,

144
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,658
to predict what they're gonna do,

145
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:42,779
to react what they're gonna do,

146
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,940
to react what they did.

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,000
So.

148
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,182
I think there really needs to be as much interaction

149
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,264
as possible for it to be skill testing.

150
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,086
I also want hype, exciting moments built into the game,

151
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,328
not something that's accidentally there,

152
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:59,169
but all that stuff I told you about Puzzle Fighter,

153
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,110
it's not an accident that it's so exciting.

154
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,352
It comes directly from the rule design.

155
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,849
I personally want games that are asymmetric,

156
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,551
that means the kind where I choose a character

157
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,853
and you choose a different character

158
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:13,295
and we each have different strengths and weaknesses

159
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:16,598
and now that's a matchup that has a certain dynamic

160
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,480
of how it's played and we can switch characters

161
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,441
and have a different matchup.

162
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,084
That's really interesting and really compelling to me

163
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,105
so I knew I wanted that.

164
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,872
And of course nobody would want a slow, boring start to their game.

165
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:32,413
But it goes doubly so if you're making a competitive game,

166
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:35,994
the kind that would ever be actually played in a competition,

167
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,735
like if you're doing multiple rounds of Swiss,

168
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:41,316
or if there's ever going to be commentary on it or something in streams.

169
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:47,379
Every turn of the game really needs to pull its weight and be there for a reason.

170
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:52,521
So you have to be careful about having kind of samey starts to your game all the time.

171
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:56,278
So let me tell you a little bit about how Puzzle Strike,

172
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,599
the tabletop game, works,

173
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,900
and we can refer to these various points.

174
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,562
This is a bit of a confusing diagram,

175
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,083
but just bear with me.

176
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,704
So in Puzzle Strike, you start with,

177
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,446
well, each player has a zone called the gem pile,

178
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,527
and that starts empty,

179
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,908
and every turn you automatically will get

180
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,829
one gem into your gem pile.

181
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,035
and you lose the game if you ever end with 10 gems in your gem pile.

182
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:25,780
So if nobody did anything, then after 10 turns, the game would end.

183
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,244
There's a universal mechanic in the game called Combine,

184
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,547
which is the upper left purple chip there.

185
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:36,134
What that's showing is you can combine two of your 1 gems into a bigger 2 gem.

186
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:39,692
There's another universal mechanic with the purple chip

187
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:43,073
and the upper right, which is a crash gem.

188
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,294
And what that's showing is that you can crash a two gem

189
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,294
to break it apart into two ones

190
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:50,695
and send those to the opponent's side.

191
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,816
That diagram in the bottom middle is just showing

192
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,617
that if you crash a three gem,

193
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:56,737
it sends three to the opponent.

194
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:02,419
So this concept of bundling up gems into a big gem

195
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,079
and then crashing all of them to the opponent,

196
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,700
that is offense.

197
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:10,135
So what I mean by offense is that I said if nobody does

198
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:11,756
anything, the game would end after 10 turns.

199
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:14,958
But if I keep sending my gems to you, I'm reducing the

200
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:15,539
number of turns.

201
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm trying to end the game quickly and fill your side up.

202
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,281
So that's offense.

203
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:23,683
Now defense is another mechanic called

204
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:24,624
counter-crashing.

205
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:29,107
And how that works, let's take the example that I have five

206
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,348
gems in my gem pile, and you have five in yours.

207
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,349
If I crash one gem.

208
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,552
I'm going down to four, I'm sending one to you,

209
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:37,793
and you're gonna go up to six.

210
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:41,056
But if you counter crash, it's saying,

211
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,939
hold on a minute, before that one gem arrives

212
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,980
in my opponent's gem pile,

213
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:49,083
they're gonna crash one of their own gems

214
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:52,987
and send it not at me, but at the incoming gem.

215
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,688
So it's like I'm firing a missile

216
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:55,629
and they're shooting it down.

217
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:59,118
And those gems that meet in the air

218
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:00,618
are removed from the system.

219
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:04,960
So that's defense, because it's slowing the game down,

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,201
adding turns to the game.

221
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,142
In this example here, my opponent didn't go

222
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,604
from five to six, they actually went from five to four.

223
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:15,505
They got farther away from that lose condition.

224
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,366
So that's offense and defense.

225
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:28,262
Since I'm covering those I think it's important to mention kind of the third leg of the triangle which is economy and when I think of

226
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:33,890
These these three concepts I think of Starcraft which is depicted in this cake

227
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:40,980
So in Starcraft, offense is like I build units and send them to your base right away.

228
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,670
Defense is something like if the opponent is a Terran, they might build bunkers, which

229
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,591
is static defense.

230
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,695
It doesn't move around, but it's very effective against early attackers.

231
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,718
But what do you do against someone who is playing defensive?

232
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:02,421
There's really no point in attacking them early because you're sort of wasting your early units.

233
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,543
And you also don't need to play defensively yourself because they're not threatening you.

234
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,344
You can sort of do whatever you want.

235
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,705
So what's best to do in Starcraft is to invest in your economy.

236
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,587
And by doing that, a little bit later in the game you can have so much money.

237
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:23,850
you can kind of do anything. So economy beats defense. And in the course of a game of Starcraft,

238
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,852
there's a dance between offense, defense, and economy where you're kind of going back

239
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:32,893
and forth between them depending on what the opponent does. And that same exact sort of

240
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:38,396
thing is going on in the tabletop game Puzzle Strike. So the first item on my list was I

241
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:38,696
wanted

242
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:46,136
interaction with the opponent to be an important thing and so here's a way to make that the

243
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:50,041
central mechanic of the game. I also mentioned that I wanted hype

244
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,203
exciting moments to not be

245
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:58,290
accidental but to be designed into the system and they're in Puzzle Strike for really the same reasons that they're in Puzzle Fighter.

246
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:04,672
when your gem pile is almost full, that means you have a whole bunch of ammo that you can

247
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:10,420
potentially fire off. And there's also a mechanic in the tabletop game called the height bonus.

248
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,285
It doesn't work exactly the same way as the ‑‑

249
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,589
is the video game, but it's the same concept in spirit.

250
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,491
When your gem pile is almost full,

251
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:20,954
you can draw more cards per turn.

252
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:24,138
So there's that same kind of bait to be really greedy,

253
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,380
to build up a lot of gems in your side,

254
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,983
because that's gonna allow you to draw a lot of cards

255
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,285
and maybe do a really big combo,

256
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,127
even though it's putting you close to losing.

257
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:37,309
The next point I said that was important to me is asymmetric games,

258
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,850
games where I play one character and you play another,

259
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,433
and it's really beyond the scope of this lecture for me to explain why that's so compelling,

260
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:50,114
but in case someone needs at least a little bit of intuition,

261
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,875
I wanted to give the example of a street fighter match,

262
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:57,257
where on the right side we have Zangief, who's a big slow wrestler,

263
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:00,518
and he needs to get close to you to throw you in order to do damage.

264
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,480
And Dhalsim, the other character,

265
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,464
he has limbs that can extend across the screen

266
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,607
and he can spit fire across the screen too.

267
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:10,650
So he wants to keep the opponent away.

268
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,313
And these two characters have opposite goals.

269
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,375
One wants to get close and one wants to keep away.

270
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:19,013
That, in most versions of Street Fighter,

271
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,615
that's a pretty interesting matchup.

272
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,258
And the dynamics of that matchup are different

273
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:25,521
than all the other matchups, so that's cool.

274
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:29,966
But if you imagine another hypothetical Street Fighter game

275
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,449
that only had one character, like a super character

276
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:33,410
that had all of the moves.

277
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,313
you would remove this dynamic from the game.

278
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,514
I mean, it would be removed

279
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:39,657
because there would be no such thing as one,

280
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,198
as I need to get close

281
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,300
since you can do as much damage close anyway

282
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,962
and there's no such thing as keeping away.

283
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:49,267
So you lose something by having a symmetric game.

284
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,281
I'm gonna come back to that point,

285
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:55,904
but I wanted to mention the last of my four points

286
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:56,945
I mentioned earlier.

287
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,567
Again, we'll cover it more closely here.

288
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,668
That's the slow, boring start thing.

289
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,210
So in Dominion, you start with these cards here.

290
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:05,912
The yellow ones are money,

291
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,013
and you use those to buy more cards in your deck.

292
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,254
Okay, fair enough.

293
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:12,917
The green ones, here's a closer look.

294
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:16,680
So the card on the right is basically blank.

295
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,341
At the end of the game, you do get points for it,

296
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,142
but when you actually play the game, it doesn't do anything.

297
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:25,943
And that's the opposite of what I'm looking for

298
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:26,823
in a competitive game.

299
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,804
I want to get you to the action right away, quickly.

300
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,265
It also makes me think of StarCraft again,

301
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,105
since in the old days,

302
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,446
you started with four workers in StarCraft.

303
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,446
Later on, they upped it to six,

304
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:40,827
and nowadays it's actually 12 workers

305
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,927
you start the game with.

306
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,508
What that does is jumpstart the game

307
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,368
and get it to the important decisions quicker.

308
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:52,833
So I want to give you important decisions quickly and that ties in with me also wanting you to have different characters

309
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:57,076
What a character is is like a starting condition. That's different for me from you

310
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,560
So I it was just a natural thing to replace those

311
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,262
Those cards with

312
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:10,846
Well, they're chips and puzzle strike, but I'm gonna say the word cards anyway, but to replace them with with character cards

313
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:14,729
So this is a character right here and right away. You're doing interesting things with this character

314
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:22,722
This diagram was actually made by my playtesters and what it's showing is the concepts I just told you about

315
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:31,310
Rushdown or offense defense and economy and it's a map of all the characters in Puzzle Strike and where they fit on that continuum

316
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,912
It just happens to work out really well

317
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:36,915
You have an extreme rushdown character an extreme defense character and many others that are in between

318
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:36,995
and

319
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:43,397
This is not a map of where you're completely locked into playing a certain way.

320
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,758
It's just a push in one direction or another.

321
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:52,039
And I was saying before how I just really like there to be different characters in general in just about any game.

322
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:59,060
But in this particular style of game, like Dominion or Puzzle Strike, it's especially important, I think.

323
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,741
In this style of game, there's a common pool of cards that I'm building my deck from and you're building your deck from that same pool.

324
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:06,841
And if...

325
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:12,256
we both look at this pool, there's probably just a best deck that can be made.

326
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:16,559
And it's probably the best deck for me and for you.

327
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,581
And that's just, it's frustrating that every time we play,

328
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,802
we would be confronted with this issue that what I want to do is kind of what

329
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:27,665
you want to do. That can be mitigated if I can interact with you a lot.

330
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:32,887
But it's mitigated even more if I get a push in one direction and you get a push

331
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,248
in a different right from the start.

332
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:37,210
And then we're looking at the bank cards in a completely different way.

333
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:43,488
So now that you kind of know how it works, I can tell you some of the problems I

334
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:48,030
encountered along the way. The first problem was that defense was too good. So when I

335
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:55,075
say defense, I mean that counter crash mechanic. That's where I break a gem in my pile, I'm

336
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:59,117
going to send it to you and you say hold on a moment, you're going to crash a gem in your

337
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:04,681
pile and nullify the incoming gem. From the very first time we ever play tested this,

338
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:08,805
It worked exactly as it was supposed to in the early and mid-game.

339
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,087
And that's when you needed to work.

340
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:13,912
Because if it didn't work then, you'd be dead by the time you got to the late game.

341
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,153
So that's fine.

342
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:18,457
The problem is, what happens when players use this same mechanic

343
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,840
and lean on it heavily in the late game?

344
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,522
And what we found is that...

345
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:29,096
It was slow and hard to kill people and could be stalemate-y at times.

346
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:35,279
It was just generally frustrating that it wasn't anything like what I was going for.

347
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:41,062
It started with this story of how edge of the knife, back and forth it is, and it wasn't

348
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,803
really coming true because of this late game problem.

349
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:47,125
And then I thought, okay, what can we do about this?

350
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:53,728
it's not too hard to change some nuances of how that rule works and make it a little less

351
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:59,372
powerful, but when we made it even the tiniest bit less powerful, it failed to work during

352
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:03,534
the early and mid game and then everything was just all rushed down. So now I'm stuck

353
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:08,397
because I need to make it less powerful, but I can't make it any less powerful at all.

354
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,299
There's no setting that actually does what it's supposed to do.

355
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:15,838
And when I get stuck, I thought about StarCraft.

356
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,819
Why is this not a problem in StarCraft?

357
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,220
So in the early game, you can build bunkers.

358
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,000
That's your defense.

359
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,021
In the mid-game, you could build more bunkers

360
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:26,401
and add some siege tanks, add some turrets,

361
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,142
get a very solid defense.

362
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:31,403
But why is it that StarCraft does not have this problem

363
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:34,044
of being boring and stalemating and taking a long time?

364
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:35,365
It usually doesn't.

365
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:42,369
The answer is because they have very powerful late game units and my favorite is the carriers from the Protoss race.

366
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,272
So you build a fleet of carriers, you can just kind of take out anything.

367
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:51,815
And with that in mind, it really helped me realize what we needed to do in Puzzle Strike.

368
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:55,618
You need to be able to build up to something that just smashes through defense.

369
00:19:56,018 --> 00:20:02,962
And the main thing that you build in the game are the gems, combining them from 1 gem to 2 gem to 3 gem to 4 gem, which is the biggest.

370
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,324
So we should make the 4 gem.

371
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,973
big and fancy and special and look different

372
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,835
and have a special rule that says

373
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,816
when you crash a four gem at someone,

374
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,637
it is un-counter-crashable.

375
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,899
It simply ignores the defense rule the rest of the game.

376
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,021
And as soon as I did that, it worked immediately

377
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:23,963
and it went back to edge of your seat,

378
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,104
back and forth, back and forth.

379
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,367
So that was a success and it's in the shipped game.

380
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,128
The second problem I had though

381
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,049
is that offense was too good.

382
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:39,576
Okay. So to even explain what I mean by this, I've got to tell you about something called

383
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,439
mono purple. So mono purple.

384
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,833
Every time you play Puzzle Strike, you're building a deck,

385
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,934
you're building your deck from a set of cards

386
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:52,436
that always contains these purple ones.

387
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,917
And then there's a bunch of other non-purple ones

388
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:55,798
that change every time.

389
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,259
So if you were playing in a mono-purple way,

390
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,041
what it means is you kind of ignore the rest of the game

391
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,983
and you only just build a deck of these.

392
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:07,145
It's kind of a degenerate strategy.

393
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:09,006
And if you talk to some people,

394
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,247
they will say that the first version of Puzzle Strike,

395
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:16,068
was broken and was just all mono-purple,

396
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:16,768
it's all you should do.

397
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:18,789
That is not true.

398
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:20,790
But I'll tell you what is true.

399
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,750
There are real problems.

400
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,931
One problem is that if a new player

401
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,532
uses this kind of naive strategy,

402
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:28,693
it takes quite a bit to beat it,

403
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:30,694
which is kind of uncomfortable.

404
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,175
You'd hope that a simple strategy

405
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:34,275
wouldn't be too hard to beat,

406
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,676
but you really do kind of have to know

407
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,616
what you're doing to beat it.

408
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:38,037
So that's a negative.

409
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:45,802
But what about the experts? If you look at games between the best players, is that all they're doing?

410
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:53,707
And the answer is no. It's back to this. You saw decks on every point of this spectrum and it looked pretty healthy.

411
00:21:54,267 --> 00:22:01,953
The problem is that when they were using a rushdown strategy, a lot of the times that meant they were going mono-purple.

412
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:04,374
Not when they're doing econ or defense.

413
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:12,079
But I said, okay, that's not good, because that means like a third or almost a third of our strategy space

414
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,681
is this thing where you ignore most of the game, like, we can't have that.

415
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:18,863
The game had already shipped at this point.

416
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:24,286
And my players disagreed and said they actually really liked how it was.

417
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,448
But I complained more and more and said I really didn't like that.

418
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:32,088
You know, it's too hard for beginners, and like, should experts really be doing that a third of the time?

419
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:37,632
And we were trying to make an expansion which had new characters and new cards to build your deck from,

420
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:40,454
and my player said, okay, we'll just be really smart about it.

421
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,195
When we make the new characters and we make new cards,

422
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:50,660
we have it in mind the whole time that we want to kind of counteract this tendency for some people to just buy the purple chips.

423
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,601
So that's what we did, we worked on that.

424
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:53,982
And...

425
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:56,833
Here's how that went.

426
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:00,874
So making cards for this game, I don't know exactly why,

427
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:04,535
but it is the hardest design thing I've ever encountered

428
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:07,276
on any game that I've worked on or consulted on.

429
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:11,037
And it's something about how the systems are so intertwined

430
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:14,458
that like if you, any card that gives money or actions

431
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,279
or whatever, it has ripple effects

432
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,280
that have all sorts of unintended consequences.

433
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,481
And it's just really hard to make anything at all.

434
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:25,282
I mean, I can deal with that, but just saying it's hard.

435
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,443
But there's a second thing that is absolutely back-breaking.

436
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,644
It's much worse than that first thing.

437
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:37,705
So I would come up with an idea for a new card in the expansion, and my playtesters

438
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:40,526
who knew what they were doing, they'd say, oh, you can't have that.

439
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,086
Nobody would put that card in their deck.

440
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,467
They would just mono-purple instead.

441
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,782
and I would shake my fist and I would buff it and give them a new version.

442
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:51,965
They'd say still the mono purple thing. Then I'd buff it again.

443
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:56,008
And they'd say, okay, now you'll use it, but it's actually broken.

444
00:23:56,188 --> 00:24:00,432
Like you could just instantly win the game with this. And it happened.

445
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,033
Again and again and again and again.

446
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:06,513
And finally one time, it was just too much.

447
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:09,014
It was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

448
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:11,774
And I flipped out and I upended the tea table

449
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:12,854
and I said to the tester,

450
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,555
you will never tell me again that I can't have a thing

451
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,296
because of this monopurple business.

452
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,836
Like, we can't go on like this.

453
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:23,937
We have this tiny, thin film of design space

454
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,477
where it's powerful enough to be.

455
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:30,891
better than the purple chips, but not broken.

456
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,192
And we can't go on like that.

457
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:36,837
Like the whole endeavor of let's address this piece by piece,

458
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:40,061
band-aid by band-aid on each card has failed.

459
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,042
It's utterly failed.

460
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,423
And we need a system-wide change.

461
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:44,786
They were skeptical,

462
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:46,007
because they kind of already liked the game.

463
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,568
But they said, you know, what's the change?

464
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,551
And I said, I have no idea, so please help.

465
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:55,114
And we got the whole testing community to help.

466
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,235
They all submitted ideas.

467
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,417
And this went on for weeks and maybe months.

468
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:02,520
And I kind of felt like Christopher Columbus saying,

469
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,781
you know, there's gonna be this new world,

470
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,243
but then after a while, people are, they're skeptical.

471
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,064
Like, is there ever really gonna be land?

472
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:10,506
Everyone involved kind of knew that.

473
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,402
A lot of these ideas sucked, even though they're proposing them, they're just trying their

474
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:20,745
best to come up with some way that addresses our problem of the design space being too

475
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,046
small.

476
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,366
We tested a whole bunch of ideas.

477
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,989
Often they were too complicated or simple but didn't do what they were supposed to do.

478
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,052
After being stuck on this so long, I was like, okay, well, what would StarCraft do?

479
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:40,694
Let's think about our problem in my game

480
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:41,514
compared to StarCraft.

481
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:44,194
In StarCraft, you might build some Zerglings

482
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:45,675
and send them at the opponent's base.

483
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,395
In Puzzle Strike, you might put some purple chips

484
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,636
in your deck and combine, combine, crash.

485
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:51,996
Kind of similar.

486
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,477
In StarCraft, if they counter you,

487
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:56,497
then you lose your Zerglings.

488
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,598
But in Puzzle Strike, if they counter you,

489
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:00,838
you actually get to keep all of your purple chips

490
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,199
because they will cycle back.

491
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:04,359
That's like the Dominion mechanic

492
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,079
because the same cards are gonna cycle back

493
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:06,740
to your hand later.

494
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,601
okay, that's some cause for pause.

495
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:12,643
In StarCraft, in order to do an effective rush,

496
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,263
you have to cut back on your economy.

497
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,605
So if they counter you, they're gonna be ahead in economy

498
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:19,486
and then later on that's gonna be a big deal.

499
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,728
In Puzzle Strike, you don't really get behind.

500
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,690
in your economy when you try for this rushdown.

501
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,912
You get a little bit behind in the number of actions

502
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,354
per turn you can use, but you don't really get behind

503
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:33,397
in economy, and that is very questionable.

504
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,360
And then on top of all that, in StarCraft,

505
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,222
even if you could keep your Zerglings,

506
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,323
they're not really that relevant in the late game.

507
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,045
because they're not that powerful, but in Puzzle Strike,

508
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:47,066
the same purple chips are really great in the late game.

509
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:48,306
So when you frame it like that,

510
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,367
it's completely crazy and totally out of whack.

511
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:55,027
It would be like, you could attempt a rushdown

512
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:58,108
with almost no risk, even if you're countered,

513
00:26:58,488 --> 00:26:59,829
and you're happy with the results.

514
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,689
So something's wrong there.

515
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:04,890
You need to be behind economically.

516
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,490
Okay, so let's look at the chips.

517
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,611
Crash gem, you break a gem.

518
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:15,774
It sends it to the opponent. Also you get you get a resource you get a dollar the idea being that there's it's called gem

519
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:21,557
Power actually there's power inside the gem and you're releasing it by by crashing it, but that's really suspicious

520
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:23,458
You know that isn't that the problem can we delete that?

521
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:29,501
Turns out we can't that's it's too long of a story, but it messes everything up if you delete that okay fine

522
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:34,923
What about the other purple chip though so this one is when you put two two gems together?

523
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:37,344
I was thinking okay thematically

524
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:39,971
it's the opposite.

525
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:43,092
So what if it took energy to put the gems together

526
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:45,112
and then you release the energy when you crash it?

527
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:47,313
So maybe you have to pay a resource to do this.

528
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,334
And so that's thematic, but what about the dynamics?

529
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:56,055
If I choose to do combine, combine, crash against you,

530
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,695
I'm starting to rush you down.

531
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,896
And if that costs me $2 because of the two combines,

532
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:03,116
but you could defend without spending that,

533
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:05,598
you're getting $2 ahead economically,

534
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,439
and then I might rush you down really hard

535
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,540
and do it again, combine, combine, crash the next turn,

536
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,101
and now I'm $4 behind.

537
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:15,184
And that sounds like the kind of check and balance we need

538
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,485
where defense can actually counter offense.

539
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,006
So here's what the change would look like.

540
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:20,747
It's just adding a minus $1 to it.

541
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:29,035
And I came up with this this idea and made this graphic and then I went to post it on the forums

542
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,997
You know the forums that we had gone on for weeks or months trying to come up with an idea

543
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:40,560
There was an HTML error that when I posted it and accidentally took up the whole screen of the forums

544
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,921
It was just like the forums was just this one enormous chip

545
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:48,683
And the players were like wow it's so big. It's so dramatic

546
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:53,843
Yeah, I think I might have got some points for that.

547
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:56,965
So I think a lot of the players at that point realized

548
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,267
that was it, that was exactly the solution we needed.

549
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:00,828
There were some naysayers and they said,

550
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:03,611
you can't just put an extra minus $1 on this thing,

551
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:06,373
it's gonna, you need to redo the whole game,

552
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,134
you need to rebalance everything around it.

553
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,716
And I thought that was bogus.

554
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,478
So we tested a little bit and it turns out that.

555
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:18,322
About 80 or 85% of the cards, they worked better, not worse with that.

556
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:22,706
And it makes sense because when you take offense, defense, and economy, and one of them is kind

557
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:27,149
of like misaligned out of whack, and you make them make sense to each other relatively,

558
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,530
all the work that we had done.

559
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:33,604
It just kind of worked better than the extra 15% of cards.

560
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,145
Something about them may have relied on money,

561
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,846
especially much, and so we had to adjust those.

562
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,026
But it was easy to pick them out,

563
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,507
easy to identify them and fix them.

564
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:47,728
So we did and shipped this as a new edition,

565
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:48,748
and it totally worked.

566
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,312
So the summary of all this is that Puzzle Strike,

567
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:56,515
it has a structure that's similar to Dominion,

568
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,317
but all the dynamics are really modeled

569
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,218
after Puzzle Strike.

570
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,660
And then every time I ever got into trouble design-wise,

571
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,862
I looked to StarCraft for the answers.

572
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:07,406
So StarCraft is kind of the secret unsung hero of the game.

573
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:09,468
And that's my story, thank you.
