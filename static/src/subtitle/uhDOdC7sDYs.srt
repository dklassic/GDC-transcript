00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:06,012
Hello everyone, welcome to the GDC twitch channel, my name is Brian Francis your regular

2
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:11,495
Your regular host just hanging out here with you today on this fine Wednesday afternoon. Good afternoon

3
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:14,656
If you are somewhere east of me, good morning

4
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:19,179
If you're west of me and just happy high noon if you're here in California or on the west coast

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,483
We are here today playing a really cool game from when I was 12 years old.

6
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:29,969
The game is Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast. I'm letting the old logos fly by on the screen for a bit of nostalgia for everyone.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,712
Here we go. Here's the Raven Software logo.

8
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:40,519
I'm excited today. Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast was a game I played so much of in 2002, 2003, 2004.

9
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:50,407
It was announced earlier this month that the game would be re-released on Nintendo Switch and PS4.

10
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:58,352
Today, down in the left-hand corner of the screen, we are joined by four developers who worked on the original game.

11
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:06,638
Going from nearest to furthest, I've got your names on standby here, but why don't you guys just introduce yourselves while I load up Nar Shaddaa.

12
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,420
I'm Chris Foster, I was the lead designer on the project.

13
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:11,881
Michael, game programmer.

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,450
I'm James Monroe, a tech programmer.

15
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:18,361
Eric Biesman, a story from things like that.

16
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,447
Right on. Chris, I'm gonna ask you to take the lead on my first question here.

17
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:31,733
For everyone in chat, for folks like Adrenalinke, I do want you to know that you can ask questions too if you ask them in Twitch chat.

18
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:35,896
There are two kinds of questions. If you ask a question and we pull it for the stream.

19
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:43,421
We've also got Chris from Raven is hanging out in chat. He'll be grabbing some questions that you can ask as well.

20
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:47,142
For folks who are fans of Raven Software, we would advise...

21
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,123
We're here today to talk about Jedi Knight.

22
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:53,545
We would love to answer questions about Call of Duty, but unfortunately we can't do that

23
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:55,286
because we have to stay focused on Jedi Knight.

24
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:58,487
So if you have Call of Duty questions, feel free to drop them in chat

25
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:00,008
and maybe we can get you an answer.

26
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,789
But for the stream itself, we're going to be focusing on Jedi Knight.

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,651
Chris, I'm going to toss my first question to you as the design lead.

28
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:11,693
And as I enter this Nar Shaddaa bar that I remember so well.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,164
What was the origins of Jedi Knight 2? Because I believe this was Raven taking over development of the Dark Forces series, correct?

30
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,886
I'm going to toss this right at Eric.

31
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:31,711
Eric was our commander in chief on the whole thing, so he's best suited to answer the background.

32
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:41,076
Yeah, so Steve Raffel was actually the project lead, and he and Kevin Schilder did a great job. Unfortunately, I couldn't be here today.

33
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:46,837
So when we first started, we had just come off of working on Star Trek Voyager Elite Force,

34
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:53,060
and we worked with Paramount, and we had put a lot of love and passion into that game as well.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,662
And I think that that was something that helped us take a step towards LucasArts.

36
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,904
You know, they saw what we had done, they'd seen all the stuff we'd worked on before,

37
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:06,826
so just kind of like magic happened, and suddenly I'm working on...

38
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:12,309
the game that I've always wanted to work on in my life. I grew up on Star Wars and it made a huge

39
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:20,351
thing. So, huge dent in what I did with my life. So really it was, I think it was more fate than

40
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:26,753
anything. It just kind of happened. We had a lot of really good upfront meetings. We spent a lot of

41
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:31,114
coming back and forth. LucasArts people came out and visited us. We live in the middle of

42
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:34,455
frigid, frosty Wisconsin. They're in beautiful

43
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,162
sunny lovely California so we visited them more than they visited us.

44
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:44,606
But yeah just kind of I don't know if that answers your question it just you know I feel like it just

45
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:49,770
kind of happened after what we've already done. I mean our work it was an example of our work

46
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,851
I guess speaking for us.

47
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,507
No, not at all.

48
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:58,630
Just to follow up on that question, what was the lay-up, what was kind of the first blueprint

49
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,911
for what this game would look like?

50
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:07,055
Obviously following up on Jedi Knight meant you were, as following Kyle here, you would

51
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:10,516
be taking up a lightsaber again, but you're also, you know, you guys were coming from

52
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:11,397
a shooter background.

53
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:17,400
What were the first steps taken to lay out the programming and design for this game?

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,662
It's kind of like our prototype that we worked on.

55
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:27,325
Yeah, but I think, well, we started building a level of just test features, functionality

56
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:32,027
and things out, reflective surfaces, rebounding surfaces, how stormtroopers would walk around

57
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:32,987
AI and stuff like that.

58
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:37,669
So I built a little playground to help Mike and everybody feature all their stuff and

59
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,970
then they took it from there and made it like crazy.

60
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,591
Yeah, if I remember...

61
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,351
That's the same level that we released, that we showed at E3.

62
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,172
Right? And you built it.

63
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,414
And it was also what we released eventually as the demo for the game.

64
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:55,755
But if I remember correctly, we were originally going to do Dark Forces 3.

65
00:04:56,135 --> 00:05:00,437
And we, and they, like, just a shooter. No Force powers, no Jedi.

66
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:03,778
I don't know if it's because they thought we were an FPS studio or whatever, but we were like,

67
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:05,919
we can do Force powers, we can do lightsaber.

68
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,661
We've done Heretic 2, which is a third-person action game.

69
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,302
So we brought over some of that animation stuff.

70
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:18,663
and we took the Elite Force engine we'd done, we put them together, and the Ghoul technology.

71
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,003
Yeah, from Soldier Fortune.

72
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,444
Yeah, that allows dismemberment and stuff.

73
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,784
We put all that together, and hit location, like really...

74
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:24,965
Yeah, skeletal animation.

75
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:26,905
Yeah, all that stuff.

76
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,606
We put it all together and made a demo in about three weeks, I think it was.

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,066
It was quick.

78
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,307
It was very, very fast.

79
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,447
Yeah, and that was...

80
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,988
Brian Rathel took that to LucasArts and they're like,

81
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,108
oh, okay, I guess you're gonna do a Jedi game now.

82
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:39,408
Yeah.

83
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:41,849
Well, I think part of it was that we had the...

84
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:48,460
Kyle Katarn is Dark Forces, and at the end of Jedi Knight, he's a Jedi.

85
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,221
Yeah, he's a full-on Jedi.

86
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,824
And so to bring him back to Dark Forces was a challenge, and that's actually a challenge

87
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,445
we had to follow through in this game too.

88
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,926
That's why we started him without his lightsaber.

89
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,628
We just didn't want to start him as some uber-powered Jedi.

90
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:05,051
We also didn't want to create a new character for this one, because it had been a while

91
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,673
and we really wanted to make sure Kyle, who was a really cool guy, like I really like

92
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:10,554
his character and Janors and all the...

93
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,934
all those people that surround him.

94
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,095
We wanted to make sure that the game was about him.

95
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,977
So it was kind of questionable at the beginning,

96
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:21,798
like do we just start full on super powers,

97
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,340
force user, or do we bring him back to his roots?

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,640
And at the end of the day,

99
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,061
we decided to bring him back to his roots.

100
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:29,542
And I actually really think that turned out well.

101
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,183
Using that same hero's journey again.

102
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:31,783
Yeah.

103
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,725
And I think the design philosophy was

104
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,206
like the first few levels were like dark forces.

105
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,227
Yeah, totally.

106
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:39,007
And then it becomes.

107
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,357
Right on. We've actually got a solid question in chat. I'm gonna...

108
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,287
There's a... I'm gonna get to that question later.

109
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,490
Adrena, Lin-C, I may actually remember the cheat you're talking about,

110
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,531
but I'm gonna follow up on that.

111
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,554
What do you think, as game makers, was sort of the...

112
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:01,576
What was sort of the guiding limitation of your original tools

113
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:02,476
that you had to make this game?

114
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:05,698
Because obviously, it's much easier to sort of pop things into a prototype now,

115
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:08,520
but in 2001, 2002, that was not the case.

116
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,223
What do you think your team did well in getting this idea,

117
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,044
like from concept to execution?

118
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,299
But for some tech things, I think something we really did well was packing a lot of texture

119
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,540
detail in on the characters.

120
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,944
We had some advanced texture mapping tools that helped us pack them efficiently.

121
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,947
So for not a lot of memory, we got really high details on that.

122
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:37,611
And looking at it now, yeah, it's low poly, but for the time, we were maximizing everything

123
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,372
we could out of those.

124
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:43,716
And using skeletal animations, because the previous tech was using mesh animation.

125
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:48,693
this is much less memory so we had a lot more variety of animations so we could do all the flips

126
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:55,678
and saber attacks. Didn't we do a lot of large texture map like texture pages that had a whole

127
00:07:55,698 --> 00:08:00,743
bunch of that because with that way we could just use the drawing on the wall we could cut stuff

128
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:04,025
out as well we're like we're gonna put this on the window we're gonna put this piece on the

129
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,868
right underside of the bar we just took the textures off on the same page and just tried

130
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,110
to use them for everything we could.

131
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:13,025
One of the best part. Oh, go ahead.

132
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,205
Yep. What was, um, let me push this guy.

133
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,986
Okay, I can't push him off the edge and I'm getting shot by a disrupted rifle.

134
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:18,767
This guy's going great.

135
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:25,249
Um, uh, I was gonna say, well, what, what was you, you know, with, with having Star Trek and,

136
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,890
um, uh, Soldier of Fortune, uh, games under your belt, what was different about,

137
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,911
like, getting this texture pack together compared to those games?

138
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,698
It had to be realistic.

139
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:40,741
But it also had to look like the reference from all the movies and everything.

140
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:41,681
That's where I was going to go.

141
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,322
Star Wars was pretty...

142
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:48,686
We had our own environments that we were making up for some of the things.

143
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,627
But we knew we wanted Stormtroopers.

144
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,649
There's like the classic Star Wars characters that we wanted.

145
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,611
And so, from a prototype standpoint, we didn't have to do a bunch of concepts.

146
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,252
We didn't have to do...

147
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,913
We could just sit down and work.

148
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,694
I think that, at least from...

149
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,962
The Star Wars side of things really made it go a lot quicker.

150
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,903
We already knew the world that we wanted to make.

151
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:13,406
But as far as technology and stuff, it was really just building off of that technology that we already used.

152
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:17,968
We just, we had that in our pocket and we had it ready to go.

153
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,148
The, a fun little note, when we were doing the demo,

154
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,650
we were starting so quickly and coming right off of the Elite Force,

155
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,291
that for Stormtroopers, I just took the Klingons from...

156
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:28,893
Oh, I forgot about that.

157
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:32,555
We painted them white, put black around their eyes and those were our stormtroopers.

158
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,097
I forgot about that.

159
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:36,598
But they made the models really quick.

160
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,041
They were in for the demo by the time it was finished.

161
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,761
Yeah, they did.

162
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,722
They built this super fast.

163
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:43,903
Let's talk about lightsabers.

164
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:55,451
This game, I think, sticks in a lot of people's minds because it's one of the first Star Wars games that does third-person lightsaber action in a way that would be compared to for games when The Force Unleashed came out,

165
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,152
when The Force Awakens came out.

166
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:02,646
This is the big challenge of streaming and talking is, A, this game is already old school challenging.

167
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,067
That's a very difficult level.

168
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,929
That's a really hard level to do.

169
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,291
Guys, I'm going to be honest, your first two levels were really hard too.

170
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,633
Yeah, that was stupid.

171
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,255
I remember when I got to that level, I always got sniped.

172
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:13,915
Good job, Stu.

173
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:18,839
The thing about Nar Shaddaa, if I remember correctly, that was supposed to be before you get your lightsaber.

174
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,644
But at some point we were like, it takes too long to get your lightsaber, we're going to move those after you get your lightsaber.

175
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,825
But the design for the levels...

176
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,638
was still mostly for shooters.

177
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,820
So it's kind of weird you get your lightsaber and then don't get to use it a lot.

178
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,761
Because they're snipers.

179
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,061
Yeah.

180
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:37,223
But we ended up working on some of those puzzles to let you into the top of things.

181
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:41,545
We just had to retroactively work on some of that to make sure that the saber was still

182
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,166
really fun to actually use in here.

183
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,639
Yeah, like this bar fight in the beginning.

184
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,721
Yeah, once you get past all the snipers.

185
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,222
You can't avoid the snipers.

186
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,884
It's a little, it's actually, the bar fight is so great.

187
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,825
It feels so great because it feels like the Noir Jedi thing

188
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:54,626
you guys put together.

189
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,668
I really like that sequence, especially with

190
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,790
I was replaying it and I was so impressed

191
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,251
I'll get back to my question in a second, but

192
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,913
I was so impressed with the scene

193
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,714
what your cutscene and animation scene

194
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,895
were able to do with these low poly stuff

195
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:08,756
because even though

196
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,518
even though the models may look a little

197
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,739
old, sorry.

198
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:21,264
Um, the camera choices and the way the model, like the animations are pretty pose-driven,

199
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:27,087
does, you get that cinematic sense in a way that I don't, that I think a lot of newer games have

200
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:31,710
to do so much work to get with so many more effects. Alright, let's try sniping.

201
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,151
We definitely storyboarded on pretty much everything.

202
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:35,572
That was you?

203
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:35,932
Yeah.

204
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:36,652
That was me.

205
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:37,913
We had a lot of fun with that.

206
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:47,061
Um, okay, no scoping, no scoping. Um, uh, yeah, let's talk, like I said, we were talking about

207
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,824
the lightsaber and the reason I wanted to talk about the lightsaber, like I said, because,

208
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:55,249
um, everything from the, uh, the limbs that get chopped off to the marks that get left on the

209
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,834
wall, um, it's a very, like, free-flowing nature of it, where I can move right and swing,

210
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,036
moving left and swing. These are things that don't...

211
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:06,898
Like, if you think about KOTOR, if you think about the classics like side-scrolling games,

212
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:13,640
like the level of immediateness to this lightsaber usage wouldn't be met again for a while.

213
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,781
What do you, what was the core design and programming logic that made that possible

214
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,721
if you're able to share that?

215
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:26,883
For the lightsaber combat stuff, well for the effects, it was mostly Jeff Dishler.

216
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:31,645
I recall. He spent a lot of time on that, making it look really good, the lightsaber

217
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:38,407
blur, the glow itself, the marks on the walls and stuff. That was all him. The combat was,

218
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:46,910
we brought over the third person combat logic that we did for Heretic 2, and then expanded

219
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,871
it for this and put in a lot of transitions and try to keep it smooth. My goal was to

220
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:52,632
make it so that...

221
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:57,611
you could be moving in any direction and attack in any direction. I worked with the animators on that.

222
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:03,696
And tried to keep it as freeform as possible, to give you control in every direction.

223
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:10,020
And I wanted it to be quick, I wanted it to be responsive, I wanted it to be fairly lethal.

224
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,303
My actual inspiration for the combat was Bushido Blade.

225
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:20,107
It was old, I don't know, PlayStation 1 was it? PlayStation 1 game called Bushido Blade.

226
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,217
where you have these samurai fighting,

227
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,581
facing off with these different samurai weapons,

228
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,744
swords, naginata, stuff like that.

229
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,587
And you'd like fly through the air

230
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:30,568
and like slash at each other.

231
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,893
One hit could kill you if you timed it just right.

232
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:35,916
And that's kind of what I was aiming for.

233
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,162
Right on, I'm gonna go into the question pile real quick, so sorry I have to pause the gameplay for a sec.

234
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:43,183
Um...

235
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,124
Duh-duh-duh, um...

236
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,165
Uh, yeah, let's talk about first and third person views.

237
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:50,946
Like you talked about, you were borrowing some of your third person tech, um...

238
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,648
This is again one of those things that I think from a player's side...

239
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:57,249
At the time, it must have seemed like an easy thing to just say,

240
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,150
Oh, the game is in first and third person.

241
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,012
Um, nowadays you would still say, Oh, of course you can just...

242
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:08,478
set your camera to wherever it is. In 2001 and 2002, I'm sure that wasn't true, even though you had working tech.

243
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:17,066
Um, what was the... the secret to making... what techniques did you use to get a game that could switch between first and third on the fly like this,

244
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,228
and make sure that that didn't create any weirdness?

245
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,791
Oh, there was some weirdness.

246
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:23,952
Oh, hey, yeah!

247
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:27,776
We went through a lot of weirdness to get there, but yeah, we took the... I think we took the basic...

248
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:32,348
The engine already had a rudimentary third person to just set the camera back, and we

249
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:37,489
added in a bunch of scripting and traces to manipulate the camera to make it feel more

250
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:43,390
natural to do some cinematography type thing where if you back up into the wall it moves

251
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,070
the camera up.

252
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,852
Yeah, we did a lot of testing with that when we were building everything, especially those

253
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:52,893
little elevator shafts everywhere to make sure there's enough room for the camera.

254
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,433
Yep, and it would slide and move around.

255
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,893
And the little camera...

256
00:14:56,753 --> 00:15:00,116
I'm trying to remember, did we do it in here when you got some of the kills in slow motion?

257
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:04,201
Yeah, we made a target around the death.

258
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,482
Those were very cool.

259
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,625
But yeah, designing it we just had to make sure that you could do it either way.

260
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:11,638
And I'm trying to remember, you can switch on the fly.

261
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,459
You can switch on the fly.

262
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,059
There was a menu I can pop into here.

263
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,379
I think it's P.

264
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,500
By default?

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,360
Well, we're on PS4 now. We're playing the new release version.

266
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,761
I played it recently on the PC.

267
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,641
So you could shoot your guns in third person.

268
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,762
I remember I would charge up the Breyer pistol,

269
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:32,242
do a roll, and then come out of it and like

270
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,643
blast the guy right in the head when you stood up.

271
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:35,823
And then the...

272
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:39,448
Do you remember the first bug when we did first person saber?

273
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:40,589
There was first person lightsaber.

274
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,471
And you would do a roll and your saber would just hover.

275
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:43,872
Yeah.

276
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:44,832
It didn't work.

277
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:45,853
It can't roll.

278
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,735
It's not really attached to your body.

279
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:54,980
So yeah, we did do first person lightsaber and it was, we felt like because Jedi Knight

280
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,543
was first person lightsaber that we had to do a first person lightsaber but we kind of

281
00:15:58,563 --> 00:15:59,544
preferred the third person.

282
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:00,105
Right.

283
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:05,149
So we did it and the trick was like, I tried all sorts of different things of attaching

284
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:05,709
the players.

285
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,041
view to the actual model but then it was like moved around too much. I tried not doing that

286
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,522
and yeah and then your arms are moving around over here while you're back here.

287
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:20,723
So I blended the two and then I faded out the arms. I just put some alpha right from the arms

288
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:25,344
so they fade out and we went up to the shoulders. We used the actual third person arms though. Yes

289
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:30,106
and then so that would uh it would a little bit hide the the connects that you're not totally

290
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:35,367
connected. I'm not sure how many people played that way but we we uh put it in there but I don't

291
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:36,067
think we kept that for

292
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:42,486
Jedi Academy because there were just the saber staffs and dual sabers and all the acrobatics

293
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,788
and stuff just didn't really work.

294
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:45,808
Swiss Army Knife Sabers.

295
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:46,929
Look, Delphi!

296
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,430
Oh, face shot!

297
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:51,791
I would recommend Vespen.

298
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:58,075
Again, PS4, we're stuck, like I said, get ready to allot me dying.

299
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,216
This is not pro-play Jedi Knight 2.

300
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:03,898
This is someone who hasn't played Jedi Knight since...

301
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,120
This is as far as you were able to get.

302
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,701
It took me six hours to get this far, guys.

303
00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:15,305
When I was playing through it again, I realized that nowadays, when we're making any game,

304
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:19,007
we're doing serious talks about onboarding and steps-driven.

305
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:21,649
We did no onboarding for the most part.

306
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:25,203
Hey, you've got a gun. Do this stuff. Go figure it out.

307
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,284
Hey, you found a secret area. Good job. We didn't tell you.

308
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:32,225
And when you get your lightsaber, I was running around in one part of Bespin going,

309
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:36,086
why did I make this puzzle so hard? This is so painful. I keep having to heal.

310
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,547
And I was like, oh, that's right. We can wall run.

311
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,448
Oh, yeah. We never tell the player you can wall run.

312
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:41,748
I'm like,

313
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:44,278
Yep, that's how we got past that puzzle.

314
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,179
You were supposed to just know that from...

315
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,141
Yes, you were just supposed to realize that.

316
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,142
That was a different time.

317
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:52,344
It was. There were things called manuals that we expected people to read.

318
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,426
Oh, right. It was in the manual, you're right.

319
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,448
Yeah, exactly.

320
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,350
Man, I do want to, I need to take a minute.

321
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,072
I'm going to pause from trying to get past this sniper brigade.

322
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,974
I need to get to some of these great questions in chat.

323
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,938
We are going to go back to Adrena Linkta's question.

324
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:13,454
In the PC version of Jedi Outcast, there's a cheat where you can activate over-the-top dismemberment,

325
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,315
where you can cut off limbs and even whole torsos. I remember this cheat.

326
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:17,735
It was gruesome.

327
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:23,777
They heard that the game used the Ghoul 2 animation system, which was used in Soldier of Fortune.

328
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:29,259
Did the functionality of Ghoul 2 in Soldier in Fortune, was that also used in Jedi Outcast,

329
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,539
and did that lead to the existence of the Heavy Gore cheat?

330
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,200
Basically, yes.

331
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,042
The Ghoul was the skeletal animation system I was talking about earlier, where...

332
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:48,036
That gave us the ability to pretty much zero out any limb just by zeroing the scale so we could cut off at any joint.

333
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:58,483
So with that in mind, I think Mr. Gummel here added the realistic saber where as soon as it touches you, it severs you.

334
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:01,399
Just readings wise.

335
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,539
This was a debugging tool.

336
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,423
This was debugging the joints so we could make sure every one of them looked correct when they got severed.

337
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:10,546
I wanted to make sure if I cut off more than one part it would work correctly.

338
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:21,154
I wanted to make sure the lightsaber was doing, you know, I could try out making the lightsaber more deadly by increasing the damage or making it do damage when it's not in the middle of an attack, like if it's in a transition or anything like that.

339
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:22,455
That was the deadly one I remember.

340
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,451
I just actually tested out someone in chat pointed out if you click R3 on the PS4 version

341
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,856
You can switch between those first and third person view. So here's that first person view we were talking about

342
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:36,138
Yeah, that's the first person view.

343
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,419
Yeah, I see your arms.

344
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,641
See how they're kind of faded out there at the bottom.

345
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,323
Now can you do a forward roll?

346
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,205
Yeah. Did Aspyr do the forward for this?

347
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:44,766
Yeah.

348
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,748
Yeah, it's Aspyr. Aspyr Media.

349
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,028
So you can...

350
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,286
You can do the forward roll in first person, but your view just goes forward.

351
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:58,047
Yeah, roll. Because when it was actually attached to the body, it was too disorienting.

352
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:00,507
Right on.

353
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:05,568
Oh, Chris Graft, Mysterious Interloper Chris Graft, who is also Gamma Sutra Editor-in-Chief,

354
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:11,330
would like to know, are there any aspects of Back in the Day Game Dev that you look on fondly that don't exist today?

355
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,490
Oh god, yes.

356
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:12,890
Yeah.

357
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,359
How long did it take to finish this thing?

358
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,201
Being able to make a game in 10 months for 24 people.

359
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,922
Yeah, that was nice.

360
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,584
One of the things with fast development,

361
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,625
we do talk about is back then

362
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,146
we wore a lot of hats.

363
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,708
Like, I built levels, I was in

364
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,750
charge of the design team, but I also

365
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,892
had the light levels, I was scripting,

366
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,773
and we were doing all the continuity

367
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,435
of everything, and we were helping Eric

368
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:37,395
make sure that

369
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:41,006
when the dialogue went in that it all made sense given what we had to change around.

370
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,748
So we were doing tons of things.

371
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:47,752
A lot of times now we're a little more segmented like we build the levels and we do whatever

372
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:53,057
but somebody else is doing a Hollywood level layer and somebody else is you know a scripter

373
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,079
that has you know 20 years of experience doing it.

374
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,580
So we kind of spread.

375
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:00,164
a lot of those tasks out, so it means a lot more communication has to happen.

376
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:05,836
Yeah, I think for me it really comes down to, when I started I think there was 13 people

377
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,362
at Raven, and now there's two-something.

378
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:11,456
And that's a portion of what goes into making a game.

379
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:14,259
Like you have four or five hundred people that could be out making a game.

380
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,121
And I still love it.

381
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,622
I still love the people I work with.

382
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:20,345
And I got to meet a lot of really cool people at different studios.

383
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:24,289
But there was just something about, like Chris said, I would be working on the narrative.

384
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,850
I'd be working on ketchup base.

385
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:28,573
I would be retexturing and talk to our artists.

386
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:29,915
I'd help with art, like.

387
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:35,388
it was there was just more for you to do and I personally have not really been in an editor

388
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,992
and I don't know how long and it's it's it's something that you really miss and I miss

389
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:45,777
I need a minute to work on yeah yeah I'm just running away from you guys

390
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,682
oh look grenades oh these guys love throwing grenades

391
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:57,920
exactly in a PC game on a PC, but it's been harder on console.

392
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,761
Yeah, how does it feel with the DualShock?

393
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:05,444
Uh, so I played this on GameCube back in the day, so this is already like, it feels better

394
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:09,826
than it did back then because the GameCube controller was a proto-FPS controller.

395
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:10,747
Right.

396
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:18,135
It feels, the looseness of the camera is the only challenge, but it's also just, I had

397
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:22,620
this realization yesterday, if I go back and play Halo, I know exactly what I'm doing,

398
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,684
like the shooter controls for Halo have defined most of the shooters I've played since then.

399
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:31,946
This game feels like kind of the end of the doom era like like with key hunting like kind of a floating gun

400
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:35,607
I'm gonna walk around with the gun for a minute, but like this kind of like there's no aiming down the sights

401
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:40,308
There's no snapping behind cover like the most effective way to murder a bunch of stormtroopers is to effectively do this

402
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,989
To just juke back and forth with blasters

403
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,489
I made it through that part. So I'm gonna save real quick

404
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:52,991
There's an interesting challenge with the ps4 version of this game where I may accidentally fill up all my saves and I may have to

405
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:56,351
Go delete some if that happens, but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it

406
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:04,714
May I? Just gonna go back to the chat real quick. There's a bunch of great people expressing

407
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:11,276
their love for the game. Quick shout out to Mace Maddenis who's still modding Jedi Academy

408
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:18,718
after 10 years. Wow! Dark Shadow Rage bought the Switch version. They love Outcast.

409
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,055
10 years of modding Academy.

410
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:23,978
That's really awesome.

411
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:26,401
Yeah. I'm going to dive into my

412
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,322
question pool again.

413
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:30,346
So you talked about going to

414
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,289
fly out to work with LucasArts and some

415
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,871
of LucasArts working with LucasFilm.

416
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:41,955
I'm gonna ask a two-part question on this. One, what did it mean to work with an external partner

417
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:46,736
like that back then in GameDev? Because back in the day, licensed games were a lot less riskier.

418
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:50,598
They feel a lot more riskier these days, given the financial partnerships that have to take place.

419
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:53,018
I got shot. I hate that guy.

420
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,583
And the second part of the question is, what kind of resources do they have for making

421
00:23:59,623 --> 00:24:01,064
this Star Wars game feel like Star Wars?

422
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:07,848
Because the Battlefront devs talk about how they get to go out to old Star Wars locations

423
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:12,872
and record audio from those locations and pick up textures from the audio.

424
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:17,215
Sorry, I was rushing through my question there, but what resources do they provide to make

425
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,616
a Star Wars game look like Star Wars?

426
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,247
Well, they have the library.

427
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:27,230
They had a massive text library and the reference library where you got a lot of shots and things

428
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,891
when you were out there.

429
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:34,874
So when we started, I would say that we still had to paint all of our own textures, but

430
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,656
most of the stuff that we had, consider this was only the first three movies.

431
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:41,138
This was before Jar Jar was introduced.

432
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:48,233
And it was, there was just a ton of, they had their library and they had, they had,

433
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:53,096
they still do I think, they still have a division of people that are just there to, you know,

434
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,077
tell you if it's usable or canon or not.

435
00:24:55,157 --> 00:25:02,301
So we had to have a lot of yes or no conversations and there was a lot of times where actually

436
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:04,343
I could find.

437
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,248
be like, no, they have to say yes to this.

438
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:08,049
Why do they say no?

439
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,310
I will go find reference in a comic book

440
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,431
to show them that it's already out there.

441
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,412
Yes, it is canon.

442
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,554
Yeah, and then they'd be like, all right, fine.

443
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,535
You can have a gold protocol droid.

444
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:19,656
That's not, you know, stuff like that.

445
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:23,219
And it was, it was, it was cool,

446
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,900
but at the same time, it can get pretty frustrating.

447
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,762
I would say like, as far as like what we came into,

448
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,383
they sent us books.

449
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,722
movies, comics, like they had a lot of physical material that we could look at and look through.

450
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:42,905
And then, like I mentioned earlier, I think, I can't speak for all of us, but Star Wars nerd

451
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:47,727
would pretty much define me growing up especially. So I had all this, you know, Star Wars role-playing

452
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:52,569
game stuff, I had all these different things. So I already had like this really, like this was a

453
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:57,411
dream come true. Like this was seriously, never in a million years did I think I'd get to work

454
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,171
on a Star Wars title.

455
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:04,549
And so I was lucky enough to get to go out and work on the story and they took me to Lucas Ranch.

456
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,191
I got to have lunch right next to George Lucas. I couldn't look at him or talk to him

457
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:15,153
because they warned us about that when we got there. But you know as a nerd boy growing up

458
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:20,395
in Wisconsin this was like the most amazingly cool thing I'd ever done in my entire life.

459
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:29,756
I kind of a weird follow-up question on that. I like I like

460
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:36,325
I am endlessly fascinated by how story and experience emerges from tools and shapes.

461
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:41,066
What do you think was the biggest contribution you guys did for Star Wars in terms of something

462
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:43,066
that could only happen in a video game?

463
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:49,928
Because it's easy, big air quotes, to make up story ideas and say, oh, it would be cool

464
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:50,728
if this happened in Star Wars.

465
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:54,309
It's another thing to say, because our game could only do this, this is kind of the only

466
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,749
thing that could happen in this moment in this way.

467
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:59,850
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to snipe these Rodians because I hate them.

468
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:04,414
Well, we fostered hatred of Rodians.

469
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:09,599
Oh, I like Rodians! I hate to take these ones!

470
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,062
Okay, these Rodians, yes, exactly.

471
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:22,592
That's a really good question. I mean, there was the Reborn, the Remnant, all those things that kind of came out together.

472
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:28,922
I mean the whole expanded universe actually was pretty cool and how everything tied together.

473
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:33,826
Obviously since we worked on it I was disappointed when Disney mixed it all.

474
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,269
I kept expecting to see Kyle in Rogue One.

475
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,830
Kyle would have been great in Rogue One.

476
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,292
Cassian Endurance.

477
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,914
I thought he was going to be in Disney at one point.

478
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:44,794
Kyle Katarn.

479
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:45,575
Let's put him back.

480
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:46,316
Yeah.

481
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:49,358
But you know again I think Star Wars was huge but it wasn't as...

482
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:56,650
Huge as it is now like now there's almost like everywhere you go there's Star Wars

483
00:27:56,731 --> 00:28:02,576
And and well we made it accessible through the game because you can actually then jump into Star Wars in this case and actually feel

484
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:05,959
Like you were in the world. I mean getting killed by Rodian

485
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,180
Yeah, exactly

486
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:16,007
What's funny is I killed them and then I accidentally loaded the game to where I hadn't killed them

487
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,689
Oh, I was like, why did I do that?

488
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,209
Huh?

489
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,712
I want to say too about the modding, the person you mentioned modding before.

490
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,193
Modding was really important to this game.

491
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:33,056
When this game came out and we saw how many people were making content for it, making

492
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:39,119
character models for it, lightsaber models for it, James and I tried our best to make

493
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:44,421
Jedi Academy as mod-friendly as possible, externalizing a lot of the data, putting it

494
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,062
in text files, making it easy to mod.

495
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:53,629
The first external data, most of it was scripted back then, but we moved it to text files so

496
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,791
that you could change the values.

497
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:59,655
Right, and that was really important to me personally too because I started as a modder.

498
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:04,660
When I applied at Raven, it was sending Doom and Quake mods to them.

499
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,985
I wanted to see it make the game really easy to mod, so for me it's really awesome to see

500
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:11,686
that people are still modding it all these years later.

501
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:16,064
To go on mods real quick, I'm actually going to build off of that.

502
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:23,368
I saw a great tweet from Radiator Yang, his handle is Radiator Yang, I believe it's Robert

503
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:30,272
Yang is his full name, talking about how much level design tools that are available to the

504
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:30,993
public have changed.

505
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,175
On the one hand, anyone can license Unity or Unreal, on the other hand, there isn't

506
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:37,437
quite that Doom or Quake mod for people to just play around in.

507
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,078
How do you feel...

508
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:52,144
I guess you guys obviously have made a very moddable game, but how do you feel that games like Doom and Quake were at the time for modders, and do you feel like people still have those opportunities to show off their own skills?

509
00:29:53,565 --> 00:30:01,769
They can in certain games. I mean, Valve's got their stuff for Team Fortress, and obviously the Black Ops tools are out for...

510
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,030
They're out for 4.

511
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,051
I don't know if they did for 4.

512
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:09,453
Okay, but they were out for 3, and I mean, people can go out there and make all kinds of mods and all kinds of...

513
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,582
Changes I mean, I think the world sorry. No, I was gonna say it's a it's a little

514
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:18,963
Different I suppose because you have a few more options

515
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:22,405
But I guess you have to be really invested in the game to really want to do that

516
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:28,107
I think the world quote-unquote the game world changed when consoles became

517
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:32,529
Yeah, the king like back when this kid like this was built for PC

518
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,311
We we only were a PC studio and that's why you know, the other company imported it

519
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,802
And so it's a lot easier to use a keyboard and a mouse and be able to modify stuff and

520
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:49,483
Offer tools that are supported that way than it is to do it for like a console game

521
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,884
So I think like that's that's part of it is just as we've gone along

522
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:58,506
It's just we we've focused more on console games, just the entire industry in general

523
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:00,826
Really quick

524
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:14,889
Instigator007 points out that Halo Forge is an excellent resource still available to people.

525
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:22,916
I was using GTK Radiant and I expanded the ladder map that you made.

526
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:32,204
We used to test AI, like I just scripted it to spawn increasingly difficult waves of enemies and we released that.

527
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,045
But I was using GTK Radiant.

528
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:37,559
earlier this year to expand that and modify it.

529
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,281
So you can still modulate tools.

530
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,321
The Sames tools still work.

531
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:45,603
And we released pretty much all the tools for this, the

532
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:47,463
Simulate and ModView and all that other stuff.

533
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:47,924
Simulate.

534
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:49,204
That's your new track.

535
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,324
I'm going to dive into the question pool again.

536
00:31:55,925 --> 00:32:01,430
One of the things that I was fascinated on revisiting this was the, not only is this,

537
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:05,434
I feel like a lot of people working in Star Wars outside of the movies have wanted to

538
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:07,096
see that grittier side of Star Wars.

539
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:12,241
I could dive, I'm a Star Wars history nerd, so I could dive into like the crime show that

540
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,283
was supposed to be made before the Disney buy.

541
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:19,407
But the idea of gritty Star Wars is not in and of itself fascinating, but at the same time you guys are the you know

542
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:25,612
You took a brand that the time was if anything getting more kid friendly and released a a version where which we discussed before

543
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:31,077
People's limbs were getting dismembered extremely you are literally showing that just we just watched a bunch of people get disintegrated

544
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,619
what was kind of the

545
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:40,464
The feel at the time for that kind of storytelling and that or in that kind of visual design in your in your Star Wars world

546
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:43,259
You got something else you want to say?

547
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,502
Well, I was going to say something I remember specifically from that era.

548
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:52,446
We've just come from Elite Force where all the weapons and ships were super clean and shiny.

549
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:56,869
And here, I remember having a conversation about how the whole world is different now.

550
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:01,833
Things are gritty and grimy and scratched up and dirty.

551
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:06,556
And it was a very stark contrast switch to this world.

552
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:09,499
It's high tech beat up.

553
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,680
It's all well used industrially.

554
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:18,903
I think, too, like, well that's not totally related, but I think one of the things that,

555
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:23,167
I think one of the reasons we did, you know, licensed games well is because we were fans

556
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:24,108
of every license we got.

557
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,109
That's right, we had a lot.

558
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:30,674
Like, we knew, we knew Star Trek and Star Wars, you know, Wolverine and X-Men.

559
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:36,400
To be fair, like, to be fair, I know I keep saying that, it's my new words apparently.

560
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,870
Back then, licensed games were the king.

561
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:43,413
If you had a movie title, you were the king.

562
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:44,693
You were walking on water.

563
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,235
To get a new game up and off the ground

564
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,716
with a brand new license was not an easy thing to do.

565
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:52,278
And working with Activision too,

566
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:54,399
I know that they were very much about trying to find

567
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,101
co-marketing and getting people connected that way.

568
00:33:57,241 --> 00:34:00,423
So it wasn't until probably right when we started,

569
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:03,265
we just finished up Wolverine, right?

570
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,366
X-Men Origin Wolverine.

571
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:09,287
It was sort of the downfall of movie games almost, I felt like, where movie games...

572
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,110
Because they had to be so connected to an actual movie, they became really hard to make.

573
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,312
And they didn't give the returns that they used to.

574
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:21,334
And on top of the licensing fees, it feels like, just went up.

575
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:23,875
And so the returns you'd have to make to keep your company doors open...

576
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,697
Are you behind me too? Seriously?

577
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:30,539
There's one above you, one behind you, and one in front of you.

578
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,140
So... go left.

579
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,581
Go left.

580
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:40,948
As far as the dismemberment stuff goes, I remember there was a debate in rules about

581
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,789
what you can dismember and what you can't dismember, how much...

582
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,369
That was in Cavitation.

583
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:52,171
And then you go see... and then Episode 3 comes out and Anakin cuts off both of Dooku's hands

584
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,011
and his head.

585
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,452
It's like, oh, okay.

586
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:55,872
And they're like, really?

587
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,733
And he's chopped in half, right?

588
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:58,273
Yeah.

589
00:34:58,553 --> 00:35:00,193
Well, they said that was okay because it wasn't...

590
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:04,994
Anakin gets arms and legs and burns his wrists and is like, holy crap.

591
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:05,915
Well, that was...

592
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:12,436
We had a hot patch right there at the end where we had to dial down the chance of dismemberment

593
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:17,481
per location and the neck was something like 10% but we had to take it down to, did we

594
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:18,702
make it actual zero?

595
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,443
We made it actually zero.

596
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:22,004
Unless it was a droid, you couldn't make it.

597
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:23,786
That's right, we made it actually zero.

598
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:27,809
We were like, it's a really low chance and they were like, no, that's too much chance.

599
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,511
So you're right, yeah, zero.

600
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,873
So you had to go up and jump down onto that thing, I think.

601
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,845
I did have a game facts guide open.

602
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,306
Yeah, I'm just going to get shot a lot, aren't I?

603
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:41,268
Alright, how do I get up on this?

604
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,751
Um, it is back at that front area, isn't it?

605
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:45,812
Yeah, there's a little window.

606
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:46,612
Yeah.

607
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:47,613
Hmm.

608
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:49,114
Hmm.

609
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:53,978
Do I have to shoot this, right? Nope.

610
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:56,901
You have to go up a level and jump down onto the roof.

611
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,162
Jump down onto the roof.

612
00:35:58,702 --> 00:35:59,763
Got it. Oh.

613
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:00,704
Yeah.

614
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:04,447
Well, you know, some of the other things that I noticed when I played through was

615
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,381
You don't always get the best clue of which glass is breakable.

616
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:16,124
We try to have the most breakable have either cracks in it or a pattern in it that it's unbreakable.

617
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:17,264
But if it's clear, it's breakable.

618
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:21,266
Yeah, but there are some clear glasses here and there that we had that were not breakable.

619
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,448
It just happens sometimes that they became bulletproof.

620
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,709
Yeah, exactly. It just happens.

621
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,592
I think in the past, especially, there was sort of the designer mantra of...

622
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:43,720
Harder is better. Yeah, you still see games that are really hard and they thrive on those dark souls. Yeah

623
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:49,202
Consider this the dark souls. Yeah

624
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:55,664
Everyone at home you are being introduced to my kitten Ellie. She decided to join us and is squeaking into the microphone

625
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:03,547
So if you hear her say hi to her she loves video games and she loves Star Wars she likes eating Star Wars Legos

626
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:10,898
Um, so we only have 20 minutes left in our chat.

627
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,258
Unfortunately, I could go all day.

628
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,760
I could, but unfortunately these folks in the room need to go back to making video

629
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,060
games.

630
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,641
I'm told that I'm told that you can't just talk about video games, although you

631
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,762
need to actually make video games.

632
00:37:22,562 --> 00:37:27,764
Um, yeah, we can just hang out.

633
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:29,125
Production does not approve.

634
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:31,866
By the way, this is my current lightsaber.

635
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:32,486
Oh.

636
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:36,353
I will pause for a minute just to admire this.

637
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:46,303
So I, uh, modified it to, uh, have the sound, the actual sounds from the game.

638
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:47,264
Uh-huh. Ooh!

639
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:51,969
And that's just, that's just a, um, that's not one of the new, um, hilts from Disney, right?

640
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:52,830
That's, that's like a...

641
00:37:53,388 --> 00:38:00,774
No, this is a help that I think Saberforge made and then I modified it a bit to make it look more like Kyle's lightsaber.

642
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:11,303
Nice. I do my best on the stream to keep things related to game development, but I, as a Star Wars nerd, need to stop and admire my craftsmanship.

643
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:15,166
Um... um... okay.

644
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,634
Moving on from the greater thing, let's dive into the- we've danced around the topic of tools this whole time, but I'm curious,

645
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:26,498
what were the tool- you already mentioned the names of some of the tools, but what were the tools like that you used to make this game,

646
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:32,623
and what do you think worked well about those tools, and what do you think that helped you iterate quickly,

647
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,086
and what do you think they could have- like, what were the things you were trying to improve as you were making them?

648
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:40,289
Radiant was our editor for the levels.

649
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,593
By this time, at least, Radiant had more than a top-down view.

650
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:52,644
Because when we first started working in the Quake editor, it was only top-down.

651
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:57,985
You had the Z-checker, and that was the only way you could tell floor above floor or anything.

652
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:02,166
So as soon as we were able to actually have multiple views, it was like a godsend.

653
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:03,606
It was a game changer.

654
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:11,748
But really, I mean, Radian is Radian, and at its core, building brushes, surface, all

655
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:12,208
of those things.

656
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,180
It's pretty solid.

657
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,502
Patches have changed quite a bit from the way they used to have to be implemented.

658
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,505
I mean, they were a lot more like a nerd back then, but we also had bending mode, so we

659
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,405
couldn't just grab points.

660
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:28,750
We had to hit a tool to take a pipe and actually bend it on a specific angle, then save it

661
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,691
and make sure it didn't crash, because we put too many parts in it.

662
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:32,752
We're like, hey, it's saved.

663
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,074
This was before normal maps.

664
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,315
This was before specular.

665
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:39,096
So we didn't, you know, textures were just painted.

666
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,538
We added normal maps.

667
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,067
the game you put in.

668
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:44,587
Did we?

669
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:46,287
It's at the very end, yeah.

670
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:46,727
That's cool.

671
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:47,828
It was in the first ports.

672
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,128
I know we had to write a lot of tools for ourselves.

673
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:50,928
We did.

674
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:56,389
For like the model viewer and the editing note tracks

675
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:58,490
in the model viewer, I think we did that.

676
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,331
And stripping out the script, we did that for Elite Force.

677
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:04,771
Stripping out the dialogue out of the script

678
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,852
to turn it into subtitles and that sort of thing

679
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:08,832
and sound files.

680
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:09,812
Oh, gosh.

681
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:11,653
I had to hand, my friend, I had to hand

682
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:12,093
go through.

683
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:15,556
for voice modulation for head down.

684
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:21,900
I had to mark which vowel forms people had to use for their mouth.

685
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,722
We didn't have lip sync tech.

686
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:27,524
So we did animations for this one, right?

687
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:30,606
The previous one we did texture pages, but this one was animation.

688
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:36,189
And you tagged it, which you had to put in brackets, which phoneme.

689
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,871
Yeah, which phoneme so that it would pick a matching vowel.

690
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,072
I remember I wrote a little...

691
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,615
I guess procedural kind of head bobbing as they would talk based on the volume of the file they're saying.

692
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:52,441
We would use the average volume to drive the animation.

693
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:56,726
Oh really? Wait, wait, wait. No, I need to nerd out about that.

694
00:40:57,106 --> 00:41:01,731
I'll nerd out about the figure in a minute, but how did using the volume to drive the animation work?

695
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:02,853
Well, so...

696
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:04,624
Well, I was talking about the saved memory.

697
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,066
We don't store all the animations.

698
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:08,930
Like, the upper animations are completely separate from the

699
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,753
lower legs so that we could do all those left, right attacks

700
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:12,775
and running.

701
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:14,497
The facial animations are the same way.

702
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:16,880
We just stored, what was it, seven phonemes?

703
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,201
Different mouth shapes.

704
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:24,510
That was to drive all the animations and then to make it seem more realistic, we added some head motion.

705
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,530
Yes, they're not just puppets.

706
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,770
So they're not just puppets, right?

707
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,851
Trying to keep the interest, like they're nodding and bobbing.

708
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:35,213
And so we just basically made it random, but as an input to the random number generator with the volume,

709
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:39,254
so that if they're speaking more emphatically, their head will move more.

710
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:39,934
Right.

711
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:43,595
And that was just a free way to make on-the-fly animations.

712
00:41:44,287 --> 00:41:48,330
I'm sure that's a trick that's still used today to some extent, but I just haven't heard of it being

713
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:51,593
of such a programmatic solution being implemented with animation.

714
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:53,414
You did that in Elite Force and carried it over to this.

715
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:57,117
Yeah, there's a lot of programmatic solutions back then just because the memory was so tight.

716
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:03,543
I mean, look how many textures we have in this world. It's not a...

717
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:04,463
Not a large set.

718
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:11,169
I'm just trying to get some breathing room here. Okay, cool.

719
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:17,894
back to tanks.

720
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:30,662
Oh wow, is that with a Yu Zhong Vong?

721
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:34,485
Yeah, so I had to get that.

722
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:41,631
So it's called comic, but yeah, like the way I could, like I said, I could talk too much about how the Old Eagle worked, the logic of it.

723
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:45,474
I could spend too much time there. I'm going to check chat to make sure there's any questions.

724
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:49,457
Oh, Bucky21659 has a great question.

725
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,860
Is there anything you can talk about as far as cut concepts or content?

726
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,581
or things that changed during development. For instance, they heard Tavion was going to be male

727
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,723
and was supposed to be encountered again near the end of the game.

728
00:42:59,443 --> 00:42:59,823
That's right.

729
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,624
So, do you remember this?

730
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:04,145
Do you remember anything? Go ahead.

731
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,207
You know you were first to ask.

732
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:07,547
You start.

733
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:10,368
Are we those chipmunks?

734
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:12,249
I have to look something up, so you start.

735
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:14,970
Well, I just, I mean there's a ton of stuff that

736
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,091
hit the cutting room floor.

737
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:18,692
I don't know how many stories

738
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,633
I put together, I don't know how many different

739
00:43:20,673 --> 00:43:22,394
locations, like again, this was like

740
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:29,686
Nerd Eric's dream. So I was pulling in like everything that I could possibly get character wise.

741
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:37,409
You know, we were lucky we got Lando. And that was just like, holy cow, just to be able to have

742
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:42,512
Lando in the game was amazing. And it's kind of it's, it's something we always joke about,

743
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:47,974
but we were actually running a Star Wars RPG game. And so a lot of the characters in that game,

744
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:52,777
that's Tavion, that's Ardis, that's D'Sonn, those are those are characters that we had.

745
00:43:54,393 --> 00:44:02,619
different things like that, but I couldn't, I don't even know where to start with things that were in and went away or never even made it to the day.

746
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,841
So, change the opening level.

747
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:05,962
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:44:06,002 --> 00:44:08,664
Yeah, we'll change the opening level.

749
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:16,290
So I was going to say, the bad guy, Tavian, the story behind that was, I had suggested that we make a...

750
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:21,094
a bad guy based on Bruce Lee, but the specific Bruce Lee no one ever saw.

751
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:25,138
That was an audition he had done for Shaw Brothers films.

752
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:28,881
So he had a very kind of Shaw Brothers look to him.

753
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,543
So it was kind of like, I don't know if this is going to show up.

754
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,024
It's showing up. It's good.

755
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,666
Yeah. So it's that look right, like that.

756
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:36,147
Yeah.

757
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,869
And we originally were going to do that.

758
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,131
And I think then it became a woman, like the story changed everything.

759
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:43,713
But we did end up using something like that.

760
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,295
For this guy, you'll see sometimes he's a Jedi trainer.

761
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:46,655
Yeah.

762
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:48,002
That's what it became.

763
00:44:48,703 --> 00:44:51,223
But that was something I remember that was a cut concept.

764
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:53,464
So we still use them somewhere else?

765
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:54,524
Yeah.

766
00:44:54,984 --> 00:45:03,327
I think coming up with D'San, even being his own race, was coming up with a new type of

767
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,947
creature for Star Wars at the time was hard to get passed through.

768
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:09,108
It had to go to Lucas.

769
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,849
We had all these things we had to jump through.

770
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,970
What got cut for technical reasons?

771
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,609
I wanted to, oh no that was for Jedi Academy.

772
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:20,369
Yeah, flying.

773
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,290
No, well okay.

774
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:22,690
The ships.

775
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,171
So the flying we did that in, I did that as a mod after Jedi Academy, being able to fly

776
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:27,571
the ships.

777
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:30,712
But for Jedi Academy I wanted you to be able to build your own lightsaber.

778
00:45:31,173 --> 00:45:31,893
That's right.

779
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:32,573
Yeah, that's right.

780
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:37,174
Although for Outcast I do remember, like we could only have a certain amount of lights,

781
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:42,576
and like in the Doomgiver levels, like I went through and I started putting colored lights

782
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:47,479
everywhere like every point in the world where there was a light I really wanted to make it feel

783
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,902
like a real place and it we ran out of

784
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,301
It ran out of entities essentially, and those all got torn out in order for it just to run.

785
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:57,542
It was so depressing.

786
00:45:57,602 --> 00:46:01,743
Didn't some of the levels have to be split in half when they were ported to the console?

787
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:03,504
We had to split a lot of them, yeah.

788
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:06,925
We had to chop a whole bunch of them in pieces and we were like, where's the logical point?

789
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:08,765
We were just playing through, like, here?

790
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:11,386
It was because of something you had to go back and forth.

791
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:15,047
Yeah, we had to chop some of those spots where we were like, this isn't optimal but it's

792
00:46:15,428 --> 00:46:15,688
going to work.

793
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,048
But that was just for consoles.

794
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:17,408
Yeah, exactly.

795
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:18,849
For PC we were just like, yep.

796
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:20,209
Well.

797
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:24,517
Art Salad actually asked a smart question.

798
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:27,539
Couldn't you use shader lights instead of entity lights?

799
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:31,802
They didn't cast light, right?

800
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:35,805
Yeah, they were shadow casting and some of them were scripted to blink and stuff.

801
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:36,805
So they were not baked.

802
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:42,389
And we didn't have shaders, like GPU shaders back then.

803
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,671
Answer. The tech didn't exist yet.

804
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:52,242
Right. This game is entirely on the CPU. The GPU is just the fixed function triangle rasterizer.

805
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:59,444
To springboard off that chat while I deal with another pair of annoying Rodians,

806
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:07,351
um, this is so- I do, I do actually- weirdly I've like, as an adult now, I've picked up on so many subtle design things

807
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:13,716
that help make this game make sense, like um, the concept of a kneeling Stormtrooper and how dangerous they are versus the standing ones.

808
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:22,203
Um, uh, the- the fact that each- you've separated the species, like it's easy to tell which species and what kind of gun you're facing based on that.

809
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:22,863
Um.

810
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:26,266
Which I guess technically is anaphobic, but whatever, who cares, it's Star Wars.

811
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,549
They're just story tells.

812
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:32,191
Yeah.

813
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:34,032
I'm going to...

814
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:40,498
I guess I can ask this question from DarkShadowRage.

815
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:46,923
Did you guys spend any time playing fan maps, like one called Atlantica from JKA?

816
00:47:48,985 --> 00:47:50,846
And I'm going to follow up as a dev question on that.

817
00:47:50,886 --> 00:47:51,927
What was the difference...

818
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:52,828
Oh no, another one.

819
00:47:53,348 --> 00:48:00,070
What was the difference from interacting with your community then versus interacting with

820
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:00,870
your community now?

821
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,971
He said, as Chris, the wonderful community manager, sits in the room and has been very

822
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:05,592
helpful today.

823
00:48:06,612 --> 00:48:08,632
What's changed about interacting with your community in that way?

824
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,493
You want to start with the mod question?

825
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,134
Did you guys play that mod?

826
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:13,454
Yes.

827
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:17,315
I don't remember that map in particular, but I played a ton of mods.

828
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,196
Maps, multiplayer mods, multiplayer.

829
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:26,982
Mods, content, player models, all the extra dual maps, those are really cool.

830
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,665
Played on modded servers and stuff like that.

831
00:48:30,685 --> 00:48:41,115
I remember one was so cool, it wasn't really Jedi related because it was a total conversion to a Roman Colosseum.

832
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:47,781
And so there would be this cheering and you would come out and you'd have a short sword and rose petals were falling and everything.

833
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:50,384
and they had music from Gladiator or something.

834
00:48:50,424 --> 00:48:53,225
And you go out and fight, and he was using all of our...

835
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:54,526
Sabers.

836
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:55,066
Yeah, all of our...

837
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:55,466
Animation.

838
00:48:55,486 --> 00:48:57,327
But he was using, not lightsabers, it was swords.

839
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,408
And it was so well done.

840
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,109
I was like, this guy's amazing.

841
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:00,969
This guy should get hired.

842
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:03,951
And I think he ended up working at Respawn.

843
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,312
Yeah, and he ended up going to...

844
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:10,254
But anyway, I remember just being super impressed with a lot of the mods that were out there.

845
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:14,356
So as far as the second part, with how we interacted with people, like...

846
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,257
We came from, I don't know, probably all of you guys said Finger Files.

847
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:19,777
Plane Files?

848
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:20,397
Yeah.

849
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:24,818
We lived in a world where Plane Files ruled the earth where we could, every day we would,

850
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:26,378
I mean it was a totally different place.

851
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:31,039
I would come into work and I would write, hey today I'm working on this level with

852
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,760
this character and this gameplay and now everything is a tightly held secret.

853
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,921
I'd get fired if I, you know, we put screenshots out on our own.

854
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,422
What was the instant messaging thing we had back then?

855
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:47,460
We have AIM, we have ICQ.

856
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,581
I used to get ICQ messages from...

857
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:50,601
Oh, random ICQs all the time.

858
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,223
I'd get them from people working at magazines or interviewers,

859
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,224
and they're like, hey, can I ask you a quick question?

860
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,085
I'm like, sure, and I answer the question.

861
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:00,846
Nowadays, we're like, we actually have to make sure.

862
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:02,987
Legally, we're allowed to answer certain things,

863
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,627
and we don't want to give away things

864
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:05,988
because we don't want to screw up marketing.

865
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:08,789
But sometimes back then, it was like, oh, here's the info.

866
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,810
We're like, wait, should I told somebody?

867
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,801
Well, it's probably okay.

868
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,682
I went and looked and you can still find them on Blue's News.

869
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:16,583
Yeah.

870
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,824
The last time I checked it was on Blue's News.

871
00:50:19,204 --> 00:50:19,984
It was on Blue's News.

872
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:20,784
One of those two.

873
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:21,925
I'm pretty sure it was on Blue's News.

874
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,225
But it was cool.

875
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:29,108
It was cool and at the same time it was pretty weird where one time I have a brother who

876
00:50:29,148 --> 00:50:34,550
lives kind of near me and he was wearing a Jedi, I don't know if it was a Jedi, it was

877
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,331
a raven shirt and a UPS driver came up and...

878
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:42,538
And like had to have him sign for something. He said Beastman would you work at Raven software?

879
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:46,642
And that's when i'm like, all right, I am not going to be posted online anymore

880
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:48,284
They're outside the window

881
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:54,611
Yeah, I still have a uh mail posted on my door that we got like a few years ago

882
00:50:54,691 --> 00:50:57,414
I think from a group of people who still play

883
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,516
multiplayer and they were just thinking

884
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,804
us for how amazing it was and for making the game and I was like, oh man, it makes me feel really good.

885
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:06,825
So it's now pasted in my door in my office.

886
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,906
Yeah, I think the biggest thing with that is and

887
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:14,428
Mace kind of hits on it in the chat is I wish studios were more open with communication like that still.

888
00:51:14,968 --> 00:51:19,590
It's not that we don't want to be. Everybody's very very, even projects we have right now,

889
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:25,373
everybody's very very passionate about it. It's just it's a different culture now of the info sharing, you know, we're all

890
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:29,182
Once the game comes out, you can certainly talk to us.

891
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:33,023
There's certainly ways that we want to reach out with even newer titles and stuff like that,

892
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:35,904
with Twitch and Twitter and all that type of stuff.

893
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:38,244
It's not that we've lost interest.

894
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:42,225
It's about the reveal. Everything's bigger.

895
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:48,126
I remember when we released development screenshots, like you were saying,

896
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:51,527
like the lightsaber. We showed some pictures of the lightsabers and stuff.

897
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,508
I don't know if that was for E3 or whatever.

898
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:01,545
We released them and then I would go on to the forums and I'd see people were talking about the lightsaber effects and how it didn't look right.

899
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:04,926
And I remember reading that and I'm like, oh, they're right. They're totally right.

900
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:06,686
It's like it's got the wrong blend mode or whatever.

901
00:52:06,726 --> 00:52:11,948
And so, you know, they just changed the blend mode and it looked more, you know, movie-like.

902
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:15,849
And I'm like, oh, that's great. Like that's something we wouldn't have known if, you know.

903
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:18,950
We wouldn't have thought of that as quickly without the...

904
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,011
I'd say it's been, it was 90% positive.

905
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,832
Like, there's always those people online that are not.

906
00:52:25,653 --> 00:52:29,615
They just don't like anything. They dislike you for some reason, but I love...

907
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:33,256
I mean, I'm a gamer at heart. I'm a Star Wars fan at heart.

908
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:38,559
Like, I want to geek out with people and I want to share stories and, you know, talk about this stuff.

909
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,660
You must be playing on Jedi Knight difficulty.

910
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,741
I am. I am. And I regret it.

911
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:50,444
So, for this game, for difficulty, like I...

912
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:53,445
My personal philosophy on difficulty was that...

913
00:52:54,147 --> 00:52:57,809
I didn't like it when they just threw more enemies at you, or they did some of that,

914
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,830
or like they just have more health.

915
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,031
Like I didn't want the Jedi you fight to have more health.

916
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:09,555
So what I did for difficulty was, at higher difficulties, they had better tactics.

917
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:13,457
Like they would dodge, they would start rolling, they would start jumping, they'd force grip

918
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:17,959
you, or they'd push and they'd have better reflexes and that sort of thing, and reaction

919
00:53:17,979 --> 00:53:18,239
times.

920
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,031
Maybe that's why the snipers are killing you guys.

921
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:25,572
They are the best aiming snipers I've played.

922
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:29,294
I play a lot of Apex Legends and I swear, like, player snipers aren't this good.

923
00:53:30,214 --> 00:53:33,316
I mean, it's the computer, duh. It's allowed to be good.

924
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:37,218
They're sitting there all day, just waiting at that one spot.

925
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:40,539
And when snipers are going to come by, this is their job.

926
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,060
You do a few of them.

927
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:42,240
Yeah.

928
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,454
Folks, we only have a, we literally, on paper we were supposed to be wrapping up in the

929
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:49,134
next three minutes.

930
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:53,098
We got a little bit of a late start, so we can make sure we, if you have questions, get

931
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:54,860
them in chat now and I will ask them.

932
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,503
If you repeated, if you had a question earlier and I missed it, I apologize.

933
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:02,126
I'm like a one man band over here at the moment.

934
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,814
I'm going to ask my last question. I'm actually kind of impressed. You guys are such efficient

935
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:14,000
answerers that I've gotten to all of the topics I wanted to hit. My last question is, most

936
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,666
games in the era that this was released had to ship with a single player campaign and

937
00:54:18,706 --> 00:54:21,950
a multiplayer in order to be marketable. That's changed a lot.

938
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,212
There's a lot of talk about the death of single player experiences.

939
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,093
There's a lot of talk of multiplayer only games.

940
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,355
Y'all are in an interesting place where because you still work on Call of Duty,

941
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:35,277
you're working on a franchise that sometimes does both and sometimes does recently just did one.

942
00:54:35,998 --> 00:54:40,961
What do you think has changed about the era of single and multiplayer design versus the era we live in today?

943
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:46,043
Ooh, that's a good question.

944
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:48,545
I remember it wasn't that long ago that we still had to...

945
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,040
Like you couldn't ship them a single player game, right?

946
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,121
You'd have to have multiplayer.

947
00:54:53,822 --> 00:55:00,085
Yeah, for a long time in the development of our Wolfenstein title, we didn't work in that way with multiplayer.

948
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:00,425
Right.

949
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:07,049
I think the biggest, I mean, speaking as a gamer, the biggest thing difference is the progression systems.

950
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:12,372
You know, back in this time, I mean, I landed this game in college.

951
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,534
It was an arena you got into and you played.

952
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:16,355
Now it needs to...

953
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:20,443
multiplayer always needs that stickiness, at least the multiplayer we're working on

954
00:55:20,463 --> 00:55:25,705
need that stickiness of progression, unlocking things, feeling like you're invested within

955
00:55:25,745 --> 00:55:27,145
the game in some form.

956
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:34,006
Let's be fair, technology has allowed us to connect everywhere all the time, so that online

957
00:55:34,086 --> 00:55:38,707
presence, that community, that's something that all the games are interested in, bringing

958
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:39,367
people together.

959
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:40,467
That's grown a lot.

960
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:40,828
Yeah.

961
00:55:40,848 --> 00:55:45,088
I think too, we got kind of lucky in that the engines we were using, like the N engine,

962
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:47,554
It was a King of the Universe.

963
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:51,057
It was actually Quake 3, right?

964
00:55:51,597 --> 00:55:54,839
This is the predecessor. This is of all multiplayer games.

965
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:00,943
So Quake 3 was still in development while we were working on Elite Force, which is a game right before this one.

966
00:56:01,444 --> 00:56:05,727
And that didn't have any single player at all. We had to add the concept of single player to that.

967
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:12,752
It may have something to do with the routines and things like that you guys were playing around with for all the different AI.

968
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,676
But I mean, we were always going to do multiplayer.

969
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:17,156
Yeah.

970
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:19,697
We had a lot of fun working on multiplayer.

971
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:20,138
Yeah.

972
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:20,578
Oh, man.

973
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,759
That's where we got to kind of let things go.

974
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:25,440
And then everybody's like, oh, force push

975
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,741
is really powerful multiplayer.

976
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:27,601
And we're like, yep.

977
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,283
Let's make more places where you can push each other.

978
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:30,883
Yeah.

979
00:56:31,163 --> 00:56:31,823
More playable.

980
00:56:31,923 --> 00:56:34,925
All I'm hearing is extra life, LAN party.

981
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:39,047
I'm going to pause the game and get into these questions

982
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,288
in chat, because it's more important than me

983
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:41,048
getting to the level.

984
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:47,474
I'm getting somewhere. Hi, Ellie, you back again?

985
00:56:48,015 --> 00:56:52,458
Um, DarkShadowRave wants to say thank you again, Raven Software, for making such great games.

986
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:57,783
Uh, um, and they- and poke Asper to update the PC version for 16x9.

987
00:56:57,903 --> 00:57:01,325
Asper, if you're tuning into this, folks in chat have had some comments for you.

988
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:03,767
There are folks at Raven Software who cannot help with this port.

989
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:05,829
Um, uh...

990
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:10,067
Other questions before we leave today?

991
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:11,088
Um, uh...

992
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,529
Oh! Yeah, Chris Graft is back again. I'm gonna get this question in.

993
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:21,570
What were the key parts of the game's design that were points of contention

994
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,591
among the team during the game's development?

995
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:26,232
I don't know if I'd order that.

996
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:30,205
You said we were all fans, but we all had the same vision.

997
00:57:30,245 --> 00:57:34,668
The only thing I think that people were, you're going to laugh at this, that had issues with

998
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:39,171
were some of the jumps, because some of our guys were insanely good at making jumps.

999
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:39,812
Oh yeah.

1000
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:41,013
And people were like, tone it down.

1001
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:42,374
They're like, that doesn't make it fun.

1002
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:43,194
Poor the snipers.

1003
00:57:43,554 --> 00:57:44,175
This level is...

1004
00:57:45,616 --> 00:57:53,221
Especially, but later on in Academy as well, we had one jump in the rift where nobody could

1005
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:53,522
make it.

1006
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:55,203
And our designer said, what?

1007
00:57:55,835 --> 00:57:59,778
I can do it just fine. He does it at his desk for like, nobody else could do it. He tried

1008
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:02,801
it at somebody else's desk and he couldn't do it and it had to do with a combination

1009
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:07,084
of I think his keyboard and mouse settings or his keyboard and mouse.

1010
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:11,908
It was because most of the other computers we had, if you held the control key along

1011
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:15,751
with one of the others, it didn't register the interrupt and you couldn't hit both keys

1012
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:18,874
simultaneously except on his. He had a HP or something.

1013
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:20,975
He was allowed to make these crazy strafe jumps.

1014
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:26,098
But yeah, the only other thing that I think ever came up was people having a grumpy time

1015
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:29,721
with some of the AT-ST combat back and forth.

1016
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:32,384
There's like, come on, you're in the AT-ST, you're doing worse stuff.

1017
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,445
Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:39,390
Yeah, but honestly I think we had more disagreements with LucasArts than ourselves.

1019
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:40,851
And none of those were...

1020
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:43,254
LucasArts was great to work with.

1021
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:44,955
Very talented guys.

1022
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:47,377
Michael Stemmle wrote the dialogue.

1023
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:52,014
Dan Pennett and Brent Toskey, like all the people that were there were...

1024
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:57,416
And they had a composer that would take the John Williams pieces and put them together for us the way that we needed.

1025
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:01,777
Like he would mix and match them and we wrote a dynamic music system that would...

1026
00:59:02,378 --> 00:59:02,858
That's right.

1027
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:07,299
Go between, yeah, go between like kind of the mellow exploration music and action music.

1028
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,940
Trying to blend in and match tempo with the...

1029
00:59:10,578 --> 00:59:11,739
the two different genres.

1030
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:13,940
We had a whole dynamic music action.

1031
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,902
Look at that, you're going down memory lane here.

1032
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:21,544
Most of the disagreements we had that I can remember were just me trying to get other

1033
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:23,946
Star Wars movie references into the game.

1034
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:27,328
I remember there wasn't a lot of time for these games.

1035
00:59:28,308 --> 00:59:29,229
We didn't have enough time for you.

1036
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:30,290
Yeah, that's true.

1037
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,011
We didn't have time to disagree.

1038
00:59:33,251 --> 00:59:36,633
But I think the thing is that Star Wars is such a clear vision.

1039
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:37,414
Star Wars is such a...

1040
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,614
a visionary concept to begin with. We all knew what we were making.

1041
00:59:41,315 --> 00:59:45,637
Right? We all have the same vision. That's the hardest part of making any game is

1042
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:50,520
make sure everyone's got the same vision for the end. And if you don't, then you uh...

1043
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:56,144
Poor speed!

1044
00:59:56,184 --> 00:59:58,846
Every time I remember how a puzzle works in this game that I solved in childhood,

1045
00:59:59,306 --> 01:00:02,228
as I solved as a teenager, I'm just like, I knew this. I knew how to do this.

1046
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:08,332
Anyway, I'm going to ask one last question for you guys from my end.

1047
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,418
Work-life balance is a huge topic among game developers.

1048
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:13,620
Was I supposed to go over here?

1049
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,261
I really hope I was.

1050
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:14,722
Um...

1051
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:14,782
Um...

1052
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:14,922
Um...

1053
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:15,263
Um...

1054
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:15,323
Um...

1055
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:15,443
Um...

1056
01:00:15,523 --> 01:00:15,604
Um...

1057
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:15,784
Um...

1058
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:15,924
Um...

1059
01:00:15,944 --> 01:00:16,064
Um...

1060
01:00:16,084 --> 01:00:16,225
Um...

1061
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:16,365
Um...

1062
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:16,545
Um...

1063
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:17,507
Um...

1064
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:17,907
Um...

1065
01:00:18,008 --> 01:00:18,048
Um...

1066
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:18,188
Um...

1067
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:18,248
Um...

1068
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,190
It's a huge topic among game developers these days.

1069
01:00:22,171 --> 01:00:25,132
It has been a long time since this game was in production.

1070
01:00:26,713 --> 01:00:30,676
When working on this game, did you have to pull crazy hours in order to make it work?

1071
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:32,837
And do you think, was it necessary?

1072
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:34,938
Do you think your team's improved by then?

1073
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:38,721
Did you learn anything from working that hard that you now are able to work more efficiently?

1074
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:43,183
What are your thoughts on how hard you worked on this game then versus how hard you work on games now?

1075
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,655
For me, this was a passion product.

1076
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:51,178
So there was a lot of self-defined extra time.

1077
01:00:51,198 --> 01:00:54,720
It made it a lot easier.

1078
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,843
My wife, I guess I'm trying to remember if I was married then, yes.

1079
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:02,765
My wife at the time, she was, or she still is my wife,

1080
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:05,987
was very caring and very understanding about it.

1081
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:10,730
But yeah, definitely there are times when it is not.

1082
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:13,312
This was a product where I actually

1083
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:14,610
Did not mind it.

1084
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:20,391
Well I had a futon in my office that I used to kind of live on when we were doing Star

1085
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:24,932
Trek and when we got into Star Wars I got myself a new pillow because I knew I was going

1086
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:27,893
to be spending so much time because it was so much fun to work on everything.

1087
01:01:27,913 --> 01:01:32,314
And I'm just going to say this out here, Kelly if you're listening, thanks for putting up

1088
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:38,135
with all that, because I spent so much time at work and it was a labor of love.

1089
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,076
I'm like, this level isn't quite where we wanted it to be.

1090
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:43,677
I'm going to spend the evening just trying to rework it.

1091
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:45,690
And then we'd rework it, and then we'd say,

1092
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:46,590
what do you think?

1093
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,891
And then somebody would give us feedback,

1094
01:01:47,931 --> 01:01:49,871
and then we'd spend the next night at work again,

1095
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:52,092
and then stumble off the couch in the morning

1096
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:55,194
and hope that we actually were coherent the rest of the day.

1097
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:57,274
Did that a lot.

1098
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,195
I'd say the same thing.

1099
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,856
It was a passion project for me.

1100
01:02:01,036 --> 01:02:03,137
I think you can jump down to that room.

1101
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:04,897
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out, I

1102
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:06,378
think I need to jump down to a room,

1103
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:07,258
but I don't know which room it is.

1104
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:07,979
And I have three heads.

1105
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:10,020
That console thing you were trying to get into before

1106
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,780
that has all the glass.

1107
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,461
That's really, really far below you.

1108
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,320
Good luck.

1109
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:18,784
Save, save, save.

1110
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:20,066
I think I did work a lot.

1111
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:20,947
I honestly don't remember.

1112
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:23,429
I do remember I would take the game home with me on weekends.

1113
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:25,331
And come back with a stack of notes.

1114
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:26,692
Yeah, I would play it over the weekend.

1115
01:02:26,832 --> 01:02:28,074
I'd take a bunch of notes, and then I'd

1116
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:30,636
come into work on Monday and do it all.

1117
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:35,020
So I think, like everyone said, it's a passion project.

1118
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:37,823
And yeah, I think we've all gotten probably more efficient.

1119
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:41,588
As we've gotten older, we work smarter, not harder.

1120
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,509
We've also gotten a lot more time.

1121
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:46,070
I mean, this game, we did it really fast.

1122
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,992
The thing I remember, because it was sort of the end, was spending crazy long hours

1123
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,433
just doing the final burn.

1124
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:56,295
We had to burn it to CD, drive it out to FedEx to get it on the last plane out of here to

1125
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:58,857
get it over to California for review.

1126
01:03:00,097 --> 01:03:03,539
Those are some crazy long nights that we don't have to do that anymore because now we have

1127
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:04,759
blazing fast internet.

1128
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:06,300
So that's a giant time saver.

1129
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:13,375
JustOneMoreGamer has actually a really good question that I really should get to before we go.

1130
01:03:13,395 --> 01:03:19,159
What was the thinking behind creating a completely unique demo for the game? How much extra time did that add to development?

1131
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:20,820
None.

1132
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:21,741
None really.

1133
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,482
Because that was a lot of prototype work.

1134
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:28,065
Yeah, that was a lot of work that we took to LucasArts to prove that we could do it.

1135
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:29,707
It was the pilot, yeah.

1136
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:32,789
It was also our E3 demo.

1137
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:33,489
Yep.

1138
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,771
That's where we were playing around with, like, hey,

1139
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:38,339
You can use the lightsaber to break something.

1140
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:42,762
There was some extra work that we had to pause it up and get it ready for public consumption.

1141
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:45,263
We had to go back to it and put the proper file on it.

1142
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,645
We said we wanted to do it and they went, okay, sure.

1143
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:48,685
Yeah.

1144
01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:51,547
But yeah, that was something we wanted to make sure would happen.

1145
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:54,409
That also has nothing to do with the actual story.

1146
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:54,749
Right.

1147
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:55,990
It's a fixed scenario.

1148
01:03:56,652 --> 01:03:58,314
not having the reflective floors.

1149
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,595
Because we used to have the...

1150
01:03:59,695 --> 01:04:02,238
At the beginning we tested out the reflective floors so you could see

1151
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:04,079
the stormtroopers walking.

1152
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,482
And it was all reflective with the shots too.

1153
01:04:06,502 --> 01:04:09,384
But I think in the demo it just turned out just being reflecting shots.

1154
01:04:10,345 --> 01:04:11,286
Like all the surfaces.

1155
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:13,588
I can't remember how it finally shipped, but I know that

1156
01:04:14,009 --> 01:04:15,330
when we first did it, it was reflective.

1157
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,512
Because we built that one hanger just to show it off

1158
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:18,973
and show the guys moving information.

1159
01:04:19,114 --> 01:04:19,794
The glossy floor.

1160
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:26,281
Alright, I would love to. I guess there's a secret place back on this 45 degree ledge.

1161
01:04:26,641 --> 01:04:28,803
Uh, I guess I'll try getting to it, but then I'll probably die.

1162
01:04:29,584 --> 01:04:30,384
Nope, didn't die.

1163
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:33,787
Um, uh, wow.

1164
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,848
Whoa, he made it.

1165
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:35,669
You gotta get-

1166
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:37,270
I did not know about that.

1167
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,652
Uh, this is Stu's level.

1168
01:04:39,672 --> 01:04:40,052
It's his-

1169
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:41,573
Oh, yeah, it's their life secrets.

1170
01:04:41,713 --> 01:04:41,853
Yeah.

1171
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:50,814
Oh man, oh my god, Endar, you just made this, when I get back to playing this game, you just made this so much easier for me with those extra shields.

1172
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:51,895
Thank you.

1173
01:04:53,115 --> 01:04:55,797
With that, I'm going to bring our stream to a close.

1174
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:59,279
Thank you so much to the folks from Raven Software for joining us.

1175
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:01,980
Thank you for everyone for watching. Thank you for your good questions.

1176
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,102
As a former member of the Jedi Academy community, thank you all for showing up.

1177
01:05:07,423 --> 01:05:10,788
Here on the GDC Twitch channel, we talk to developers about how games get made.

1178
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:12,591
We are mostly talking about newer games.

1179
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:15,835
Occasionally, we have the opportunity to go back and revisit a classic game,

1180
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,618
and I'm so thankful we got to do that today.

1181
01:05:17,638 --> 01:05:21,864
It seems weird that 2002 is now an era of classic games, but...

1182
01:05:22,425 --> 01:05:29,108
It is. I'm thankful for to Asper Media for porting this game to new consoles so that new folks have a chance to check it out.

1183
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:34,151
If you enjoyed the stream, please click the follow button down below.

1184
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:38,213
We have some other great streams with some other great devs throughout next month and throughout the end of the year.

1185
01:05:39,654 --> 01:05:41,556
If you're a developer yourself or a developer adjacent,

1186
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,378
we invite you to come out and join us at GDC.

1187
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,761
If you are an active developer talking right now,

1188
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:49,204
we are still taking submissions for the GDC summits.

1189
01:05:49,925 --> 01:05:52,767
Those close September 30th, so we would invite you to supply.

1190
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,289
Go to our website to check all that out.

1191
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,633
Yeah, hey, pitch to the people in the room.

1192
01:05:58,653 --> 01:06:00,355
If you have a good talk for the summits, submit it.

1193
01:06:01,236 --> 01:06:01,797
We'd love to hear it.

1194
01:06:03,218 --> 01:06:13,181
From there, for folks in the room at Raven, if people have more questions about Jedi Knight, where can they ask them?

1195
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:23,585
They can ask them at our Twitter, at Raven Software. They can ask them at my personal Twitter, raven underscore lin, L-I-N-N, and I can get them to the right people.

1196
01:06:24,445 --> 01:06:30,627
Right on. With that, I wish everyone have a good day, and of course, may the Force be with you. Bye, everyone.

1197
01:06:31,307 --> 01:06:31,967
Thanks a lot.

1198
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:32,248
Thanks.

1199
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:36,569
What? Is that the wrong one?
