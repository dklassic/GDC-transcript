1
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:05,842
With that out of the way though, I think we'll get started.

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,444
So my name is Rainer Bloch-Andersen.

3
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:12,705
I work at CCP Games right now, primarily on EVE Online.

4
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,407
I've been with CCP for about two and a half years now,

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:15,947
since June of 2012.

6
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:20,809
And I'm currently titled as a technical designer, as that

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,991
title tends to change from studio to studio.

8
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:26,672
For us, it means I do a bit of game design and a bit of

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,814
programming, whatever is sort of needed to get the job done

10
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:31,095
within the team I'm on.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,202
Just briefly, I'm going to go over what EVE Online is, for

12
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,343
those of you that may not be aware.

13
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:42,307
So EVE Online is a sci-fi, MMO sandbox.

14
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,569
The sandbox is a really key thing for us.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,652
And by that, I mean we stay very hands-off of our game.

16
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,413
We provide our players with tools.

17
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,096
What they do with those tools is entirely up to them.

18
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,079
If you scam someone and you're using the tools provided in

19
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,261
game, we will not intervene in that.

20
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,623
So you can be scammed and that kind of stuff.

21
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,953
Building on that, though, we are also a single sharded game.

22
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:09,675
We have one cluster in London, which is where all of our

23
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:10,695
players connect and play.

24
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:13,776
And this tends to amplify the sandbox nature of our game.

25
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:17,198
If you pull off a great heist, everyone in our game tends to

26
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:17,818
hear about it.

27
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:19,999
And it's this big thing because it happened on one

28
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,199
server in one universe.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,521
We're also coming up on our 12-year birthday.

30
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:26,462
We came out in 2003.

31
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,099
And relevant to this presentation,

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,741
we have generally an above-average

33
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:34,422
technical user base.

34
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:37,724
Our users tend to be more technically inclined than most.

35
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,207
And then, as this will come into play a little bit later,

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,889
these are some numbers, averages from 2014

37
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,692
on the EVE sort of player base.

38
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:51,253
The key thing here that I'll come back to

39
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,234
is the 420,000 unique users logged in per month.

40
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:03,806
Before we really dive into what I or we at CCP believe are the benefits and challenges of supporting third-party devs,

41
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:08,490
I want to make sure we're all on the same page as to what we define third-party devs to be anyways.

42
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:14,275
So to us, a third-party developer is someone outside of CCP who creates external content for our game,

43
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,958
generally in the form of a desktop, web, or mobile application.

44
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,560
It could also be spreadsheets or whatever.

45
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,083
These developers are not paid by CCP in any way.

46
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,734
and they don't receive any extra information that anyone else can't get.

47
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,816
All of the resources we provide our third-party developers,

48
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:35,998
whether it be our APIs or downloadable resources,

49
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,621
are available to anyone, whether they classify themselves as a third-party dev or not.

50
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:45,641
But what do we offer these third party devs in terms of

51
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,082
resources to do cool things?

52
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:51,305
We offer them first our image export collection, which is we

53
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,186
gather up all the static images for a game.

54
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,348
This is things like icons, renders that are not going to

55
00:02:57,388 --> 00:03:00,711
change, that are static renders between releases, UI

56
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,652
elements as well, all get packaged up and released.

57
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,442
We also offer our static data export.

58
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:09,624
So this is a collection of static information for our

59
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:12,765
games, such as item attributes, item names, the

60
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,966
way the market's laid out, the universe data, all of that

61
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:19,387
stuff that will not change between releases, packaged up

62
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,728
and released to our third party devs.

63
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:25,250
We give them access to our OAuth2 login, so they can add

64
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,671
a Login with Eve button to their application,

65
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:28,411
web page, whatever.

66
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,125
We also give them access to our image server.

67
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,925
This is something we use ourselves as well.

68
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:36,067
And this is generally basically a CDN.

69
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:38,788
It hosts a lot of the same images that are in the image

70
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,969
export, but also dynamically generated images.

71
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:44,990
So character portraits, that kind of stuff, corporation

72
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,870
logos, whatever.

73
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,786
We then give them access to two web APIs.

74
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,148
The first is our XML API.

75
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,250
It's our older API.

76
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,373
It's been out, I think, since about 2004, 2005.

77
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,156
And our Crest API.

78
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,379
Crest stands for Carbon RESTful API.

79
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,123
Both these are HTTP APIs.

80
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,307
The Crest one is a JSON RESTful API.

81
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,330
The XML API, as I said, it's our older one.

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,052
It gets about 1,100 requests a second these days.

83
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,215
And Crest is approaching 500 or 600 requests a second, just

84
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,876
to give you an idea of where our APIs sit.

85
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,518
The key difference between these two, aside from their

86
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,921
age, the XML API sits outside of our game cluster.

87
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,502
It has no access to the logic of the game or

88
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:27,483
the runtime state.

89
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,965
It only knows what's persisted to disk in the DB.

90
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,627
So it just has read access to the DB.

91
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,909
Crest, it runs on the cluster.

92
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,010
It's part of the game.

93
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,613
It was built for our second game, Dust 514, so that it can

94
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,855
read and write to our cluster.

95
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:44,756
And we're working on opening that up to our third party

96
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,938
devs now, so they can both read and write to our game.

97
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:58,269
And then briefly, what we feel internally are our guidelines to help us in developing resources for our third party devs.

98
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,252
First and foremost, our client is off limits.

99
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:06,598
There's no UI mods, no mods of any kind, anything like that will get you banned permanently from our game.

100
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,040
We do this because we firmly believe, as our game is a competitive game,

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,102
when you get into a fight, it is up to your skill using our client.

102
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:18,063
We don't want you to have to go and download something just to be competitive,

103
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,764
which is kind of our second point.

104
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:23,626
You should not have to download any application to be competitive at EVE.

105
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:27,347
You can have an application that helps you find a fight, that kind of thing,

106
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,828
but once you're in a fight, it's your skill at our game

107
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,709
that's going to sort of determine who wins.

108
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,151
So those two kind of play off each other, and the third one

109
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:38,072
just builds on that, which is no information should be

110
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,993
available to our third party devs that you cannot get in

111
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:41,593
the client.

112
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,134
This is, again, just to help support the

113
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:45,274
first two points there.

114
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,356
So the first benefit I really want to talk to you guys about

115
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,817
is how third party developers can help you deal with the

116
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,018
scope of features in your game.

117
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,722
For us, we generally start when we're designing a new feature,

118
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:00,003
very blue sky, right?

119
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:02,604
We design the feature to cover as many use cases as possible.

120
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,785
We're brainstorming the biggest, greatest feature ever.

121
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,966
We scope this down and prioritize it and start work

122
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:08,586
on it, right?

123
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:11,907
During development, sometimes things get cut.

124
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,608
This is either because we've run out of time,

125
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:15,328
the thing was too difficult to do,

126
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,849
whatever problem came up, or we just

127
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,810
felt this thing we were going to do, part of this feature,

128
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,391
wasn't going to fit our game, wasn't going to fit our client.

129
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:25,351
So we cut it.

130
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,562
For the most part, this is generally where things then

131
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:29,143
get shipped.

132
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,705
For us, what we try and do, however, is during that

133
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:36,548
development, expose it in one of our APIs, whether it's XML,

134
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:39,531
API, or Crest, or add it to the static data export.

135
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,773
And we have a very easy framework for

136
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,674
doing that these days.

137
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:47,156
So if a team would like to add something to the API, it

138
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,718
doesn't take much effort, doesn't take much more than

139
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:52,080
they've already put in to develop the feature to get it

140
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,221
added and exposed to our third-party developers.

141
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,905
But I mean, OK, so that's what we do.

142
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,266
But why expose the data?

143
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,409
And how does it help us deal with the scope of a feature?

144
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,552
The best way to go about this, I think, is with an example.

145
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,696
This is a screenshot of the wallet in our game.

146
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:10,599
Shows you all of the money coming into your character

147
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,261
and the money that your character is spending.

148
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,655
It works pretty well for small groups, right?

149
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:18,218
You can paginate forward and backwards.

150
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,780
You can put in a specific date and load the transactions from

151
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,201
that date.

152
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,044
You can filter by transaction type if you only want

153
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:26,947
transactions for market stuff or player trades.

154
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:33,548
And then you get a very quick rundown, sort of summary of the money coming in and out and your total balance.

155
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,952
So again, this works wonderful for small groups or an individual, right?

156
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,294
Small groups, 10, 20, even maybe 100.

157
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:45,879
But we tend to have groups in our game, as we're a single sharded game, that go up to 3,000, 10,000.

158
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,342
There's a coalition of 40,000 players in our game.

159
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:53,105
This wallet tends to fall apart at that scale.

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,543
So very early on, before we even really realized how

161
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,444
important third-party developers were to us, one of

162
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:02,387
the things we added to the XML API was the wallet.

163
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,649
And this is exactly the same information you see in this

164
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,430
screenshot here.

165
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:11,756
It's who the transaction was between, the transaction type,

166
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,739
the time, how much it was for, all that kind of stuff.

167
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,343
Just grabbed from our database, formatted for XML,

168
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:18,923
and dumped out.

169
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,414
What I'm about to show you is a public financial release from

170
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:26,355
one of our organizations.

171
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,396
They're a 3,000-member organization known as

172
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,177
Pandemic Legion.

173
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,519
And it covers 18 months of their alliance.

174
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,783
So very simply, it shows the income and expenditure of

175
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,725
their alliance over time.

176
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,008
Same sort of thing, just broken down by subgroup or

177
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,731
corporation in the alliance, how much they were spending.

178
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,237
by corporation over time, pretty straightforward, right?

179
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:55,143
Then they start breaking it down by category, or I'm not sure how they define these, but they're a type of category, I guess.

180
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:02,549
This is the fuel usage over 18 months by the corporations in this alliance,

181
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,373
and sort of who was spending the most fuel, and then broken down by fuel type.

182
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,277
So that was all really cool, right?

183
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:10,917
Really nice and pretty graphs.

184
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:14,358
It makes for great content, nice news articles written

185
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:17,119
about this, financial report, and that kind of stuff.

186
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:22,220
But if it's so cool, why do we not offer that in the client?

187
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:26,381
Well, to be honest, we could add all those features in the

188
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,202
client, and they'd be used by no one.

189
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,703
And the reason I say that is Pandemic Legion or any other

190
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:33,983
organization of that scale.

191
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,095
they really only have one guy dealing with their finances, right?

192
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,940
And that one guy probably wants Excel.

193
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:45,429
But also, and this is sort of more important,

194
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,654
Not sure if you can read it, but there's a section there called Espionage or Special Projects.

195
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,755
Then there's another one called FanFest.

196
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:58,358
FanFest is our player gathering in Iceland that happens once a year.

197
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,720
I have no idea how they're spending in-game money on that. I don't know.

198
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,964
Special Projects or Espionage. Again, I have absolutely no idea what they define as that.

199
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:12,588
Our game is a sandbox, we give them tools, what they do with those tools is up to them.

200
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,469
So a lot of this is emergent gameplay.

201
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,593
They're infiltrating a corporation and I guess probably spending some money to pay for that

202
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:25,118
alt or whatever, but we have no way of tracking that in the game, right?

203
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,382
So we could spend a lot of time developing this feature, trying to build a replica of

204
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,183
Excel in our client.

205
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:36,143
But then we're probably going to miss a lot of these special edge cases

206
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:39,230
that our players want, because we don't know what they are.

207
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,813
This is a sandbox.

208
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:41,875
It's emergent gameplay.

209
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:54,919
And just serve as a few other examples of areas that our third-party developers have created tools or resources to help in areas that we didn't even know existed or needed features.

210
00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:06,063
Character trading. We offer an authorized way of transferring a character between two accounts and players will bid ISK or our in-game currency to buy these other characters.

211
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:12,505
And they can take the word of someone that says, well, I'm selling this character and he has these stats and this much money.

212
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:15,446
But then you're relying on that character, or that person,

213
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,167
to be telling you the truth about that character.

214
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:20,629
Via our API, there's a person that's set up a,

215
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,630
he's a trusted person, a trusted player,

216
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,151
and he's set up a website that'll pull all this information

217
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,612
from the API and tell you it's API verified

218
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,793
and what this guy is telling you is true, right?

219
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,955
So that helps with character trading,

220
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,175
which is, I don't think,

221
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,076
anything we originally thought would exist.

222
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,583
Planetary income monitoring.

223
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:38,924
You can own planets in our game.

224
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,985
And when players use those planets as the owner,

225
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:42,026
you get a cut of that.

226
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:43,367
You get to tax it, right?

227
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:45,649
And that will show up in your wallet.

228
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,230
And again, it works great for small groups.

229
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,432
If you own a planet, half a dozen or a dozen planets,

230
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:51,252
it works fine.

231
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:54,214
But when you own 500 planets, and you

232
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:57,296
want to know which planets are generating the most income

233
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:00,318
for you, and you own 500 planets, and 30 of them

234
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,840
come under attack, which one do you defend?

235
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,521
You need to be able to track all this information.

236
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,462
You want to track things like.

237
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:09,026
which corporations are paying you the most, maybe you make them a deal,

238
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:12,050
or trying to attract more people into using your planets, right?

239
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,096
All this sort of stuff, which applies to like three or four organizations in our game.

240
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,720
So we could again spend a bunch of time developing these features in our client,

241
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:24,465
but the number of people they apply to is pretty limited.

242
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,748
Starbase fuel management, same kind of thing as the planetary income monitoring.

243
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,671
We show you in our calendar in the client when the starbase you own is going to run

244
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,973
out of fuel and we send you a mail in the game when it's running low.

245
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:43,978
But if you own 3,000 or 2,000 starbases, trying to track that, trying to track where the fuel

246
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:48,401
for specific ones are and who has access to all of this stuff is very tricky.

247
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:52,744
And again, only a couple of organizations in our game need that.

248
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:56,138
But then not just talking about these larger organizations,

249
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,219
asset management, more specifically,

250
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,722
cross-account asset management or cross-account anything.

251
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:06,181
We focus our client on, when you're logged in, the character you're logged in as.

252
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,623
I don't think that's going to change anytime soon, but a lot of our players have multiple

253
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,024
accounts or multiple characters.

254
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:13,865
They have assets split across all of them.

255
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,886
They want to know how much total wealth they have.

256
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:19,649
They want to know where, I know I have this ship, but I can't remember what character

257
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,549
had it or where it is.

258
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:25,072
Load up a third party tool, do a search for that ship, and it'll tell you where it is.

259
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,694
But we're not really going to offer that because we are focused on the character you're logged

260
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,055
in as at that time.

261
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,150
This list goes on, though.

262
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,093
Shopping lists, timer boards, hundreds of other things.

263
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:38,295
Sorry.

264
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,940
So again, these are all things we could add in.

265
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:50,002
But it's a question of really, sort of, I'm not sure if any

266
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,262
of you guys have seen this chart or something like it

267
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,203
before, you generally get to pick two things, right?

268
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,624
It's going to take a lot of time, or you'll have a lot of

269
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,205
time, and you'll get a great thing, but it's going to cost

270
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,325
you a lot of money, right?

271
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,746
Or you get a great quality thing, and it's not going to

272
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,787
cost much money, but it's going to take a lot of time.

273
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,988
So by exposing this data to third party developers,

274
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:15,502
They're creating things first and foremost that we didn't even know existed.

275
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:22,046
Or things that we didn't have time to do, or that we didn't think fit our client.

276
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:27,670
We're pretty proud of the client we have and we're building it in a certain direction.

277
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,372
But sometimes players want it to go in a bit of a different direction.

278
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,554
We can't make this work for everybody.

279
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:35,615
So third-party tools can help with that a lot.

280
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:42,159
So my first recommendation to you, or the first benefit that we see in third-party developers,

281
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,362
is letting them help us build a better game.

282
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:47,703
They're very passionate about our game, right?

283
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:51,166
These people put hundreds or thousands of hours into our game.

284
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,467
A lot of them are very technically inclined.

285
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:56,089
Some of them work for Google or Microsoft or whatever, right?

286
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:59,431
They come home and they want to do a side project or something.

287
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:02,573
Give them the chance to do it for your game and they'll do amazing stuff.

288
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:10,745
The next thing is, quite literally, sometimes they'll do things better

289
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,747
than we do or than you can do.

290
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:19,475
So this is a kill mail in our game.

291
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:21,877
When two people meet in our game and they kill each other,

292
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:24,999
the person who died and the person who laid the final blow

293
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:29,262
will get, or used to get when Eve launched, a mail in the client.

294
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,244
It was literally a text mail that we sent you that contained

295
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,325
this sort of information.

296
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:37,608
It would tell you who killed who, who died, and where you died,

297
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:40,289
and how the ship you were flying at the time you died was fit,

298
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,251
and the weapon that was used to kill you, and that kind of stuff.

299
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:45,572
It'll list everyone that was involved, but it will only be

300
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:48,834
sent to the person who laid the final blow and the person

301
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:49,314
who died.

302
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:53,496
At CCP, we viewed these as a form of an after action report.

303
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,377
So after you died or after you killed someone, you can see

304
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,318
what they lost or what they died if you killed them.

305
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:02,579
Or if you died, who killed you and what ship they were using

306
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,680
so you could look back at it and maybe learn from it.

307
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:10,082
So yeah, we called it Kill Mails because it was text and

308
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:11,603
it was sent as a mail and it was about a kill.

309
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,890
Three or four years after the introduction of Killmills to

310
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,952
our game, we went and updated it a little bit.

311
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,655
We made it so it was no longer a mail sent to you, but you

312
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,497
could go to your character sheet, and you could look at

313
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,378
all of your kills or all of your losses.

314
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,081
It was still, though, when you clicked it and you viewed the

315
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,403
Killmill, just a bunch of text.

316
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:30,865
Not really that pretty, right?

317
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:34,048
Around the same time we did this renovation, though, we

318
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,490
added this same information to our XML API.

319
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,540
And this is when it really took off for our third-party developers,

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,442
and they really started doing some cool stuff with it.

321
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:45,325
And the key thing with what our third-party developers did

322
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,929
is they viewed Killmails as something very different than we did.

323
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,351
Whereas we viewed them as an after-action report,

324
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,974
they viewed them as something entirely different.

325
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,335
And I'm going to get into that in a second.

326
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,798
But first, the first big change they made

327
00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:59,780
was they made them look a lot prettier than we did.

328
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:00,889
Right?

329
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:04,612
They made it really nice and graphical, big image of the ship that died.

330
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,433
You can see the ships that killed you.

331
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:08,615
The portrait of your character was in there.

332
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:09,636
Looks really good.

333
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:13,119
And this website hasn't changed a lot since it was first

334
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,460
released many, many years ago.

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,662
Because it looks pretty good as it is.

336
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:22,164
But as I said, the bigger change here was that these third-party developers

337
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:24,284
viewed the killmails as something different.

338
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,485
We viewed them as an after-action report.

339
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,787
They viewed them more as an Intel tool, right?

340
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,168
Now that they were storing them all on a database on their server,

341
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,849
they could let you click on a character and view all of that character's kills

342
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,350
and losses, where those kills and losses happened,

343
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,492
so you could start tracking where a character was in our game based

344
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:43,512
on their kills and losses.

345
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:48,355
You can look at a specific system and see all the kills or losses in that system, right?

346
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:53,499
The front page of the website showed you the biggest losses in the last seven days.

347
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,520
And there's a leaderboard.

348
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,403
You got points for killing people and you lost points for dying.

349
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,947
All these kind of things built off of this idea that killmills were something more

350
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,188
than just an after-action report, right?

351
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:09,372
On top of that, one of the cooler, or to me, one of the coolest things

352
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:11,473
is they started building in these timelines.

353
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,925
You can get fights in our game that involve three or four

354
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,607
parties, different parties, right?

355
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:19,630
They'll let you group the people into parties and then

356
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,631
view a timeline.

357
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,633
So even if you're not in the game, you're at work or

358
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:25,256
something, there's a big fight going on in our game, you can

359
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,878
load a page like this up and just start hitting refresh and

360
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,261
watch as like, oh no, my team's losing, losing.

361
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,502
Oh no, sad.

362
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,786
But you could participate in the game without actually

363
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:35,626
being in the client.

364
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:42,523
Over time, these kill boards grew to be a very central part of our game's

365
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:43,183
experience.

366
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:48,505
If you participate in PVP, there's a very, very good chance you care about

367
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,326
kill boards, or you're viewing them, at least.

368
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:53,687
Maybe you don't care about your kill board stats, but you're using them as an

369
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,769
Intel tool to find fights and that kind of stuff.

370
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:03,731
To give you a bit of an idea as to how central of an experience these kill

371
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:04,972
boards are to our players.

372
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,662
There's two main killboards out there right now.

373
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:11,724
The first, actually I guess it's the second, the newer one,

374
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:12,944
is known as Zed Killboard.

375
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,926
These stats are all taken from a one month period in 2014.

376
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:18,227
And as I said earlier, on average,

377
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,308
we had 420,000 unique people logged into our game

378
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:20,808
per month in 2014.

379
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,331
So these stats are again taken from one month in 2014.

380
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,332
Zed Killboard would get about 658,000 visits a month, which

381
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:35,232
translated to 3.1 million page views, and about 200,000

382
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:36,753
unique viewers.

383
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,073
That's not bad on its own right there.

384
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:42,054
But then we look at Eve Kill, which is the older Killboard.

385
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,554
It's been around a bit longer, right?

386
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:46,115
In that same month, they got 1.6 million visits, at 8.6

387
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,836
million page views, and 401,000 unique viewers.

388
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:56,202
Of course some of these are the same people from work or home or their laptop or whatever, right?

389
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,567
But that is a substantial portion of our player base.

390
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:03,292
When we have 420,000 unique users logging in every month,

391
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:06,737
and about 401,000 unique visitors on this website,

392
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,920
it's a pretty good indication.

393
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:10,795
of how important these are.

394
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:18,641
But beyond just Intel or bragging rights or whatever,

395
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,942
these killboards turned into something else.

396
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,705
I don't think we really realized it at the time.

397
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:26,567
So the important thing to keep in mind is, as I said,

398
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,367
we're single shards.

399
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,390
This game takes place at all times of the day

400
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,471
while we're asleep or awake.

401
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,573
And sometimes these big fights will happen

402
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,934
while we are asleep in Iceland.

403
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,919
So we'll wake up and there'll be articles on Kotaku or Joystick or Massively,

404
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,061
sometimes the BBC or Times about these massive fights that have happened in our game.

405
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:47,522
And we're waking up and being like,

406
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,443
well that's cool, they have all these numbers and whatnot,

407
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,383
and these numbers are incredibly accurate.

408
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,044
They're taking these numbers from killboards,

409
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:57,565
about how big these fights were and how much was lost in these fights,

410
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,126
and there's news articles being written about it,

411
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:02,047
there's Wikipedia articles being written about it.

412
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,387
We wake up and all we do is say,

413
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,648
yep, those numbers are accurate.

414
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:10,812
right? So these kill boards have turned into a bit of a marketing thing for us,

415
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:15,554
not like us directly using them, but they can give us a bit of a marketing

416
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:19,995
benefit. The other huge advantage and really cool thing about third party

417
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:23,696
data is making a kill board was that when we decided we wanted to go back and

418
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:27,797
revisit Killmails, we had something to sort of look at. We could look at what

419
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:31,538
they've done as a prototype or as an experiment and sort of pick what we

420
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,199
thought was the best from different things.

421
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,442
So a few years ago, we went back and we redid killmails in the client.

422
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:41,025
No longer is it this blob of text, but we're actually formatting it,

423
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,507
displaying it nice and pretty.

424
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:46,950
We added the ability to look at specific wars, all the kills and losses

425
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,331
in there.

426
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:49,833
Again, taking some hints from the kill boards

427
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,996
and mixing it in with what we thought worked best in our client.

428
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:00,582
Sorry.

429
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:08,556
So again, the main point here I want to make is just that sometimes third party developers can do things better than we can.

430
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:12,859
And we should embrace this. We shouldn't be afraid of it. We shouldn't be worried about it.

431
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,862
We should embrace it and support it. It's awesome.

432
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:24,829
So, the third thing I want to talk to you about is mobile phones and what our third party developers have done for us in this sort of realm.

433
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:29,638
Eve Online, specifically, we have zero mobile resources.

434
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,441
Our web team makes their web pages to look great on mobile,

435
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,904
yes, but we don't have a dedicated mobile app for Eve

436
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:37,766
Online, not an official CCP one.

437
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,390
We're focused on Eve itself and that client.

438
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:45,474
There's an Android application called EveDroid.

439
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,356
There's other ones for Android, and there's some for

440
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:50,078
iOS, but I just sort of want to quickly run you through

441
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:53,644
what our third-party devs have done here.

442
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,846
So this is, as I said, EVE Droid.

443
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:58,568
First thing, to me, it looks fabulous.

444
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,489
It looks like a professionally done application.

445
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,651
It has a lot of great features.

446
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:05,293
You can look at all your different characters from multiple accounts.

447
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:08,255
You can look at a specific character's wallet transactions.

448
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,596
That's what's going on on the left there.

449
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,935
You can look at the entire item database of our game,

450
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,457
and then based on what character you have selected at the time,

451
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,420
know if he can use those items or how long until he can use them.

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,983
On the right there is a screenshot of the person

453
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:28,626
playing around with a fitting for a ship and seeing how that all works.

454
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,387
So this is all really slick.

455
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:31,408
It looks great.

456
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:32,228
It's wonderful.

457
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,995
And just to give you an idea, this is the top user agents on

458
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:37,076
our XML API.

459
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:40,961
The second, third, and fifth slot are all Android mobile

460
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:41,922
applications.

461
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:45,406
As I said, we get about 1,100 to 1,200 requests a second on

462
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:46,067
this API.

463
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,871
So a substantial portion of them are coming from mobile.

464
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:56,640
Now, all this information that's being used by this

465
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,442
EVE Droid application was exposed either in the static

466
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:03,744
data export or the XML API years before Android was ever

467
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:05,966
publicly even known about.

468
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,568
But without any extra effort on our part,

469
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:14,090
We were just maintaining a set of APIs that already existed.

470
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,212
We had a substantial mobile presence, something our

471
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:20,054
players seemed to really care about and our third party

472
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:23,115
developers were eager to do something with.

473
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:30,279
While I was writing this, what I realized, though, was that

474
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,821
it's not really about mobile phones.

475
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:35,222
As I said, we didn't even know about mobile phones at the

476
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,163
time, like Android.

477
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:37,123
It wasn't really a thing.

478
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,224
But we released this information.

479
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:39,204
We got that.

480
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:45,327
So yes, it's about mobile phones, but it's about smart watches and Google Glass and robots and whatever comes next.

481
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:49,449
I've seen a robot walking around that tells you when the server comes up or goes down

482
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:52,430
and tells you when your character's done training things and that kind of stuff, right?

483
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,172
I've seen it on Google. I've seen notifications on Google Glass and all these other things that...

484
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,415
Again, we don't even have access to.

485
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,418
I don't have a robot to try and play around with.

486
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:02,978
I wish I did.

487
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:04,740
I also don't have Google Glass.

488
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,582
But I've seen Eve there, right?

489
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,305
I've seen us have a presence there, because our third party

490
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,027
developers are doing awesome stuff for us.

491
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:14,071
So the real point I want to make here is that third party

492
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:16,253
developers will help you take your game to places you don't

493
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,134
even know exist.

494
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,026
And then I guess on top of that, even if we do go back and

495
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:25,852
create a mobile application ourselves, just like the

496
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:28,459
Killboards and the Killmills, we'll have great examples to

497
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,283
look at and places to take pieces from.

498
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,132
So those are some of the benefits, and they were quite

499
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:34,552
wonderful.

500
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:38,294
But let's talk about some of the challenges and the

501
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:39,635
problems that we've encountered.

502
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:43,036
The first thing is the API key requirements.

503
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:47,138
So with Crest, the authentication on Crest is

504
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,599
with the OAuth 2.0.

505
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,781
The XML API, though, you log into our website, you generate

506
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,002
an API key, and that just gets passed in as a

507
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,163
parameter in the URL.

508
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,244
And that will determine whether you have access to

509
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:00,565
certain resources based on the character the

510
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:01,626
API key belongs to.

511
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,923
And as I said, we have a bit of an above-average technical

512
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,584
user base.

513
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:09,405
And we're very hands-off in our sandbox.

514
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:12,888
So if someone steals from you, that's your fault for letting

515
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:13,408
it happen.

516
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,490
Because of that, though, we've run into a situation where

517
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,153
corporations, guilds in our game, are very eager to

518
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:21,233
protect themselves.

519
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:23,935
So if you want to join a group, they generally want

520
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,436
your API key up front so they can do a

521
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,157
background check.

522
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:33,687
If you think that's funny, so this is the I want to give you just sort of a an understanding

523
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:38,911
It's the lengths our players will go to to protect themselves. This is a screenshot of the pandemic Legion forums

524
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:43,915
Everything looks great, right? It looks pretty normal if you were to copy and paste that actually

525
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,196
I think they've deactivated it now

526
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:48,639
But it used to be if you copy and pasted that posted it on reddit, right?

527
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,143
You're a spy you have access to their forums your copy and paste this bit of information to leak it on reddit

528
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:58,687
They've done Unicode watermarking on this, so they can copy and paste what you've just

529
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:02,609
pasted into Reddit back into their tool, and they'll know what character was logged in

530
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,230
at the time this was copy and pasted.

531
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:05,891
They took this further, though.

532
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,214
When people started finding out about that and just started taking screenshots like this,

533
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:15,558
they started doing some screenshot watermarking so they could adjust the levels in Photoshop on the screenshot

534
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,939
and still know who took this screenshot, right?

535
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,981
So this is the lengths our players will go to to protect themselves,

536
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:26,804
this counterintelligence espionage game they're playing outside the client.

537
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,107
And again, that takes place outside the client, right?

538
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,028
So we don't really care.

539
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:37,010
Except we kind of do when it comes to the API key.

540
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,532
So this is a comment from Control-Alt-Delete.

541
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:40,593
He's a few years old now.

542
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:43,196
He starts with giving an example of joining a guild in

543
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:44,177
most MMOs, right?

544
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:45,278
Hey, I like this game.

545
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:45,958
You like this game?

546
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:46,699
Fantastic.

547
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:47,780
Let's play together, right?

548
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:49,702
Then there's Eve.

549
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,567
To join a group in EVE, you need to go through this long

550
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,768
interview process and give them your API key.

551
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:57,128
And it's that API key thing that we're worried about.

552
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:00,149
Because to get the API key, you need to leave our client,

553
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:03,750
go to our web page, log in, generate an API key, and then

554
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,251
go and give it to this corporation that you want to

555
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,912
join, and then they'll do a background check

556
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:11,032
based on that API key.

557
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,893
But if you check the wrong boxes when you generated the

558
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,693
API key, you've got to go and generate it again.

559
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:17,114
It's a bit of a mess, right?

560
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:18,194
And most importantly.

561
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:22,451
excuse me, you're being forced to leave our client just to

562
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,692
play our game with people.

563
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,173
That's not so great.

564
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,994
And on top of that, most people don't know

565
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:29,095
what an API key is.

566
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,857
I don't know of many other games that have that, right?

567
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,658
So you come to Eve, and you're like, well, I don't really

568
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,718
know what this is, but OK.

569
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,700
And now you've just given these people access to

570
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,421
everything about your character.

571
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,422
You probably don't even know you can revoke that API key if

572
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:43,604
you leave that organization and don't want them to have

573
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:44,384
access anymore.

574
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:47,086
So this is an ongoing issue.

575
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,953
And sorry, kind of meant to advance to that.

576
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:55,094
Yeah, this problem of leaving the client just to play our

577
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,255
game, it goes against one of our core guidelines for the

578
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:01,936
API. We're not quite sure how to fix this ourselves, to tell

579
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:02,376
you the truth.

580
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,816
We know it's an issue.

581
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:04,676
We're aware of it.

582
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:07,137
And we're trying to make sure it's not becoming more of an

583
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:10,118
issue as we continue expanding the resources for third party

584
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:10,658
developers.

585
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:13,099
But we're not quite sure how to fix that.

586
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,883
It's a bit of an issue specific to Eve, but it's a good example of where things

587
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,804
can quickly spiral out of control.

588
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:24,709
What we try to do, though, to avoid more of this same problem coming up,

589
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:28,365
is we talk internally about what we're going to expose, right?

590
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,728
We talk about how it can be used against players,

591
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,030
how it can be used to do weird things.

592
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,013
But then, more importantly, we talk externally

593
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:38,294
about what we want to do.

594
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,015
We talk to our third-party developers.

595
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,037
There's a Slack channel that I sit in

596
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:44,259
with a bunch of third-party devs, an IRC channel.

597
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm on Twitter.

598
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,382
Most of them know my email address.

599
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,583
I'm easy to get ahold of.

600
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:50,444
I tell them this is what we're thinking of doing.

601
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,867
And they're more than happy to give us feedback.

602
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,269
These are some really smart people.

603
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,431
And they're also very devious.

604
00:29:57,633 --> 00:30:00,536
And they're more than willing, oftentimes, to tell you what

605
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,300
bad things they'll do with your API if they got it.

606
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:10,619
And this again this seems a bit obvious put it on the test server right and yes, please do

607
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:15,043
But tell your third-party devs about it. We try and make sure we tell them in advance

608
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:20,348
This is what we're gonna put up. It's up. Please go try it right not just yeah

609
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,971
It happened to be on the test server two weeks ago. Why didn't you try it right?

610
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:26,254
We encourage them to go and try it before we put it to production

611
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:32,040
And then, most importantly, watch its usage and be prepared to take action.

612
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:37,045
If you leave an API up and bad things are happening with it, but you leave that up for

613
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:44,192
five years, players tend to get to the point where they believe it's a right that they

614
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:44,492
have it.

615
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:45,653
They deserve that.

616
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:47,215
It's part of their gameplay.

617
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:50,017
If you take it away a month or two after release,

618
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:53,420
At that point, it's still kind of a privilege to have.

619
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,441
They're happy to have it.

620
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,582
It's kind of cool.

621
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,643
But it's not becoming ingrained in their

622
00:30:57,683 --> 00:30:58,924
daily life of the game.

623
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,668
So when you put an API out, watch it carefully.

624
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,369
Watch what your third party devs are doing with it.

625
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,090
Talk to them.

626
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,030
See what they're doing.

627
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,391
Ask them what they're doing with it.

628
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:12,654
And then if it's starting to go the wrong way, be prepared

629
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:13,315
to take that action.

630
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,637
Maybe it's modifying the API resource or deleting it until

631
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:18,399
you solve whatever problem there is.

632
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:22,733
But this kind of, that last point of taking action

633
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:25,515
leads me into sort of my next thing I want to talk about,

634
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:28,637
which is a bit more of a specific example, which

635
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:31,158
is sort of what I guess I've called the forgotten data.

636
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:34,496
So this is the star map in EVE.

637
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:37,438
I guess it's a little hard to see there, but all the dots

638
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:38,659
are solar systems in our game.

639
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,103
This map, when EVE launched, had about 5,200 star systems

640
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:44,404
in it, all that you could visit.

641
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:48,907
The yellow and red that you're seeing is a filter you can

642
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:49,608
apply to the map.

643
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:52,430
So you can see the number of NPCs killed in every system

644
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,691
over the last hour.

645
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:59,309
When we added the XML API, this seemed like a great thing

646
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:00,470
to add to it, so we did.

647
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,793
You can get publicly available every

648
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,855
solar system in our game.

649
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,697
The number of player kills in it, the number of NPCs killed,

650
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:08,718
that kind of thing.

651
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,681
It's exactly what you see in the client, so that's fine.

652
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:13,683
It's cached for the same amount of time.

653
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:14,704
It's one hour.

654
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:16,186
It only updates once an hour.

655
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,577
Importantly, though, when we did this, there was only 5,200

656
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,019
systems, and they were all visible on the map.

657
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,520
So we basically just did select all from map data,

658
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:28,582
convert to XML, dump to the API.

659
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:29,243
Very simple.

660
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:30,984
And it worked fine.

661
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,529
In 2009, we added a new area of space to our game called wormholes.

662
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,692
These wormhole systems were very different than other solar systems

663
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:39,172
in our game.

664
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,454
They were much harder to live in.

665
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:43,816
They did not show up in the client.

666
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,958
If you open the map in the client, you didn't see them.

667
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,520
And as I said, they're much harder to live in.

668
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,581
And this didn't happen right away.

669
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,423
Over time, as players started developing tools,

670
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,025
I forgot to make that image bigger.

671
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,442
As our players started developing tools to help them better live in wormholes,

672
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:07,707
one of the things that they started doing, and this is like three or four years after the release of wormholes,

673
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:13,692
what they started doing was tracking all of the NPCs killed every hour for every system.

674
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:15,773
So when you went into a new wormhole system,

675
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,353
because it didn't show up on the map

676
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:18,554
and you couldn't get this information,

677
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,974
suddenly you had it outside the client.

678
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,595
But more importantly, you knew sort of every time,

679
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:26,836
if their NPCs were killed between five and seven every day,

680
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,576
you knew the people who lived there

681
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:31,817
probably logged on between five and seven.

682
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:35,118
So if you laid a trap, you had an advantage.

683
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:36,919
And this was information that you couldn't get in the client.

684
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:38,879
You could track this outside the client,

685
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,760
use that information to lay a trap,

686
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,661
and present yourself with an advantage.

687
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:48,677
When we learned about this, we knew we had to do something.

688
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:53,043
Because it was breaking a core rule of ours for the API, which

689
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,605
is that information in the con.

690
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,341
Sorry, information outside.

691
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,062
You should not be able to get information outside the client.

692
00:33:58,142 --> 00:33:59,203
You can't get in the client.

693
00:33:59,583 --> 00:33:59,764
Wow.

694
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,346
So what were we going to do, though?

695
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,948
When we first talked about, well, since this is breaking

696
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,749
the rule, we need to remove it, our players got very angry.

697
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,391
They got very upset that we were taking away something

698
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:14,573
that they were using to get PVP.

699
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:17,976
They were using this tool to get content in our game, and

700
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,156
we wanted to take it away.

701
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,982
and they'd gotten so used to it that there were organizations that built themselves around this.

702
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,184
There were organizations of several hundred people,

703
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:31,886
their only purpose was to use this information to get their kills.

704
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,099
So OK, we said we want to remove it.

705
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,419
Our players got a bit upset.

706
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,180
We went back and we talked about it a bit more.

707
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,862
And we just simply looked at our guidelines, which were you

708
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,042
should not be able to get information outside the client

709
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:46,603
that you can't get in the client.

710
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:50,144
And so we thought, OK, should we add this to the client?

711
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,505
If it's giving our players content, should it be there?

712
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,446
When we talked about it and thought about it some more, we

713
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:57,466
realized that it was not.

714
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:01,168
creating the style of game that we wanted in wormholes.

715
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:03,189
So we stuck with our decision.

716
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,150
We removed this information from the API.

717
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,553
So whoops, again, a little behind.

718
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:14,055
To avoid this kind of thing, though, in the future,

719
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,817
something we've tried very hard to do at CCP is make sure

720
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:20,818
that the feature teams that are developing features are

721
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,820
also the ones that are dealing with the API.

722
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,581
When the API, the XML API was first released,

723
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:29,142
there's one guy who sat over in a corner and did this, right,

724
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,762
in his spare time,

725
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,203
which is why when wormholes came out

726
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:34,503
and one team was adding these wormholes

727
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:36,764
and decided that they didn't want it on the in-game map,

728
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:38,965
this other guy, he didn't really know that decision.

729
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:41,886
He didn't, so he didn't think about removing them from the API, right?

730
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,366
There was this lack of communication.

731
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:45,847
And so what we try and do now is make sure that feature

732
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:49,708
teams are either doing the work in the API themselves, or

733
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,709
they're at least well-informed of what the API is capable of.

734
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,890
And the people working on the API are there and ready to

735
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,391
assist them, either by showing them or doing the work that's

736
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,712
required to make the modifications to the API.

737
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:06,553
So yeah, the biggest thing there is just making sure that

738
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,774
feature teams are aware of it, and preferably

739
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:09,674
doing it themselves.

740
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:11,475
So.

741
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:14,599
That went a little bit quicker than usual, but that's fine.

742
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,921
Some conclusions.

743
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,565
Again, third-party developers can help you with use cases

744
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,388
that you don't have time for or that you don't know exist,

745
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:24,871
which to me is a really key thing.

746
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,953
We're building a game with emergent gameplay.

747
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,556
We don't know all the things our players want to do.

748
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,678
And our third-party developers are there, and they're more

749
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,599
than happy to help us.

750
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:39,966
So, empower them to do so. If they're there, they're willing, they're smart people, right?

751
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,468
They can do some really cool stuff. Give them the chance to do it.

752
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:49,792
The number of times I've seen players go through and manually write down all the stats for items in a game

753
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:56,316
because they can't scrape that information from the data files or it's not provided to them in an easy to access way.

754
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:59,658
So they're going through and they're just looking at the game and writing down all the stats

755
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:03,240
just so they can build a mobile application that is an item database, right?

756
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:08,665
It's not that hard for us with the framework we have in place to release this information

757
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:12,469
and you know I don't personally think it's I guess it depends on the use case

758
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:17,714
But if you put the effort in and you make that information available you provide yourself with a framework to easily do that

759
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,276
They'll do a lot of cool stuff

760
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,290
And then sort of, I think this covers most of our,

761
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,750
the issues I talked about.

762
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,510
The biggest thing is really just discussing

763
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:31,331
what you want to do in your API,

764
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:32,351
what your feature teams are doing,

765
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:35,712
and preferably, as I said, bring that API development

766
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:36,672
into the feature team.

767
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:40,813
So, as I said, my name's Reiner Block-Anderson.

768
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:42,133
That's my email address for my Twitter.

769
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:43,754
And if you guys have any questions,

770
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:45,414
I'd be more than happy to answer them.

771
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:46,374
There's microphones.

772
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:08,937
Great talk. I love Eve. I don't play it enough. I guess two questions. First is, do you use this also in Dust 5.14? 5.14, I guess.

773
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:13,147
So with the XML API, no.

774
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:14,408
But with Crest, yes.

775
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:18,993
So Dust 514, for those that are unaware, is a PlayStation

776
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:20,174
3 first-person shooter.

777
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:22,917
It takes place, though, in the Eve universe on the same

778
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:24,819
server as Eve Online.

779
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,803
So we use Crest for all the rewrite between the Dust

780
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:30,144
client and the Eve server.

781
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:34,139
And then, so second question is, do you use the API

782
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:34,840
internally?

783
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,003
So Cress's read-write, is it a benefit to your internal team

784
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,005
to also utilize this to add features?

785
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:45,448
We have used it in several cases, and we are working more

786
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:48,730
towards having it be something that we use more.

787
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,491
Great, thank you.

788
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:53,242
Awesome, thanks for the talk.

789
00:38:54,343 --> 00:38:58,008
So you mentioned that as part of a feature development,

790
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,331
teams have to add the API.

791
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,955
And you also mentioned that developers internally

792
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,878
will add API requests when they see the fit,

793
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,540
like when it would be good for the API.

794
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:14,865
How do you, from your community, how do you understand when you should remove, add, or

795
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,906
prioritize different API features?

796
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,587
Do you have a request open?

797
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,029
Do you have a poll that GoonFleet can swarm?

798
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:27,752
How do you add these non-feature specific APIs into your system?

799
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:33,496
So, yeah, I guess the question is how do we add features to our API that are not requests

800
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:35,917
from the feature team, but requests from the community?

801
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:40,920
And honestly, we just sit down and talk with them on the forums or whatever.

802
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:47,824
And if a player has a suggestion and someone in the company is really interested in exposing it,

803
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,186
then it's just up to that person to go and expose it.

804
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,328
We're pretty open like that, right?

805
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,710
So, yeah, if someone wants to do it, they just do it.

806
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,130
Okay, thank you.

807
00:39:58,311 --> 00:39:58,891
Yeah, not a problem.

808
00:40:04,064 --> 00:40:04,765
Hi, great talk.

809
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:05,486
Thank you.

810
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,470
Sorry.

811
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:11,214
Oh, for Pete's sake.

812
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:23,695
Usually when a change comes out for a game that involves a new feature or maybe some rebalancing,

813
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:28,518
the community's reaction to it is based on their exposure to those changes.

814
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,981
This API seems to provide a lot of transparency.

815
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:41,647
I was wondering if you get a more, let's say, profound reaction to designers balancing things in EVE Online as a result of that.

816
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:44,285
Sorry, I didn't quite understand.

817
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:50,287
I'm saying if a game needs to be rebalanced after it's released,

818
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:54,388
right, as they tend to be, does your API

819
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,110
expose those changes in a way that players

820
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,531
can analyze those changes, see what you've done,

821
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,211
react to that more strongly?

822
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:09,398
In many cases, yes. And we will often put out the static data export that I was talking about.

823
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:13,741
We'll put that out early. There's tools that are generally called fitting tools.

824
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,905
They let you practice fitting a ship without actually launching the client or owning the modules.

825
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:24,832
We'll put out the information that's needed to update those tools before the actual release

826
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:29,336
so that we can get better feedback. We find that's actually a very valuable and beneficial thing.

827
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:41,787
Also, how do you decide whether a feature in the client will actually be exposed through the, like, is there a general guideline for whether or not to expose it?

828
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:47,427
So the question is, how do we decide which features will be exposed in the API and which

829
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:47,867
ones won't?

830
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:56,055
Again, as I sort of suggested, we sit down and we talk about it, and we decide we want

831
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:57,356
to expose everything possible.

832
00:41:57,636 --> 00:41:59,218
At least I personally do, right?

833
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:03,462
So really it just comes down to discussing it and deciding if there is a reason not to

834
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:03,982
expose it.

835
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:05,924
Thank you.

836
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:11,317
I was curious, do you guys have information in the game

837
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,219
that's only available to the individual users?

838
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:14,980
And how do you feel about third-party developers

839
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,882
aggregating data that's meant to be private

840
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,163
for individual users?

841
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:21,025
We have a lot of them.

842
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:24,387
Sorry, the question was, do we have information in the API

843
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:25,068
that is private?

844
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,631
And how do we feel about third-party devs correlating

845
00:42:29,651 --> 00:42:31,753
that information and stuff like that?

846
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:32,874
Very much.

847
00:42:32,954 --> 00:42:35,096
A lot of our API is private information,

848
00:42:35,116 --> 00:42:36,297
especially the XML API.

849
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:44,022
There's everything about it is built around the idea of giving people the control over what they expose.

850
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:47,164
You can create an API key that only gives access to your wallet,

851
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,666
or only gives access to the skills you have or the items you have, right?

852
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:55,469
And if a third-party developer gains the trust of the community,

853
00:42:55,489 --> 00:43:00,753
and the community gives them all the API keys required to gather that information,

854
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:02,754
then that's kind of the choice of our community.

855
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,878
We do have a bit of a thing that I don't think we've decided how we feel about it yet,

856
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:17,484
where part of that counterintelligence and that espionage thing is specifically going out and harvesting API keys.

857
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:20,886
And I'm not sure how we feel about that yet, to tell you the truth.

858
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,688
You have a lot of botting traffic against the APIs,

859
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,289
and how do you evaluate and deal with that?

860
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:32,752
And then corollary to that is there, aside from API key,

861
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,194
how have you addressed any security concerns

862
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:39,157
in protecting the APIs and users in general?

863
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:41,680
So I missed the first part of your question.

864
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,280
Can you repeat that?

865
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,082
Botting traffic against the APIs.

866
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:47,344
So users writing bots to just constantly hit them.

867
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:55,243
Yeah. I mean, our API, so I guess the question was, you know, there's a lot of bots or programmatically,

868
00:43:55,343 --> 00:44:01,828
our API is accessed programmatically a lot. And we're totally fine with that. As I said,

869
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:09,234
we try and offer the best and the best security to our players in generating their API keys.

870
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:13,237
They can revoke them. And we give them a log of the API key access.

871
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,479
So if they feel that their API key's being misused

872
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:17,500
or abused or something,

873
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,201
as an individual, you can revoke it.

874
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:22,163
Other than that, I'm happy to see the graph climb

875
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:23,544
of the number of hits on our API.

876
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:27,207
So does that answer the first part of your question?

877
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:29,949
Yeah? And then I guess the second part

878
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:31,970
was about the user security of it

879
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,931
and how do we secure the API.

880
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:33,131
Sorry.

881
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:36,874
man 3 in audience I guess it's more platform security.

882
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,455
Once you open up this functionality...

883
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,750
There's potential abuse and potential, you know,

884
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,711
if there is use of that.

885
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:45,111
I mean, our biggest concern

886
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:47,652
is people DDoS-ing it kind of thing.

887
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,132
Outside that, it's secured with SSL3,

888
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:52,493
and we highly encourage everyone to use that.

889
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:55,074
I'm very much of the opinion

890
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:57,494
of revoking the non-HTTPS version of it.

891
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,215
So hope that...

892
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:03,596
And as I said, we do a lot for providing users information

893
00:45:03,616 --> 00:45:04,756
about how their API is being used.

894
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,827
Sorry, I had another question.

895
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:14,337
So one issue that I feel like we've run into

896
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:18,344
is you talked about users being able to select what

897
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,446
information they want visible.

898
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:26,609
So there's like an instance where there's like a history of some sort, like a battle history or like a match history of some sort.

899
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:32,072
And users may go in and select that. They don't mind if that's available through the API.

900
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:38,056
And then if they go back later and say that they want that private, then there's sites that have already scraped that information.

901
00:45:39,117 --> 00:45:44,141
How do you feel about that sort of... is that something that you... well, excuse me...

902
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:47,063
that you would ask sites to remove, or is that something that's on the users...

903
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:53,358
So the question was sort of, once a user is granted access to their API and certain information,

904
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:57,019
if that user revokes it, how do we feel about the information that's already been pulled

905
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:57,719
from the API?

906
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:01,000
And it's up to our users as to what they expose.

907
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,341
If they choose to expose it and share that information, and once it's out there, that's

908
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:07,042
sort of on them, is our general response.

909
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:11,288
Hi, another question.

910
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,216
At what point did your community grow large enough that, I mean, I'm not sure if maybe

911
00:46:18,236 --> 00:46:23,181
they were large enough when you released the API, but I'm wondering if there's a critical

912
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:28,187
mass of, you know, of members of the player base that are necessary to utilize these APIs.

913
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,585
So the question was, sort of, at what point did we hit critical mass,

914
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:36,327
where there was enough users to utilize these APIs that we provide?

915
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,529
And to tell you the truth, as I said at the beginning,

916
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:41,031
we have an above-average technical user base,

917
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:43,552
and the API was built in response to...

918
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:47,815
We used to offer a web page that would show you your character's skills.

919
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,416
That web page was being scraped.

920
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,978
So the API was originally built in response

921
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:54,920
to the needs of our community,

922
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,221
and it just sort of continued to grow from there.

923
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:03,873
This sounds like it might be against your guiding principles, but I was wondering if

924
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:07,735
it seems currently like a very read-only API.

925
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:11,897
Is there any plan to expand to any actions or writes?

926
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:15,399
So the question is, are we ever going to open up write access to our API?

927
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:17,019
Very much so, hopefully this year.

928
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:22,206
And that will be via Crest, and yes, very much so.

929
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,867
Crest, as I said, was built for DOS 5.4, which does read and write access.

930
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:30,669
And yes, we are very much moving towards releasing that to our community.

931
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,589
In which capacities?

932
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:33,630
Which kind of access?

933
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:35,224
Good question.

934
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:39,368
So in what way are we going to release the write portions of

935
00:47:39,388 --> 00:47:39,869
the API?

936
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,932
Anything that doesn't modify your wealth directly.

937
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:44,634
So no selling of things.

938
00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:46,055
We don't want people making market bots.

939
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:49,098
We're going to start with no transferring of risk.

940
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:51,561
Our gut feeling is we're going to start with things that

941
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:52,662
don't modify your wealth.

942
00:47:53,123 --> 00:48:02,153
So changing your queue for skills that you're training or modifying your contacts, sending mails in the client, that kind of stuff.

943
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:04,075
Hopefully chat at some point as well.

944
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:05,938
We want to open up to our third-party devs.

945
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:08,340
Those things that don't modify your wealth.

946
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:09,982
Thank you.

947
00:48:10,082 --> 00:48:10,403
Not a problem.

948
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:18,081
Kind of as a follow-up to that, what kind of philosophy do you have about what experiences

949
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:22,725
you want players to have to have in-game versus ones you want to allow outside of the game?

950
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:26,448
Because with some of these things you can get people mostly playing your game through

951
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,069
the phone and not through your client.

952
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,834
So if I understand the question, how do we feel about and where do we draw the line?

953
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:38,380
Yeah, where do you draw the line as to like, you know, this is something we really want

954
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,166
you to log into the client to do versus something we'll allow you to just do anytime, anywhere?

955
00:48:44,227 --> 00:48:49,533
We're moving in the direction of we want you experiencing our game, whether it's through

956
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:51,715
our client or not.

957
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:55,499
We're happy that you are experiencing our game and being involved in it.

958
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:59,262
So as it stands now, to do things you have to be in the client,

959
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:02,704
as we open up Right Access, we're more than happy.

960
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:11,031
If you just experience chat through your phone, that's fine.

961
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:13,533
We're totally happy with that, as long as you're part of the universe.

962
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:23,371
Awesome. You mentioned that you currently have like the XML API and you're opening up the Crest API here soon.

963
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:28,798
Do you have a plan in mind of maybe migrating people from the XML one to the REST API?

964
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,401
And if so, what kind of strategies are you utilizing for that?

965
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:33,120
So the question was,

966
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,782
are we gonna deprecate the XML API sort of thing,

967
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:38,242
I guess, really.

968
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:39,883
And yes, very much so.

969
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,284
We're, uh, we've been focused on getting Crest

970
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,705
to the point where we can release,

971
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:45,846
read, and write access to our community.

972
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:48,447
And once we get that, one of our top priorities

973
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:51,128
will be sort of migrating all the same information

974
00:49:51,148 --> 00:49:53,269
you can get in the XML API over to Crest.

975
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,390
And once we've done that,

976
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,411
development of the XML API will stop.

977
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,652
There's a ton of applications already built around it.

978
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:02,473
So we're just going to leave it running for kind of however many years we feel is needed.

979
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:07,454
And throughout that time, we'll just be encouraging development to happen on Crest.

980
00:50:07,594 --> 00:50:08,935
And then at some point, I assume we'll kill it.

981
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:09,035
Cool.

982
00:50:09,055 --> 00:50:11,315
Thank you very much, guys.

983
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:11,975
Appreciate it for coming out.

984
00:50:11,995 --> 00:50:12,175
Thank you.

985
00:50:12,195 --> 00:50:12,375
Thank you.

986
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:12,576
Thank you.

987
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:12,776
Thank you.

988
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:13,056
Thank you.

989
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:13,276
Thank you.

990
00:50:13,296 --> 00:50:13,496
Thank you.

991
00:50:13,516 --> 00:50:13,736
Thank you.

992
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:13,976
Thank you.

993
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:14,196
Thank you.

994
00:50:14,216 --> 00:50:14,396
Thank you.

995
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:14,676
Thank you.

996
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:14,876
Thank you.

997
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:15,096
Thank you.

998
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:15,336
Thank you.

999
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:19,217
Thank you.
