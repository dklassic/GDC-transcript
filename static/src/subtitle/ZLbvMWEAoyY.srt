1
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:15,369
Yeah, so let's talk about Destiny.

2
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,390
So I'm Justin Truman.

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm the general manager for Destiny 2.

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:29,852
I've got about 20 years of game dev experience on consoles and PC, and the last 12 years

5
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:32,393
I've been working on Destiny and Bungie.

6
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,765
And on Destiny, I've worked on a bunch of different roles,

7
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:39,568
engineering, design, production, business now.

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,491
And so my goal in this talk is to talk about

9
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:44,673
Bungie's evolution as a studio

10
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,694
in a really cross-discipline way.

11
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:52,059
It's also worth saying, while I'm the only one up here speaking right now,

12
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,000
every learning that we're going to cover today

13
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:58,042
was the collective contribution of a ton of, like,

14
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:01,104
really talented and insightful folks at Bungie.

15
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:04,526
So the only part that I'll take sole credit for

16
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:07,928
is any mistakes or dumb statements that I'm about to make.

17
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:12,184
And the evolution that I want to talk about for the next hour

18
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:16,489
is our journey from our box product roots as a company

19
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,172
to the live service team that we have today.

20
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,934
And this journey really catalyzed

21
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:26,820
in some kind of painful ways with the launch of Destiny 2.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,242
So way back in 2017, we launched Destiny 2.

23
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:37,948
And at the time, Destiny 1 was still a thriving live service.

24
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,410
But we had committed with our publisher

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,371
to release a full sequel to that live service

26
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,134
that we had just started nurturing three years prior.

27
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,656
And so for us at Bungie, we knew that if we

28
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:52,578
were going to have to sequel, we wanted to do it right.

29
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:56,420
We wanted to make something that we and the entire Destiny

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,341
community were excited about.

31
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,592
because we liked a lot about the original Destiny 1,

32
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,373
but we knew that it had a reputation

33
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,854
as a somewhat flawed game.

34
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,174
Like it was really fun,

35
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:11,396
but it was also pretty nerdy and hardcore.

36
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:13,957
And so we wanted to turn that on its head

37
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:18,018
and make a much more widely appealing version of Destiny.

38
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,260
So we built a better campaign with a much better narrative.

39
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:27,016
We tuned the rewards to be faster and more generous

40
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,358
with more instant gratification.

41
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,480
Our primary razor during development

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,402
was that we wanted to put a two on the box.

43
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,244
You can see how it kind of subtly influenced

44
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,606
our marketing treatment leading up to launch.

45
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:43,428
And we did it.

46
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:45,889
We launched to great reviews.

47
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,152
Destiny 2's Metacritic was more than 10 points

48
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:50,573
above its predecessor.

49
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:56,258
And our players and our fans told us that we had made something more appealing,

50
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,659
more polished, and more rewarding.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,961
And that was also reflected by our in-game data,

52
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:06,684
because Destiny 2's player engagement was both broader with more players

53
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:11,546
and deeper with more hours than it had ever been in Destiny 1.

54
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,109
For about six weeks.

55
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,292
And then issues started to emerge, with the first signs being our most avid,

56
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,874
hardcore community running out of content.

57
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:29,937
This then rapidly spread to broader, more casual players,

58
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,939
and eventually these problems spilled all the way out of our community

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,062
and started creating a bad reputation for our brand in a major way,

60
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:40,863
even amongst gamers who didn't play Destiny.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,851
And that threatened the total ecosystem of the game

62
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,213
as we first frustrated and then shed our player base.

63
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:55,055
To show this visually, so this was our weekly active users

64
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:57,475
for Destiny 2 in the first few months.

65
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,317
And for comparison, this is what Destiny 1 looked like.

66
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:06,518
So, so far, so good. But then, this started happening.

67
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:13,457
And this moment right here in February of 2018

68
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,639
was fucking terrifying.

69
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,560
So this graph shows the trend of our weekly active users.

70
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,901
And at the rate that we were shedding players,

71
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:24,541
we did the math.

72
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,582
I remember being in the meeting.

73
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,262
We did the math.

74
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,323
And if this continued for just five more weeks,

75
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,720
we would run out of players.

76
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:34,843
The entire population would be gone.

77
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:39,509
And we were seriously looking at potentially being one month away

78
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,695
from having to just close up shop on Destiny 2 altogether.

79
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,401
So that was in February of 2018.

80
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:54,290
Now fast forward four years and we're on track in 2022

81
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:57,454
to have our most successful year ever

82
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,257
in the history of the Destiny franchise.

83
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,921
We've had our highest critical and community reception

84
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,924
in the history of our series and we're on track

85
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,467
to have the strongest business year we've ever had.

86
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:13,665
And that's five years after launching Destiny 2.

87
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,607
That's eight years after the launch of the franchise.

88
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:24,310
And that runs like totally counter to the AAA peak and decay model

89
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,291
that I've experienced with every other game I've worked on in my career.

90
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,353
So what I want to talk about for the rest of this talk

91
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:38,735
is what had to change about Bungie to go from here to here.

92
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:44,118
And this moment, when we were literally five weeks away

93
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,120
from shuttering Destiny 2 as a product,

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,383
it was exciting, it was intense, it was terrifying,

95
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,064
and I'm gonna talk about it some today.

96
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:57,087
But more than any one moment,

97
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,770
I wanna talk about the long, multi-year process

98
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,371
that this moment catalyzed.

99
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:07,016
that required us to rethink so many of our development practices

100
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:11,519
and our studio culture from the ground up over multiple years.

101
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,000
And at its core, this is about the transition

102
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:19,803
from a box product mindset of developing games

103
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,104
to a live service mindset.

104
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:26,986
And so what do I mean when I say a service mindset?

105
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,708
And I'm not talking about like the product definition here.

106
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,430
Like I think we all know what a live service game

107
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,951
looks like on the product side.

108
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,774
But what is the mentality, the culture,

109
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:41,456
the practices that lets you win in this environment?

110
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,257
And so for the rest of this hour,

111
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,539
I wanna try to define what we had to learn

112
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,120
to get to where we are today.

113
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,990
And each of these transitions that I'm going to be talking about,

114
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:55,437
they were really hard for us to first identify and recognize.

115
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,560
And then even once we understood them,

116
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:01,987
they were still hard to navigate and transform to as an organization.

117
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:07,468
And so, I think that they're each pretty universal in application.

118
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,410
So, I'm hoping that we can help anyone in the audience

119
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,111
who's undergoing similar transformations on your team,

120
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,694
at least to get past that first step of identifying and recognizing these,

121
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,675
and then the actual transformation is still pretty tough.

122
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:24,519
But actually, I want to go back a step earlier,

123
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:28,181
because before we can define the endpoint of what a service mindset is,

124
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,262
we have to define the starting point.

125
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:36,926
So what do we mean at Bungie when we say the box product mindset for developing games?

126
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:45,149
And I would say for us at Bungie, like Halo was our canonical example of a AAA box product.

127
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,771
Because when we built Halo, we found success on every axis.

128
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,968
We had critical acclaim.

129
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:56,530
We had broad popular appeal, cultural relevance,

130
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,711
high sales, sustained player engagement.

131
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:04,013
Halo was a winner by every possible definition of success,

132
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,955
but unfortunately that meant that we didn't have to think

133
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,856
too deeply about which of those successes really mattered.

134
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,102
By contrast, Destiny 1 was the first game

135
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,644
that Bungie made in well over a decade

136
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:22,007
that didn't receive universal critical acclaim.

137
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,089
And this was like a really big blow

138
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,551
to our studio culture at the time

139
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,693
because in many ways it felt like failure.

140
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,356
And what we didn't realize when we launched Destiny 1

141
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,459
was that Destiny was already becoming a success

142
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,240
in the ways that mattered.

143
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:44,475
Engagement was the true measure of success for a franchise like ours, but we didn't know it yet.

144
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:51,921
And a lot of our efforts to make a better Destiny 2 were because we had a wrong

145
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,523
internal definition of what success was.

146
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,341
Because you can fix your review scores, you can fix your sentiment,

147
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:03,265
you can even fix your sales as long as you have engagement.

148
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:05,707
As long as you have a community of players

149
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:09,211
who care about and are passionate about your game.

150
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,201
even when that passion is being expressed as anger or frustration.

151
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:18,362
Anger, we eventually learn,

152
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:21,163
anger is not the opposite of loving a game.

153
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:25,005
Anger is like two degrees off from loving a game.

154
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:27,466
And they both come from passion,

155
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,788
from people who are highly engaged with what you're making.

156
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,769
And the opposite of loving a game,

157
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,610
the thing that could kill you is apathy.

158
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,851
And that's so much more scary than anger.

159
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,491
But I'm getting distracted.

160
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,994
So from way back in the Halo days,

161
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:46,636
all the way through Destiny 2 launch,

162
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:49,479
our process was pretty straightforward.

163
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,523
We would hire the best talent in the industry.

164
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,565
We would give them a lot of freedom

165
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:58,229
to use their creative guts and their creative process

166
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,933
to make whatever they considered to be the best game possible.

167
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,848
We'd release that product with a big bang

168
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,749
and the largest marketing push we could manage,

169
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,950
and we'd trust that success by every definition

170
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,290
would follow from that.

171
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,472
And this was all summed up at the time by our studio motto,

172
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,193
we make games we want to play.

173
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,888
and this is at the wall in front of our studio.

174
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:25,670
And we believe that when you trust your gut

175
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,572
on making something awesome,

176
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,595
making something that you can't wait to play,

177
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:33,357
that all of the different forms of success that you might want,

178
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:36,300
critical acclaim, sales, engaged players,

179
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,643
those all just flow naturally and intuitively from that.

180
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,071
And this picture is old and grainy because it's an old picture I actually found on my

181
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:50,693
cell phone because we took down that motto a little while after D2 launch as we evolved

182
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,233
our view of what success really meant.

183
00:10:54,894 --> 00:11:00,016
And our new studio motto, this is a more recent picture, is we create worlds that inspire

184
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:00,416
friendship.

185
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:06,009
And this new studio purpose has a bunch of benefits over the old one,

186
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,531
like including the fact that we make games we want to play.

187
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,352
It sounds a little too much like it's just like gatekeeping

188
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,413
for bald middle-aged white guys like me.

189
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,595
But besides adopting a more global and inclusive view,

190
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:23,457
this is really about a shift away from that box product mindset

191
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:25,558
into the service mindset.

192
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,778
And again, I'm not talking about the product design.

193
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,963
I'm not talking about business models or like free to play

194
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:31,805
or microtransactions.

195
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,832
I'm talking about something much more fundamental

196
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,996
to how we think about success.

197
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:42,044
Like if you think about the best AAA box product games out there,

198
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:45,186
like The Last of Uses, the Tsushima's, the Elden Rings,

199
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,067
there's plenty more that I can throw up on here.

200
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,149
Horizon, like core to the box product mindset in these games

201
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:54,811
is the goal of exceeding your expectations

202
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,712
in every way, across every axis.

203
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:02,535
They blow your mind with their scale, with their polish, with their quality.

204
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:08,178
At their best, they often almost feel like perfect games.

205
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:14,255
But we all know that these products don't start perfect.

206
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,857
Like, one of my favorite old quotes from a Pixar interview

207
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:21,980
that I love is, all of our movies suck at first.

208
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,702
Which, like, it sounds weird.

209
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:28,705
It's almost incomprehensible when, as consumers,

210
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,728
all we get to see is this near-perfect run

211
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:35,791
of artistic products coming out of Pixar and now Disney.

212
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:39,561
But we're all familiar with what the creative process is actually like

213
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:43,424
behind the scenes, that nothing starts great,

214
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:45,506
nothing starts perfect.

215
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,729
Making anything great is always about iterating

216
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,970
through failure after failure,

217
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,352
making it just a little bit better each time

218
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,835
until you finally have something incredible.

219
00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:00,816
And this idea of taking a game, taking any creative idea,

220
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,117
and doing all of that iteration in secret at your studio

221
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,338
so that the only thing you release,

222
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:10,459
the only thing your audience sees is near perfect,

223
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,840
that is what we're talking about at Bungie

224
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,920
when we say the box product mindset.

225
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:21,038
because you iterate and iterate guided mostly by your talent and your gut

226
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:22,699
until you have something amazing,

227
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,301
then you release it with this giant marketing explosion

228
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:27,623
and hope that it blows all of the doors off.

229
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,965
And to be clear, I'm not knocking this process.

230
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:34,107
It's amazing. I have tons of respect for every one of these studios,

231
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,909
every one of these games.

232
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,871
This idea of seeming like you never miss

233
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,813
is why I originally applied to work at Bungie.

234
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,604
And so I'm not trying to criticize it, I'm just setting it up to contrast it

235
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:50,425
with a different approach that we've now had to adopt for Destiny.

236
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,646
So, if that's the boxed product approach,

237
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,067
then what is the service approach and mindset by contrast?

238
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:04,968
And more than anything else, being a service is about being fast.

239
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,189
For a live service, more than anything,

240
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,170
more important even than quality,

241
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,626
A live service is about being fast.

242
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:17,788
Like, back in 2010,

243
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:21,930
you could have a long-lasting, high-retention game

244
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,792
just by releasing something that was super high quality,

245
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,934
really well-balanced and unchanged

246
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,495
that players kept coming back to for years.

247
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:34,137
But to stay afloat as a service today,

248
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:37,540
you need to be constantly feeding your players.

249
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,781
You need to be responding to their concerns.

250
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:41,702
You need to be making the game better.

251
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,779
And so if box products are in the business of over-delivery,

252
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,342
live service is the business of constant delivery.

253
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,704
And to provide that constant delivery to players,

254
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,546
you need to be fast.

255
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,988
You need to be as fast as your organization can possibly be.

256
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,891
And so at Bungie, one of the key lessons that we codified here

257
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:10,376
to shift our mindset is that velocity is more important than position.

258
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,866
Like your position is your game's quality right now.

259
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:15,886
How good is it?

260
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,327
What issues does it have?

261
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,248
How much content does it have to engage your players?

262
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,429
And these are all important questions,

263
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,370
but so much more important for us now

264
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,832
is how fast can you change that position?

265
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,773
If your players need more content,

266
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,094
how fast can you funnel it into your game?

267
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,315
If your game has an unbalanced meta,

268
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,356
how long does it stay unbalanced?

269
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,183
And if your community has a valid complaint,

270
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,983
how quickly can you respond to that complaint?

271
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:54,966
And this is why in this important but unintuitive way,

272
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,947
I'd rather have fast than perfect.

273
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:03,208
Because being perfect, even just being great,

274
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,068
is your current position.

275
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,029
But fast is your velocity.

276
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,849
And a fast game will become great.

277
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:16,990
But a great slow game will very quickly fall behind.

278
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:22,111
So, let's tease apart a tangible example for us at Bungie.

279
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,872
This shift in our mindset to focus on velocity

280
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,612
has meant that for our future games that we're building,

281
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:33,773
we mentally shift a lot of our focus away from the launch of the product.

282
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:39,005
Because all of our industry experience and training, all that box product training,

283
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,127
has us traditionally laser focused from day one

284
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,308
on having the best possible game on the day it launches.

285
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,889
That's what you're losing sleep over.

286
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:49,331
It's like, what's going to happen when we finally get to launch day?

287
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,073
But if you're trying to make a live service...

288
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:57,079
We found you should actually kind of de-emphasize that launch in your mind.

289
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:02,763
Like a much more important question is what is your roadmap and release tools

290
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:06,906
going to look like for the first year after your game launches?

291
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,270
Because you can launch with a game that blows people's minds and is super high

292
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,473
polish, or you can launch with a game that has lots of promise, but a bunch of

293
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,655
like janky issues on day one.

294
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:27,830
And the sifter that's going to determine which of those two games is relevant 12, 24 months later is their velocity.

295
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:29,724
How many updates came out?

296
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:32,925
How much better was the game getting each month?

297
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:38,586
Because that is what builds and retains fans in 2022.

298
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,747
And if you're optimizing for that, then the position that you're in

299
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:47,088
on the day you release becomes less and less relevant,

300
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:52,250
because it's just one beat among many on your way towards a perfect game.

301
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,790
And the reality is, like...

302
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,110
If you try to launch a new live service game in the 2020s,

303
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,892
it's kind of like that Pixar quote,

304
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:05,035
a simple fact is your game is probably going to suck at launch.

305
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,577
And that's OK.

306
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:10,640
Launch is not the end of your journey.

307
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,302
Launch is the beginning.

308
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:17,785
No new game, iterated on in secret for however many years,

309
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:22,517
can show up and immediately beat the existing live services

310
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:25,018
that have had the advantage of being able to iterate

311
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:28,319
directly with their community for five or ten years.

312
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,160
You don't get to win that battle on day one.

313
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,042
But if you're focused on your velocity, not your position at launch,

314
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,883
then the better challenge becomes how fast can you improve your game

315
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:43,825
once you are in that same direct dialogue with your community?

316
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,746
How quickly can you change your existing roadmap?

317
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,285
if you find something in the live game?

318
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,868
Can you deploy weekly patches, daily patches?

319
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:55,190
If you have a major exploit in your game,

320
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,733
can you identify the issue, then triage it,

321
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,296
test it and deploy a hotfix in 24 hours?

322
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,299
Because if you're focused on those kinds of challenges,

323
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,601
building up that velocity before you launch,

324
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:13,024
instead of just focusing on your position at launch.

325
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:17,750
then your game will get to perfect with shocking speed.

326
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,332
And you'll be making a game that is perfectly tailored

327
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:23,674
to your community and built to last.

328
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:29,238
So a bunch of this, like, the big cultural hurdle

329
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,460
for our team and our organization,

330
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,942
one of the main things that I'm going to keep returning to

331
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:38,504
is about redefining success.

332
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,246
Like, what does quality mean to you?

333
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,198
and to your team.

334
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,139
And I don't just mean in terms of business goals,

335
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,120
like KPIs or something.

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,061
I mean in your bones,

337
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,542
like in your heart,

338
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:55,464
why do you get up and go to work making video games every day?

339
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,785
And for us at Bungie, for a lot of us,

340
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:03,468
it used to mean that feeling of seeming perfect,

341
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,170
of being impeccable, being uncriticizable.

342
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,171
That is all part of that box product mindset.

343
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:15,125
But now, we're instead focused on being fast.

344
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,986
And the really, really tough part here, though,

345
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:22,588
is that to do that, you have to get

346
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,749
comfortable with public failure.

347
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,191
Like, you have to get comfortable with all

348
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:31,292
those failures and those iterations,

349
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:34,533
that journey from your game sucking to it being great,

350
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:37,815
more of that happening out in the open

351
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,556
instead of in secret at your studio.

352
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,804
And this trade-off is worth making, like it gives you speed.

353
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:50,546
It lets you feedback and iterate and get better faster.

354
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,488
It makes the final product even better.

355
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,609
But you have to be willing to take those lumps,

356
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,852
which are a lot if your ego like ours,

357
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:03,113
if your definition of success as an artist

358
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,255
is tied up in that mystique

359
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:08,736
of only letting your failure happen in secret.

360
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,425
To give one more example in this space,

361
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,766
broader than just developing a game,

362
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:20,069
I believe this shift to an ongoing service-oriented

363
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:23,890
iterative conversation is happening in every sector.

364
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:25,691
Even with people's personal brands.

365
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:29,193
This is why you're seeing so many more public apologies

366
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:32,395
from corporations, from celebrities, whomever.

367
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,376
It's more and more of that failure,

368
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,398
just like we had on Destiny, happening out in the open.

369
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,683
And in success, it means by embracing this service mindset,

370
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:47,284
you're getting to a better position even faster

371
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,705
through that feedback, through that critique,

372
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,526
and that extra transparency.

373
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:55,007
That's honestly, I think, not optional anymore

374
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,268
to any highly visible brand.

375
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:02,250
All right, so that was our first big learning,

376
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,572
that velocity is more important than position.

377
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,222
For the next part, I'm going to dive in deeper into what it means

378
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,744
to really redefine success.

379
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:21,827
Like I was saying about the halo days, when you're really successful,

380
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:26,730
it's really easy to not bother with a precise definition here.

381
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:30,392
And I'd wager that for most people in this room,

382
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:34,755
you probably define success as some combination of two things.

383
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:38,440
whatever your chosen version of quality is,

384
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,361
like that could be Steam user reviews

385
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:44,202
or Game of the Year awards or Metacritic.

386
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,942
I don't know, do people still use Metacritic?

387
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:46,782
I'm old.

388
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,183
But whatever that definition of quality is,

389
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:53,924
mixed with some definition of reach,

390
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,085
like that could be financial success,

391
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,625
it could be unit sales,

392
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:00,266
or it could just be how culturally impactful

393
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:03,747
or big your game is with your chosen audience.

394
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,310
But in order to adopt a service mindset,

395
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:11,571
we've had to get a lot better at defining

396
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:16,333
multiple axes of success and doing that very precisely.

397
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,514
So let me start with our first tangible example.

398
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:24,095
This was when we really started learning to break apart and be

399
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:26,235
more precise with our definitions.

400
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,956
So remember this terrifying moment

401
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,796
I was talking about in February of 2018.

402
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:40,754
At the time, living through it felt like a stressful, real-life version of FTL,

403
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:41,895
if you've ever played that game.

404
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:44,737
Like, if your engine room is on fire

405
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:48,241
and your O2 is draining out through a hull breach

406
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,742
and your shields are down,

407
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,466
which of those is most important to fix first?

408
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,109
Because if you get it wrong, your ship's going to explode.

409
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,992
And the mantra that we came up with during that difficult year

410
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:09,417
was first trust, then retention, then revenue.

411
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:15,300
And we realized that our first priority was player trust.

412
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,023
Because we'd assumed when we built Destiny 2

413
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:24,206
that players who ran out of content would just happily leave

414
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,808
and come back for the next expansion.

415
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:29,972
But what they were actually doing once they ran out

416
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,473
was they were sticking around in all of our online communities

417
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,814
with these megaphones shouting to everyone

418
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,055
to avoid this game because it sucked.

419
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:42,196
And this was especially bad with streamers and influencers

420
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,737
because we had literally hurt their livelihood

421
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:49,459
by making streaming Destiny a less viable profession.

422
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,339
So they were loudly and like understandably

423
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,720
shouting their complaints to every viewer.

424
00:24:56,135 --> 00:25:00,079
And so we knew that we needed to solve these trust issues first.

425
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,601
So we focused a lot of our early work

426
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,083
on trying to repair our reputation with our players

427
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:09,046
and our community and our influencers.

428
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,608
We bumped to the top of our priority queue

429
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:14,130
several early changes to the game,

430
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,812
not because our designers believed

431
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,554
that these were the most important root causes

432
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:20,735
to our engagement issues,

433
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:24,532
but because they were vocal pain points in the community

434
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:28,534
and addressing them quickly would clearly indicate

435
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,095
that we were listening and we were responding

436
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,255
to our player community and we were just trying

437
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:34,536
to do our best.

438
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:39,429
And this trust battle took us almost a full year,

439
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:40,789
if I'm being honest.

440
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,010
And that's also when we did stuff like

441
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,451
we removed all of the microtransactions

442
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,092
from some of our releases in that year,

443
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,493
taking multi-million dollar losses in the process

444
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,395
because the risk of losing more trust

445
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,715
was so much worse at the time

446
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:58,116
than the known loss in revenue.

447
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:02,620
And the reason that we were able to eat that revenue loss

448
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:06,023
was because we knew that revenue wasn't the goal yet.

449
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,466
Trust was. Revenue can come later.

450
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:14,210
And then once we had player trust and sentiment under control,

451
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,012
we then focused on retention.

452
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:21,596
And this was the real focus of our first major expansion

453
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:22,717
after Destiny 2 launched.

454
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:29,485
Forsaken. Forsaken's product focus, more than any other specific goal for that release,

455
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:36,489
was to fix the endgame for Destiny 2. To fix our retention and to ensure that there were

456
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:43,372
plenty of long-term pursuits and content in Destiny 2 for our most hardcore players.

457
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:51,044
And this focus allowed the product to succeed.

458
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,006
Not just succeed in being a great expansion, which it was,

459
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:59,528
but being the expansion that Destiny 2 needed

460
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:01,749
at that moment in time as a service.

461
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,410
And it worked.

462
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,713
So, this was that terrifying moment in February of 2018,

463
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,996
but by the time Forsaken launched one year in,

464
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,758
our brand trust was back on track.

465
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:20,401
Our retention had recovered from that precipitous drop

466
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,122
after D2 launch.

467
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:28,807
And only after we had solved for trust and solved for retention,

468
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:33,110
did we then actually start paying attention to the business again.

469
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,144
That was when we started experimenting with revenue innovation

470
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:39,827
that we knew would ultimately be player wins,

471
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:41,229
but were complex,

472
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,874
and we knew that they needed to be built off of a foundation of trust.

473
00:27:45,294 --> 00:27:48,819
So, that was when we started charting our course to get out of loot boxes.

474
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,100
or move our sword of direct purchase.

475
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,482
That's also when we started to add a free-to-play entry point into our game.

476
00:27:56,522 --> 00:28:01,443
These were all designed to further sustain the long-term Destiny hobby,

477
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:04,965
and I think they've made our game better for all players.

478
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,966
But to go back to that FTL analogy,

479
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:11,567
it would be suicide to be messing with our shields

480
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,428
when our O2 systems were down.

481
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:18,244
And I truly believe that each of these different releases

482
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:21,286
along this road would not have succeeded

483
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:25,729
if we didn't have clear laser focus each time

484
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,752
on what our specific goals and definition of success were.

485
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:32,254
And importantly, these goals,

486
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,016
they change from release to release.

487
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:39,499
So that was a really simple example,

488
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,420
three definitions of success,

489
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:44,042
layering them on one at a time.

490
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:48,827
As we've iterated since then, it gets more and more nuanced

491
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:53,549
because we keep trying to build more and more precise definitions of success.

492
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:00,092
So, for a more recent example, here's one of our typical KPI report cards.

493
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:02,793
I pulled this straight from one of our internal presentations

494
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:03,953
not too long ago.

495
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,177
KPI means Key Performance Indicator.

496
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:11,560
It's quantifiable measurements of performance

497
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:15,264
that we measure against a defined target we set ahead of time.

498
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:19,307
And we call it a report card because while every release

499
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:22,850
might have their own unique metrics that we want to measure,

500
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,032
so like for example in the Witch Queen,

501
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,714
we released the new glaive weapon.

502
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:30,037
So we have a metric for like how many people are using the glaive weapon.

503
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,398
Those are unique per release.

504
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:38,316
This report card is the baseline grades that every release is going to get no matter what.

505
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:44,440
And it gives us a common language to define and discuss success every time.

506
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:50,244
So let me talk through what our KPI report card looks like and what each of these different

507
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:51,105
measurements mean to us.

508
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,086
So first up.

509
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,407
We have that trust in Bungie, trust in our game,

510
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:58,688
and we measure it in two ways.

511
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:00,948
One is vocal sentiment.

512
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:06,289
So what are people saying about us online, on social media, on Twitch?

513
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,590
And vocal sentiment is super important because that's your reputation.

514
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,791
That is what people say you are,

515
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:19,232
but it's also often distorted by a small vocal minority.

516
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:21,053
There's a few people who talk a lot

517
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,933
and a lot of people who have an opinion and don't talk very much.

518
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:31,055
So to get beyond that vocal minority, we also do our own weekly surveys of player happiness

519
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,816
using a rate last week metric.

520
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:40,157
So we randomly reach out to, I think, a few thousand folks every week, and we ask them

521
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:44,418
to rate the last week of Destiny on a one to five point scale.

522
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:46,803
And we've tried some different systems here,

523
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:49,704
like we've done more subjective measurements of quality,

524
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,805
we've done net promoter scores,

525
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:54,126
but we've found that that rate last week

526
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:59,309
hits that sweet spot for us of rapid, precise data

527
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,230
that we can quantify about player happiness.

528
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,172
If you release an amazing live event,

529
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,093
you can know the very next week

530
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,673
if your players are happy about it.

531
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,674
Or if you do something terrible and you break something,

532
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:11,995
you can know immediately

533
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,776
if your players are unhappy about it.

534
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,862
And so between the two of these, you

535
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:21,165
can get a good week over week trending of both what players

536
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:23,947
think of your game and what they're

537
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:26,488
saying they think of your game.

538
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:29,110
And both of those are interesting and different data

539
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,931
points about player trust.

540
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:35,895
So next up, we have the lifeblood

541
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,996
of our game, our engagement.

542
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,179
And our primary metric for this is our average DAU,

543
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,220
so average daily active users.

544
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:48,220
How big is our community that is willing to show up and play each day?

545
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,921
And you can measure your active users daily, weekly, or monthly.

546
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,443
There's interesting nuance there and different learnings

547
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:59,064
that you can pull from each of those different types of measurements.

548
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:03,246
But for our report cards, we like DAU because it's not very latent.

549
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,967
You can get new DAU scores every single day.

550
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:13,131
And while DAU is ultimately one of the best indicators of health for us as a franchise,

551
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:14,872
it's kind of like our blood pressure.

552
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:18,895
Like it's super important, but it's not very actionable on its own.

553
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:23,398
To try to impact DAU, we have to go one layer deeper.

554
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:28,682
So DAU is ultimately a function of really just how many players are coming into your game each week

555
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,523
and how many players are leaving it.

556
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:31,904
You funnel in, funnel out.

557
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,751
And so we measure this through new players,

558
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:39,612
so brand new accounts that are created on a given week,

559
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:42,673
our weekly return rate,

560
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:45,194
so these are players that played last week

561
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,155
and have returned this week to play again,

562
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:50,936
and then win back.

563
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,577
So these are players who did not play last week

564
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:56,397
but played at some point in the past.

565
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,998
It could have been two weeks ago, it could have been five years ago,

566
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,959
but for whatever laps they've returned to us.

567
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:08,338
And you put these factors together, and then you can see pretty easily your funnel in and funnel out of players.

568
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:14,144
And importantly, each of these KPIs are going to be pushed differently.

569
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:21,090
Like, the type of content that typically causes your engaged players to stick around, that raises your return rate.

570
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,692
is going to be really different from the type of content

571
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,134
that's going to cause new players to show up.

572
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:30,697
And this is where getting higher granularity

573
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:33,038
in how you're defining success for a given feature,

574
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:36,241
a piece of content, or a release gets really important.

575
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,945
So, finally, beyond our blood pressure,

576
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,527
we've got the revenue that we're trying to accomplish,

577
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:49,610
made up both in unit sales and in microtransactions.

578
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:54,986
And importantly here, while we're tracking revenue daily with these report cards,

579
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,727
we aren't actually optimizing for revenue.

580
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:01,729
Because it would be easy to make decisions

581
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:04,290
that temporarily spiked our revenue,

582
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,211
but were very bad for the long-term health of our game.

583
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:13,513
And that's why we focus a lot more on our trust and our retention scores

584
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,274
than just on our revenue scores.

585
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,361
All right, so we're gathering this data.

586
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:22,423
We're bundling it up in these report cards.

587
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:25,347
But the data only matters if you're doing something with it.

588
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,650
And so the remaining step for us is about validating

589
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:32,394
our hypotheses and really unpacking and learning

590
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,196
from this data each release.

591
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:38,665
So we have three main ways that we use this data.

592
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,467
They each have different levels of latency.

593
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:45,089
They range from very rapid and timely use of the data

594
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:48,971
to very thoroughly analyzed but delayed.

595
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:57,516
So the lowest latency access.

596
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,538
is all these KPIs have dashboards that are live updated

597
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:05,740
and they're visible to our whole studio every day.

598
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,262
We have them up in the kitchens in our offices,

599
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:10,723
and if you're remote, you can log in

600
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:12,524
and you can see them directly in your browser.

601
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,206
And this was like a meaningful cultural shift

602
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,267
because we're talking about live updating

603
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,428
and displaying all of our core metrics,

604
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,689
including our business metrics about stuff like revenue,

605
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,890
to the whole team.

606
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,424
But what this means is that at a glance,

607
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:29,446
anyone in our studio who's trying to make a decision

608
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:32,507
about something they're building can see how we're trending

609
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:35,729
against our KPIs for the year, for the week,

610
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:36,850
or for the given release,

611
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,591
and that data is updated every single day.

612
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,435
We then do what we call live ops reviews

613
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:46,996
of this data every two weeks.

614
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,998
So we dissect the performance of the last two weeks

615
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:51,958
of our game with the team.

616
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:55,818
And importantly, the audience here for these LiveOps reviews

617
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:58,920
is not just like our PMs or analytics.

618
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,142
We try to get all of our feature leads,

619
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:04,723
like all of our design directors, our art leads,

620
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,025
anyone who's making creative decisions about the product

621
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:11,987
to prioritize attending these meetings every two weeks.

622
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:16,149
Because in these meetings, besides going over our report cards,

623
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:20,591
we do deep dives into specific, timely topics in the game.

624
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:24,719
So like as a recent example, we just launched the Witch Queen,

625
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:26,180
what has it been, like a month?

626
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Something about a month ago.

627
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:31,323
And we launched our first legendary campaign with the Witch Queen.

628
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:35,325
So this was a hard mode that you could opt into and play

629
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:36,265
instead of the normal mode.

630
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,247
And so two weeks after that launch, in our LiveOps review,

631
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:43,509
we did a deep dive on how that legendary mode feature performed

632
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,671
and how many players engaged with it, how many of them completed it.

633
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,252
We could have that conversation with the whole team

634
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:50,713
just a couple weeks after launch.

635
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:56,806
And what this means is that we can try different creative experiments like that

636
00:36:57,306 --> 00:37:01,669
and validate them three, four times across different releases.

637
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,153
And our creatives then get to develop a much more intuitive understanding

638
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:12,877
of what kinds of creative approaches are going to yield the results that they want.

639
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:20,679
And finally, we have these large two-hour lecture-style recaps

640
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,540
that we do at the end of every season,

641
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,982
where we recap the all-up performance of every aspect of a season

642
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,804
or an expansion release several months after it's gone live.

643
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:34,506
And this is where we get the most in-depth analysis,

644
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:37,367
but it's also where we have the most latency,

645
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:40,869
because we spend several months building these presentations

646
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:44,050
and consolidating our analysis.

647
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,252
But we then present these in our theater,

648
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:51,316
and we record them and put them all up on our streaming portal

649
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,118
for any employee to watch.

650
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,480
So this picture was from one of our pre-COVID sessions.

651
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,761
That's why we're not wearing masks.

652
00:37:58,681 --> 00:37:58,841
But...

653
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:02,626
They're basically our college-level courses

654
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:05,447
on learning the destiny business.

655
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,488
And they've become a great entry point for any employee

656
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,769
to start understanding how their work

657
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,951
is going to impact our players at scale.

658
00:38:18,312 --> 00:38:19,733
And so what this all drives to,

659
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:23,374
what we're trying to accomplish with this nuanced definition of success

660
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:27,336
is to start doing data-informed design.

661
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,725
And importantly, it's not data-driven.

662
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:34,446
We are not putting any guardrails on our creative process

663
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,087
or our team's vision.

664
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:39,169
We regularly try radical new experiments

665
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,990
that veer far away from our existing data,

666
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,711
that veer away from our standard formula.

667
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:49,137
Like a recent example, we, in last December, we released a 30th anniversary pack.

668
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:54,283
And that was a very different product from anything we had built in the last several years

669
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:58,788
that was driven, like the definition of that product was driven by the creative passion

670
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:04,735
of the team and how they wanted to celebrate 30 years of Bungie more really than anything else.

671
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,471
But even when we take those big swings,

672
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:11,954
when we're guided by that creative vision,

673
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:15,456
those creators then get to be scientists.

674
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,639
What we do is we try something new,

675
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,361
but ahead of time, we predict what we think is gonna happen.

676
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,364
We then take those predictions and quantify them,

677
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:27,565
and then finally, after we release,

678
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:31,448
we validate whether those results matched our predictions.

679
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,791
And almost every release through this process,

680
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:38,992
we get at least one just like shocking

681
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:42,173
and surprising result back that totally violates

682
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:45,494
our expectations and our hypotheses of our game.

683
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:50,175
And I love when this happens because that's when I know

684
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:51,575
that we're really learning.

685
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:53,996
Like that's when I know that we're honing our craft.

686
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:56,456
We're discovering something that's true.

687
00:39:57,217 --> 00:40:00,339
about destiny or something that's true about our community

688
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,362
that didn't fit any of our shared conventional wisdom

689
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,546
up until that moment. And as a result, we're becoming better designers,

690
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,687
becoming better artists and creators.

691
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,392
Okay, so we've talked about velocity, we've talked about data.

692
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:21,255
The third major way that I want to talk about redefining success

693
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,437
is in the product itself.

694
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,928
And the way we talk about this mindset shift internally

695
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:31,350
is you're building a train station, not a train.

696
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:35,713
So if you think about that box product mindset

697
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:41,077
as building the most impressive, fast, luxurious new train

698
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,437
that the world has ever seen,

699
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:46,480
you're pouring over the details of the trim in every cabin,

700
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,642
the friction on the wheels, everything to make that train

701
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:51,703
the most amazing thing the world has ever seen.

702
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:57,251
And you probably have some sort of intense push at the end of the project.

703
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:00,514
It could be a targeted crunch or it could just be extra focus

704
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:02,436
where all anyone is thinking about

705
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:07,101
is how to get those last few steps to release to a gold master,

706
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:10,064
to a final perfectly polished experience.

707
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,647
But as a live service,

708
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:17,711
what we're actually building is a train station.

709
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:20,994
And the moment that that train has departed,

710
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:22,856
you have another one arriving.

711
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,938
And in fact, the track probably needs

712
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,160
to be cleared for that next train

713
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:29,763
before the previous one has even departed.

714
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,067
So this, to put it visually,

715
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:41,075
this was what our release schedule looked like,

716
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:41,955
a development schedule.

717
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,482
during Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 development.

718
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:48,482
So we released Destiny 1, we built a couple expansions,

719
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:51,583
one after another for Destiny 1, and then in parallel,

720
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,584
we were building Destiny 2 and eventually released that.

721
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:56,424
But otherwise, it's a fairly straight shot.

722
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:00,365
We were building trains in this model.

723
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,126
But this is what our release schedule looks like today.

724
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:10,568
And so at any given moment, we have five to six releases

725
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,468
in various stages of development.

726
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:15,265
And we're not a significantly larger team

727
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,766
than we were when we were shipping Destiny 2.

728
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,547
Like this hasn't been a dramatic scale up in team size,

729
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:25,668
but it has been a dramatic scale up in schedule complexity,

730
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:29,129
year over year with largely the same team.

731
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,871
And what comes with that increased complexity

732
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:36,532
is yet another redefinition of what success looks like.

733
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:41,697
Because success for a great train station means predictability.

734
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,919
It means scheduling rigor.

735
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:48,082
It means no one should be doing any heroics.

736
00:42:50,424 --> 00:42:54,528
There's this great, I don't know, maybe it's apocryphal Miyamoto quote,

737
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:57,850
that a delayed game is eventually good,

738
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,812
but a bad game is bad forever.

739
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,632
But we found that once you're in a train station mindset,

740
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:08,557
you actually need to have almost the completely opposite approach.

741
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:13,022
Because a delayed train doesn't just hurt that train,

742
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:18,527
it potentially causes cascade failure and chaos in the entire station.

743
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:23,793
Whereas the reality is today a bad game can be fixed.

744
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:28,198
And I hope you all are hearing the point that I'm trying to make here.

745
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:30,478
I'm not trying to dunk on Miyamoto.

746
00:43:30,518 --> 00:43:33,999
I'm not trying to say that quality isn't important.

747
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,440
But like that earlier point about velocity,

748
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,481
it's that you don't get the quality on a service through perfectionism

749
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:46,962
or through heroics and overextending yourself in any one given moment.

750
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,963
That is train thinking.

751
00:43:49,423 --> 00:43:50,443
It's not station thinking.

752
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:54,964
Instead, you get to quality one train at a time.

753
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,521
Like, our seasons in Destiny right now are the best they've ever been.

754
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,022
I think that's a safe statement that our community would agree with.

755
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:05,802
So are our expansions right now, the best they've ever been.

756
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,243
And the reality is our seasons got there

757
00:44:08,263 --> 00:44:10,724
a fair bit quicker than our expansions did,

758
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:13,744
despite our seasons being under tighter schedule constraints

759
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,805
with less room to, like, iterate and polish.

760
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,786
And so do you know why they got there faster?

761
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:22,966
Because right now we're on season 16.

762
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,701
We've been able to iterate so many times

763
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:29,942
as train after train passes through that station

764
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:32,303
to get to where we are today.

765
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:36,184
But that also means that to keep the station running,

766
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:39,405
you need to let trains go out the door

767
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,427
that carry risk on them that you might not be comfortable with,

768
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:48,568
or that have things that you know could be just like a little bit better

769
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,870
if you just backed up the train station just for a couple weeks

770
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,630
and did a heroic savings throw.

771
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:59,519
And we've had to learn painfully not to do that

772
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:02,299
because that only makes things worse.

773
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:13,303
So a tangible example that we found here is with crunch

774
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:18,004
because now a truism that we have at Bungie

775
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:22,545
is that on a live service, you're either never crunching

776
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:27,040
or you're always crunching.

777
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,842
Because if you put in that crunch level effort,

778
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,443
even when it's just individuals choosing it for themselves

779
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,923
from their own passion,

780
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:36,824
you overextend yourself,

781
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:39,165
you burn down your stamina bar.

782
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,786
But unlike those big box products that we used to build,

783
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:46,188
where you could roll from that release with a low stamina bar

784
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,889
into some early pre-production and concept phase

785
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:51,130
where you get to recharge,

786
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:55,106
In a trained station, you are rolling from that release

787
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:57,948
straight into another high-pressure release

788
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:58,868
in the middle of production.

789
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:03,531
You don't get a chance to recover from any overextensions.

790
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:07,373
If you spent an extra week closing that last release,

791
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:11,176
you've just lost a week on your next release

792
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:12,556
and you're already behind.

793
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:20,566
And so in basically every case, we've seen overextension create cascading debt,

794
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,989
where you're transferring that debt from one credit card to the next,

795
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:26,570
getting further and further behind.

796
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:33,299
And we see that with schedule delays, we see that with crunch,

797
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:35,100
we see that with any kind of pressure,

798
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,462
just building and getting worse and worse each release.

799
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,605
And that is what we mean by that road

800
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:44,507
leading on a service to always crunching.

801
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:48,570
And the only way that we've been able to combat that is with rigor.

802
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:53,030
It's with dismantling the whole idea of heroics,

803
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,572
that leave it all on the field final push to close a project

804
00:46:57,592 --> 00:46:59,513
that we've all felt in the past.

805
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,073
And we have to kind of get rid of that mindset

806
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:06,315
and instead just be disciplined, be constrained,

807
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:10,236
operate in a way that you know can be repeated

808
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:13,157
sustainably and consistently every release.

809
00:47:13,817 --> 00:47:16,698
That is the train station mindset.

810
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:21,115
And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we've perfected this.

811
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:22,959
I'm talking about the mindset here,

812
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,070
the recognition that if you allow even a little bit of overextension,

813
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:30,481
to creep onto your teams or onto your project,

814
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,124
it's going to cascade and it's going to build release after release.

815
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,765
We've seen it happen over and over.

816
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:39,848
And so the reality on the team is this is a constantly ongoing battle.

817
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:44,272
We don't catch every case on every team, but with every new release,

818
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:48,516
we are trying to constantly proactively identify

819
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:50,697
where our teams are overextending themselves.

820
00:47:51,258 --> 00:47:52,818
Whether this could be through their own passion

821
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:55,759
or it could be through feature overscoping,

822
00:47:56,299 --> 00:47:59,399
but regardless, we try to actively help each team member

823
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:01,180
to learn this lesson

824
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,400
so they can ultimately get onto that never-crunching path

825
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,521
because you don't want to be on the other path.

826
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:14,902
And so here's the last almost painful realization for us about train stations.

827
00:48:15,442 --> 00:48:17,802
So remember back when I said that box products

828
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:19,563
are in the business of over-delivery.

829
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:25,546
Overdelivery is actually dangerous for a train station.

830
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:28,747
With every release that you put out there,

831
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:32,848
you're setting a pattern for your community and for your players.

832
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:36,349
And so if we release an expansion with two raids, let's say,

833
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:40,650
next year our community is going to be upset

834
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,751
if we go back to only one raid.

835
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:46,752
We've hurt the station by making a rogue decision

836
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:48,552
on just one of the trains to overdeliver.

837
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:54,239
But at the same time, and this is why this lesson is painful to us,

838
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,247
is because so much of quality and delight in our craft

839
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,689
comes from over-delivery, right?

840
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,076
It comes from giving folks stuff above and beyond what they expected.

841
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,276
And we still want to do that.

842
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:12,961
We still want to surprise and delight and sometimes even overwhelm our players.

843
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:17,325
But we need to be mindful of the patterns that we're creating,

844
00:49:17,405 --> 00:49:22,009
the implied future commitments that we've set for ourselves each time.

845
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:25,472
And this is tough, like this is honestly one of the ones

846
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:27,733
that we're still grappling the hardest with,

847
00:49:28,354 --> 00:49:31,095
because it's hard to tell a team,

848
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:34,556
a team that has extra cycles and they have energy

849
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:36,016
and they want to do something amazing

850
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:37,157
and they know how to do it,

851
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:40,118
and it totally would be amazing and awesome for the game.

852
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,399
Sometimes we have to tell them, like,

853
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,600
we shouldn't ship this because it's an over delivery

854
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,481
that is going to set us up for failure on future trains.

855
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:55,378
And to paint it in a more positive, more proactive light,

856
00:49:55,899 --> 00:49:57,601
the lesson that we're still learning is that

857
00:49:58,442 --> 00:50:01,305
everything we deliver needs to be a blueprint.

858
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:06,352
We need to understand how the blueprint will be repeated

859
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:10,016
and whether or not we can do that repeating sustainably.

860
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,190
And if we can't repeat the blueprint,

861
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,391
or if we don't want to,

862
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:17,755
we need to make sure that our delivery of that feature,

863
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:21,759
that content, sets up player expectations to match ours,

864
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,641
that the blueprint is not going to be repeated.

865
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:30,727
So like a good example of this recently was our legendary difficulty for our campaign.

866
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:35,609
That was a cornerstone feature of the Witch Queen and it's been really well received.

867
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:39,830
Like I think it really made that expansion better than our previous ones.

868
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,291
And it also was a meaningful step up in the amount of work that we had to do building a campaign

869
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:49,773
because we had two difficulty modes that were finally balanced for every single mission.

870
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:55,335
And we knew that going in, so we designed it as a blueprint

871
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:58,737
and we weren't just worried about whether we could ship the Witch Queen,

872
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:01,078
we were worried about can we ship this blueprint

873
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,780
and repeat it in every future expansion,

874
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:08,363
which fortunately now we want to because it's a proven success.

875
00:51:10,885 --> 00:51:15,067
So, yeah, returning all the way back to this moment in 2018.

876
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:20,869
At the time, it felt like, it honestly felt like it could be the end for us.

877
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:27,050
Like for D2 altogether, but what it really was, was the inflection point

878
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,531
that was the beginning of us really understanding and embracing a live

879
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,311
service mindset.

880
00:51:33,731 --> 00:51:39,693
This was the inciting incident that led us to some big multi-year shifts in our

881
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:40,193
mindset.

882
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:44,534
This is what helped us solidify a bunch of these learnings that I've tried to

883
00:51:44,574 --> 00:51:45,294
walk through with y'all.

884
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:51,467
how your velocity is so much more important than your current position.

885
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:56,428
That to achieve that velocity, we have to get really comfortable

886
00:51:56,828 --> 00:52:00,229
with failing out in the open, in front of our players.

887
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:03,410
That when you're in a live service crisis,

888
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:07,370
prioritizing trust, then retention, then revenue,

889
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:09,371
could help you get out of it.

890
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:14,500
and that you need all of your designs and all of your creative decisions

891
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:19,144
to be data informed in nuanced and quantifiable ways.

892
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,348
And that we're building a train station, not a train,

893
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,571
which means that you need to stamp out crunch

894
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:29,793
and any other form of heroics

895
00:52:30,153 --> 00:52:32,014
that you're doing that overextends your team.

896
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:35,657
And to beware of overdelivery

897
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:38,920
that can cause future problems for your station.

898
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:44,826
And ultimately all of these mindset shifts, what they really boil down to

899
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:48,067
is redefining what success means,

900
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:52,729
what quality means for your entire team and culture.

901
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:56,910
And if you do that, I think that any organization

902
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,172
can make the transition from a storied history of great triple A box products

903
00:53:02,772 --> 00:53:05,353
into the future of live service.

904
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:11,513
So yeah, I hope that you've gotten some value out of the lessons

905
00:53:11,593 --> 00:53:12,833
that we had to learn in this space,

906
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:15,474
because we paid for every one of these lessons

907
00:53:15,894 --> 00:53:18,615
with a lot of scrapes, a lot of bruises, a lot of blood,

908
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,435
and a lot of soul searching.

909
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:22,396
And so I'm hoping that by sharing,

910
00:53:22,996 --> 00:53:26,997
you can get to that same destination with far fewer injuries.

911
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:33,594
And if you like what you heard, we'd love to have you on this learning journey with us,

912
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,115
building the future of live services at Bungie.

913
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:40,617
So we're hiring right now for almost every type of role imaginable.

914
00:53:40,657 --> 00:53:44,899
We have development, publishing from entry level to director level,

915
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:46,819
and we would love to speak with you.

916
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,701
So, yeah, thank you, everybody.

917
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,117
I think we've got about five minutes for Q&A,

918
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:03,521
if anyone has questions.

919
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:07,131
Thanks for the talk, that was really revealing,

920
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:07,633
appreciate it.

921
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:12,502
I appreciate any candor that you can offer for this specific question.

922
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:17,164
From the beginning, having a specific corporate partner

923
00:54:17,584 --> 00:54:20,945
to becoming fully independent and moving into having another big partner,

924
00:54:21,485 --> 00:54:24,026
how did these learnings all

925
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:28,968
collide with that in terms of what buy-in you had originally,

926
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:32,069
maybe, and then from there what changed in terms of this train station

927
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:36,430
metaphor as you became more independent and how that relates to

928
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:37,391
moving into a...

929
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,531
brand new partnership. Thank you.

930
00:54:40,412 --> 00:54:42,352
Yeah. I mean, I think I think most of

931
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:44,493
the manifestations of these learnings are not

932
00:54:45,053 --> 00:54:47,034
they're not at the green light phase. They're not

933
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:48,834
at the milestone phase. They're in the like

934
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:51,255
the day to day decisions that

935
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,396
everyone on your team is making culturally.

936
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:59,406
And so we found that if we can make that transition internally in our organization,

937
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:02,210
then we feel really confident that we can make something great.

938
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:06,795
We can convince anyone that it's going to be amazing,

939
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:09,358
whether that's our players or our partners or our parents.

940
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:12,686
Yeah, it's a great talk.

941
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:18,008
I'm a little curious about your overall sense in the shift of the industry towards live ops.

942
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:23,090
I feel like a lot of games are slowly becoming the live ops kind of model of things.

943
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,772
And until you get to live ops, you just kind of keep going for it until you get there.

944
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:28,213
So I'm just curious, right?

945
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:31,874
You're well known for a lot of different games and expansions and sequels.

946
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:33,795
Now we're in a live ops mode.

947
00:55:33,815 --> 00:55:36,876
Do you see that as like a future for the next decade or so?

948
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:38,577
Yeah, I mean, I think.

949
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:45,886
I think if you're trying to make a game that builds a community that sticks around,

950
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,147
then I think it's worth thinking of it as a live service.

951
00:55:48,187 --> 00:55:49,328
Like no matter what type of game you're making.

952
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:53,170
You could be making a rogue-like 8-bit indie game,

953
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,091
but if you're planning to release that indie access,

954
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:58,093
like early access, and iterate and build a community,

955
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:00,074
I think you can still think of that as a live service.

956
00:56:00,134 --> 00:56:03,095
It's got the same lessons about your velocity mattering.

957
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:09,539
about needing to be in a constant dialogue with your players and being willing to fail publicly to learn faster.

958
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:15,904
Like I think all of those still apply if what you're trying to do is build and nurture a community over time.

959
00:56:16,264 --> 00:56:24,109
Maybe just as a quick follow up, based on your KPI, do you have a point where like live ops, this is where we would start to ramp down?

960
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:25,910
Have you thought about that far in the future?

961
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:32,430
Not anytime soon. We are very happy with where Destiny is and it is getting bigger each year.

962
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,510
Cool, thank you.

963
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,491
What's up man?

964
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:38,312
Yeah, thanks Justin for the talk. Really inspiring.

965
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:45,535
I have a question about the leadership and disciplinary directors and this new approach of the train station.

966
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:52,298
How you convince them in the company that it is a good way and how you recognize that they changed their mindset?

967
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,328
Sorry, can you help me understand the question a little better? What do you mean?

968
00:56:58,188 --> 00:57:02,651
Yeah, because for sure they have all the leads, the directors, you know,

969
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:08,594
they had this previous box mindset. Yeah. And then the conversion, the road, the new one.

970
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:11,934
Yeah, so like, let me give you an example.

971
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:15,117
We've found that there are things in the game that we could release

972
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:21,742
that might very briefly create some negative sentiment,

973
00:57:21,762 --> 00:57:23,224
but then that quickly rebounds as players,

974
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:25,065
because sometimes players just don't like change,

975
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:26,847
and then they understand the difference,

976
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:28,889
but they might be really great for the overall health of the game.

977
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:31,051
It causes people to show up more, to play more,

978
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:33,052
to ultimately long-term be happy.

979
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:37,858
we need to provide all of that data to our team

980
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:39,819
because if you don't provide all that data,

981
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:41,621
they're gonna see the sentiment side.

982
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:42,881
Like anyone can go on the internet

983
00:57:43,202 --> 00:57:44,543
and can see what your players are saying,

984
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:48,186
but if you don't know what the silent majority are thinking,

985
00:57:48,226 --> 00:57:49,927
if you don't know what's happening with engagement,

986
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:52,229
you're probably making the wrong decisions.

987
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:53,990
And so we try to make all of our leaders

988
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:57,733
like see that full picture of what success is

989
00:57:57,813 --> 00:58:00,955
so that they can balance those different axes.

990
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:07,212
Okay, maybe the second one, because you said about stamina, stamina and creativity.

991
00:58:07,472 --> 00:58:09,194
So everybody are boosted with those.

992
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:17,960
Yep. How do you know, have a control that they are all working the same direction, the same goals, release by release, train by train?

993
00:58:19,722 --> 00:58:20,222
Yeah, it's hard.

994
00:58:22,596 --> 00:58:26,481
It's hard because, I mean whatever, it's hard on any creative project to get everybody working the same direction.

995
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,787
It gets easier the more similar your blueprint is to something you've done before.

996
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:34,913
Like there's a lot of things that we release in our seasons that we know,

997
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:39,980
even though we're going to be creative on them, we know the rough size of the box and the shape and what it's supposed to look like.

998
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,842
And so we tend to focus when we build our creative pitches

999
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:45,823
on the differences.

1000
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,103
Like what are the ways in which we're gonna innovate

1001
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:50,084
and be different from our previous blueprints

1002
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:52,065
and then really focus our efforts

1003
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:53,886
on like aligning the team around those differences.

1004
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:55,736
Thanks.

1005
00:58:56,017 --> 00:58:56,497
Yeah, thank you.

1006
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:59,661
Hey, I'm aware of the time, so I'll be really quick.

1007
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,684
I'm a longtime Destiny player, and I love it.

1008
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,646
So thanks again for an amazing game.

1009
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:07,691
My question was really about some

1010
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,114
of those data-driven insights about the player community

1011
00:59:10,154 --> 00:59:10,455
itself.

1012
00:59:10,495 --> 00:59:11,977
Could you share any examples of the things

1013
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:13,779
that you said were surprising that you've learned?

1014
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:21,467
maybe from the 30th anniversary pack, which was way out there, very different experience.

1015
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:25,248
Here's one I'll give you. I'm not going to give you numbers, but

1016
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:32,510
the number of players who played the Legendary Campaign was shockingly higher than we expected.

1017
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:38,532
And even completed it. We expected it to be a narrow minority of players who would play it,

1018
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:42,914
but it had a very different uptake in our community than what we expected.

1019
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:44,994
That's great. No wonder.

1020
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:47,838
Thanks.

1021
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:50,505
I think let's do one more question, and then we're done.

1022
00:59:52,771 --> 00:59:53,733
Thank you for the great talk.

1023
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:54,495
Love, Destiny.

1024
00:59:54,764 --> 00:59:55,905
Thank you.

1025
00:59:56,405 --> 01:00:01,967
So when you're focusing on DAU and weekly AU,

1026
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,668
do you break down your audience kind of like by motivation?

1027
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:07,269
It's OK for this part of the audience

1028
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:09,250
to just like they care about the story.

1029
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,891
They're going to show up for a very short time per week

1030
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:13,011
to play through this story.

1031
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:16,272
Because how do you avoid the trap of focusing so much

1032
01:00:16,332 --> 01:00:18,973
on that you might burn out your players?

1033
01:00:19,774 --> 01:00:21,654
Because they feel like they always need to be engaged.

1034
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:22,615
They can't play anything else.

1035
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:29,351
Yeah, and that's kind of that distinction between engagement and sentiment and why we have to track them both.

1036
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:35,796
Because you can create toxic patterns where you motivate people to log in, but they get less and less happy about it.

1037
01:00:36,277 --> 01:00:39,500
And so when that happens, we see that show up in sentiment first,

1038
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,782
and then inevitably it's going to show up in your engagement too.

1039
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:43,003
Because eventually someone's going to be like,

1040
01:00:43,383 --> 01:00:45,565
I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I need to stop this.

1041
01:00:46,005 --> 01:00:48,707
But we usually catch that first on the sentiment side.

1042
01:00:48,727 --> 01:00:49,528
Okay.

1043
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,425
Even if there's no way to track it if they're being silent about it, if they just silently.

1044
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:57,969
Well, this sentiment on the silent side with like Ray last week,

1045
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:00,451
we're able to track even the players who aren't complaining.

1046
01:01:00,512 --> 01:01:02,313
We can see their interest waning over time.

1047
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,254
Okay, thanks.

1048
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:05,617
Yeah, so thank you everybody.
