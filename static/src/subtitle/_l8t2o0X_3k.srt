Hello and welcome to Sharing in Success, how to compensate your team through revenue sharing.

2
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:22,516
My name is Kellen Boyer.

3
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:28,179
I'm a video game lawyer with a practice focused on representing independent game studios.

4
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:33,071
And as part of this work, I'm frequently called on to create revenue sharing structures.

5
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,312
And what I've noticed throughout my time doing that,

6
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,113
is that there isn't a huge amount of understanding in the industry about

7
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:42,855
different types of revenue share structures that are available,

8
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:47,337
and as well some key considerations that they should be taking into account

9
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,978
when coming up with a revenue sharing structure.

10
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:54,800
So let's first start with what a revenue sharing structure is.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,664
It's a legal agreement, or it could be a corporate structure, where each person gets a percentage

12
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:02,765
of game profits.

13
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:07,448
So we're talking about each person who's involved in the development of a video game,

14
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:11,932
whether it's a coder or a sound person, gets a percentage of game profits.

15
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,253
And you wonder, what's the purpose of this?

16
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:15,114
What can it achieve?

17
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:19,056
I think it achieves two key purposes.

18
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:26,674
The first is that it incentivizes the development team by providing a chance to participate

19
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,415
in the game's success.

20
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:33,660
This is especially helpful if you're trying to recruit people to work on a game in a very

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,506
competitive job market by providing this additional financial incentive where they could earn

22
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:46,737
Theoretically, astronomically, more than a regular salary would be through a revenue share structure.

23
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:52,542
I think it really allows you to bring on key people with a lot of talent to work on your game.

24
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:55,504
So I think there's certainly an incentivization element here.

25
00:01:56,765 --> 00:02:00,768
Also though, and I think this is really important for independent game studios,

26
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:06,152
is that the revenue sharing structure helps decrease the studio's financial outlay

27
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:09,975
by supplementing immediate compensation with the revenue share.

28
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:17,586
The reality is, with a lot of our clients, that they don't have a huge amount of money

29
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,147
to put into the development team.

30
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:25,709
So they need to come up with a way to pay people what their market rate is, but to do

31
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,610
it in a different way than just straight cash.

32
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,751
And I think the revenue share obviously can come in and serve that purpose.

33
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,933
So if the studio is faced with someone...

34
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:40,139
who would like $50,000, which the studio maybe can't afford, then maybe it's $25,000 cash

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,602
with this 5% revenue share on top.

36
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:48,807
So the revenue share can come in and supplement what the studio could otherwise not afford

37
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:49,168
to pay.

38
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,390
So I think there is that second benefit.

39
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:56,447
And as I noted earlier, there's this chance of earning exponentially more through the

40
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:59,229
revenue share than an increase in salary anyway.

41
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:05,312
So together I think there's great value in these two purposes of a revenue share structure.

42
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:10,474
This incentivization, it can help with hiring, and then as well supplementing what the studio's

43
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:14,276
actual financial means are with the revenue share portion.

44
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,471
So what are these revenue sharing structures?

45
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:23,158
I consider there to be two common revenue sharing structures, but of course with an

46
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:26,482
asterisk I am a lawyer so there's always a qualification.

47
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,785
I think creativity is the limit.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,908
There's lots of permutations possible of these structures.

49
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:42,916
But even though our clients love to come up with incredibly complex structures almost all the time, simplicity is often easiest to create and understand.

50
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:47,038
And plus cheapest. Usually a lawyer is going to have to write a plan.

51
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:47,619
And so.

52
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,380
There's a cost component with the more complex structures anyway.

53
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:56,883
But I think simplicity is core here because you need to understand the plan and how it's administered,

54
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:02,085
but also people that are receiving it that you're trying to incentivize through the plan need to understand it as well.

55
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:08,308
So I think that simplicity is a really key guiding rule when you're coming up with any revenue share structure.

56
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:14,030
So let's talk about the two core types, the two common revenue sharing structures.

57
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:18,387
The first of which is the revenue sharing agreement.

58
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:22,329
The second, which is the same kind of structure

59
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,371
in the sense of you are distributing revenue,

60
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,633
but it's different in that it's equity-based revenue share.

61
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,155
So we'll talk about each of these now in turn,

62
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:33,096
and hopefully you'll have a better understanding

63
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,237
of what each involves.

64
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,599
So let's touch on the revenue share agreement.

65
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,282
This is a written agreement between the studio

66
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,783
and each developer.

67
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:49,491
where the studio agrees to pay a percentage of game profits to the developer.

68
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:55,194
And importantly, it takes the form of a royalty.

69
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:02,099
And these grants can be on a one-on-one basis,

70
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,480
or they can be done in a different way.

71
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,441
But let's look at the one-on-one.

72
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:10,184
In the one-on-one basis, it's going to be something along the lines of

73
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:11,545
following commercial release,

74
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:17,643
The company, the studio, will pay somebody, me in this case, a percentage of the game

75
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:18,704
net revenue.

76
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:27,214
Now we'll talk a bit about what net revenue means in a bit, but know that it can be on

77
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:27,975
a one-on-one basis.

78
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:40,259
Or it could be, as you saw in the slide I just skipped ahead to, or it can be based

79
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:41,561
on a set-aside pool.

80
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,303
And what do I mean by that?

81
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:49,573
The pool is a percentage of the game net revenue that's allocated among all the participants.

82
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:56,605
And if you visualize it this way, you take a percentage of the game revenue, say 15%,

83
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,226
and that's your hard cap.

84
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:04,270
That's the maximum amount of the game revenue that's being given away, distributed under

85
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,110
the revenue share.

86
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:10,514
And the pool, that's the 15%, is participated in by whoever you want that worked on the

87
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:10,774
game.

88
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:18,180
So you could have 20, 100 people in the pool, and they would all be participating in that 15%.

89
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:23,195
So an example of kind of pool language would be,

90
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:27,096
the company could allocate 15% of the game's net revenue

91
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:27,836
to the royalties.

92
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,496
That's kind of pool type language.

93
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,437
So which one works?

94
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,438
You have a revenue share agreement that's more one-on-one,

95
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,778
and you have a revenue share agreement that's a pool.

96
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,279
Which one would you want to consider

97
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,759
based on your particular studio?

98
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,800
I think if you have a small studio, up to five people,

99
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,820
that one-on-one, those individual grants,

100
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,601
I think that works.

101
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,301
But it does not work once you get.

102
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:55,281
to a larger team because you are going to lose track of the total percentage you are

103
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:55,922
giving away.

104
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,327
When you are doing 1-on-1 grants, you are not dealing with a hard fast and pooled cap

105
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,248
of let's say 15%.

106
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,773
Instead you are saying, Kellyanne gets 5, Julie gets 10, etc.

107
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:08,776
It's often easy to lose track of how much you are actually giving away.

108
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,598
And plus, it just becomes unmanageable.

109
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,799
If you have 20 team members, that's 20 separate agreements all trying to distribute 0.25.

110
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,859
It works so much better in a pool context.

111
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,220
So if you have that medium or large team, I think the pool is critical.

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,581
It's really the only structure, at least as compared to the individual grant,

113
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:32,882
that really can help accommodate multiple – lots of people, pardon me, participating in that revenue share.

114
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,991
And this revenue share structure is usually the simplest, but also the cheapest structure,

115
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,993
and as I noted, it's really the most common.

116
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,799
So what is this other structure?

117
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,081
The equity-based revenue sharing structure.

118
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:52,565
So you could do the agreement, we talked about that a moment ago, or you could do equity-based

119
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,246
revenue share.

120
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,589
And that means that the developers receive shares in a company.

121
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,689
And their shareholding percentage corresponds to their revenue share.

122
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,852
And instead of the revenue share being paid as a contractual royalty, as we talked about

123
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:11,975
in the case of the agreement, it actually takes the form of a dividend on the shares.

124
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,157
And I think here it's important maybe to describe what a dividend is.

125
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:19,080
A dividend is a distribution by the company.

126
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,467
I'll see you in the next video.

127
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,923
Let's multiply by the number of shares that you actually have.

128
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:39,706
And a key rule with dividends, and this plays out a bit later on in this presentation,

129
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:44,250
is that dividends must be the same for shares of the same class.

130
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,353
So if you have A shares and B shares, different classes of share,

131
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,816
you can say that the A shares get $1 and the B shares get $2 a share.

132
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:54,819
You cannot say that within the A shareholders,

133
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,522
Kellen gets $1 a share and Julie gets $10 a share.

134
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:03,025
You have to treat all shareholders of the same class the same in most legal jurisdictions.

135
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:08,249
And that plays out in how you have to structure these equity-based revenue shares.

136
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:14,207
Because you don't want to give someone a revenue share for a game they didn't work on.

137
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,268
How do you split them up?

138
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:20,692
How do you give out separate royalties or differing revenue shares to the different

139
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:21,272
participants?

140
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,296
And what you have to do is create a separate share class for each game.

141
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:30,460
So in a simple example, you could have common shares being owned by the founders, and then

142
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,544
Game 1 shares will be owned by the Game 1 devs, Game 2 shares by the Game 2 devs, etc.

143
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,890
And we'll talk a bit about sequels and stuff later on and DLC.

144
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,552
You can actually do subordinate series of game one shares, series of game two shares.

145
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,934
Sky's the limit, as I talked a bit earlier on the permutations.

146
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:55,056
But what you can recognize so far here is that it's complex and obviously it's going

147
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,176
to be costly to create.

148
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,628
I think it serves a purpose though, because it coexists nicely with raising investment

149
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:02,148
in the game.

150
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:08,250
And I'm not talking about publisher investment, that's never an equity-based investment, just

151
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:08,790
in advance.

152
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,631
I'm talking about investors that actually want to share in your company.

153
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,192
I think it can coexist nicely with raising investment in the game, because you could

154
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,453
issue Game 1 shares to people that invested in Game 1.

155
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:24,814
And those, when you declare a revenue of royalty, a distribution, pardon me, a dividend...

156
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,133
on those Game 1 shares, the investors would share along with the other Game 1 shareholders.

157
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,638
I think it's a great structure in that sense.

158
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:41,562
As you're gathering here and as I noted, it really is complex because you need to build

159
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:46,006
into the company's constituting documents into its certificate of incorporation if you're

160
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,469
in Delaware or its articles if you're in some Canadian provinces.

161
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,672
All of this language that would actually normally be in a revenue share agreement, how it's

162
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:57,235
calculated, how frequently it's paid, all of that.

163
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:01,478
You have to calculate all that but put all those calculations into these constituting

164
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:01,999
documents.

165
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,279
Thank you.

166
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:08,895
The form of more than one document that needs to be created internally within the company to achieve this.

167
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:15,277
So obviously complex, but I think it does serve that great purpose for investment.

168
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:19,358
As I said, it's rare. I do these maybe 5% of the time.

169
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:32,122
So now up to this point, we've talked about those two purposes, incentivization, we've talked about as well, supplementing what you could pay with your studio with the RevShare and the two types of structure. You can do the RevShare agreement.

170
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,156
Or, you know, it could be pooled one-on-one, or you could do an equity-based revenue share.

171
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,157
One pays a royalty, one pays a dividend.

172
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:46,962
But regardless of the structure, I consider there to be five key considerations you take

173
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:53,085
into account when figuring out how to structure these revenue share relationships.

174
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:57,328
The first is the percentage of game revenue to allocate.

175
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,549
And, you know, while I love to

176
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,741
To try to see if there's standards in the industry, I don't know if there's a standard

177
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:06,782
in the industry on this.

178
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:08,082
I think someone needs to do a study.

179
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:12,684
I've done studies on publishing agreement rev shares, but I've not done one yet on game

180
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:16,626
revenue percentage to allocate in a rev share structure.

181
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,888
So I can't say that there's a hard and fast rule.

182
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:20,968
This is what you should allocate.

183
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:24,571
But I think it's valuable to look at analogous structures.

184
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:29,314
And the one that comes to mind for me is startup stock option plans.

185
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:34,758
I work a lot in the startup sector as well, and their stock option plans

186
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:42,559
are used extensively to compensate employees almost in the same way and with the same purposes

187
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,504
as I'm talking about for these revenue share agreements.

188
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:52,971
And in a stock option plan for a typical startup, there is actually a pretty common size and

189
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:58,296
that's 15 to 20% of the company's shares are allocated to employee compensation.

190
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:05,898
And what I mean by that is the startup will take 20% of its share, set them aside, and

191
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:09,341
distribute that 20% among all the employees.

192
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:14,346
And in option, just for anyone's reference, it's a right to buy a share in the future.

193
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:22,009
And the idea here is if the company sells, everyone's going to hopefully make a lot of money from their startup

194
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:27,130
and from the shares that they receive through those options. So it definitely serves the same purposes here.

195
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,351
But I don't want you to say, okay, well startups do 15%. I'm going to do 15% because

196
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:39,513
it doesn't make sense. It's not an arbitrary determination. And it's actually not an arbitrary determination for startups either. That 15 number

197
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,293
is usually just a good starting reference point and

198
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,314
You don't have to follow it as a hard and fast rule.

199
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,615
And I think there's a couple things that you should take into account when determining

200
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:53,697
how much of the company's revenue is being given away under this rev share structure.

201
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:58,939
And startups consider the same two things when considering the option plan size.

202
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,121
And that's the number of people the company plans to hire as well as the percentage that

203
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,582
the company is willing to give away.

204
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,983
The number of people you plan to hire is really going to play into that.

205
00:14:12,114 --> 00:14:18,979
Because if you're going to hire five people versus 100 people or 20 people that you're

206
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:24,883
all going to give a rev share to, that's going to factor into how big of a pool you actually need.

207
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,866
And as well, just the percentage you're willing to give away. Ultimately, 15%

208
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:35,071
could be too much money in your mind based upon how you think the game is or is not going to perform.

209
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:43,158
And I think when you're considering that percentage that you're willing to give away under the rev share, you should also not forget the publisher gets a percentage.

210
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:50,786
Now, this presumes you're going to have a publisher who gives you an advance for the game development in exchange for getting a percentage of the game's revenue.

211
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:58,314
But when deciding on that percentage, you need to take into account what the publisher is ultimately going to get.

212
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:05,216
Usually, if you have an industry standard based off my studies, look at my GDC presentation

213
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:12,437
last year on this, it's about 56% roughly, maybe 60% of game revenue is going to be paid

214
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,478
by the publisher to the developer.

215
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:23,420
So a 15% pool on a 50% rev share paid to the developer is much different than a 15% pool

216
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,681
where 85% of the publishing agreement revenue is being paid to the developer.

217
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:28,801
So.

218
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:35,046
Who else is getting a cut outside of the pool, the rev share agreements, is really critical

219
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:36,206
when determining that percentage.

220
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:42,231
And I know I'm using the word rev share agreements here, but I'm really talking about these revenue

221
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:42,811
share structures.

222
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:47,214
So all of these things also apply to the equity-based revenue sharing as well.

223
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:52,254
So what you're gathering is that there really is no guaranteed formula to determine the

224
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:58,879
percentage, but take into account both, maybe start from a 15% number and work backwards

225
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,602
considering the number of people you're planning on hiring and the percentage you're willing

226
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:03,262
to give away.

227
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:07,966
And I think as part of those two considerations as well, though, you've got to circle back

228
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:12,629
to that incentivization purpose and to the compensation purpose, because if you just

229
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:13,470
can't afford...

230
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,572
To pay people what their market rate is, you're going to have to have a bigger rev share than

231
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:24,354
not because you're going to be compensating more through the rev share component than

232
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:25,374
through the cash component.

233
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:30,516
So let's move to the second key consideration, and that's how you actually calculate the

234
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,137
revenue share.

235
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:35,318
And you've seen some of this language before, this net revenue number I used, or term, pardon

236
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:37,699
me, and the gross revenue term.

237
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:38,699
What do these things mean?

238
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,580
How do they play out?

239
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,622
So let's look at gross revenue.

240
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,324
This in my mind is all revenue from the game.

241
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:47,026
There's no subtraction for expenses.

242
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:52,069
And I consider this to be dangerous because there actually is a risk that you won't have

243
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:52,950
the funds to pay.

244
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,753
In theory, there's a chance that your expenses could exceed the amount of money you have

245
00:16:56,813 --> 00:17:01,136
coming in, especially if your game's not that successful, such that you're going to have

246
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:03,798
an obligation to pay a rev share based on gross revenue.

247
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,780
But in reality, that money does not exist in the company.

248
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:11,441
So almost always I believe the calculation should be based on net revenue.

249
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:17,165
And net revenue, I consider it to be game gross revenue, all the money coming in from

250
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:23,308
the game that you get, minus platform fees, returns, chargebacks, publisher payment, taxes.

251
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:27,570
Ultimately, it's a company that gets to set the cost deducted from gross revenue

252
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,812
to arrive at the net revenue. So for each of our clients, we do completely different

253
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:35,854
structures as to what's deductible and what's not. I feel like it is a bit of a collaboration

254
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,916
as well with your team members, especially if you're a close-knit team.

255
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,097
As to what is going to be deducted, salaries, for example, may not be something you would

256
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,462
deduct when arriving at that net revenue number.

257
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,750
But I think it is really critical to say that it's a net revenue calculation.

258
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:55,446
And as for the terminology net versus gross, I don't really care what you call it.

259
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:59,988
I think it's just really important to say that there are going to be, it's a term, whether

260
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:05,290
you use profits or other terms as well, as long as it's clear that there are going to

261
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,712
be some subtractions that are going to be made before you arrive at that number from

262
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:10,172
which you calculate the rev share.

263
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:15,795
So the third consideration is how this revenue share is actually earned.

264
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,855
We can talk a bit about as well, when is it paid, but how is it earned?

265
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,939
And there's common approaches here too, and one of the most common ones is time-based.

266
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,967
Someone's time spent on the game is divided by everyone's time spent on the game,

267
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,690
and then you arrive at a percentage from that calculation.

268
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,558
What it requires, though, is timekeeping.

269
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,358
And while lawyers like filling by the hour at times,

270
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,059
it does not work in the independent game scene.

271
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,460
Indies hate timekeeping.

272
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,640
So I don't know if it works for everyone.

273
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,160
We certainly do see it.

274
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,661
I see it quite a bit.

275
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,861
I think it's a simple way of doing things, too.

276
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,442
But timekeeping may not work well.

277
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,622
Perhaps it would work well, though,

278
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:57,882
if you had a bunch of contractors

279
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,543
that were tracking their time,

280
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,943
just because that's natural for a contractor work.

281
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:04,564
In that case, maybe it would work okay.

282
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:11,105
A different approach, other than time-based, is milestone-based, where you grant a person a particular percentage,

283
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:15,766
but it's subject to completion of a milestone.

284
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:22,709
And what I mean by that is, you're going to hire someone, perhaps as a sound designer,

285
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:29,712
and you're going to offer them 5% of the game gross, pardon me, net revenue, 5% of net,

286
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:34,534
and they get that only upon completion of the milestone.

287
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:46,161
You could do a prorated based upon completion, but I think only earned upon completion makes a lot of sense, especially for a deliverable like a piece of sound that's going to be used in a game.

288
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:55,548
So that's milestone based. I think that works really well from an accountability perspective, because you can say to your team members, look, if you develop out this piece of code, you're going to earn the milestone.

289
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,130
And I think it works well when it's.

290
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:24,264
It isn't someone whose role is everywhere on the game. I think it works really well if someone's just working on a portion of the game, because I think if you're going to do a project based in the sense of, you know, develop a particular piece of code, it can get a bit complex. But another way of doing it too, when we're talking about milestones isn't perhaps a part of the project, but it could be a stage of the project development. So we could combine

291
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:34,236
time-based with milestone-based and say that actually it's the development cycle milestone.

292
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:41,157
So once we hit alpha, if you're still working with us, we will give you one percent. And if

293
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:46,758
you're still with us at the beta release, steam early access, whatever it is, we'll give you

294
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,239
another percentage and another percentage. So you could combine time-based with milestone-based as

295
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,060
a variant of the milestone structure.

296
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:58,060
But the completion of the milestone should be determined by the company acting reasonably.

297
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,883
You could also do the determination based upon the passage of time.

298
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:07,266
So you grant a person a particular percentage, but it's earned over the development cycle.

299
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:15,112
So for example, you could offer someone 10% rev share, which is vesting over 10 months.

300
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:20,495
And what vesting means, it's a bit of a startup term, vesting is a synonym for earn.

301
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:24,498
So someone gets 10% rev share, but it's earned over 10 months.

302
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:28,420
They would earn 1% based upon a month of work.

303
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:34,991
And if they stop, let's say, halfway through, let's say 10 months,

304
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:39,636
so they stop at five months, they would get 5% because they've only worked half the duration.

305
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:44,001
So it's kind of a time-based structure, but it's not looking at them tracking time.

306
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:47,985
It's instead looking at just the passage of time and saying, if you're...

307
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:52,013
Stay with us for a particular period of time, you're going to get a percentage of it.

308
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,054
Kind of tied into the milestones as well.

309
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,395
You kind of see some overlap there.

310
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:58,657
But you can also introduce what's called a cliff in startup land.

311
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:03,119
And what that means is you have to stay with the company for a particular period of time

312
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,242
and only then do you start to earn the revenue share percentage.

313
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:12,264
So if you say 10% invested over 10 months with a three-month cliff,

314
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:13,945
the cliff is this cutoff point.

315
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:16,787
So if they stay only for two months, they don't get anything.

316
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,569
If they stay three months, then they'd get a third,

317
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:27,173
and then it would go on for the remainder, maybe vesting in monthly period.

318
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,336
So you can see here that there are multiple ways for that rev share to be earned,

319
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:39,381
just timekeeping, passage of time, the milestones, and this vesting structure as well.

320
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:43,581
And I think though, regardless of what you choose, lean toward that simplicity.

321
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:50,104
Whatever works best for how your studio operates and how your team feels comfortable to, I

322
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:51,165
think that's the way to go.

323
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:53,606
But at least you've got a couple options outlined to you here.

324
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,548
The fourth is how do we treat non-game revenue?

325
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,290
What do I mean by non-game revenue?

326
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,231
I'm referring to downloadable content.

327
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:13,208
How do we deal with that within these revenue share structures?

328
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:19,416
Some of these structures work in a way that can accommodate these things, but I'll say

329
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:23,401
that equity-based revenue share has a lot of trouble dealing with this kind of work.

330
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:28,203
A DLC and merge sequels.

331
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:29,284
We'll talk about that in a second.

332
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,425
So what do you do with these?

333
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:35,228
Do we include them or do we exclude them from the revenue share on a high level at

334
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:35,749
high level?

335
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:39,311
A simple rule is the developer should only be included in the royalty for

336
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:43,835
merchandise for DLC only if they worked on that content.

337
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:53,666
But the tracking and calculations can get complicated quickly for these additional sources

338
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:54,227
of revenue.

339
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,449
So let's start with DLC and merchandise.

340
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,734
I think it's important to treat each of these revenue sources as a separate calculation.

341
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:09,179
So in the revenue share agreement, you would say that the people that worked

342
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:15,778
on the DLC and the people that worked on creating the merchandise, they would have a separate

343
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:19,179
revenue calculation and would be paid out among those people.

344
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,261
That's kind of high level how you do it.

345
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:25,443
But it doesn't work well in an equity revenue sharing structure.

346
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:29,345
This goes back to that dividend rule, a bit complicated I know, that I described earlier

347
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:33,067
because people are all going to have the same share class.

348
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:33,687
You can't.

349
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:38,509
Change the dividend that's going to be paid to those people in the same share class.

350
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:43,050
So it's hard to have secondary revenue source calculations, if not impossible, I've read

351
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:49,112
secondary revenue, uh, pardon me, separate revenue share calculations within shares of

352
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,972
the same class.

353
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,214
There's, there's a series way of doing it where you create a secondary class of share,

354
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:56,234
but super complicated.

355
00:24:56,574 --> 00:25:00,335
So I think ultimately if that's something you're considering, probably like most people

356
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,736
lean toward a rev share agreement.

357
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,102
And what about sequels?

358
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:08,223
My rule is always create a new revenue sharing agreement,

359
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:11,604
plan, or share class for those sequels.

360
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,625
There's no point in using the same agreement

361
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:15,386
because your percentages are gonna vary,

362
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:16,426
the team's gonna be different.

363
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:17,946
I don't think it makes sense.

364
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,827
The fifth and final set of considerations

365
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,768
is what to think about concerning termination

366
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,109
of the revenue share agreement.

367
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,930
Because ultimately you can't keep on paying

368
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,607
of the revenue share forever.

369
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:36,188
It's not practical, even just from a monetary perspective,

370
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,828
because at some point the game is not going to be making

371
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,129
the same kind of money it once did,

372
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,189
so paying $2 to somebody just doesn't make sense.

373
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,190
You could set the revenue share to be fixed duration.

374
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,071
For example, five years.

375
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:50,291
Pretty simple.

376
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,032
You're going to get paid this for a period of five years

377
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:54,792
following commercial release.

378
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,671
You could also do it based upon a monetary cap.

379
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:07,156
So until $100,000 in royalties is distributed among all of the participants.

380
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:14,301
The best I think is actually mixed, where you say it's until the earliest of five years

381
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:20,185
or a certain percent, not percentage, a certain dollar figure in royalties are distributed.

382
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,666
So I think that's probably the best way to plan for termination.

383
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,568
In this duration and this monetary number, they're just examples.

384
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:28,049
They're not anything to follow.

385
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:31,691
And I think that's probably the best way to do it.

386
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:36,214
One thing to avoid though, and one thing we are avoiding here with this language, is to

387
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:39,055
avoid perpetual term because you just can't have this going on.

388
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:43,578
As I said, it's not practical to be looking at 20 years from now paying out some rev share.

389
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:48,186
So plan for termination because ultimately it may need to end.

390
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,987
Let's talk about situations where it actually may need to end.

391
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:56,190
Well, if the company is bought or the game is bought, then the revenue share should terminate.

392
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,732
We have had clients that sell their game and the acquirer doesn't want to deal with the

393
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,212
revenue share.

394
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:04,614
They want to be able to monetize the game however they see fit without any baggage from

395
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:05,375
the former studio.

396
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,496
So your revenue share structure should accommodate

397
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:15,438
How it could be terminated should the company or the game be bought and perhaps a final payout

398
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:21,440
Is the way to go but there's a couple ways of doing it that just go beyond what we're talking about here

399
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,061
You should also though plan for hard financial times. Sucks to say but that's something you have to do

400
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,123
What if the company can't pay or or it's harmful to pay

401
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:40,139
And by harmful to pay, I mean the company could be in a tight financial spot where paying

402
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,523
that revenue share could be detrimental and cause it to have not enough funds on hand

403
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,464
to keep on paying its own payroll.

404
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:52,908
So there may need to be a cause built in there to address the situation.

405
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:56,050
Now, I don't think the company can't pay or it's harmful to pay.

406
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,051
I don't think they're often a cause for termination.

407
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:03,715
But the company should be able to delay payment until it's able to, acting reasonably.

408
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,924
So I think in these agreements, it's great to have a clause that says if it's harmful

409
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:12,527
for the company to pay, it will cause the company to go bankrupt if they pay.

410
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:18,352
The company can delay that payment until, acting reasonably, it can make the payment

411
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:22,295
and perhaps there's an interest component, something like that to it.

412
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:26,779
But admittedly, there is an element of trust involved in this structure.

413
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,303
So I think it really requires a cohesive team and some trust there.

414
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,794
So to summarize, I consider there to be two types of plan you should look into.

415
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:40,598
The Revenue Sharing Agreement, which could be an individual grant or it could be a pool,

416
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,761
or the Equity-Based Revenue Sharing.

417
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:51,628
Ninety-five percent of the time I would say that the Revenue Share Agreement is best.

418
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:58,199
You should create a percentage royalty pool based on your hiring plans.

419
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:02,640
Whether you're actually doing the pool structure or you're just doing individual agreements,

420
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:09,123
you should be saying, we're going to set aside a certain percentage and that's going to be paid out among everyone who's participating.

421
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:16,506
And then consider how that percentage is vested. Is it hourly, milestone, passage of time, some hybrid?

422
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:18,167
These are all things you need to consider.

423
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,308
And then as well consider downloadable content, merchandise.

424
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,510
How those are addressing the plans,

425
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,611
but split those SQLs out to a new plan.

426
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:28,414
And then finally, plan for termination.

427
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:31,636
Is there an end date? Is there a payout cap?

428
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:34,699
And consider that delayed payment clause as well.

429
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,581
So that's it for the presentation.

430
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,623
My contact info is here and I'm glad to answer any questions.

431
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:41,364
Thank you.
