00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,992
Hi everyone, welcome to my talk about charming your communities.

2
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:14,139
I'm super jazzed to be here presenting to you online today.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,542
Charming your communities is something that I've been doing

4
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,384
throughout my career.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,148
So being able to share this with you right now is really cool

6
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:20,528
to me.

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:21,530
So let's get started.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,251
As a brief introduction, my name is Victoria Tran.

9
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:27,411
I'm the Community Director at InnerSloth.

10
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:31,092
We make a game called Among Us and also the Henry Stickmin Collection.

11
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:34,993
Previously, I was the Communications Director at Kit Fox Games,

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,993
and they make games like Boyfriend Dungeon,

13
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:42,254
Publishing, Dwarf Fortress, Paparazzi, Mondo Museum, a ton of things.

14
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:45,555
And I think one of the things that I want to point out is that in all of these

15
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:47,755
games, charming your communities is something that.

16
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:50,898
I try to do in any single thing I touch.

17
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:54,361
But yeah, so you can find me on Twitter at the Vy Tran.

18
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,422
I'm always there.

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,126
I am too online, as we all are, but you know, we move on.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,935
So Can You Pet the Dog basically created an entire cultural revolution in games in 2019.

21
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:11,381
It's a Twitter account made to answer one simple question. In this video game,

22
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:16,446
can you pet the dog? Unless it's casual Friday, then it's about petting various other creatures,

23
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:20,690
but you know. It's a simple account all about the charm and joy about finding a

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,271
petable creature in a game.

25
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:27,776
So what is it about this tiny moment that has garnered over 480,000 followers

26
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:32,160
and inspired various video games to include dog pats in their system?

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,944
It's that the pat is a joyful, yet often overlooked or missed point

28
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:38,907
in the game experience, and it's charming as heck.

29
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:45,461
So my work often involves throwing around a lot of words that I realize sound like huge lofty

30
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:52,085
ideals, right? So kindness, compassion, connection, positivity, belonging, etc. I get it. I get that

31
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:58,809
these words seem amorphous and frivolous. Like, how are you actually supposed to do that? And

32
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:02,572
is it even practical? Well, arguably, yes.

33
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:04,989
I don't know what I'm doing.

34
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,790
But the work that goes behind creating kinder, better

35
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,232
communities aren't grand gestures of glamorously

36
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,793
paraded moments or anything.

37
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,735
They're really small daily activities and experiences

38
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,277
that trigger larger change over time.

39
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:21,240
So unlike things like straight follower numbers or more.

40
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:26,466
you know, more metric-based things, these are closer, more personal moments.

41
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,729
And remember, like, what's easy to measure doesn't always mean it's actually super important.

42
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,492
So let's talk about delightful moments in games and online communities.

43
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:38,514
So these aren't the huge integral main stage moments I'm talking about,

44
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:43,597
not the subversion of the Stanley Parable or the satisfying gunplay mechanics of Destiny 2.

45
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:48,280
These are small moments, kind of similar to Ys VIII, but not quite,

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,642
that can charm your communities in and outside of the games themselves.

47
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:56,058
So really quick agenda, we go into the what, the why,

48
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,440
the how of charming your community

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,721
so you get a better sense of it,

50
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,363
and then a little bit of a conclusion.

51
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:03,123
So what?

52
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:07,006
So what does charming a community even mean in this case?

53
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,968
So if you've worked in marketing,

54
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,009
you've probably seen the marketing funnel

55
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,750
or something very similar to this.

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,352
And it's basically a funnel that shows

57
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,834
how people take a desired action.

58
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,596
So whether that's buying your game, wishlisting on Steam,

59
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:26,991
signing up to your newsletter, that sort of thing. It all goes from this and it's very audience-based.

60
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:31,895
Basically, it's a very top-down approach, right? You spread your net as far and wide as possible

61
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:36,878
and then you kind of narrow it down. Charming Communities is about community-first building

62
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,300
and that kind of means flipping that funnel.

63
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,172
on its head or on its bottom.

64
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,336
It means flipping the funnel.

65
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,459
So it's starting small and focusing

66
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,164
on creating a truly integrative environment and place

67
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,367
that cares about each other, which in turn

68
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,391
helps your studio scale and sustain itself.

69
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:59,433
So what we want is to create groups of people who keep coming together over what they care about

70
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:05,115
with member-to-member interactions. So this is versus just building an audience. So audiences,

71
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:10,056
like while these individuals may all share an interest in your content, they don't actually

72
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:14,338
have a relationship with each other. There's no mutual concern and there's no real coming

73
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:19,939
together. And that's kind of different from when we charm communities and when we go community-first

74
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:20,620
approaches.

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,831
So Charming Communities is purposefully

76
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,053
creating a warm, vibrant experience

77
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,874
that people will associate with your studio.

78
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:30,957
The specific feelings can vary, but I'm usually

79
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,839
referring to qualities like playfulness, delight,

80
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,381
positivity, earnestness, attention to detail.

81
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,562
And Charming Your Communities involves

82
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,824
staying aware of community sentiment and member

83
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,645
experiences, putting time and energy

84
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:45,187
into finding special moments worth a little bit

85
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:46,128
of extra investment.

86
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,450
All right, all right.

87
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,791
But we've heard that.

88
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,012
Why?

89
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:52,712
Why does this even matter?

90
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:56,554
And for one, creating intentional, authentic,

91
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,475
and warm community spaces is always

92
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:01,056
something that we should aspire to as community developers

93
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:04,577
and as people who have the privilege of creating

94
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:07,939
the kind of tone and environment that people gather in,

95
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,440
because that's a very cool thing that we get to do.

96
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,301
The sense of connection that stems

97
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,942
from feeling included and welcome

98
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,903
creates a true sense of togetherness,

99
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,824
which is something that community devs all

100
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:20,085
work really hard for.

101
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:26,377
And Charming Communities isn't just about that though, if you're like not into all the like, you know,

102
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:28,159
touchy-feely positive things.

103
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,942
It really helps integrate individuals into the community.

104
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:35,728
When people first hear about your game and you, it doesn't mean they're part of your community yet

105
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,610
or that they even want to participate in it.

106
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,851
It just means that they know who you are.

107
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:44,333
They may share an interest in your game, but they have no relationship with each other, no connection.

108
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,834
And again, that's not what a community is. That's just an audience.

109
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:53,897
One of the core responsibilities of community developers is to figure out how to welcome strangers into their spaces.

110
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:57,378
And I think of this as the community integration journey.

111
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:58,138
Woohoo!

112
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:03,424
So we can split up the community journey into four stages. There's new members, regular members,

113
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:07,627
loyal supporters, and advocates. So new members, these are the people that have just discovered

114
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:12,750
your game, maybe just plopped into your Discord, or are curiously scrolling through your Steam page

115
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,053
or website after hearing about it. They can kind of be characterized by it's like it's really

116
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:21,976
difficult to actually make them take an action, so buying your game, joining your community,

117
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,077
getting invested in the studio, and they can be

118
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:28,785
completely turned off by your studio, the developers, or your games if they have a first

119
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:32,071
bad experience. And once they're gone, gone forever.

120
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,775
Next, you have the regular members.

121
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,316
So these are people who stick to,

122
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:40,478
who choose to stick around for a bit after playing your game.

123
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:42,099
So if your game is still in development,

124
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,142
maybe they hang around your community spaces passively

125
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,964
or throw you a follow to casually be kept up to date.

126
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,185
So they come more than once,

127
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:51,306
but there's no reason to really choose your game

128
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:55,309
over another or get it if another similar game comes out

129
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,711
or if it's not on sale or something.

130
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,133
And it's not particularly attached to your community space

131
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,214
over another place.

132
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:07,632
Next, you have your loyal supporters, and they're invested in your community and the game's development, which is great.

133
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:14,216
And these community members have invested a significant amount of time into your game and are committed to being a part of the game's journey.

134
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:22,161
Even if there's other competition out there, they're still likely to come back to your game or still have a certain place in their heart for your work.

135
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,354
So their main characteristics is that they'll usually choose your game or community space over another,

136
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:32,519
but they can be whisked away if another studio comes around with a better game and they get dragged into the hype.

137
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,463
And you know, the point here is that when you have a community and you create a community around your studio,

138
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:44,231
is that they'll be around for more than one game, and you know, they'll want to support you as merch comes out and all that kind of thing.

139
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,884
And then next, next you have the advocates.

140
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,369
These are members who are active participants,

141
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,370
contributors, and helpers,

142
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,433
and they are everything in communities.

143
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,995
You know, they're the future mods,

144
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,999
they're, they're, they're just, they're gold.

145
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,780
They help us create the communities that we strive for,

146
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,022
help other members become healthier, wiser,

147
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,243
and more autonomous.

148
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:10,865
Their main characteristics really consist of word of mouth.

149
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,025
They tell their friends to join.

150
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,286
They tell their friends about your game

151
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,507
and that they should play it.

152
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:17,688
They're more credible to any friends and contacts

153
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,509
when it comes to game recommendations,

154
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:20,730
vouching for decisions,

155
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,851
or helping you out within the community.

156
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,572
They provide a lot of feedback and empower you to do better.

157
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,273
And they really importantly,

158
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,595
they welcome people into the community

159
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,295
actively want to help them.

160
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:34,656
Having people who can actively integrate

161
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:38,597
other community members further along the journey,

162
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:39,917
amazing, fantastic.

163
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,918
So as a community director, developer, manager,

164
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:44,958
we need to ask ourselves,

165
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,359
how do we move community members along in this process?

166
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,479
So there are a number of ways to do this, right?

167
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,740
The game experience itself, the community surrounding it,

168
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,300
merchandising, marketing, et cetera.

169
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,921
But one of the most meaningful ways to garner goodwill

170
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:57,441
and also.

171
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,894
pretty cheap sometimes, towards your studio

172
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,256
is by charming them with positive experiences,

173
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:05,037
which I'll explain how to do further down.

174
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,699
More importantly, it'll make your community

175
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,061
a healthier and more pleasant place to be in.

176
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:12,022
A community where members feel listened to, heard,

177
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,004
and like they truly interact with the developers

178
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,405
and each other really helps create a deeper sense

179
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,167
of trust and understanding.

180
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,428
So game development is wrought with issues for sure,

181
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,490
but a community that supports each other through it

182
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,271
is everything and a great motivator.

183
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:29,193
Creating charming communities or charming moments not only deepens bonds,

184
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:34,474
but can be a way we community managers and developers reflect back to our players

185
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:38,335
that we appreciate them and want to put some extra effort in to show that.

186
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:42,597
All right, we've gone through all that, and now we finally get into the how,

187
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:45,357
which is how do we charm communities?

188
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:49,159
So many people falsely assume that more time spent in your community

189
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,779
equates to a better relationship.

190
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,395
But time is really vague and shaky.

191
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:55,957
You know, how much is enough time?

192
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:59,240
Does more time automatically equal better quality relationships?

193
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,487
Basically, time isn't a great indicator of how much you actually have positive feelings towards someone.

194
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:09,770
So as an example, think of a relative that you may dislike,

195
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,816
but you've known all your life versus someone that you just met that you felt instantly connected to.

196
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:21,739
Many relationships don't grow predictably, so we need to think about the best way to encourage

197
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:27,362
positive community connections. And that's by creating meaningful moments.

198
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,523
I don't know why I'm doing these hand actions.

199
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:34,469
And the best part is we can design for these moments, right?

200
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,590
We don't have to just hope that these moments happen by chance.

201
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,411
And honestly, we shouldn't wait for it.

202
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,872
But community managers and developers, in particular,

203
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:42,913
are well-suited for this,

204
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:46,394
because we're the ones that are closest to the community,

205
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,275
their needs, their wants, and inside jokes.

206
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:51,116
And we can help make those few seconds or minutes

207
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,638
that elevate an experience and connect the players.

208
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:56,579
Being part of an exceptional moment

209
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,800
makes being a part of the community meaningful,

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,141
and that makes a truly strong community.

211
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:09,467
So side note here, charming your communities must still be backed up by actually fulfilling at least their core needs.

212
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:24,399
So players can forgive small problems, small bugs, but no amount of charming moments can necessarily save a game that, you know, completely disappoints, breaks entirely, has shady studio practices, disappointing customer service, that kind of thing.

213
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,261
Good relationships are always built on trust and respect.

214
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,870
All right, so now how do we actually create moments

215
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,152
that are joyful and transformational?

216
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,653
So in the book, The Power of Moments

217
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,675
by Chip Heath and Dan Heath,

218
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,237
they outlined the three main ways moments

219
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:41,178
kind of stand out to us,

220
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,799
and that's peaks, pits, and transitions.

221
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,502
For now, I'll focus on how we create peaks,

222
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:48,664
which are the delightful, positive emotions

223
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,945
that are associated with a moment.

224
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,507
And as far as timing your communities go,

225
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:53,888
this is probably the moment

226
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,649
that you'll be consistently aiming for.

227
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,708
So generally, peak moments are created

228
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,491
when you make one or more of these experiences

229
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:03,312
in an interaction, according to the book.

230
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,535
So there's elevation, which are surprising events

231
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:07,797
and extraordinary experiences.

232
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,900
There's insight, which is kind of shaping the way someone

233
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,182
sees the world.

234
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:15,185
Connection, creating meaning or deepening ties with others.

235
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:17,947
And finally, pride, which are significant milestones

236
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,450
or being recognized by others that you respect.

237
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:26,604
So when building a community, you don't want just a neutral community experience with no complaints.

238
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:30,667
We want to elevate our communities to feel engaged and motivated to participate.

239
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:36,410
That's when your players start to feel like a true community and begin to encourage, support, and connect with each other.

240
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:41,276
So I'm going to dive into ways I've created moments,

241
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:45,339
but keep in mind that everyone's personality, game genre, studio

242
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,800
vibe, values, humor, and community

243
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,122
are just completely different and contextual.

244
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:53,204
What works for me might not work for you, and vice versa.

245
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:55,586
It's all about finding your own voice.

246
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,467
And also remember that these examples

247
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,029
may include one or more of the experiences

248
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,010
listed here within them.

249
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,351
It's not just mutually exclusive.

250
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,614
All right, so elevation is all about surprising events,

251
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,396
creating extraordinary experiences,

252
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:12,239
and or breaking out of a prescribed expectation

253
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,201
of how things should be.

254
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,844
I like really silly, chaotic, inconsequential jokes

255
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:17,225
in my work.

256
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:20,769
So moments of elevation are one of my favorite things to do.

257
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:24,571
So when I'm trying to elevate, I think, what are people expecting me to do?

258
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,792
How are things usually done?

259
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,254
And how do I break past that routine?

260
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:31,456
And I guess less professionally, you could consider this.

261
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:36,359
What is something super like dumb that would bring me the most enjoyment right now?

262
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,720
So some examples of this.

263
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:45,318
Breaking routines. This is when I was sending out a newsletter when I was working on Boyfriend Dungeon

264
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:50,664
and there is basically a cat as one of the playable characters in the game and in the

265
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:56,090
newsletter I normally send these newsletters out in the voice of the characters and when it became

266
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,013
the cat's time to send it I was like...

267
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:04,862
why don't I just send an email marketing newsletter full of meowing and not actual words and there's

268
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:10,468
no real marketing put into it um and that's that that was like the marketing message which was

269
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:14,552
meowing and it really worked it plopped a ton of meows into the text

270
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:19,523
and a lot of people expected a typical marketing newsletter and instead I just

271
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:23,847
filled their inboxes with meows and if you can't read the text on here it

272
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,929
says hey kitfox just wanted to say I love this mail

273
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,073
I've been enjoying these mails every time they came in but this just subverted my

274
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,836
expectations amazingly keep up the amazing work

275
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:33,937
that was really nice

276
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,135
Another way I like to elevate moments is community spotlights.

277
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:41,917
So spotlighting community members as part of the game or outward-facing communications

278
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:48,241
is a ton of fun, even more so if you spice it up in normally overlooked areas of your communications.

279
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:52,923
I think of it as a fun reward for paying attention to something that people often scroll past.

280
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:56,525
So as an example, these are the Among Us Steam reviews that I took

281
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:59,687
just from people talking about it.

282
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,968
Like, it's great. 10 out of 10. Among Us is a game.

283
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,293
There's also fun details.

284
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,954
I love adding small little quirks into anything I do.

285
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:09,696
The reason this works so well is it shows off

286
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:11,677
a little bit of personality, right?

287
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,178
Highly specific details bring a little bit of spice

288
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,400
to the table, whether that's yours specifically

289
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,420
or the entire studio's.

290
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,902
So in Boyfriend Dungeon, for example,

291
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:22,603
the healing item is bubble tea

292
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,964
because we all love bubble tea.

293
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,930
And if you scroll through the Paparazzi store page,

294
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,092
I added an entire section at the bottom just for dogs.

295
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,013
Very exciting.

296
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,714
There's also a secret role in the Among Us Discord

297
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:37,196
that opens up a pretzel stand channel born from an inside

298
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,417
joke between the moderators.

299
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,078
You can't do anything in it.

300
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,959
It just has a picture of a pretzel.

301
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,360
It's there.

302
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,980
It's just there.

303
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,381
Also, shout out to Xbox for the way

304
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:49,143
they handled the leak of their Xbox Series X.

305
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,745
They sort of just owned their own leak,

306
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,085
which was extremely amusing.

307
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:58,844
And when we go into insight, world-shaping moments of insight

308
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:01,327
are harder to create, as these are deeply personal.

309
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,930
These may also work with certain games, too,

310
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,532
depending on the subject matter.

311
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,314
For instance, I'm not entirely sure

312
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,838
what kind of self-actualizations people are having

313
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:11,959
when they play Among Us.

314
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,704
Unless we count, you know, some people realizing they're really good at murder and betrayal.

315
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:21,809
But I do have another example from a past experience with Boyfriend Dungeon when we were

316
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:26,834
running a booth at a convention and I got this email a few days later and I got permission to

317
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:33,019
share it. But it's basically someone who was really happy that we used the correct pronouns during

318
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,544
the convention and that was really that was really sweet to see. It's an email that I

319
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,768
I love very much, hold deep in my heart.

320
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,369
Purely thinking of charming communities

321
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,831
and creating special moments as a marketing ploy

322
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,152
is a huge disservice to the underlying principle

323
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:51,574
of what I'm trying to convey, by the way,

324
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:53,835
that caring about others and creating true connections

325
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:54,856
has meaning to it.

326
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:58,658
If we can create kinder spaces in the places,

327
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,039
in the spaces we create and work in,

328
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,481
people can form real bonds they couldn't otherwise.

329
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,682
And I really hope those connections help

330
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:06,863
them face the outside world too.

331
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,856
So when we talk about experiences of connection,

332
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,597
I think of them as having direct ties or roots to the community.

333
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:15,657
So inside jokes, right?

334
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,438
So Lucifer Within Us, another game I worked on,

335
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:20,238
has a collectible achievement named Devil's Herb,

336
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,079
which is a running gag in the Kit Fox Games Discord

337
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,740
over the fact that I really hate cilantro

338
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,481
and other people loved it.

339
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,361
So it became this whole battle between the Discord

340
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:31,522
and the community.

341
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:33,162
It's really fun because the community

342
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,743
knows they had a tiny hand in a part of the game, which

343
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,863
was the devil's weed.

344
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:41,086
achievement. The good thing about the cilantro trope too was it delighted

345
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:44,008
others who haven't participated in the community and it really pulls in

346
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,950
elements of unexpected levity.

347
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:49,337
I've also talked about the Among Us Twitter account

348
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,639
in previous things I've done.

349
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:54,941
But this is all about connection and responding frequently.

350
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:59,264
I try to respond as much as possible to any random tweets.

351
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:03,427
And this is one of the quickest ways I've created charming moments.

352
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:06,349
And I do it because I know how strong those moments of recognition

353
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,250
have been for me.

354
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,511
Way back before I got my start in games,

355
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,893
I tweeted at Juicy Beast that I love their game.

356
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,034
And they liked my tweet.

357
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,495
But somehow, even knowing.

358
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:19,521
they saw my tweet made me really happy and I still remember it now, years later.

359
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:24,648
And these moments of insight can also form when we ground parts of our work in reality

360
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:30,496
and common moments that many of us have experienced, such as in Hitman 3 and having, you know, talking about relationship troubles.

361
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:37,350
Creating moments of pride is about recognizing the work and effort people have invested into you and the community.

362
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:44,373
So the simplest way I do this is to, again, comment on as many pieces of fan art or user-generated content that I see,

363
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,814
whether that's on Twitter or TikTok, that sort of thing.

364
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:51,316
It can be simple as a kid's drawing or 3D short animation.

365
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:54,237
Supporting and lifting up the community is a great way to charm them.

366
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:58,720
And sometimes it doesn't even need to be directly related to fan art, right?

367
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,703
So I interacted with Twitter users regardless of follower count,

368
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:06,166
and a particular funny reply from one user got me roping in Xbox into the jokes,

369
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,969
and it really spawned a really amusing thread for the whole community to take part in.

370
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,511
And the best part was seeing the poster's reaction to it all.

371
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:18,220
Think about moments in your own life outside of games. Feeling like you matter or are seen

372
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,027
is charming in practically any context and it's a big idea of,

373
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,994
you know, charming communities. If that can brighten someone's day, I'm happy to do it.

374
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,080
And to be perfectly clear, not all peak moments

375
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,841
have to be funny in order to be charming or meaningful.

376
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,642
Remember, it's all about finding your own voice

377
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,842
and one that fits your community and game.

378
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,523
For example, co-op mode has a wonderfully sweet tone

379
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:39,704
in the communications,

380
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,924
which fits their playful cinematic games,

381
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,785
such as Goodbye Volcano High,

382
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,226
and Darkness Dungeon leverages their thematic

383
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,326
dark undertones in their communications

384
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:49,827
to match the game perfectly.

385
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:51,947
And truly respecting, caring,

386
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:53,288
and being a part of your community

387
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:55,508
will better set you up to be able to connect with them.

388
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,109
All right.

389
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,130
Talked a lot.

390
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,576
And now we're in the conclusion.

391
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:05,056
I forgot.

392
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,638
Sorry, I just noticed that I forgot

393
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,641
to change that slide subtext.

394
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,442
But we move on.

395
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,128
So charming your communities isn't about better marketing.

396
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,409
Thinking of it that way completely

397
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,231
eradicates the core idea of why we as community builders

398
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,332
want to make moments matter, to connect, delight, and foster

399
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,093
a true sense of meaning in being together.

400
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:27,655
And one reason it is so hard to build a peak

401
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:30,056
or to make moments or to charm communities

402
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,857
is that it's actually really no one's job to do it,

403
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,978
and it's a hassle, and it's never urgent.

404
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:37,960
But putting in that time really does matter and pays off.

405
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:44,828
Eliminate the values and you'll get the cold kind of silence brand moments that we all hate so much.

406
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,850
And community-led growth is all about investing time, cultivating and caring for the members that join early on

407
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,991
and charming them into loving what their community stands for and spreading that to others.

408
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:00,612
This rings true for communities of all sizes, as far as I know, as far as I've worked on.

409
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:06,753
And there's no point, no sustainability and no joy in having a community you don't particularly enjoy interacting with

410
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:07,773
or that you feel...

411
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,152
don't care about you.

412
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,918
By creating moments, we as developers can build

413
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:14,463
stronger ties, a mature community, and grow together.

414
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,963
Basically, I really love communities.

415
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:21,125
I love these spaces because I see them as true places

416
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,747
to find genuine love and understanding and connection.

417
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,949
Sorry, I've said that word so many times, with others.

418
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,150
There is a space where compassion and ethics can

419
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,031
fuse with technology, and I hope we

420
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,332
can continue to give more consideration to it.

421
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,113
And I think a good way to start is

422
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:39,395
to think of how we can make delightful little memories

423
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:39,935
for each other.

424
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,407
Thank you so much for listening to my talk.

425
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,529
I hope you enjoyed it.

426
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,672
I will probably be in chat to answer any questions.

427
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:52,897
And yeah, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day,

428
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,360
week, month, year, et cetera.

429
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,321
Bye.

430
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:56,601
Bye.

431
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:56,661
Bye.
