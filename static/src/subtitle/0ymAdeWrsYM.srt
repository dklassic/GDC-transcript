1
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:06,269
My name is Martin.

2
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:15,052
I am the creative director at Coldwood, and I made a game called Unravel, and I will be

3
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:21,355
talking about this today.

4
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:27,537
First off, just a quick summary of what Unravel is for those of you who might not know.

5
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:34,600
Unravel is a game about love and about the bonds between people.

6
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,765
and it uses yarn to represent those things.

7
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:42,827
And the premise is that we're bound to the things we love.

8
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:45,188
We're literally bound to the things that we love,

9
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:46,888
and when we lose them, we start to unravel.

10
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:53,231
And the goal is to help someone whose life has come apart.

11
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,472
They're in pieces, and you are the red thread

12
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,233
that ties all those missing parts back together.

13
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:07,507
It's most definitely not a power fantasy.

14
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:12,771
You play this tiny little creature in a big and dangerous world,

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,733
and you've got lots of heart,

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,715
but beyond that, you're not really that powerful.

17
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:21,717
You're just doing what you can to help,

18
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:24,659
because it's the right thing to do.

19
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,842
And you don't get to save the world either.

20
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,243
You're just helping someone deal with their pain and loss.

21
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:37,048
So it's not this big extravagant doomsday plot,

22
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:41,110
but it is something that we can recognize,

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,312
because we all get lonely,

24
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,194
and we could all use some help reaching out sometimes.

25
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:48,836
So we can empathize with that.

26
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:54,720
And that's really what it's all about, empathy.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,923
You do nice things because it's the nice thing to do.

28
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,806
So you might not get to be traditionally powerful,

29
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,429
but you get to do some proper good.

30
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:12,896
And I think that's pretty powerful in its own way.

31
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:17,460
And I think games in general are really powerful things.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,322
They can make a huge impact.

33
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:23,559
The bonds that they make with the audience are super strong.

34
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:28,062
They just can absorb our attention for hours and hours

35
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:31,264
and take us places and transport us into an experience.

36
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:35,606
And they can be emotional and inspiring and educational

37
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,768
and provocative and beautiful, and very intensely so.

38
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:42,090
And games let us see things from new perspectives.

39
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:52,645
give us a chance to walk in someone else's shoes

40
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:53,786
and share their experiences.

41
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:58,347
And the way that they totally immerse us in a situation

42
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,248
can help give us a deeper understanding of it.

43
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,409
So games can be great at inspiring empathy.

44
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,190
And they can also be kind of crap at it.

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,350
Too often, I think, games settle for less.

46
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:22,610
they choose distraction over deeper engagement.

47
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,332
And too often, they just don't have anything interesting

48
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:29,694
to say, or anything nice to say.

49
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:34,057
Or perhaps even worse, sometimes when they do have

50
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:36,038
something good to say, when they do have an important

51
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:38,760
message, they kind of say it so clumsily

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,261
that people just stop listening.

53
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:48,186
And I've made a ton of pointless games like that.

54
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:53,920
games that I'm not necessarily proud of.

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,022
And I was fed up with it.

56
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:00,005
I wanted to make something that was

57
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,726
meaningful and enriching.

58
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:06,069
Something that might be a positive influence.

59
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,871
Because I believe that games do influence us.

60
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:15,155
Our culture shapes us as much as we shape it.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,766
whatever impact our game might have, as simple or insignificant as that might be,

62
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,868
I wanted it to be something positive.

63
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:28,332
But I also knew that we had to do it kind of gently,

64
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,374
so that it wouldn't just put people off.

65
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:34,418
Because whenever we sense that there's a message there,

66
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,421
we tend to get kind of defensive.

67
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,604
It's almost like we've been kind of conditioned to resist messages.

68
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:47,273
And I wanted to tell this story about love and empathy,

69
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:51,434
but I didn't want to talk about it necessarily.

70
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,796
I just wanted it to be something that you felt,

71
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:57,097
that you understood, kind of intuitively.

72
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,818
So in Unravel, we try to turn empathy

73
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,839
into a game mechanic.

74
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,621
Or maybe that's kind of like the wrong word for it,

75
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,182
I don't know, but the whole purpose

76
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,143
and the point of the game was to inspire empathy.

77
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:20,279
And I figured that the best way to do that was actually to get just a little bit mean.

78
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:30,722
Because first we give you this irresistibly sweet thing, this absolutely gorgeous game

79
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:36,944
that just immediately draws you in and it's so friendly and it's charming and it's inviting.

80
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:42,018
I mean, I'm sorry for bragging, but it really is.

81
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,438
It's super beautiful.

82
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:46,220
And the atmosphere is just magical,

83
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,961
and it's full of details.

84
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:51,583
And there's this cute, endearing little character.

85
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,384
And I wanted you to fall in love.

86
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:57,587
I wanted you to fall head over heels in love with it

87
00:05:57,587 --> 00:06:00,588
at first sight.

88
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:03,010
And then just turn everything around

89
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,591
and snatch all that loveliness away.

90
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:09,655
and just like rip up all that sweetness, rip it to shreds,

91
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:14,897
and just drop you down the deepest, darkest hole.

92
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:19,519
It's cruel, but I mean, I wanted to break your hearts.

93
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,321
I wanted to push you to the point of nearly giving up.

94
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:29,844
Just because then we could make it all right again

95
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:30,785
at the end.

96
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:33,306
You emerge from that darkness into a light

97
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:34,787
that just feels redeeming.

98
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,843
Everything we took away, we give it all back again,

99
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:42,364
but better and lovelier and friendlier.

100
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:45,164
So we wanted maximum contrast,

101
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:48,445
like we were moving from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high,

102
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:53,366
and just moments before, every single step was a struggle.

103
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:55,587
And then you suddenly find yourself flying.

104
00:06:55,587 --> 00:07:00,268
And those sharp turns between light and dark,

105
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,628
it made a real impact.

106
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,051
You suffer in the dark parts,

107
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,812
because you remember what the light was like.

108
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,853
We gave you something beautiful to lose,

109
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,254
and we made sure that you lost it.

110
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:17,655
And then when you're amended again,

111
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:20,676
you can appreciate what it means to be whole,

112
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,797
because you know what it's like to be broken.

113
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:27,019
And for some, that experience was quite profound.

114
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:31,540
But it only works if people care.

115
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,372
So, how did we make them do that?

116
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:41,757
Step one was to give people someone to care about, of course.

117
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:45,420
And not the typical hero, but someone vulnerable.

118
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,883
Someone that would need their help to get through this journey.

119
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,865
I wanted players to feel protective,

120
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:57,469
like they were leading this character instead of just following or observing.

121
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,932
And to make that work...

122
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,465
that character, Yarny, had to feel like a real, living,

123
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:15,611
breathing thing, something that was more than just pixels.

124
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:18,873
And looks were a big part of that.

125
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,554
I don't think that's a rule.

126
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:23,617
It's not like more realistic visuals necessarily

127
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:24,717
makes things more relatable.

128
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,940
But in Unravel, it definitely helped.

129
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,093
One of the core themes of the game is that you're tethered

130
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,234
to the things that you love, and the farther away from them

131
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,275
you get, the weaker you become.

132
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:41,378
And we wanted players to be able to actually see that,

133
00:08:41,378 --> 00:08:44,440
to see Yarny unraveling in this vivid,

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,582
almost gory detail, loosing loop after loop of yarn

135
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:51,245
and gradually just wasting away and really suffering.

136
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:54,207
So that when players saw that, they felt compassion.

137
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,329
They felt bad about seeing that little creature hurting,

138
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,270
and they were eager to set things right.

139
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:02,189
So realism really helped us set the right tone.

140
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:09,234
It helped us get people in the right mindset.

141
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:14,257
Unravel tells this story without words, or mostly without words anyway.

142
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:18,540
So Yarny doesn't actually speak, but still has to be able to say a lot.

143
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,502
There was lots of discussion early on about the character design.

144
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,536
People worry that it might not be expressive enough.

145
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:28,917
So I used the Yarny doll that I made before

146
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:32,898
to show just how much you can say through body language.

147
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,658
And the cool thing about body language

148
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,198
is that it's always on.

149
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:40,939
Every single animation or lack of animation

150
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,339
says something about the character.

151
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,740
So the way Yarny stumbles after a long jump, for instance,

152
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,081
or struggles to clamber over a ledge, it's quite endearing.

153
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,121
And it builds the character.

154
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,377
And we wanted to enforce this idea

155
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,599
that you were playing as someone rather small and weak,

156
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:01,541
that nothing you did should be easy.

157
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,602
We did tweak it, though,

158
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,603
because it has to be fun to play as well,

159
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,525
so Yarny got progressively more and more capable,

160
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,387
but we still wanted to enforce that notion

161
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:11,727
that you're not a superhero,

162
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:18,071
you're a fragile little thing on a really dangerous quest.

163
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:21,493
And we had to let Yarny have some fun sometimes as well

164
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:22,754
and be just a little bit silly.

165
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:27,252
But there was one big rule that it couldn't turn cartoonish.

166
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,053
That was a super important rule.

167
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,494
Everything had to stay dignified.

168
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:34,695
Because I think it's difficult to empathize with someone

169
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,895
if you don't take them seriously.

170
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:44,318
And situational awareness was incredibly important as well.

171
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:47,799
Like, whatever happened, Yarny had to react to it

172
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,440
like a living, intelligent being.

173
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,520
So...

174
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,759
if there's a point of interest, Yarny looks at it.

175
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,960
And when you swing on your yarn,

176
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,460
there's ragdoll to give you proper weight.

177
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,801
And if there's water,

178
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,482
you can see Yarny kind of wading through it.

179
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,102
And when you get out of the water,

180
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,543
Yarny shakes the water off.

181
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,203
And when you land hard after jump,

182
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:10,064
you see like this little stumbling steps.

183
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:13,025
And there are tons and tons and tons

184
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,945
of contextual animations and physics tweaks

185
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:18,907
throughout the game for all kinds of different animations.

186
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,229
Our animator Sam Addo and Jakob Marklund,

187
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:27,171
who made all the code, they just did a beautiful job

188
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:31,835
of bringing Yarny to life.

189
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:34,536
And Yarny had to react emotionally as well.

190
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:37,659
Let me see if I can play this video.

191
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:42,322
We wanted players to feel what Yarny was feeling,

192
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,923
so we had to communicate that.

193
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,963
So we used the thing called mood zones.

194
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:51,266
These artist-defined areas where we could swap out

195
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:52,747
any part of Jarni's moveset

196
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:55,550
for a more emotionally charged version.

197
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,613
So here, when the lightning strikes in a minute

198
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:00,174
or in a second,

199
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:03,717
you can see how the mood changes

200
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:07,160
from the neutral to a more worried and scared version.

201
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:17,811
And we use those mood zones a lot, both in subtle and more dramatic ways.

202
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:24,716
And this is from the darkest and most desperate level.

203
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:27,958
It's this constant battle against the wind.

204
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,922
And if you leave the light there, you're going to freeze to death.

205
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:38,385
And every time the wind picks up, you can see Yarny struggling or stumbling if you're facing the other way.

206
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:40,747
And then that lamp.

207
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:46,055
When you pull it along with you, it's meant to feel like you're dragging your whole past behind you.

208
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,956
So we made it look really, really heavy.

209
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:53,077
And the lamp is your only safe spot in the level.

210
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,898
So it has its own move zone as well.

211
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:59,900
So when you stand close to it, you can see Yarny kind of warming up, huddling closer to it.

212
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,241
And you can see the snow starting to melt off as well.

213
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,731
Without all of those animation levels,

214
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,612
none of this would have worked.

215
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:12,273
This level would have been pretty much pointless.

216
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:16,055
But because Yarny looks and acts like a real living being,

217
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:18,796
it works, and it works really well.

218
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:23,398
And once again about looks, we're really obsessed with looks.

219
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:29,500
The game world of Unravel had to be fiercely lovely.

220
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,441
One look at it should be enough to draw you in

221
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:32,342
and keep you in.

222
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,571
I wanted that first impression of the game to be like a gut punch,

223
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,692
just dropping into this achingly beautiful place

224
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:44,012
that's full of love and sadness and so many memories.

225
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:48,174
And the goal was to create a place that felt like home,

226
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,374
like a place to love and to come back to.

227
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,235
So we wanted realism,

228
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:56,556
but above all, we wanted to capture how things feel,

229
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:57,536
not just how they look.

230
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:01,430
And we put the camera really low, down at ground level,

231
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,351
so you can get super close to everything

232
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:06,292
and see and appreciate just how beautiful

233
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,133
even the most ordinary things can be.

234
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:12,516
And we wanted to saturate every area with detail

235
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,357
so that the world looked alive and lived in,

236
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:17,278
and so that the world could tell stories.

237
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:24,542
Unravel is a game about mending broken bonds,

238
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,604
and things like that don't happen without effort.

239
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,112
So the gameplay had to reflect that.

240
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:34,333
Things had to be a little bit difficult.

241
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,274
You had to face some real dangers.

242
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,555
We wanted it to feel like a real accomplishment

243
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,096
when you got to the end, but we had to balance it

244
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:44,397
so we wouldn't scare everyone off.

245
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,798
So what we did was we tried to make things seem harder

246
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,739
than they really were.

247
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,880
Near misses and narrow escapes are very useful.

248
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,481
If a chase ends with a narrow escape,

249
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,862
then that excitement, that last minute excitement,

250
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,022
is the only thing you remember.

251
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:03,857
I wouldn't say we always got it right, we didn't.

252
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,737
Insight is probably a better example

253
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:09,299
if you want to see how to use narrow escapes.

254
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,979
But we kind of made it work.

255
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:11,960
And also a note on danger in general.

256
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,180
I guess death is like the most common fail state

257
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,481
in games like this.

258
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:19,443
But it kind of sucks as a tool

259
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:26,225
when you're trying to build empathy for your character

260
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,766
if you just keep killing it all the time.

261
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,445
It's okay if it happens sometimes.

262
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,246
It can even be a good thing.

263
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,527
But if it happens too frequently,

264
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,089
then players just get emotionally detached.

265
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,670
So you can't ever treat your character

266
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,391
like it's disposable.

267
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:43,674
What we did was that we tried to fetishize death

268
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,855
a bit instead.

269
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:47,457
So when it did happen, it would have maximum impact.

270
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:51,199
Like death shouldn't be used just as a quick reset.

271
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,122
It should be like a wow moment or a cringe moment.

272
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,863
It should make you react and feel like,

273
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:57,944
oh dear, what did I do to that poor little thing?

274
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:06,606
As weird as it sounds to say, death has to be rewarding.

275
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:10,548
And as much as we love brutal challenges and cruel deaths,

276
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:13,649
we also had to leave space for things just to be nice sometimes.

277
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,509
We had to give you some breathing room,

278
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,250
places where everything was just lovely and peaceful,

279
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,531
places where you didn't have to figure anything out

280
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,211
or wonder what might come next,

281
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,452
places that were just there for you to enjoy.

282
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:30,327
The game does get progressively darker,

283
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,928
but we still give you these little moments every now and then

284
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:39,411
of hope and sweetness, just to keep your spirits up.

285
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:43,273
So, we went through all those steps to try to make people care.

286
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,835
We had their attention, and what would we do with it?

287
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,276
How would we get our message across?

288
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,877
Especially since we wanted to tell the story without words.

289
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,902
It's important to remember that Unravel's story was meant to be more like a painting or a poem

290
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:07,026
than a film or a comic. I had certain things in mind when I was writing it, but I tried to

291
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:12,449
move away from the details and focus on the themes instead. I didn't want there to be one

292
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:19,234
correct interpretation. I just wanted to inspire people to think for themselves,

293
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:22,776
and hopefully it would make them feel good things, and I think that it did.

294
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,468
So what we did was we just tried to fill the world with details

295
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,109
and things that would inspire stories.

296
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:33,732
You could say it's like scattered notes

297
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:36,593
that you could just pick up and find and arrange

298
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,654
into music yourselves.

299
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:44,178
And speaking of music, Unravel's soundtrack

300
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:47,139
was so important for the story.

301
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,920
Frida Johansson and Henrik Oya, they

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,862
did an absolutely amazing job creating the music.

303
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:58,009
One of the team members joked that all we really needed to do to get an emotional reaction

304
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,030
was just slap some violence on it and people are going to cry.

305
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:07,011
And I think turns a little bit more to it than that, but he's not entirely wrong either.

306
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:12,973
The whole purpose of Unravel Stories is to inspire certain emotions and to make people

307
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:13,533
think.

308
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,754
And music is just a beautiful tool to do that.

309
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,760
It's kind of like a one-two punch combo with gameplay,

310
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,520
music and gameplay.

311
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,482
One is the setup and the other is the knockout.

312
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,564
Because gameplay gives us a super direct way

313
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:32,146
to control the player's emotional journey.

314
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,383
If you take a scene like this one, the kite flight for instance, it's just, it's bound

315
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,143
to make you smile.

316
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:45,127
Even the first iteration we had when the gameplay was like super bland, it still worked emotionally.

317
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:50,890
It still made people smile because it feels light, it feels fun, it's maybe a little bit

318
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,551
thrilling as well.

319
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,733
It's like we have this big happy button we can just press to make people happy.

320
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,552
And I guess we pressed the nostalgia button quite a bit as well.

321
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:07,796
Like this scene from the summer garden of your childhood,

322
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:11,078
and now it's all unkempt and overgrown and old

323
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:16,683
and full of these links to the past that you lost.

324
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:20,225
And using nostalgia and sentimentality, it's a balancing act

325
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,687
because it can easily end up just drivel.

326
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:27,030
But I think, or at least I hope, we stayed on the right side of OK.

327
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:35,290
And I think it's worth trying because it is something that everyone can relate to in their own way.

328
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,211
It's a universal thing, but it still feels personal.

329
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:44,453
And pressing the unhappy button works pretty well too.

330
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,554
And it's so easy to use.

331
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:50,415
Actually, it's kind of almost too easy.

332
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:53,836
I mean, it's not that hard to make someone scared or worried or anxious.

333
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,136
It's like kicking in an open door.

334
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,872
I prefer to try to make people happy,

335
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:04,516
and not just like happy, happy, but profoundly happy.

336
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:06,998
And we just used all that negative stuff in Unravel

337
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,100
as a means to enhance the positive stuff.

338
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,621
We needed that contrast.

339
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,664
So things had to get a bit dark at times.

340
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:17,186
And sorry for that, but it was necessary.

341
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:18,347
And I'm not sorry about the mosquitoes.

342
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:26,514
If you've played the game, you probably hate these things.

343
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:32,191
And you should, because they're meant to be annoying.

344
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,354
Because sometimes messing with you is the best way to get the right reaction.

345
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:41,958
To me, that level is basically me as a kid picking berries with my mom

346
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,200
and being like cold and wet and miserable

347
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,182
and getting eaten alive and generally hating things.

348
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:52,245
But I was also learning that good things don't come easy.

349
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:56,907
and that when you get past the hard part, the effort sweetens the reward.

350
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:01,011
And I mean, I know it sounds like something that you would put on a card,

351
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,933
but it's still true.

352
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,515
And it applies to a lot of things.

353
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,579
And getting rid of those mosquitoes at the end of the level,

354
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,480
it feels like sweet relief.

355
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,143
It wouldn't have felt like that without the pain before.

356
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,628
Or like in a later level where there's this big, huge,

357
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:25,670
noisy, grinding, churning, booming, roaring machine

358
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,891
that's just getting louder and louder

359
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:29,391
progressively through the level.

360
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:32,112
When you finally shut that thing down,

361
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:36,034
the silence feels like an embrace.

362
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,035
It's so sweet.

363
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:41,797
It's that contrast that makes it good.

364
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:46,039
So don't worry too much about the flow state.

365
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,244
Because it's alright to mess with people sometimes.

366
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:58,754
But you can push it too far.

367
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:00,196
It didn't always work.

368
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:04,661
Everything wasn't balanced perfectly in the game.

369
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,969
we should have tested more.

370
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:09,971
I know for instance, like my son kept,

371
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,013
he got to a section on the last level

372
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:14,334
where Yarny just kept dying repeatedly.

373
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,137
It was one of those sections that was meant

374
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:18,918
to feel really dangerous,

375
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:21,480
but not actually meant to be that dangerous.

376
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,664
I think he might have stumbled onto a bug, I'm not sure.

377
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,146
But up until then, he'd had like this perfect journey.

378
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,248
He seemed to feel just exactly what I hoped

379
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:30,808
that he would feel.

380
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,830
But then you come to a section like that

381
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,611
and it takes you completely out of the illusion.

382
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:37,102
And once you lose someone like that,

383
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:41,806
you can't really count on winning them back.

384
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:44,188
Luckily, I think we did, but I mean, you can't count on it.

385
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:48,312
So it's a fine balance, and you have to test a lot,

386
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:51,454
constantly, much more than what we did.

387
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,416
So you can't test too much, it's really...

388
00:22:53,416 --> 00:23:00,422
So it wasn't perfect, but the good thing is,

389
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,585
when it worked, it really worked.

390
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:12,568
We've heard back from so many players who have had super strong reactions to the game.

391
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:17,790
I know I joked that the purpose of the game was to make people call their mothers.

392
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,812
And that happened, and it's not like half of what happened.

393
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:27,855
It's humbling to hear just how much the game has meant to some people

394
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:29,416
and how deeply it has affected them.

395
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,837
It probably wasn't that profound for everyone,

396
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,558
but still, it's surreal to think that our little game

397
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,419
did some actual proper good for people.

398
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,882
And Unravel was just our first attempt at it.

399
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,404
We were learning and making up the rules as we went along.

400
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,986
And we're only going to get better.

401
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:51,528
We're going to try harder to make games that matter.

402
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:54,289
And we're just one small part of this movement, too.

403
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:57,691
Games could have huge impact if we make it so.

404
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:04,075
And I think we need that impact now more than ever,

405
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:08,117
because the world has turned into a really scary place lately.

406
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:12,639
There are all kinds of wrongs out there that need to be set right.

407
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:16,981
And no, games won't fix all that.

408
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:20,643
I mean, as much as I would like them to, games won't crush fascism,

409
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:21,663
at least not on their own.

410
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:23,944
But someone has to,

411
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:27,986
and maybe we could help tip the scales in the right direction.

412
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,153
Because we do have a platform, we have a voice,

413
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,994
and it's our responsibility to use it.

414
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:39,978
Through our games, we can talk to literally millions of people.

415
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,160
Reaching out is easier now than it ever was.

416
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,304
And I just can't see how we could not try to use that voice for something good.

417
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:56,308
There's zero harm in trying, and maybe we can actually make a difference.

418
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,470
Because I think that games do affect us.

419
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,323
We know that people who play games are much more likely to have lucid dreams,

420
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:06,746
for instance, you know, the dreams that you can control.

421
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:13,672
And I have those things a lot, dreams that would be like horrible nightmares.

422
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,814
But I always seem to find a way to win.

423
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:21,120
I don't know why that is, but I think it's because people who play games

424
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,022
expect every problem to be solvable.

425
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,617
We always want there to be a solution,

426
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,079
and we refuse to give up until we've found that solution,

427
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,062
and we eventually figure out how to overcome any difficulty.

428
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:35,845
And that's a beautiful way of looking at things.

429
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:39,948
And if games can do that,

430
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:43,952
if they can change how we dream and how we think,

431
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:46,393
what's to say that they can't change how we act?

432
00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:51,618
That's pretty powerful, and it's definitely an opportunity.

433
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:59,500
And it would be nice if more of us try to make something good out of that opportunity.

434
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,220
Thank you for listening.

435
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:14,745
APPLAUSE

436
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:20,287
I do think we have time for some questions, if people have questions.

437
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,888
We have like three minutes or so.

438
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,057
Sure.

439
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:26,517
Hi.

440
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:28,618
Beautiful game, Unravel.

441
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:31,280
I haven't played it, but it's a beautiful game.

442
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,183
What I got from this is that Unravel is a game

443
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:38,465
about empathy for oneself.

444
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:41,086
So you play this game, and probably you

445
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:42,927
project yourself onto a wall.

446
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:46,149
I don't remember, Yarny.

447
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:50,930
And so this is a game that helps you probably self-heal.

448
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,172
It probably was a healing journey for you as well.

449
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,572
Maybe people can empathize with the creator as well.

450
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:02,033
Those are all facets of the empathy exposed here.

451
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:10,303
What I would ask you is if in the future you are thinking of fostering empathy for strangers,

452
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:18,786
so actually using empathy in a multiplayer context, because of course saving the world

453
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,608
or impacting the world starts in oneself.

454
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:26,430
You have to empathize with yourself, you have to love yourself before you can love others.

455
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:33,313
But a deeper change in the world is born from empathy with strangers in general.

456
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:41,540
So I wonder if you could elaborate on this and if this is something on your mind.

457
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:51,468
Do you want me to repeat the question? Or actually, I'll just say this.

458
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:58,374
Yes, it's true to say that this game is very much about building empathy for yourself and those close to you.

459
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:07,243
And if there was one thing that I could like add to it and improve on it, it would be just that,

460
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:15,949
to expand that circle and to include more people in that feeling of empathy, to make sure that,

461
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:28,137
you know, build solidarity, build, you know, teach people to be nice, teach people to be inclusive.

462
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:28,918
So yes, I would do exactly that.

463
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,801
Thank you.

464
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:31,441
Okay, thank you.

465
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,542
This looks like a stunning game, I have to say.

466
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:36,865
I can imagine this could be very good for developing empathy for young children.

467
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:44,170
With that in mind, are you going to produce this for Google Play or iOS?

468
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:44,390
Sorry?

469
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,635
Are you going to produce this product for Android?

470
00:28:53,382 --> 00:29:00,285
It's not really for me to say because I'm not the most technically minded person.

471
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:05,587
I certainly wouldn't mind, like every platform we can be on is nice.

472
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:09,989
Just make it more accessible for young children to have it on their device.

473
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:10,690
Yes, but...

474
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,991
Okay, thank you.

475
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:21,947
Hi, I just wanted to ask, for a game whose narrative is so strongly visual,

476
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,148
what was the writing process like?

477
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:27,410
Did it involve lots of storyboarding, or photography, or mood boards,

478
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,432
or a combination of all different sorts of elements?

479
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:35,354
Photography was very much a big part of it.

480
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,995
It sort of started with how the concept was created.

481
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:52,647
Basically, I mean, I don't know if you've heard this, but I was out camping in the woods and made this little doll and just ran around with it and started taking pictures of it doing strange things.

482
00:29:52,647 --> 00:30:00,130
Because I didn't have any other tools except for camera and what I could find.

483
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,331
So photography was always like a big part of the process.

484
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:05,752
And.

485
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:09,847
since the whole thing about family bonds

486
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:14,408
was also such an important part right from the start,

487
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:17,069
I actually started with our photo albums.

488
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,310
So a lot of the content was not actually created

489
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,131
for the gamers, which is things that I found

490
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:29,932
that felt appropriate.

491
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:33,233
So it was more, yeah, I don't know, I'm rambling a bit,

492
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,953
but it was pretty much like.

493
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:40,634
my photo album and scissors and lots of glue.

494
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:43,836
I appreciated what you said about building games that

495
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:45,717
matter.

496
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:51,340
This is something that's been on my mind for the last few

497
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,083
years, and I wondered if you have been able to find any

498
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:02,387
communities or groups that connect around these topics

499
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:03,107
that.

500
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,433
that you'd be able to point out?

501
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,774
I'd love to join the conversation

502
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:10,495
in the broader sense of the gaming community,

503
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,476
if that's something you know of.

504
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:14,257
I feel like it's a movement

505
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:17,078
within the entire gaming community right now.

506
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:19,239
And I think that's a really beautiful thing,

507
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,999
that people are trying to be more inclusive

508
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:22,600
and they're trying to be more responsible

509
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,921
about what they make.

510
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:27,422
So while I can't point you to a specific thing,

511
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:28,482
I know there are some,

512
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:32,144
but I can't figure them out right now up here.

513
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:37,269
But yeah, I mean, it feels like the entire industry

514
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,751
is shifting towards that, and it makes me really happy

515
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,014
to see that people care more about what they make

516
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:46,118
and care more about the impact of what they make.

517
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:49,661
Absolutely, thank you, and thank you for making this game.

518
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,243
Thank you.

519
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,305
I guess that's all we had time for, so.

520
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:55,167
Thanks a lot for coming.
