1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:07,779
Accessibility, practical fixes from EA Madden's NFL franchise.

2
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:13,362
I'm Karen Stevens and I'm a software engineer on the Madden team, Electronic Arts, and occasionally

3
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:15,723
I'm also a product owner.

4
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,845
Interesting story behind that.

5
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:24,308
So quite a few years ago I had a friend tell me, I said, oh I know you're a huge Raiders

6
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:24,668
fan.

7
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,430
Are you looking forward to playing the next version of Madden?

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,111
And he replied, I can't play Madden.

9
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,253
I'm like, well, why can't you play?

10
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,394
And he's like, well, I'm low vision.

11
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:34,174
I said, yeah, I know.

12
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:37,697
He's like, well, that means that anything that moves, I

13
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,779
have a really hard time seeing if it's too small.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,382
So like, pass icons, for example, or anything that

15
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:46,364
moves on the field, I don't have time to react.

16
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,045
I can't see it.

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,866
So I don't know how to catch the ball.

18
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,348
So I had to give up playing.

19
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,290
I said, well, I can't promise you anything.

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,351
But I can say this.

21
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:58,314
If I ever get an opportunity to do something about that, I

22
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:58,514
will.

23
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:05,659
So fast forward to summer of 2014, Tiburon Game Studios, EA

24
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,101
Game Studios, had an internal game jam.

25
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,884
So my feature was Madden Game Accessibility, and it happened

26
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:14,365
to win for best feature.

27
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,228
So that allowed me to pitch the idea and get some

28
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:22,551
traction, and this is what came in to Madden 17.

29
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:27,514
So what is accessibility?

30
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:31,768
Disability is a mismatch between a person and their

31
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:32,328
environment.

32
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:34,930
Accessibility is correction of this mismatch.

33
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,392
By this definition, you could actually say a tall person is

34
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,735
disabled if they're on an airplane, because they do not

35
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:42,876
match their environment.

36
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,438
Actually saying that someone has a hearing impairment,

37
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,519
that's a medical condition.

38
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,360
That doesn't actually define who they are.

39
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,623
So when we design software, we can design it to try to

40
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,665
include as many people as possible, and that's what

41
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:57,826
accessibility is.

42
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:01,628
Here you see two charities listed.

43
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:05,749
Both of these charities, and there are many others, these

44
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,290
two happen to focus mostly on configurable controllers and

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,511
actual solutions for people who can't use their hands or

46
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,971
have trouble with fine motor skills.

47
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:17,832
They provide them options.

48
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,592
And that's great, but hardware only goes so far.

49
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,113
It's important to consider this at a software level, too.

50
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,744
Accessibility is a mindset.

51
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,905
It's not just one feature.

52
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:34,045
It's considering your user the entire way through.

53
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,586
So it's really a form of usability.

54
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,286
It's cheaper to plan it than to try to tack it on as an

55
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:40,887
afterthought.

56
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,907
We all know what happens when you have feature creep.

57
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,527
Things can quickly get out of scope.

58
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,588
So it's good to think about it from the very beginning.

59
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:51,528
And it doesn't mean that it has to be that expensive.

60
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,569
Everything you saw here was done within a month.

61
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,651
Almost entirely by me.

62
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:05,076
So I took the role of product owner, designer, developer, I did some UI placeholder art,

63
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:06,577
I pretty much did the whole thing.

64
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,441
So it doesn't take much, necessarily, to get a big win with your audience.

65
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,144
So why is this important?

66
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:23,767
Well, 19% of the U.S. population currently has some form of disability.

67
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,685
25% of today's 20-year-olds will be disabled by retirement.

68
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:30,846
You may wonder why these numbers don't match.

69
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:35,028
It is true that many people who have a disability also have

70
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,989
health issues which may reduce the mortality rate,

71
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,110
and that's why these numbers don't quite match.

72
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,832
The presentation here is mainly focused on visual issues,

73
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:47,653
and it's interesting that 25 million are visually impaired,

74
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,254
and about 1 in 12 men, 1 in 200 women, are colorblind.

75
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,497
And that is not included in those visually impaired

76
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:55,877
numbers.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,301
So I'm sure everybody here has already used

78
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,242
the accessible feature.

79
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:06,904
How many people have, in their game, set a brightness

80
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:09,045
setting, contrast, gamma control?

81
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,887
Have you been in a bar and seen subtitles on the TV?

82
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,128
All those are accessibility settings.

83
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,891
You may want to do something like, you know, you have a

84
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,293
child, you don't want to wake up, so you mute the TV.

85
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,555
You're eating something, so you really don't want to use

86
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,116
two hands.

87
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,419
All this are technically accessibility, even though

88
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,902
really there is nothing disabled about you.

89
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:37,390
So yes, as I said earlier, there are many settings such

90
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,210
as volume control that already exists.

91
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,233
Now, one pushback I heard is, well, this is fundamentally

92
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:45,693
changing your appearance of the game.

93
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,475
What if you go on YouTube and you see the game looks

94
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,835
different than you would expect?

95
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,816
How are we going to communicate this?

96
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,438
So the solution was, and I know it's hard to see here,

97
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:00,179
which is intentional, is a light watermark that sits in

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,959
the bottom corner.

99
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,661
And it will let us know that if someone's like, why is this

100
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,621
so strange looking?

101
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,702
We can say, well, they have an accessibility setting turned

102
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,263
on, and I can see this little watermark.

103
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:15,126
And the settings can be used to prevent altering the

104
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,246
original game experience.

105
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:19,588
So Madden without any accessibility turned on is

106
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,889
pretty much what you would expect based on the previous

107
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,850
versions of the series.

108
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,386
So here are the Madden accessibility settings.

109
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,289
As I mentioned, I was a one-man band for this.

110
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,352
There's a few consequences and rooms for improvement.

111
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:37,833
This is a journey.

112
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,855
This is not a single step in the process.

113
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:42,657
So they are there, but they're a little buried.

114
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,900
They're a little buried because I did the UI myself,

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,261
and I'm not a UI developer.

116
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,962
So I kind of just did the best I could to

117
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,684
make sure it shipped.

118
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,006
I'm hoping that at some point, maybe we can

119
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:53,726
polish that a little.

120
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:54,807
But this is sufficient.

121
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:55,888
You can turn it on, turn it off.

122
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:56,308
Works great.

123
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:03,447
So size, so we talked about enlarge.

124
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,311
It's pretty obvious to say things should be big enough so

125
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:07,871
you can see them.

126
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:11,158
And there should be enough contrast so you can tell what they are.

127
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,119
This kind of puts numbers to it.

128
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,222
Now, I'll admit that I've been to accessibility talks this week since I started writing these

129
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:23,703
slides and I saw a recommendation of instead of 30 pixels tall to use 40.

130
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:26,705
I would say use as big as you can.

131
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,906
Like if you can do 40, by all means do that.

132
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:30,826
That's a great idea.

133
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,508
I did not get that information until this week, which is why it's not on the slide deck.

134
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,409
30 is good, too.

135
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,151
I would not recommend smaller than 30.

136
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:44,576
If you go onto forums and you look at what sizes people start to complain about, you'll

137
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:48,639
notice that around anything below 30, you get increasing number of complaints the lower

138
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:48,980
you go.

139
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,563
So, I would recommend keeping things as big as possible.

140
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,809
4.5 to 1 contrast ratio is pretty much an industry

141
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,471
standard. I know that's kind of a vague thing, so I have an

142
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:04,113
addendum slide that covers tool and resources links, so you can

143
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:10,456
actually see what that means. So, as I mentioned, my friend

144
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,737
couldn't see the pass icons. Here's an example of what the

145
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:16,979
pass icons normally look like. They're the little buttons that

146
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,001
are above players' heads. This is what happens when you turn

147
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:20,441
enlarge on.

148
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,211
So it's significantly bigger.

149
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,412
And between the two, my friend was able to now play Madden

150
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,533
again, because he can now see the pass icons.

151
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,974
It doesn't just affect the pass icons.

152
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:38,656
It affects anything that is like a button-type thing that

153
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,977
would appear on the field in Madden.

154
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:44,278
So if there's like a tackle battle icon, there's a catch

155
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,059
icon, all of them would be enlarged.

156
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:53,073
So at the same time, enlarge changes the kick meter.

157
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,334
The kick meter usually lies in the field.

158
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:56,654
It might be angled up a little bit.

159
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:59,316
But it moves around depending on your camera angle.

160
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:03,918
And its size can vary depending on your camera angle, which

161
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,780
can be a little hard for somebody with a visual

162
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,241
impairment to find, let alone use.

163
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:15,004
So to counteract that, when you turn on enlarge, instead

164
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,185
of it being in world space.

165
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,184
It switches to screen space.

166
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:22,086
So it's always in the exact same location, and it's large

167
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,926
and easy to see, and you know exactly

168
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:24,787
where it's going to be.

169
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:28,889
So this made it a lot easier for people like my friend, who

170
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:30,389
would be like, where is that thing?

171
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,730
I can't make out the line.

172
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,330
It's too thin.

173
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,050
It's too small.

174
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:34,411
This solves it for him.

175
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,392
And it really wasn't hard to do.

176
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,174
Literally, this one, I think, only took a day.

177
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,146
So reception.

178
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:51,507
The same time I announced on EA's news forum

179
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,468
that Madden was coming out with accessibility features,

180
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,008
I also created an EA accessible Twitter account,

181
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,269
which I have on a later slide.

182
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,909
And I created an accessibility feedback email

183
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,350
so I can get people's reaction and information and things.

184
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,771
So I had a better idea of how we were meeting our users' needs.

185
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:17,395
So it was an overwhelming positive response when they heard about these features.

186
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:23,218
As you see here, I know they're kind of small, but like, as a visually impaired person, this

187
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,542
may be the best news from EA since before CFM, which is like one of our franchise modes.

188
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,204
I want to thank you for these suggestions.

189
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:34,846
I've been struggling to tell the difference between a circle and a square, but no longer.

190
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:40,162
Great addition, I don't have the best eyes anymore, so this makes me happy. And so on and so

191
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:47,454
forth. It's just, it was overwhelming positive, which was really great to see. Power post

192
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:47,975
processing.

193
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,962
So one thing about Madden is we have lots of assets.

194
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:57,084
And it would be not really feasible for us to make an

195
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:59,505
extra version of all of them to cover accessibility.

196
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,127
So we had to come up with something that would cover the

197
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,748
game and be adequate for our needs.

198
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:11,211
So looking at this, we put in some sort of filter that

199
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,992
covered colorblind, brightness, and contrast.

200
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:16,373
And it did not require any asset changes.

201
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:22,398
As I said earlier, it affects 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women.

202
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,540
This amounts to over half a million Madden players.

203
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,443
That's a lot of people who can't see our game very well.

204
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:35,065
So to illustrate exactly what this means,

205
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:41,208
The NFL kind of ran into this head first last season, where

206
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,891
they had an all red team versus an all green team.

207
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,433
And this is what the two teams looked like on the TV screen.

208
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,076
People couldn't tell which team was which.

209
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,960
And since then, the NFL has decided they've hired a

210
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,542
colorblind specialist to make sure that the matchups of the

211
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:03,685
teams next year can always be detected with people who are

212
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:04,205
colorblind.

213
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:09,409
Well, that's great for the NFL that they can do that, but with Madden, you can pick any

214
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,330
uniform you want.

215
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,615
So because of that, we can't do, especially since people may pay real world money to use

216
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:21,618
our particular uniforms in certain cases, we can't do that to them.

217
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,782
So then it becomes down to, okay, so how do we solve that problem?

218
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,043
We need to solve something.

219
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,313
Now, in addition to the red versus green problem, we also

220
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,234
had a UI issue, multiple really.

221
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:38,515
Here's one of the more painful ones.

222
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,598
The image on the left is the way a normal color vision

223
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,438
person would see this.

224
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,439
The one on the right is somebody who has red-weak

225
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,300
color blindness.

226
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,102
As you can see, the dark red arrow in particular kind of

227
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:53,662
disappears.

228
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,354
The problem is that putting red on black is actually pretty

229
00:11:58,394 --> 00:11:59,114
common in Madden.

230
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:03,677
So this was causing numerous issues, not just I'm confused

231
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,799
on what color is, it's oh, I didn't know

232
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,719
there was UI there.

233
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,162
So primary goal was to fix this.

234
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,143
I didn't know it was there.

235
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,605
If you don't know it's there, it doesn't really matter what

236
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:15,145
color it is.

237
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:22,630
So secondary goal was to make it so people would be able to tell the difference between

238
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,110
the arrows.

239
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,311
So since I'm going to refer to this many times, this is called play call.

240
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:28,391
This is what it looks like.

241
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,252
As you see here, there's different arrows.

242
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:33,213
And these arrows are more than just these colors.

243
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,514
We have a wide variety of colors.

244
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:36,974
So

245
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:43,779
Here I looked at now the colors you want to avoid here are red,

246
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,462
orange, yellow, green, those combinations.

247
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:50,846
So to ask do we ever do that in Madden, we kind of do it all

248
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:51,546
over the place.

249
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:54,128
In fact, it's more common for us to do it than not do it.

250
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,051
So it was definitely an issue.

251
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:01,535
Some people couldn't see certain areas on the field at all.

252
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,418
So that definitely needed to be addressed.

253
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,150
So I looked at math fixes.

254
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,011
I tried Daltonization, just standard Daltonization.

255
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,212
It's an algorithm by Stanford University.

256
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:18,913
It calculates where a person's vision is weakest in color,

257
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,654
and it shifts it and reduces the color space

258
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:22,935
to where it's strongest.

259
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,516
So that's great.

260
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,056
It was designed for videos and photographs,

261
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:30,017
and it works awesome for those cases.

262
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:35,433
Unfortunately, that's not a video game. A video game has lots of really bright colors,

263
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:40,936
and it turns out that Daltonization tends to squish the colors so they're on top of each other,

264
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:46,519
which meant that when I applied it to Playcall, for example, we had some issues of normal vision

265
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,481
in people not being able to tell the arrows apart. So, like, no one can tell them apart.

266
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:57,084
So, great idea, didn't quite work, so I modified it.

267
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:02,879
I realized that there's a way you can shift the colors around, so instead of having the

268
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:09,183
worst possible case scenario for games, you can improve it so you can differentiate bright

269
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:09,803
colors more.

270
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:17,948
And the way I tested this was I used PlayCall first, and I invited colorblind individuals

271
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:22,491
over and asked, how many colors do you see, and where do you see them?

272
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,542
I didn't want to leave them.

273
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,265
I didn't want to give them any indication of what the answer would be.

274
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:33,129
And I'll tell you, the first time I had someone go and say, well, these two are obviously

275
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,850
the same color.

276
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,752
And I'm like, I obviously have more work to do.

277
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:37,774
I'll call you back in a couple days.

278
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:45,200
So it took a few iterations, but we got to the point where originally only about one

279
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,863
third of people could relatively tell the colors.

280
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,733
to everybody could tell exactly how many colors there were.

281
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,494
And then I got feedback of, oh my god,

282
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,794
why are there so many colors?

283
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:57,554
What do they do?

284
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,115
I thought I knew how to play this game.

285
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:00,735
I've been on Madden for years, and I

286
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,716
have no idea what I'm doing.

287
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,716
So that's a good problem to have.

288
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,757
That means you have work to do, but that's

289
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,598
like the best possible outcome.

290
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,779
There was a very negligible hit on game performance.

291
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,420
It was this tiny fraction of a millisecond.

292
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:17,821
We didn't really notice it at all.

293
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:22,775
For those of you who are graphics oriented, for our

294
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:27,457
version, it did not require a full screen pass. Madden uses

295
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,199
FXAA to smooth out jagged edges in game play.

296
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,939
So we put it on there.

297
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,821
And then we also put it on the UI that was

298
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:37,862
not affected by that.

299
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,583
So just by tacking on to existing things, we could

300
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:43,204
shift the colors around, and we didn't have

301
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,264
to do anything else.

302
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,485
And that's one of the reasons why it was so cheap.

303
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:51,789
So bonuses is that in order to do my modified version, it

304
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:55,511
partially is using brightness and contrast controls, which I

305
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:56,332
also expose.

306
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,533
Those can also help a lot of people.

307
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:05,017
So here's an example of how this changed.

308
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,799
So the image on the right and the bottom are both someone

309
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:09,580
who's colorblind.

310
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,813
The image on the left is the original image.

311
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,436
As you can see, if you look on the right image, how the red

312
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:18,838
arrows are almost gone, they're very visible on the

313
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:19,519
bottom image.

314
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,600
They look more blue.

315
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,444
So this significantly helped people's ability to see

316
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,624
everything on the screen.

317
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:31,307
And we had a lot of people who are now confused because they

318
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:32,828
could see things they couldn't before.

319
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,820
So this is what it looks like when it's applied to the whole

320
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,401
game for a normal vision user.

321
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,303
As you can see, it doesn't look that different.

322
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,405
It really depends on what type of color blindness you have.

323
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:51,807
And by the way, I'm not saying this is a one-stop-fix-all

324
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,148
things. First of all, it had to be tuned in order for the

325
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,489
overlap to fall in a good spot.

326
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:04,981
Second of all, this doesn't mean that if you're doing palette swapping instead, that's necessarily bad.

327
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:10,385
I would just encourage you to consider your background colors when you're doing that,

328
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:16,869
to make sure that you're not inadvertently moving the colors around and then blending into your background when you're colorblind.

329
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:19,090
Because I've seen that happen quite a bit too.

330
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,072
There really is no silver bullet.

331
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:28,440
Each approach is valid, but this worked really well for Madden and will work well for similar

332
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,841
titles.

333
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:33,642
So reception.

334
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:38,464
This is a minor thing to most of us, but people with colorblindness and eye troubles,

335
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:38,944
it's huge.

336
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:44,264
Lots of thank yous, lots of people saying that this is the best thing ever.

337
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:49,185
It was overwhelmingly positive. We have lots of people who didn't, like I said,

338
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:53,827
didn't realize they didn't understand the game the way they expected it to be.

339
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:59,368
So it was very gratifying to see that it helped so many people.

340
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:06,172
I also, like I said, added brightness and contrast support.

341
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,352
I support five levels of each.

342
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:12,033
Here's the brightness and then here's the contrast.

343
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,814
Here's a bonus to the brightness and contrast.

344
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,754
So like I said, there's no silver bullet.

345
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:24,996
I got an email a few weeks ago from somebody who was complaining about, did anybody who

346
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,457
was color blind actually test this?

347
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,357
It didn't work for me.

348
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,277
I can't see it at all.

349
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:31,620
So I asked, I'm sorry, you're having issues.

350
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,744
Can you please tell me a little bit of information?

351
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:36,726
What settings are you using?

352
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,989
What type of color blindness do you have?

353
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,414
And have you tried increasing the contrast value?

354
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,276
I never heard from them again.

355
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,936
until about like, oh, a week ago or so.

356
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,638
And then I saw somebody reference on a Twitter,

357
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,359
the person referenced me on Twitter saying,

358
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,141
yeah, you should talk to this person.

359
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:56,241
She's super helpful.

360
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,123
And I'm like, oh, OK.

361
00:18:58,163 --> 00:18:59,043
So it did work for you.

362
00:18:59,104 --> 00:18:59,284
Great.

363
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,924
That's good to know.

364
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,886
Before that, I'm like, well, I'm not going to hassle them.

365
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:07,371
But, yeah, no, so it was really useful to have that there.

366
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:12,716
So people who have significant issues, and that person even admitted that they had a

367
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,979
severe form of colorblindness.

368
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,941
So that was really helpful.

369
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:22,226
Recap, it's a mindset, not a feature.

370
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:26,207
It really should be considered at every step in the development process.

371
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:30,629
It really should be considered from the requirements phase.

372
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:37,431
Like when we had mock-ups for even the current version of Madden, I went through with the

373
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,432
art directors and said, okay, I see your mock-ups on the web.

374
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:41,672
They're like, oh no, those aren't real yet.

375
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,153
I'm like, I know, that's why we're talking about it now, before we implement them.

376
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:49,196
So to go through we actually corrected some things. The best

377
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:51,458
thing you can possibly do is correct things before you

378
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:56,622
actually do them. So a lot of the biggest wins are things

379
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,305
you'll never know about, which is actually a plus. It's

380
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,928
possible to have big wins cheaply. Like I said here,

381
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,190
everything here was under a month. It wasn't much at all.

382
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:14,646
and engage your audience. Not just, you know, for warm fuzziness, but like what I do is I

383
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:21,628
take all this feedback in and I have an internal website I made and I compile different games

384
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:27,050
into different web pages and then I can send links off to other teams saying, all these

385
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,051
people have a problem with this feature in your game. We should really talk about this.

386
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:35,214
And it gives a lot more momentum behind it.

387
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:38,097
That's really the best way for me to get things done right

388
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,419
now, is just based on user feedback.

389
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,981
And it gives an idea of where our pain points are.

390
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,583
And I would encourage you all to do something.

391
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,324
It could be as simple as setting up a Twitter account.

392
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:47,925
That's what I did.

393
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:51,287
To just get information from your audience and find out

394
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:52,728
what they really need.

395
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,168
So the Twitter account is EA accessible.

396
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,229
I recommend following it if you're interested in future

397
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:05,229
updates on anything to do with accessibility for Madden.

398
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,530
Accessibility feedback at EA.com is the email that's

399
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,691
used externally for gathering feedback.

400
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:15,692
If you don't remember that, if you remember the Twitter

401
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,132
account, the email is listed in the profile of the Twitter

402
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:18,433
account.

403
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,614
So there are additional slides in this deck that cover tool

404
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:24,574
and reference links.

405
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,159
So here's some examples.

406
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,960
Don't worry.

407
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,601
It's in the vault, by the way, so you don't have to worry

408
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:32,361
about that too much.

409
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:35,023
If you can't access it, I've already been given permission

410
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,503
to share it externally.

411
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:40,585
So if you go back to the accessibility feedback or the

412
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,307
Twitter, either way, and give me your contact information,

413
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:44,727
I'll make sure you get it.

414
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,905
And here's the funny part. The code's actually in the slide deck. So the brightness, contrast,

415
00:21:54,945 --> 00:22:03,373
and all this is literally small enough to be in the notes. All of it is actually in

416
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:10,440
the note. If you get the PDF files, the PDF files, the last couple of pages of the PDF

417
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,923
is the code. And yes, I did clear this with legal first.

418
00:22:15,262 --> 00:22:20,564
If you have any questions about using it or questions, legal questions about it, once again,

419
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:25,165
contact me and I'll make sure you get in touch with the right people. You've probably, a lot of

420
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:28,646
you may have already spoken to me because I've been walking the floor saying, have you

421
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:34,108
considered colorblind support? And been handing out literal packets of paper. If any of you

422
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:39,689
would like a packet now, I have a few left. Not many, but a few. So yes, I would say

423
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:42,210
definitely look in the vault. And...

424
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:45,381
Yes, thank you. Does anybody have any questions?

425
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,073
No questions? You have a question?

426
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:59,294
Hello. As you know, I also worked on a title where we retrofitted some accessibility features.

427
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:05,339
But I was wondering, so one of the things that I kept running into was it would be a

428
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,562
feature but it would be a feature outside my team. You know, not my group of developers

429
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:14,165
I was working with but, you know, someone else. So how do you go about, you kind of

430
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,688
mentioned talking to some of the other teams, but when you find something that isn't yours

431
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:22,171
that you need, you realize it could be more accessible, how do you kind of start that

432
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:23,032
conversation?

433
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,958
So unfortunately, first of all, I'm hearing impaired.

434
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,379
Second of all, the echo is distorting your voice.

435
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,980
So I'm not entirely clear.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,720
Can you come closer?

437
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,141
I'll repeat your question.

438
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:39,123
So when you find an accessibility feature or

439
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:41,063
something that isn't accessible and you want to get

440
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,265
it updated, but it's not within your team, you kind of

441
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:46,305
mentioned already talking to some of the other teams.

442
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:49,046
How do you go about working with people outside your group

443
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:49,487
to get them to work?

444
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:50,667
Cool.

445
00:23:51,526 --> 00:23:54,572
The question is, if I got feedback from a team other than

446
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:57,738
Madden, how do I go about getting that information back

447
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:58,219
to the team?

448
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,681
Couple of ways.

449
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:00,763
First of all,

450
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,751
About a year ago, I created an internal email list.

451
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,834
So people inside of EA who are particularly interested in

452
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:12,377
accessibility are on it, which covers actually a surprising

453
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:13,918
good cross-section of the company.

454
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,140
So that gives me a starting point of

455
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,341
contacting other teams.

456
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:20,084
And usually based on that, I can find the right person.

457
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,666
And I just have a list of names basically at this point

458
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:25,028
where I go to get feedback.

459
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:28,291
Yes?

460
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:34,379
So it's kind of related to the last question.

461
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,601
So other teams that you passed on feedback to,

462
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,862
what is their response to it being a reaction?

463
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:43,583
Have you got any tips for others when you do the same thing?

464
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:47,045
So the question was, how do other teams

465
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:48,225
react to getting feedback?

466
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,243
They've been pretty good about it, really.

467
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:51,604
I mean, generally speaking, people

468
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,486
want to know if people are having

469
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,627
trouble using your software.

470
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:56,828
None of us are sitting down saying,

471
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,170
I want to write games that people can't use.

472
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,053
So generally speaking, they're pretty

473
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,575
interested in finding out what people are having trouble with.

474
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:10,138
Yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean things move quickly.

475
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,081
Just because they are all big games, they're pretty much all

476
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,164
AAA titles, and it can take a while.

477
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,445
So it doesn't mean necessarily something is going to be hit

478
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:21,807
immediately, but at least they're aware of it and have

479
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,690
the opportunity to address it, which they wouldn't otherwise.

480
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:26,431
Anything else?

481
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:30,174
No?

482
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:34,577
OK then.

483
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:36,699
Well, thank you all so much for coming.
