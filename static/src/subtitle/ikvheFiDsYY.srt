1
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:06,477
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,520
Welcome to my talk, Design in Detail.

3
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:17,403
First, I'd like to thank GDC.

4
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,504
And I'd especially like to thank them for putting me up

5
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:20,765
against the doom post-mortem.

6
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,446
I'm sure that our audiences don't overlap at all.

7
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,748
So please turn off your pagers.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,292
And this is an advanced design talk.

9
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,518
I'm going to talk very fast.

10
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:35,559
We're going to cover a lot of stuff.

11
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:38,021
If you don't get it all, don't worry about it.

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,221
We're going to put the slides up.

13
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:41,283
And I'll stick around for questions

14
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:42,364
for a long time afterward.

15
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:44,105
And I'm just going to wait until somebody laughs

16
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,466
at the joke that's on the screen.

17
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:48,048
And then, thank you, Marty.

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,929
And then I'm going to go on.

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,751
So who am I?

20
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,313
I have 13 years of industry experience,

21
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,676
mostly as a game designer on all of the Halo games,

22
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,917
especially the first three, with just a little bit

23
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:01,378
on ODST and Reach.

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:02,960
I did.

25
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:07,676
The balancing of the campaign difficulty and also the multiplayer side, as well as the

26
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:11,698
tuning of all the weapons, characters, vehicles, and other gameplay elements.

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,961
My opinions do not represent those of Bungie management, which is probably why I don't

28
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,761
work there anymore.

29
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:24,264
So last year I gave a talk that was inspired by this painting.

30
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:26,725
It's the Sunday afternoon on La Grande Jatte.

31
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:31,348
And what's really interesting about this painting is the closer that you get to it, the more

32
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:32,488
detail comes out.

33
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:32,788
And so...

34
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,103
That inspired me to do a talk where

35
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:37,404
I took a really trivial detail from Halo,

36
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:41,727
examined it exhaustively, and tried

37
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,448
to explain the design process behind it

38
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:45,669
and draw universal conclusions from that.

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,651
It was a pretty popular talk, so the GDC guy said,

40
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:49,732
come back next year.

41
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:51,193
You can do any talk you want.

42
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:53,975
So this is going to be my talk about what

43
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,016
non-designers need to know.

44
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:56,236
No, I'm just kidding.

45
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:57,337
GDC wanted a sequel.

46
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,318
So I was looking around for inspiration,

47
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:04,299
and there's a great series, actually,

48
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,342
of paintings by Monet, where he paints haystacks, which is not

49
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,043
maybe the most inspiring object.

50
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,784
But what he does is he paints them

51
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,986
from several different angles, during different seasons,

52
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:17,848
different times of day, under different lighting.

53
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:23,091
And so his theme was to revisit the same subject matter

54
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:23,791
multiple times.

55
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,834
And so my idea was, I'll revisit the same design decision

56
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:29,475
over several different games.

57
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,712
Last year I spent a little bit too much time on the abstract.

58
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,632
I didn't get to the meat enough.

59
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:39,153
So I'm going to start right in with the detail.

60
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,414
And any time I get abstract, I'm going to have blue slides

61
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,374
so you can tune out if that's an issue to you.

62
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:47,015
So the muzzle velocity is the speed

63
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,856
that the projectile comes out of the gun of the plasma rifle,

64
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,276
which is sort of the alien SMG.

65
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,237
It comes out in bolts.

66
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,537
That's the name of the projectile.

67
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:56,178
Legendary difficulty, which is the hardest difficulty

68
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:57,018
in the game.

69
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:01,415
across the Halo franchise, and if you don't know what Halo is, I don't know why you're

70
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:03,316
here.

71
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,498
So isn't this the same talk as last year?

72
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,120
How much more can you say about a weapon projectile?

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,284
Well, the sniper rifle was primarily a multiplayer talk, whereas this is going to focus largely

74
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:15,905
on single player.

75
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:20,148
The sniper rifle is shot by the player, whereas the plasma rifle is predominantly shot at

76
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:20,488
the player.

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,903
I talked a lot about active flow, sort of cadence and rhythm and firing a weapon.

78
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,365
This is going to be much more about reactive flow, the environment's effect on the player.

79
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:36,628
The sniper rifle was primarily balanced for a competitive environment, whereas the plasma

80
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:39,710
rifle is tuned for a difficulty level.

81
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,311
Which brings me to the most, I think, important point.

82
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:48,335
The last year's talk was about balancing, and this year's talk is about tuning.

83
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,076
So what's the difference?

84
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,068
Well, balance is really fundamentally about longevity.

85
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,428
It's about being able to play the game indefinitely

86
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:59,569
without the developer having to change things or fix things.

87
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,530
And so what you do is you design an element in passes.

88
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,410
You try to keep the game in a state that

89
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,710
is continually playable.

90
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,411
And then you release it to the community,

91
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,111
and they remove all the stuff they don't like.

92
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,451
And what you have left is something

93
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:16,312
that at least some small set, if you're lucky,

94
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,372
is going to continue playing indefinitely.

95
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,662
And it has nothing to do with fun.

96
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,503
In fact, most of the time, once the community gets done

97
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:23,784
with the game, it isn't fun anymore.

98
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,586
On the other hand, tuning is all about fun.

99
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,587
It happens all at once.

100
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,588
And usually, if it happens for one player,

101
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,469
it's going to happen for most of your audience.

102
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,630
And it needs to happen before release,

103
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,750
or it's just never going to happen.

104
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,671
It's very wispy.

105
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,913
It's hard to nail down just what exactly is fun.

106
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,573
And that's one of the things I'm going to try to tackle,

107
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:45,714
the blue chunks.

108
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,615
And it has nothing to do with balance.

109
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:48,175
A lot of times.

110
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,584
precisely because something is unbalanced is the reason why it's fun.

111
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:58,107
So you know how looking back on Star Wars, you thought it was about Luke, and really

112
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,167
it's all about Darth Vader?

113
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,589
Looking back on Halo, we could have named it Plasma Rifle because really that's what

114
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:03,989
it's all about.

115
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,652
So before I start getting into Halo 1, I want you to imagine that you're standing on a stage,

116
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:15,913
much like I'm standing on a stage, and you're in a room full of people, and they're laughing

117
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:16,214
at you.

118
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:17,614
Now.

119
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,476
If you're doing stand-up comedy, that's great.

120
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,138
If you're doing nude modeling, not so good.

121
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,860
If you're doing a GDC talk, as long as it's only some laughter.

122
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,044
So really, context is what I'm trying to get at here.

123
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,206
It colors every experience that you're going to have.

124
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,247
And it's very individual.

125
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:40,349
It has to do with your personal history

126
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,390
and what skills and experience you have.

127
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,092
And it really determines what you're expecting,

128
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:45,872
what your standards are.

129
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,246
You'll find that for a single game,

130
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:50,866
they often share a context.

131
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,427
They have a shared background and expectations.

132
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:56,067
And it's completely outside of your control.

133
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,648
Perhaps you can choose your context

134
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,228
by choosing your audience.

135
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,709
But most likely, you're going to inherit an audience

136
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:02,649
that you're going to have to please.

137
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,970
So when we started Halo 1, we looked at our competition,

138
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,390
which was Warcraft 2, until we stopped being an RTS.

139
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:17,132
And then it was Quake 2, which has some really unique sort

140
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:17,212
of.

141
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,380
visible projectile weapons, and some really common guards,

142
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,221
and just a ludicrously fast space marine.

143
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:28,722
We played a lot of tribes, which has similar kind of weapons,

144
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:32,523
and also this jetpacking, ludicrously fast space soldier.

145
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:36,824
Unreal, even more unique weapons,

146
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:41,045
and a really fast space soldier.

147
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:44,146
And then we looked at even our own game, where we had the four

148
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,007
which shot this slow projectile.

149
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,827
He was a really fast security officer.

150
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,831
So another aspect of context that you need to look at

151
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,333
is the community that's formed by your audience.

152
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,414
For us, it was going to be Myth fans,

153
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,675
but we weren't really sure they were

154
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:02,476
going to be action gamers.

155
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:03,657
Are they going to be into Halo?

156
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:05,518
There were Mac gamers who, at the time,

157
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,179
were feeling a little betrayed because we were going

158
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,901
to be on Microsoft's console.

159
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,523
And there were Marathon fans, but Marathon fans

160
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,224
totally embraced the mouse.

161
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,625
And were they going to be able to switch over

162
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:15,225
to be with a controller?

163
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,514
On the other hand, we had this new Xbox community,

164
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:18,895
which we didn't really know a ton about.

165
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:19,915
We thought it was gonna be younger,

166
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,436
so maybe less sophisticated.

167
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,517
And they were gonna have to deal with controllers,

168
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:26,298
so how was that gonna hurt their input?

169
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,039
So we decided we're gonna try to bring

170
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,240
both of these audiences in.

171
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,601
But it turns out the most important context

172
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:35,143
for the plasma rifle is the in-game context.

173
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,884
So in the story, the plasma rifle is used

174
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:39,765
by the Covenant Elites,

175
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,446
which is sort of the backbone of the Alien Menace.

176
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,367
It's their assault rifle.

177
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:48,160
And technically we couldn't push a lot of enemies on screen.

178
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,801
So each of these guys had to be pretty powerful.

179
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,721
So we needed a kind of a potent weapon.

180
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:57,242
In multiplayer, we really wanted to use every single player

181
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,903
weapon in multiplayer, not just because then you'd

182
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,663
be playing the same game in both arenas,

183
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:03,884
but because we didn't really have that many weapons in Halo 1.

184
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,844
But we didn't really have a clear idea

185
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:10,045
of what the multiplayer role was going to be for the plasma

186
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:10,325
rifle.

187
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,331
Now in single player, there's two things that are important.

188
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,153
One, it's the most common scavenged weapon.

189
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,654
So in Halo, you're always picking up weapons

190
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:17,234
off the ground.

191
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,715
And since a lot of the enemies use it,

192
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,057
you end up using this weapon yourself quite often.

193
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,699
And also, it's the most common enemy projectile coming at you.

194
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,401
Which means for difficulty, since it's

195
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,862
the most common enemy projectile,

196
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:29,683
it's a very large factor.

197
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,585
As goes the plasma rifle, there goes the rest of the game.

198
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,867
And actually, when it comes to the franchise,

199
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,709
it's the most common enemy projectile.

200
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,490
And it's sort of astounding how.

201
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:44,030
an entire series can be defined by one element,

202
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,051
but if it's gonna be one element,

203
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:45,871
it's gonna be that thing

204
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,372
that you're constantly getting shot at.

205
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,355
So of course, if you know anything about me,

206
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,515
you know I'm really into paper designs,

207
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,117
and so I'm not gonna show you the paper design

208
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:57,378
for the Halo 1 Plasm Rifle because it was terrible,

209
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,959
but here are some choice quotes.

210
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,901
It misfires in the rain and does AOE damage underwater.

211
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:05,923
We didn't have rain and we didn't have water,

212
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,584
and that was the first line,

213
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,305
like that was the most important thing.

214
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:15,299
The primary trigger is an instantaneous visible beam, which is not how it ended up at all,

215
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:19,303
because it's not fun to get shot at something that travels instantaneously.

216
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:25,449
You're supposed to hold the second trigger to charge the overcharge, except for Halo

217
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,532
doesn't have a second trigger, so I don't know where that came from.

218
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,935
It's more effective than other weapons against energy shields.

219
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:33,647
You know, we got some of that in there.

220
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,808
And it also disables mirror fields

221
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:38,209
faster than any other weapon except for the disruptor.

222
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,989
And there's no mirror fields in Halo.

223
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,670
And I don't know what a disruptor is.

224
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,131
So clearly, we had a very vague understanding

225
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,111
of what this weapon was supposed to be.

226
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,552
OK, blue slides.

227
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:47,052
Here we go.

228
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,273
What is a fun activity that you're

229
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,114
going to be able to engage with this weapon in?

230
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,475
So first of all, and these are going

231
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:58,056
to be the three R's of fun, it needs to be reactive.

232
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,117
It needs to be a repeatable activity.

233
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,084
And it needs to be reliable.

234
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:04,825
So what do I mean by any of that?

235
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:07,147
Nobody can have fun for you.

236
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:10,729
So fun requires that the player participate.

237
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,751
And if you're going to participate in something,

238
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,811
it needs to be interactive.

239
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,233
So that means that in order to be fun,

240
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:17,314
something has to be reactive.

241
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:18,655
It needs to be repeatable.

242
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:22,057
I'm sort of known for saying that Halo

243
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,938
has 30 seconds of fun, which we repeat over and over.

244
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:28,401
But I could have said that Halo is fun for 30 seconds.

245
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,432
And then something better changed,

246
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:32,794
because you have to play that 30 seconds exactly over again.

247
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:33,855
It's not going to be very much fun.

248
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:38,478
And so what this activity needs to do is resist habituation.

249
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,060
What is habituation, you may ask?

250
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,042
So I just got back from the Caribbean.

251
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,464
And being from Seattle, when we first got there,

252
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,005
the sun felt very, very hot.

253
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:51,328
And after a little while, it stopped feeling so hot.

254
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:54,310
I didn't notice it anymore until I got a horrible sunburn.

255
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,372
And what was happening there was I

256
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,486
My nerves and my skin were getting habituated to the sensation of the sun.

257
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:05,830
And habituation is the reduction in sensitivity when something happens over and over and over again.

258
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,254
Now you might think this is bad as in the case of a sunburn,

259
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:13,997
but it's actually extremely important as I found out later when my sunburn started to heal

260
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:19,061
and it itched madly and I couldn't sleep and I couldn't have a conversation

261
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,644
and I couldn't even really think straight because I couldn't do anything but feel my skin.

262
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,647
And if you didn't have habituation, you would feel like that all the time.

263
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,886
Habituation is also a really crucial learning tool.

264
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:31,307
So when you see something in a game over and over and over,

265
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,388
you get habituated to it.

266
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,630
You stop noticing it, and you start

267
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,112
noticing the differences between the experiences that

268
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,413
allow you to analyze them and come up

269
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,314
with different strategies.

270
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,136
But it's also the designer's mortal enemy.

271
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:44,957
Habituation makes you bored.

272
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,039
So what you should be going for in a fun experience

273
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,882
is predictable enough that you can habituate to it somewhat

274
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:53,984
and learn it, but not so predictable, not

275
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,165
so habituatable.

276
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,051
that you get bored.

277
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,412
And finally, it needs to be reliable.

278
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:03,855
It needs to be fun every time for as many people as possible,

279
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:04,296
ideally.

280
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:07,658
And it turns out these kind of reliable activities

281
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,239
are extraordinarily rare.

282
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,961
And you probably participated in most of them

283
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,062
by the time you were five or six.

284
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:15,163
What do I mean by that?

285
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,085
You didn't throw a grenade before you were six,

286
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:21,447
hopefully, unless you're breaking the ESRB.

287
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,610
So grenades are.

288
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:30,266
staple of Halo gameplay. But really, when you look at the experience of throwing a grenade,

289
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:37,828
it's really close to Peggle, which finds its roots in games like Arkanoid. I mean, how

290
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,689
many of you are itching for that ball to go right up that crack and then bounce off the

291
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:46,051
ground? If you don't know what Arkanoid is, maybe Angry Birds is a better reference for

292
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:50,732
throwing grenades. Which goes back to, like, in physical activities, like pool, you know,

293
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:55,273
what angle do I have to hit the bumper at in order for, to make the pocket?

294
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,999
Which, even, you know, even when you were a little child,

295
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,900
throwing stuff in a waste paper basket.

296
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,422
It's all that same kind of fundamental activity

297
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,323
that you could just do forever.

298
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,304
So maybe you're not convinced.

299
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:07,726
What about melee?

300
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,187
It's another Halo staple.

301
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:11,909
Really important part of the game.

302
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,009
Never gets old.

303
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,551
Just like it never got old in Final Fight.

304
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,076
Just like it convinced you to hit all those stupid Flash banner ads.

305
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,838
I couldn't, I couldn't find the Punch-a-Monkey.

306
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,122
There is no actual copy of that on the internet anymore.

307
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:32,784
Which, when you think about it, is really just a callback

308
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,345
to Whack-A-Mole.

309
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:37,347
And Whack-A-Mole is just a machine playing sort

310
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,787
of a violent version of peekaboo.

311
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,569
This is my son, and he's super cute.

312
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,710
So I wanted to use him in my presentation.

313
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:45,911
How about the Warthog?

314
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:51,734
The Warthog, way slidier than any actual vehicle,

315
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:53,475
just like in Mario Kart.

316
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:57,497
which is very similar to skiing, which is just like sliding around in your socks.

317
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,698
Or in her socks, preferably.

318
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,339
So why are these things fun?

319
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,660
There's a book called The Brain That Changes Itself, and it talks about people who have

320
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:20,004
suffered mostly brain injuries or birth defects that use practice and rote skills to sort

321
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:23,145
of regenerate their brain tissue.

322
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:30,676
And it says that a trained or stimulated neuron develops 25% more branches, increases its size,

323
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,757
and it gets a lot more blood supply going through it.

324
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:39,638
And so my theory is that just like physical exercise is fun just for the sake of exercise,

325
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,559
mental exercise is fun in the same way.

326
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:47,581
So if you look at dodging, which is something that you did when you were a child,

327
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,441
there's lots and lots of things that you're doing.

328
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:50,881
You are...

329
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:53,938
You're detecting movement in your peripheral vision,

330
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:57,379
and you are tracking objects as they move across the space,

331
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,381
which translates really well into 2D in a game like Commando,

332
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:02,881
for instance.

333
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,562
But it's even better in 3D, where

334
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,643
you're trying to take the non-linear change in size

335
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,764
of a projectile as it comes toward you and determine

336
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,425
when it's going to intersect with you

337
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:17,206
and predict its trajectory, or determine the closest point

338
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,867
that it's going to reach so you know exactly

339
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:19,907
how far you have to dodge.

340
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:20,948
So.

341
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,598
Just a quick tangent, the conventional wisdom is that 3D sucks.

342
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:29,379
And maybe the technology isn't there yet, but eventually games are going to be in 3D

343
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,800
and they're going to be way more fun because they're going to tap more directly into those

344
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,760
brain circuits.

345
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:36,601
OK.

346
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:42,742
Games, other than Halo, are fun for this reason.

347
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:46,763
So your brain is really good at pattern matching and actually has, like, physical hardware

348
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:47,103
for that.

349
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,063
So that explains things like Tetris.

350
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:54,084
Predicting complex systems with an almost intuition level

351
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,124
is common.

352
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:59,065
You have special circuits for determining a rate of change,

353
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,946
and especially comparing one rate of change to another.

354
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,867
So if you've ever tried to see if your healer's mana was

355
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:06,648
going to last longer than a boss's life in WoW,

356
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:07,348
that's what you're doing.

357
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,329
Path planning is pretty obvious in a game like Pac-Man,

358
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,910
but it's also when you're trying to complete three or four

359
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,090
quests in an area, you're trying to do it most efficiently.

360
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:19,788
Your plasticity is sort of how you make new connections

361
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:20,728
that you never had before.

362
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,109
I think Portal probably stretched everybody's brains

363
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:23,490
a little bit.

364
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,891
And finally, another thing that you're hardwired for

365
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,813
is to have a theory of mind to try

366
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,493
to get inside somebody else's head, which

367
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,874
is very useful in something like Street Fighter

368
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:35,935
or even a slow game like chess.

369
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,796
So back to reality.

370
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:38,036
OK.

371
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:40,177
So we need something that's reactive, repeatable,

372
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:43,218
reliable, that exercises your dodging circuits.

373
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:46,195
And so we rewrote the plasma rifle paper design

374
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:49,236
to say it's a high rate of fire gun that

375
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:50,496
shoots plasma bullets that travel

376
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,736
at a fast but dodgeable speed.

377
00:16:57,438 --> 00:17:00,199
So that mechanic works itself out in this way.

378
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:01,579
We don't want it to be too fast.

379
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,920
We want to give you enough time to dodge.

380
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,920
And also we want it to be slow enough

381
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,801
that it's a continuous motion, because we're actually just

382
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,242
throwing up 30 still frames a second.

383
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,986
If you can't connect those in your brain

384
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:17,227
into a single, believable, real object,

385
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,468
then you can't engage those dodging circuits.

386
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,468
And we gave it a really visible contrail,

387
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,889
which was especially useful in the PAL version,

388
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,770
actually, where it's harder to dodge because you're

389
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,730
getting fewer updates.

390
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,931
But we didn't want it to be too slow.

391
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,291
I mean, it's sort of comical if the bullets are just

392
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:34,911
hanging in air.

393
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:36,772
And we still want you to experience

394
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,532
all those near misses.

395
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:43,773
So that just brings me to a sort of a fundamental definition

396
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:47,014
of game mechanics, where you divide the potential gameplay

397
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,315
into two parts, actions that are permitted

398
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,355
and actions that aren't permitted.

399
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,856
So Mario cannot jump over the flag.

400
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:55,256
Mario cannot run left.

401
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,017
There are just things that Mario cannot do.

402
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,177
This is good, because it allows us to constrain the game.

403
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,078
But the problem is that one mechanic isn't a game.

404
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,819
It's not even really interactive.

405
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,399
If you only have one constraint, then you're

406
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,420
not making any choices.

407
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:14,704
I recently made my first Flash game, and it's Pac-Man in a line.

408
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:20,566
Basically there's no ghosts, there's no maze, you just eat all the dots, and it's boring.

409
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:28,149
So if we look at a Halo mechanic, let's say that there's a mechanic where your hand-held

410
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,270
weapon, it beats distant enemies, right?

411
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,352
And so if they are distant, then you win, if they're not distant, then you lose.

412
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:46,945
sort of a contemporary design theory is that, excuse me, that you should layer new mechanics

413
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:51,748
on top of this one. And if you layer off enough mechanics, then you're going to make a game.

414
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:56,351
And if your game isn't fun, then you should layer on more mechanics. But I really think

415
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:01,514
all that does is give you a larger number of choices that you aren't making. So what

416
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:05,336
I suggest is that you want to have

417
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,454
mechanics that support each other, sort of like a tripod.

418
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:09,535
They're leaning against each other.

419
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:12,257
And all the area inside is the gameplay.

420
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:15,199
And so a sandbox game has a huge area.

421
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,821
And maybe a more linear game has a much smaller area.

422
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:21,724
But at least there's lots of different possible places

423
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,125
that the player could be at any given time.

424
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,227
So that means that the projectile mechanics also

425
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,868
need to be supported by AI mechanics.

426
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,509
So they lead to your peers.

427
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,050
And we had them fight from the open

428
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:32,932
so that you could see them fighting from the open

429
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:33,412
and dodging.

430
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,553
And that would teach you to dodge.

431
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,090
We also made them shoot directly at the player,

432
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,951
because it's a lot easier to dodge something that's

433
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,451
coming straight at you, rather than

434
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,292
trying to figure out which direction you're

435
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:43,012
going to need to dodge.

436
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,193
We gave them a little bit of small error,

437
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,294
so it wasn't quite as predictable.

438
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,736
And they also shoot in bursts, so sort of like a fan pattern.

439
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,237
Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.

440
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,177
They kind of swing it across.

441
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,239
But they don't track the player during a burst.

442
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,639
So if you start dodging a burst, you're

443
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:59,720
going to be able to dodge the rest of it.

444
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,502
The player mechanics also needed to support this.

445
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:07,003
So instead of having the blazingly fast super soldier,

446
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:10,144
we had an agonizingly slow super soldier,

447
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,464
mostly relying on the acceleration

448
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:14,385
of going left to right.

449
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,345
You have to anticipate what you're going to dodge.

450
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,626
You can't just immediately move out of the way

451
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,367
as if you were a Ferrari.

452
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:25,167
And we also had a narrow field of view,

453
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:29,248
which is not a common thing at the time.

454
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,469
PC games had the crazy fish eye.

455
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:37,918
views and the reason is it makes objects that are distant in the middle of the screen feel

456
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,840
like they're much closer and larger and that allows you to track projectiles a lot better

457
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,741
because instead of being really, really, really small and then all of a sudden being huge

458
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:49,762
and in your face, they're actually increasing as they would in the real world via inverse

459
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,243
square law.

460
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,325
We gave the player shields which recharge after a short time.

461
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,486
So that means if you're dodging and you get a couple shots, it's not that risky.

462
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:02,585
And so we actually increased the amount of damage that a plasma rifle will do against

463
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:03,085
shields.

464
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:08,408
But at the same time we gave you body health that doesn't recharge, so we wanted to preserve

465
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:12,490
your life by making you do a little bit less damage to body.

466
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,832
When it comes to difficulty in Halo 1, it's pretty straightforward.

467
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:20,253
We had these red elites and they were like tougher versions of the blue elites.

468
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:23,154
They shot more bursts, they shot longer bursts, so they're a little bit harder.

469
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:27,717
And we had a global weapon damage scale, so on Legendary.

470
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,710
everything did about twice as much damage to the player.

471
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:35,051
So mechanics are universal.

472
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:40,753
If the game designer writes down plasma rifle bolts are dodgeable, then they are in abstract

473
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:45,455
mechanic land, but they need to be calibrated to make them personal and effective in the

474
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:45,915
real world.

475
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:50,176
These are the actual numbers that create the experience that the mechanic is describing

476
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:53,758
and make the plasma rifle dodgeable for a certain player.

477
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:56,238
So in Halo, it was calibrated for me.

478
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,059
Actually, I've said that before.

479
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,296
Actually, it's not precisely true.

480
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:06,180
So ask yourself, and hopefully you're not already asking this of yourself, why did you

481
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,480
come to this talk today?

482
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,442
Confabulation!

483
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:16,986
The truth is that you can't recreate your subconscious mind in your conscious mind.

484
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:20,529
It's like trying to emulate an Xbox on an Atari 2600.

485
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:21,289
It just doesn't fit.

486
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,912
And so what you have is an internal model, which you use to guess at your own motivations.

487
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:29,143
Usually it's pretty accurate because you have a lot of experience with yourself.

488
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:32,803
But what you should do is also build one of these internal models for the player.

489
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,564
That way you can predict the player reactions and so when you're calibrating, you're calibrating

490
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:41,805
for this little internal guy that you believe is what is representative of every player.

491
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:46,386
So this is my job.

492
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:51,567
It's also the series of steps that led to the calibration of the plasma rifle.

493
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:56,324
The process for me usually goes like this.

494
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,446
I make my best guess, which in this case was 10,

495
00:22:58,486 --> 00:22:59,988
because I had no idea.

496
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:03,050
10 is world units per second, which

497
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:07,114
is a unit of measurement that means absolutely nothing to you.

498
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,577
And then I would try the extremes.

499
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,478
So I would try 20, and I'm like, wow,

500
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,900
that is almost instantaneous.

501
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,902
Or 1, and I have to wait for the bullets to get to me,

502
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,524
and sometimes I forget they're there and fall asleep,

503
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:19,044
and then they hit me.

504
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:24,276
Um, so then I narrowed in on the value, so I tried five, and that was better, but it

505
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:29,177
was still way too easy to dodge, so I moved to 15, which, oh, that is too fast, and then

506
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:34,838
I moved to 13, which is totally dodgeable, until I tried to pay attention to something

507
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:38,718
else and shoot back, and then I'm getting hit again, so I turned it to 11, which felt

508
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:42,779
really good, and then after a while it kind of felt too good, so then I bumped it up to 12.

509
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:44,539
Twelve.

510
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,860
So the, uh, experience.

511
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,812
that your calibration gives you is something that you need to test and use your research,

512
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:57,154
obviously. For us, we found that players could dodge the plasma bolts and that felt really

513
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:02,456
good for them, but it had some unintended consequences in Halo 1. First, they were fighting

514
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:07,918
out in the open, so they saw more of the enemy behaviors, which is good, but they also died

515
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:12,720
without seeking cover because they wanted to only fight out from the open, which was

516
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,562
not so good. And then it was also extremely broken.

517
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,425
So basically, you can always dodge the plasma rifle

518
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:20,726
in Halo.

519
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,447
And this is why.

520
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:26,771
If you aim directly at the player as an AI,

521
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,093
and the player's moving, you're going to miss.

522
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,015
So you could solve that by trying to lead.

523
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:35,017
The problem is, if they zigzag at all,

524
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:36,138
you miss by even more.

525
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,121
If your projectile is dramatically slower

526
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,943
than the player, then this is not a solvable problem.

527
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,289
And basically, if you know that this is the case in Halo,

528
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:48,510
you can break the game pretty badly

529
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,891
on pretty much every difficulty level

530
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:51,691
and in every encounter.

531
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:52,671
So that's bad.

532
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,252
When it comes to multiplayer,

533
00:24:57,773 --> 00:24:58,973
we had added movement stuns.

534
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,954
So when you get shot by the plasma rifle,

535
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:03,235
it makes it so you can't turn as fast

536
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:04,515
and you can't move as fast.

537
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,516
And that was to compensate for the fact

538
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:08,256
that it just wasn't, you know,

539
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:10,957
you couldn't use it at a good range

540
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:13,518
because it was traveling so slowly.

541
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,811
But an unintended consequence of that was that movement sound was really annoying.

542
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:22,155
It works okay in Counter-Strike when you're gonna get shot three times and then die, but

543
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:25,638
in our game when you could take a lot of hits, you would just have to sit there and take

544
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:29,882
a lot of hits, which conflicted with the Halo flavor quite a bit.

545
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:36,188
It was also horribly broken because you could use it on vehicles, which... whatever.

546
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,990
It was a short development cycle, what can I say?

547
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:44,125
Now when it comes to Legendary, this is kind of interesting because the Plasma Rifle, as

548
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,047
all weapons, did twice as much damage.

549
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:47,768
So that made Legendary very difficult.

550
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,831
Had some unintended consequences.

551
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:57,676
Basically the difficulty scale was stacking with the material scale I described earlier.

552
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,839
So against shields it was actually doing almost four times as much damage, which meant that

553
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,121
it was taking down your shields almost instantly.

554
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,704
The way this was badly broken.

555
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:13,704
was, so dodging was not actually any harder.

556
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:18,245
So on normal, you could dodge back and forth,

557
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:19,925
and every projectile would miss you.

558
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,506
And if a couple hit you, that was fine.

559
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:22,186
You just take cover.

560
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,106
In legendary, you could dodge back and forth

561
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:25,246
in the exact same way.

562
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,667
The same number of bolts would hit you, and they would kill you.

563
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,748
So we weren't actually making the game harder.

564
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:32,648
We were just making it more punishing.

565
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:36,389
But luckily, we got a chance to fix everything in Halo 2.

566
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,169
So again, we're looking at the competition.

567
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,730
Ghost Recon came about that time.

568
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,951
And it was different than an Unreal

569
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,331
and that had instant projectiles.

570
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,892
It was really encouraging you to fight from cover.

571
00:26:49,532 --> 00:26:52,253
Rainbow Six came out and it also had instant projectiles

572
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,053
and fighting from cover.

573
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:55,153
And Counter-Strike, and S.W.A.T., and Medal of Honor,

574
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,834
and Minerva, and Call of Duty, and Kill Switch.

575
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:58,975
So basically we're seeing a trend here.

576
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:02,736
People want instant projectiles and fighting from cover.

577
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:04,716
We looked at our own community.

578
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:07,837
And the Halo 1 pistol is.

579
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:12,292
really unbalanced and really popular.

580
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:14,332
And we think that's probably because, hey,

581
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,193
it's an innocent projectile.

582
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,914
Legendary is also, like I described before,

583
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,434
completely unbalanced and very popular,

584
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,135
which means that people enjoy the fighting from cover,

585
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:25,675
even if it's excessively punishing.

586
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:29,797
So we talked earlier about how fun requires participation.

587
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,837
And what that means is that fun requires buy-in.

588
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:35,638
Basically, people will play the game that they want to play,

589
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:36,878
no matter what.

590
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,262
I did the Halo 1 tutorial, and before giving you a weapon in the original version of the

591
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:47,624
tutorial, I would throw you into combat, and the idea was, it would teach people to run

592
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:47,884
away.

593
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:53,967
What we tell people was, run up next to a guy and let them shoot you to death, because

594
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:57,308
you can't figure out how to kill them because you can't, because you don't have a weapon

595
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:57,708
yet.

596
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:04,951
People will, they go with their expectation over any kind of hint text or recommendation

597
00:28:04,971 --> 00:28:05,332
that you can make.

598
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,772
Again, the most important context tended to be in the game.

599
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:16,017
The elites in Halo 2 were not the faceless enemy

600
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:16,677
that they were in Halo 1.

601
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,459
In fact, sometimes they were your allies.

602
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:19,779
And at some points in the game, you

603
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,040
were actually playing as an elite.

604
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:24,403
And so they needed an instant projectile weapon

605
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,584
in their arsenal.

606
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,487
Also, in single player, we decided

607
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,588
since dodging is not fixable, maybe we'll

608
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:33,089
emphasize fighting from cover a little bit more.

609
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,191
And in multiplayer.

610
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:37,709
Since movement sign is just not fitting with the game,

611
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,090
again, we want to have some sort of instant projectile

612
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,771
on the plasma rifle, or at least much faster projectile.

613
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,932
Which brings me to interlude number two.

614
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:51,094
So every Christmas, I ask my grandma for a subscription

615
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:51,794
to Edge Magazine.

616
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:55,575
And every Christmas, I get a subscription

617
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:56,476
to GamePro Magazine.

618
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,296
Thank you, grandma.

619
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,978
But lately, it's paid off because GamePro is actually

620
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:04,998
turning into a very good magazine.

621
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,233
And recently they had an article called The Psychology of Shooters.

622
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:18,761
And in it they describe a study done by a pair of researchers named Andrew Przebilski

623
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:23,765
and Scott Rigby where they modded Half-Life and they had one version where it was bloody

624
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:27,709
and horrible and guts and violence and one version where it was non-violent.

625
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,570
It was sort of like a game of tag.

626
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:31,432
And what they found was...

627
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:36,924
that both versions equally satisfy the basic needs that they were looking for, which were

628
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:41,867
competence and autonomy. And you can read this either in GamePro or on Jamie Madigan's

629
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:44,549
blog, psychologyofgames.com, which I heartily recommend.

630
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:56,356
So their eventual sort of conclusion was that shooters satisfy human needs, and because

631
00:29:57,357 --> 00:30:01,459
both bloody shooter and tag shooter both satisfy competence and autonomy.

632
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:03,774
They're both equally fun.

633
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:06,915
But we all know that Tag of Duty would

634
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:07,315
not sell.

635
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:11,397
And I believe the reason is that our

636
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:14,738
needs are much more complex than simple competence or

637
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:15,138
autonomy.

638
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,239
And I figure out everything with graphs, so

639
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:18,720
let's make one.

640
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,582
Why is, is, let's see.

641
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,503
So dodging is a competence, right.

642
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:28,903
It's something you get good at.

643
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:34,526
Why is it way more fun to dodge on normal than it is on legendary,

644
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:37,567
when it kind of cheapens legendary if you can just dodge everything?

645
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,727
And covering is always a choice,

646
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:44,068
but why is it a more interesting choice on legendary when you really don't have any choice?

647
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:45,169
You have to go take cover.

648
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:51,430
And why is it more fun to dodge grunts and more fun to cover from elites?

649
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,331
And why is it more fun to dodge if you're playing aggressively,

650
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:57,532
and it's more fun to cover if you feel like you're wanting to play defensively?

651
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:03,399
And my answer is that competence in a shooter,

652
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,842
specifically dodging, is much more fun

653
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:08,163
when you're under low pressure.

654
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:11,165
And autonomy is much more fun when

655
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:13,547
you're trying to tackle a problem that's

656
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:14,548
much more difficult.

657
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:21,133
So when games satisfy these complex needs,

658
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:22,494
that's when they are really fun.

659
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:25,857
And this complexity comes from the context

660
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,518
that the needs are being satisfied in.

661
00:31:29,144 --> 00:31:31,926
Now, we already found out we can't control the context,

662
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,467
because that's part of the audience.

663
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,731
So what we have to do is match our fun activity to the context

664
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,114
that those players are already experiencing.

665
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:48,380
So for instance, context can make an activity feel natural

666
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,002
when the activity flows out of the context.

667
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,604
Some great examples of this, Assassin's Creed.

668
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,707
There's no question in anybody's mind that this.

669
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:02,632
is intending for them to sneak, and it feels the world really, really ingrains in you that

670
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:06,275
you should be sneaking. I think the best example of the last year or so is Super Meat Boy.

671
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:10,498
That poor guy is designed to die over and over and over and over again.

672
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:16,722
But a context will also make an activity meaningful. I think this is what Clint Hocking was talking

673
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:22,245
about in his talk yesterday. I'm still processing it, so I'm not exactly sure. Rescuing the

674
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:26,308
princess for making it through a mission or becoming the Pokemon master.

675
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,776
So what we did back in reality,

676
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,518
where we split the plasma pistol and the plasma rifle bolts.

677
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,759
So the plasma pistol became the slow, dodgeable version,

678
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,901
the plasma rifle became the faster one that forced you to cover.

679
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:41,404
And then on different difficulty levels, we sped up the projectile.

680
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:44,786
So on normal, the plasma rifle's still dodgeable if you're far enough away,

681
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:46,908
but on legendary, it's never dodgeable.

682
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:51,491
And we changed the AI mechanics, again, split them.

683
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:53,993
So the grunt kind of fights like your kid brother,

684
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,255
like they shoot straight at you and they're really easy to confuse.

685
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,615
If you hide, they come and look directly.

686
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:02,497
Whereas the elites are a lot more cunning.

687
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,698
They lead the player.

688
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,900
And because they have a faster projectile, that's OK again.

689
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,182
They track during the burst so that you

690
00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:11,823
have to consistently dodge the entire burst.

691
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:17,607
And also, they suppress you before they come search.

692
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:19,308
So what that means is if you take cover,

693
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:21,970
they'll shoot at the cover and shoot around

694
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,451
where they think you're going to be coming up.

695
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,852
And they'll do that for a good 15, 20 seconds.

696
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:28,038
before then coming up and very carefully,

697
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,540
from usually as far away as they can,

698
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,061
peeking around the cover to see if you're still there.

699
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,406
We had two protagonists in Halo 2.

700
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,768
There's the Chief, and we stopped displaying his health

701
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:42,970
because what we wanted to do was make it so that

702
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,692
as soon as your shields were down, you ran for cover.

703
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,634
And you ran for cover with this feeling of,

704
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:50,676
oh my goodness, this is really dangerous and scary.

705
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:52,117
But then we...

706
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,276
increased how fast the shield recharged,

707
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,037
so you didn't have to stay in cover for very long.

708
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,579
Because in Halo 1, you could just stand out of cover

709
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,400
and dodge back and forth until your shields came back

710
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,841
and you were shooting the whole time.

711
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:04,163
It's a little bit more boring to stand behind a rock,

712
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:05,824
so we wanted it to take less time.

713
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,506
We even moved the shield meter right

714
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,327
next to the motion tracker.

715
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:11,508
So you could be crouching behind cover,

716
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:13,569
looking at your shields and at the motion tracker

717
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,350
to see if somebody was coming around the cover after you.

718
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:19,293
For the Arbiter, we experimented with an invisibility,

719
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:19,953
where he could.

720
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:23,706
turn itself invisible for just long enough for his shields to almost start recharging,

721
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,308
with more or less success.

722
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,353
So I already mentioned that shots travel faster on Legendary, but we also changed how the

723
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:34,654
weapon damage scale works.

724
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,636
So first of all, it's per weapon now.

725
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:40,979
It's no longer global on Halo 2, which meant that the Plasma Pistol we could make do a

726
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,302
little bit more damage, but not really significantly, whereas the Plasma Rifle we could make do

727
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:46,423
a lot more damage, but totally going to drive you into cover.

728
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:50,086
Turns out this is a terrible way to balance difficulty, but I didn't know.

729
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:51,256
that at the time.

730
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,580
When we were calibrating, oh shoot, we didn't calibrate.

731
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,781
Sorry about that, Halo 2.

732
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:01,303
So almost at the end of the project,

733
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:03,325
our AI counts got cut dramatically.

734
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,127
We had to strip objects out like crazy.

735
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:10,270
And we had very little time to recalibrate any of the weapons.

736
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:14,253
So they ended up being about 15 world units per second.

737
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:17,275
So slightly faster than Halo 1, and then

738
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,496
a legendary much, much faster.

739
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:24,143
So the normal experience of the player playing in Halo 2

740
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,944
was that they can dodge grunts pretty easily

741
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,485
and at least force them to cover.

742
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:28,085
So far, so good.

743
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:30,806
Unfortunately, because we had to remove so much cover,

744
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:32,967
there wasn't enough.

745
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:35,589
And a lot of times you'd be fighting guys

746
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:36,829
that were supposed to drive you into cover,

747
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,390
and there was maybe one piece of cover

748
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,670
if we remembered to leave it in there.

749
00:35:40,331 --> 00:35:42,272
And because we had introduced Havoc in Halo 2,

750
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:44,132
sometimes that cover would move.

751
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:45,253
So they would throw a grenade at you,

752
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,634
and your cover would go flying off the cliff,

753
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:47,714
and then you'd be completely exposed.

754
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:50,619
But that's not why it was totally broken.

755
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,320
Why it was totally broken was because of the suppressing fire

756
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,121
I talked about earlier.

757
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:58,824
The AI would over-focus to a ridiculous degree.

758
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,144
And I'll try to explain that.

759
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:06,728
So basically, the way to always get the advantage of Halo 2

760
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,650
is to take cover and then pop out at a different spot.

761
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,732
So if the AI is shooting at you, you go behind cover.

762
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,974
Then you pop out on the other side.

763
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:18,296
And then you get two or three seconds to shoot at them

764
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:18,916
before they shoot back.

765
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:20,569
And then they start shooting at you,

766
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:21,750
and you go back behind the cover,

767
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,150
and you pop out on the first side.

768
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:24,571
And it takes two or three seconds

769
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:25,872
for them to figure out this tactic,

770
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:27,613
and you can just do it over and over and over and over again.

771
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,634
And if you ever played Legendary,

772
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,635
you almost certainly figured this out,

773
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,615
because it's the only way to get through.

774
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:36,418
As far as multiplayer, the faster projectiles

775
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,958
that the plasma rifle had were great,

776
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:39,459
because they made the weapon useful at range,

777
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,981
and we removed entirely the idea

778
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:42,961
of movement sound from the game.

779
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,403
Unfortunately, there was a bug that meant

780
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:47,724
that if you were carrying an SMG,

781
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:48,944
which was everywhere in Halo 2.

782
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:52,592
And a plasma rifle, you were doing almost twice as much

783
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:53,653
damage as anybody else.

784
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:56,373
It was intended to reduce the amount of damage,

785
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:58,034
but that wasn't fixed until the patch.

786
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:01,495
And it was totally broken, because if you

787
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:03,335
put two plasma rifles together, you

788
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,696
could basically drop some of these shields almost

789
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:06,616
instantaneously.

790
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:08,257
And also, because the projectiles

791
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:09,477
were moving faster for the player,

792
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:12,478
the plasma pistol overcharge that we added,

793
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:15,079
that's where they got the term noob combo.

794
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,020
So.

795
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:21,898
On Legendary, the experience is actually harder.

796
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:25,200
It's not just more punishing.

797
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,981
It's actually more difficult to dodge.

798
00:37:28,242 --> 00:37:30,063
Unfortunately, it is still more punishing,

799
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,784
and especially on Marines.

800
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:33,165
If you're playing Legendary on Halo 2,

801
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:35,466
your Marines lifespan is about 10 seconds.

802
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,629
And it was totally broken because we

803
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:42,731
had engagement distances that were very far, which

804
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:47,054
worked fine in Halo 1 because the AI would.

805
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,882
close on you until its kind of slow projectiles were effective.

806
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:55,643
But those projectiles were effective at a much farther distance.

807
00:37:55,663 --> 00:38:00,245
In fact, they were effective at a range beyond what even the player's weapons were effective

808
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:00,405
at.

809
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:05,568
And so when you get something like a jetpack elite wielding two plasma rifles, which we've

810
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:10,470
already talked about is unbalanced in multiplayer, and then you add a 4X multiplayer on top of

811
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,772
that and they're jumping around and they have recharging energy shields, you get a game

812
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,753
that's really, really way too hard, especially my level.

813
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:22,035
But luckily, we got to try it again.

814
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:31,942
Our competition, as you can see, lots and lots of military games, and several of them

815
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,103
feature cover systems.

816
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:40,729
Now, our community at this point had been almost entirely single-player focused story

817
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,110
guys, but with

818
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:46,476
Halo 2 and Xbox Live, we started to get a much larger multiplayer community until they

819
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:49,518
were given about roughly equal weight in Halo 3.

820
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:58,723
And Halo became known for that kind of free-flowing combat that Halo 2 had got us, you know,

821
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:00,324
dodging and sidestepping and covering.

822
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:04,227
And so a cover system where you're sticking to cover just really didn't fit for us.

823
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:08,950
We decided against, we figured our audience was established enough that we could sort

824
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,192
of start ignoring the competition a little bit and going our own way.

825
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,730
But again, the, the in-game context was the most important.

826
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:19,311
There's no enemy elites in Halo 3.

827
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:26,752
They switch sides on the Covenant, and so sometimes context is not outside of developer

828
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:28,533
control, but it is outside of designer control.

829
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:34,434
And that means there's no enemy plasma rifles, because the Brutes use the Spiker, and the

830
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:39,475
Jackals use the Carbine, and Grunts use the Needler, and so nobody on the enemy side is

831
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:40,375
using the plasma rifle.

832
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,096
So does that mean my talk isn't over?

833
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:45,783
No, it means an interlude.

834
00:39:47,504 --> 00:39:49,505
So pretty clearly, Halo 2 was a misstep.

835
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:53,306
How much of a misstep is up for interpretation.

836
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:56,507
But I spent a lot of time after Halo 2 ships.

837
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,868
I went on a soul-searching journey

838
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:01,308
to try to find out what should we have done?

839
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,229
What would have been fun?

840
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:05,570
I looked at lots of industry resources.

841
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,050
Raph Koster says that games are edutainment.

842
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:11,612
Will Wright says games are exploring a possibility space.

843
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:13,572
Far be it for me to disagree with Will Wright.

844
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,741
Sid Meier says games are a series of interesting choices.

845
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:19,902
But when I looked at all these descriptions

846
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,343
that designers were giving, they're

847
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:22,684
describing their own games.

848
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:24,044
Not really every game.

849
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,565
It's certainly not Halo.

850
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:28,747
So I looked into academia.

851
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:31,569
I hope there's not too many academics in here.

852
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:32,489
I may not make it out alive.

853
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,471
I just picked one of their definitions at random.

854
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:39,213
Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems.

855
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:44,199
in which there is an opposition between forces confined by a procedure and rules in order

856
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:46,420
to produce a disequilibrial outcome.

857
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:47,740
Yeah.

858
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,182
These guys aren't giving us a definition that is super useful.

859
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:55,524
What they're doing is dissecting games into their various components, which is good for

860
00:40:55,984 --> 00:41:00,546
categorizing, not so good for building something that defies categories.

861
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,387
I'm a philosopher by background.

862
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:08,109
That's what my schooling is about, so I just kind of leave.

863
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:11,809
through some of my old philosophy texts, Aristotle,

864
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:17,534
talks a lot about catharsis and sort of how entertainment

865
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,896
is about bringing yourself back into balance.

866
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:20,876
That's interesting.

867
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,639
Pascal says that games are a distraction

868
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,579
from your imminent death.

869
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:29,884
Wittgenstein says that games cannot be defined,

870
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,605
which is not helpful, because then he says,

871
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:32,986
because you already know what they are.

872
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:34,567
And he's just trying to make a point about language.

873
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:36,669
And so that doesn't help me at all.

874
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:41,524
My final conclusion was that game designers should be philosophers.

875
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:45,346
I think it actually helps you sit outside yourself and understand what you're thinking.

876
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:47,667
But philosophers are not game designers.

877
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:59,535
Csikszentmihalyi, in his book, Flow, says that flow, or some people could translate

878
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:02,377
that into fun, is the immersion of the self in an activity.

879
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,278
And he talks about the autotelic experience.

880
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:05,659
And that basically means...

881
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,893
What you're doing is completely pouring into yourself,

882
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:13,835
and it has no purpose apart from yourself,

883
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:18,137
even if it's accomplishing some other goal.

884
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:20,738
Two other psychologists, Dessy and Ryan,

885
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,079
talk a lot about self-determination theory,

886
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:27,081
which is that human needs motivate people, which

887
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:27,901
includes players.

888
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:31,783
They focus a lot on intrinsic needs and extrinsic needs.

889
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,245
I think their research is great, and I

890
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,226
think Flo has a lot of great insights.

891
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:39,702
But I sort of have a different take on the categories,

892
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,603
which I will attempt to explain with a graph.

893
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:51,885
So if you try to find a couple of orthogonal ways

894
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:58,366
to classify needs, you'll find that some needs are need needs,

895
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:01,107
meaning if you don't have them, you feel rotten.

896
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:06,468
And some needs are want needs, where

897
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:11,196
if you get them, it's a positive emotion, but if you don't have them, you're not sitting

898
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:11,836
around miserable.

899
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:16,477
And I decided to call those requirements for the need needs and aspirations, for those

900
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,978
that are more positive but also optional.

901
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:24,660
Now, clearly games are not, you're not going to die if you're not playing a game, so games

902
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,921
probably provide aspirational needs of some kind.

903
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:35,444
I also sort of played off of flow.

904
00:43:35,976 --> 00:43:38,957
and the idea of autotelic activities

905
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:43,499
to come up with two new concepts of endotelic and exotelic.

906
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,221
So telic is from telios, which means sort of like the goal

907
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:47,961
or the end.

908
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:51,482
Endo and exo meaning inner and outer.

909
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:54,904
So basically, you have things that you

910
00:43:54,944 --> 00:44:00,146
do because you want a goal that comes from outside.

911
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,507
So that's like cake, right?

912
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:03,767
I want cake.

913
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:09,328
it's going to end up inside of me. And I don't really care how it's provided. I don't really

914
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:11,049
care if I made the cake, as long as it tastes good.

915
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:20,397
Whereas Exotelic is actually I'm being used for something. So a lot of causes and religions

916
00:44:20,997 --> 00:44:27,523
are based on this. But much more humbly for games, it's just my skills are being used

917
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:33,007
to make something happen. Which is why games need to be interactive, so that you can participate

918
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,588
in them and cause something to happen.

919
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:38,726
So I would put games into this upper right quadrant.

920
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:42,307
And fun is the positive emotion that you get

921
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:43,527
from meeting those needs.

922
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:53,010
So if you think back to the graph,

923
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,771
fun is that quadrant of meeting an exotelic aspiration.

924
00:44:58,712 --> 00:45:01,153
A game is a series of constraints

925
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:04,093
on an activity that reliably and repeatedly.

926
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:07,584
meet that exotelic aspiration for a specific audience.

927
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:12,686
And I'm pretty sure that I just said that games are about fulfilling your dreams,

928
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:14,247
so I'm going to go back to the red slide, sorry.

929
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:20,010
So what exactly is the exotelic aspiration that a plasma rifle is intended to fulfill?

930
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,652
Well, I think you have to describe these needs sort of

931
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:31,134
poetically, they're not necessarily something reduced to a technical term, so

932
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:34,576
the first one is I think they make the player feel like they're on another level.

933
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:41,809
They're making their enemies look dumb, and running rings around them is a good sort of

934
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,090
trope.

935
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,431
You want to manipulate your enemies and frighten them and play with them before you kill them.

936
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:52,413
I think the plasma rifle also fulfills the aspiration to be cool under fire.

937
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:57,655
You're facing danger, and it's real danger, but you approach it with like kind of a discipline

938
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:01,856
and you don't panic and you do things just the right way and you end up winning.

939
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:03,837
And also...

940
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,852
the plasma rifle is all about turning the tables.

941
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:10,474
So the enemy's trying to use the plasma rifle on you,

942
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:11,834
and you take it from them, and you

943
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,255
use it on them and their friends much more effectively

944
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:14,816
than they could.

945
00:46:17,197 --> 00:46:20,458
Turns out, this is not just about the plasma rifle.

946
00:46:20,598 --> 00:46:21,979
This is about every enemy weapon.

947
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:23,759
So even though Halo 3 doesn't really

948
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:26,841
feature the plasma rifle, the legacy of the plasma rifle

949
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,342
goes through to all the other enemy weapons in the game.

950
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:33,463
So for almost every weapon.

951
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:35,985
that the enemy uses in Halo 3.

952
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:37,806
It's slower for enemies.

953
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:42,127
Basically, they start out a little bit slow,

954
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,608
and then they accelerate, which gives you plenty of time

955
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,169
to see where it's coming and then dodge it.

956
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,710
They also have ramp up time, so the rate of fire

957
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,591
actually increases the longer you hold on the trigger.

958
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,032
But it's much faster for players.

959
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:57,393
So the player in Halo 3 always uses the speed

960
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:58,853
that the AI would have on Legendary,

961
00:46:59,113 --> 00:47:00,314
and that includes multiplayer.

962
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,729
When you're firing a weapon, you don't, as a player,

963
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,690
care very much that it starts out slow,

964
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,131
as long as it gets to a quick speed very fast,

965
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,632
so you have the range that you need.

966
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:14,834
And players don't burst fire, at least not in the short bursts

967
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,695
that the AI does, so the ramp up isn't

968
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:17,856
as much of a factor for them.

969
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,458
This means that the player can always turn the tables

970
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:23,559
on the enemy by picking up their weapon

971
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,339
and using it against them.

972
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,322
The AI for grunts is comically incompetent.

973
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:31,003
They're always running away and panicking and putting

974
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:31,764
their arms up in the air.

975
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:35,515
We made sure that you could kill them with a single melee attack,

976
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,777
so you can kind of jump down amongst them like a cat

977
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:39,278
amongst mice and just start swinging.

978
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:42,900
But the elites, on the other hand, are dangerous,

979
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,581
but it's a manageable danger.

980
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:49,804
We added an idea in the AI of out-of-cover firing.

981
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,926
So when you first emerge from cover,

982
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,508
they're going to take a little while to start shooting at you.

983
00:47:55,528 --> 00:47:58,990
They're going to shoot at you in shorter bursts

984
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,471
with longer durations between them.

985
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:01,872
But the longer you stay out of cover,

986
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,387
they're gonna start honing in on you,

987
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:04,327
they're gonna be more accurate,

988
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:05,448
they're gonna shoot more often,

989
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:08,050
they're gonna shoot with less time in between shots.

990
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,792
And so, what this meant was that

991
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,614
for a while you could stay out of cover,

992
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:17,976
but after a while, without you even noticing it,

993
00:48:18,076 --> 00:48:19,337
because you probably were habituated,

994
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,899
the AI would just suddenly be able to start hitting you

995
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:24,040
and that would drive you back into cover.

996
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:27,122
We reduced the damage scale on Legendary,

997
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:29,643
that global damage scale that was so high before.

998
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,927
because we just decided that damage is not the right way to make a game harder.

999
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:37,189
I believe that the right way to make a game harder is to make it faster.

1000
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:42,892
So, the same experience slowed down becomes easy.

1001
00:48:43,913 --> 00:48:45,634
The same experience sped up becomes harder.

1002
00:48:45,654 --> 00:48:49,596
The projectiles go faster, the AI fire delays get shorter,

1003
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:53,778
in fact the entire combat cycle gets faster, so it's probably like 22 seconds of fun or something like that.

1004
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:59,972
And this emerged in a concept we call reciprocal difficulty.

1005
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:02,773
So basically, it's a form of dynamic difficulty,

1006
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:06,794
but it's not handled by the computer or the AI.

1007
00:49:06,814 --> 00:49:07,815
It's actually driven by the player.

1008
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:10,576
So the more you push a Halo encounter,

1009
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:14,117
the more it pushes back, which rewards risk.

1010
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:15,837
Because if you push really hard, you

1011
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:17,818
can break through very fast, as long

1012
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:19,858
as you can handle how hard it's pushing back at you.

1013
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,579
But at the same time, it forgives failure.

1014
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,720
So as soon as you withdraw, it withdraws.

1015
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:26,785
You'll notice in Halo, the AI don't really chase you very much.

1016
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:32,167
And we don't punish you at all for risking and then failing and running away.

1017
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:33,728
Your shields come back, your health comes back.

1018
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,029
The AI resets, basically.

1019
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:44,753
So I recently read a really fascinating book called Sleights of Mind, and it's a couple

1020
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:48,335
of neuroscientists who go into the world of magic, and they try to learn everything they

1021
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,957
can from the techniques that the magicians have.

1022
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:55,796
to figure out what's going on inside of the brain of the people that they're fooling.

1023
00:49:56,516 --> 00:50:02,660
And one of the things that they talk about in the context of a pickpocket is that you

1024
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,721
have a spotlight of attention.

1025
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:09,225
And anytime you attend to one thing, you are ignoring virtually everything else that is

1026
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:10,446
not happening in your spotlight.

1027
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:12,847
So that's the tunnel vision that we describe.

1028
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,449
And magicians exploit this feature mercilessly.

1029
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:18,711
The doves fly up, and you all look up, as most of you probably looked up just because

1030
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:19,292
they went like that.

1031
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:20,773
And then over here, they're doing something else.

1032
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:23,303
And I figured, you know, if magicians can do that,

1033
00:50:23,763 --> 00:50:26,464
if they can use distraction, then a game designer

1034
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:28,204
should be able to do the opposite in order

1035
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:29,985
to kind of hyper-focus while they're calibrating.

1036
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,706
So just a random smattering ideas

1037
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:33,626
on how to focus your attention.

1038
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:36,747
I always create custom test spaces

1039
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,627
so that nothing else is going on except for the thing

1040
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:39,827
that I'm trying to calibrate.

1041
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:42,608
You obviously can't ship a game that way,

1042
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:44,168
because eventually you need to try it all together.

1043
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,809
But I found that it helps you focus and not

1044
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,490
get distracted on the other things that are broken.

1045
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,609
if they're too fun, get distracted just playing the game.

1046
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,910
I use post-it notes, so if I'm balancing the plasma rifle,

1047
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,631
I'll put a post-it note that says plasma rifle on the screen.

1048
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:00,971
Right now I have one that says talk faster.

1049
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:08,593
I stare at Rorschach tests and try not to see pictures.

1050
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,693
I don't know, this is like the equivalent of last year's mouth

1051
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:12,754
noises with the warthog.

1052
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:18,075
But I feel like if you can train your brain to go into a state

1053
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,375
where it's not looking for patterns,

1054
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,255
you'll be able to see.

1055
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:25,825
specific patterns and put your spotlight directly on them more effectively.

1056
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:29,089
You need to avoid habituation.

1057
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,512
The way I do that is I take periodic breaks.

1058
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:35,836
Again, the custom test spaces are great for that because you play through it, and then

1059
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:37,037
when you get to the end, you just take a break.

1060
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:39,579
Or maybe you try tweaking something else.

1061
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:42,823
Sometimes I'll intentionally break something.

1062
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:44,705
I usually don't check this in, but I'll just...

1063
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,483
I'll just break something and play the game with a broken plasma rifle for a while, so

1064
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:53,006
I habituate to something else, and then when I put it back, I'm more sensitive to it.

1065
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:57,749
And I also do total recalibrations, and this drives producers nuts.

1066
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:04,574
But I'll basically save off a copy, blank out everything, and try to retune it from

1067
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:04,974
scratch.

1068
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:08,097
And then I'll compare the two, and I'll say, oh, these are really close.

1069
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,458
I bet you that's, you know, right.

1070
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:12,200
Or hey, these are totally different.

1071
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,901
And then I kind of have two things to compare.

1072
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,555
people can tell me which one they like more.

1073
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:19,697
So at the end of all that, in Halo 3,

1074
00:52:19,997 --> 00:52:22,938
14 world units per second, about 75% faster

1075
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:24,179
on Legendary and in multiplayer.

1076
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,741
The normal experience was that even on Legendary,

1077
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:30,562
you can dodge for short amounts of time,

1078
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:33,123
but eventually you have to return into cover.

1079
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:35,864
The unintended consequences of this

1080
00:52:35,924 --> 00:52:40,466
was that we started to see players sort of standardizing

1081
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:41,046
how they were playing.

1082
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:44,587
even on normal or on legendary, different quality of players,

1083
00:52:44,907 --> 00:52:46,448
they would kind of have the same pattern.

1084
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:49,731
And we would see that a level was

1085
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,933
taking about the same time for everybody to complete.

1086
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:57,818
And it wasn't badly broken, which was a good thing.

1087
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:02,822
In multiplayer, people started to use the plasma rifle

1088
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:06,145
more often because it was faster and it was more effective,

1089
00:53:06,765 --> 00:53:08,587
especially when combining arms with teammates.

1090
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:13,259
We saw people want to use the alien weapons more,

1091
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,682
and they want to play as elites more, which was useful later on.

1092
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:17,883
And again, not badly broken.

1093
00:53:18,924 --> 00:53:21,145
The legendary experience, legendary is very hard.

1094
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:21,726
It's supposed to be.

1095
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:23,767
But it's not punishing hard.

1096
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:26,289
It just requires a very high level of skill.

1097
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,173
And so we saw people, especially reviewers,

1098
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:32,634
that were playing on higher difficulty levels

1099
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:33,695
were giving it a higher score.

1100
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:36,397
And we also developed this bizarre sub-community.

1101
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:39,819
where they play solo legendary all skulls on it.

1102
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:40,919
You know what the skulls are.

1103
00:53:40,979 --> 00:53:42,760
I mean, that makes it incredibly hard.

1104
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,521
But at the same time, it's still doable

1105
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:47,882
because we're not cranking up the damage

1106
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:48,762
to ridiculous levels.

1107
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,383
So hopefully not badly broken.

1108
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:56,505
Which brings me to ODST, which was named Halo 3 ODST

1109
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,586
for a reason, because the sandbox didn't really change.

1110
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:04,768
Which brings me to Halo Reach, where the plasma rifle was

1111
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,488
reborn as the plasma.

1112
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:12,089
So our competition was pretty clear.

1113
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,132
We, by that time, had a large collection of sub-communities.

1114
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,592
So there's the multiplayer-only community.

1115
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:21,413
There's the people that just wanted to jump into Forge.

1116
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,154
Firefight was really popular.

1117
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:27,996
And one of the sub-communities was Halo developers.

1118
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:31,558
Basically, almost every member of the original team

1119
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:33,638
had already moved on to the next big thing by then.

1120
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:37,940
And fully half of the Reach team was hired after Halo 3 shipped.

1121
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,644
So that meant, to some extent, Halo Reach was made by the community, for the community,

1122
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,686
and they were very in tune with what the community wanted.

1123
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:54,692
Which brought up things like Elites versus Spartans, where they wanted total weapon parity

1124
00:54:54,752 --> 00:55:00,277
between the Elite weapons and the Spartan weapons, which meant that they needed an Elite

1125
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:04,360
assault rifle, which is what the Platinum Repeater eventually became.

1126
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:09,474
and that meant basically all they wanted for that game was the instant projectiles

1127
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,955
because otherwise it just wasn't fair.

1128
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:14,458
It's hard to hit a human with a dodgeable projectile.

1129
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:18,122
And they really were intent on going back to the feel of Halo 1,

1130
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,504
back to fighting elites, they removed dual wielding,

1131
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:22,626
there are lots more plasma rifles in the game.

1132
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:26,929
So according to the Halo re-strategy guide,

1133
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,952
did I mention I didn't really work on this game?

1134
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:31,724
The plasma rifle's primary purpose

1135
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:34,566
is to disable the shields of close, you know, forget it.

1136
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:38,089
I'm going to take a lesson from the plasma rifle.

1137
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:39,150
I'm going to kind of dodge this one.

1138
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,651
It's not fair for an ex-Bungie designer

1139
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,573
to talk about the decisions that the current design team made.

1140
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,815
And I'm almost out of time anyway.

1141
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:53,920
But you find that in the middle of the project,

1142
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,761
things were very different than Halo 3.

1143
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:57,202
But by the end of the project, they had sort of

1144
00:55:57,572 --> 00:56:00,534
veered back in the direction of what we had at the end of Halo 3.

1145
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:03,095
So conclusions.

1146
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,497
Tuning and balancing are not the same.

1147
00:56:06,717 --> 00:56:12,340
Balance is about longevity, especially in multiplayer, and tuning is really the craft

1148
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:22,346
of making something fun, which is, depending on which theory section you agreed with, specialized

1149
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:26,448
brain circuit activity, or performing a skill in a natural, meaningful context.

1150
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,619
or meeting exotelic aspiration.

1151
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:32,380
The tuning process, first you understand your audience,

1152
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,401
either by choosing it or inheriting it,

1153
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:37,162
because your audience is inseparable

1154
00:56:37,222 --> 00:56:38,103
from their context.

1155
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:41,484
Then you find their exotelic aspiration, or the activity

1156
00:56:41,504 --> 00:56:42,024
that they want to do.

1157
00:56:44,545 --> 00:56:47,727
You choose a fun activity that is reactive, repeatable,

1158
00:56:47,927 --> 00:56:48,387
reliable.

1159
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:50,048
And keep in mind, these are rare,

1160
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:53,269
and that's why you're going to very rarely invent

1161
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:54,510
an entirely new kind of game.

1162
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,130
Then you integrate the mechanics so that they support each other

1163
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:03,293
and calibrate the values to your internal player model,

1164
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:05,734
sometimes starting over from scratch.

1165
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:08,975
And then verify the experience through user research,

1166
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:10,556
and hopefully nothing is badly broken.

1167
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,597
And now I am out of here.

1168
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:17,099
I don't really have time for questions.

1169
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:19,580
We have like 30 seconds left, which is not.

1170
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:22,669
enough time for the first questioner to usually get out their question.

1171
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,331
So if you have them, you can email me at Jamie Griesemer.

1172
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:26,852
I have a lot more time on my hands now.

1173
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:32,777
And I'm also writing in more detail on a lot of this stuff on my website, thetipofthesphere.com.

1174
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:35,719
And I have plenty of business cards up here.

1175
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:41,603
If anybody has any questions they want to email me, or if they want a personal version

1176
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:43,985
of this talk, or would like to offer me a job.

1177
00:57:44,606 --> 00:57:44,806
Thank you.
