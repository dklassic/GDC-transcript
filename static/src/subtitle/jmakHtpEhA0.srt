00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,006
Hello everybody, my name is Insane, or my internet name is InsaneTheRainMusic, my real

2
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,448
name is Carlos Ini.

3
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:19,737
I am very excited to be joining you tonight at a weird virtual GDC.

4
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:23,509
I am a musician on YouTube primarily.

5
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,932
I take video game soundtracks and I arrange them and perform them in the style of my favorite

6
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:28,633
jazz music.

7
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:33,697
Not just traditional jazz, stuff like contemporary jazz, fusion jazz, Latin jazz, all these kinds

8
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:33,997
of things.

9
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:34,878
And I play a lot of instruments.

10
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:39,601
One of the benefits of doing a livestream concert from home is that I have, let me see,

11
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:47,608
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine different things I can play on with my

12
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:48,388
immediate disposal.

13
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:50,290
So without further ado, let's get started.

14
00:00:54,189 --> 00:01:06,689
Oh, press the button.

18
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,174
Oh, this is on. Hello. Hey, everybody.

19
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,176
For just joining us, I'm Insanity Music.

20
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:39,579
I'm currently performing a song from the video game Deltarune.

21
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,401
The song is called Field of Hopes and Dreams, composed by Toby Fox.

22
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,243
He made the soundtrack for the game Undertale as well.

23
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:51,006
I love this part.

24
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:22,640
I can use a key change.

25
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:23,635
Woo!

26
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:24,615
Woo!

27
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,356
Yeah.

28
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:30,039
Whoo!

29
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,802
There it is.

30
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:35,303
Woo!

31
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:35,603
Woo!

32
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,169
All right, wow.

33
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,665
Uh, that was, as I said, as I said during the song, that was Field of Hopes and Dreams, uh,

34
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:02,107
from the video game Deltarune, composed by Toby Fox. I arranged that and for, um, the backing

35
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:05,909
track you heard was all me. I performed that as like a multi-track thing on my YouTube channel,

36
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,951
um, and I arranged it for like a big eight-minute epic arrangement because that song means a lot to

37
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:16,092
me. Um, one of the reasons I make video game music covers on YouTube is because, you know,

38
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:19,774
like, as we all know at GDC, game audio is just such a, such an, um,

39
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,241
A huge part of what makes a game great.

40
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,943
And I would love to be able to spread that.

41
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:32,266
You know, just recognize game music for what it is and the societal impact that it has,

42
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:33,607
which I think is tremendous.

43
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:34,568
And I am...

44
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:34,668
It's...

45
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:34,828
It's...

46
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:34,928
It's...

47
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:35,048
It's...

48
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:35,148
It's...

49
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:35,248
It's...

50
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:35,428
It's...

51
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:35,548
It's...

52
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:36,169
It's...

53
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:36,329
It's...

54
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:36,469
It's...

55
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:36,709
It's...

56
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:36,809
It's...

57
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:36,909
It's...

58
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:37,009
It's...

59
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:41,753
Coming from the background of a jazz musician, we have a jazz standard songbook that we all

60
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,055
know and learn over time.

61
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:49,339
And I think that's shifting, or something like a video game music songbook is emerging.

62
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,782
So I'm going to be playing quite a few classics from different games.

63
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,804
I don't think I have the same game that appears in the set twice.

64
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,926
So there's a good bit of variety in here.

65
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,899
This next tune is composed by David Wise, who I have met before.

66
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,480
He's a funny guy.

67
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,524
And this is from, I think it's Donkey Kong Country.

68
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:09,466
It's either one or two.

69
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,187
I'm not quite sure.

70
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:13,492
But this is Mining Melancholy, which is a beautiful, beautiful tune.

71
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:14,033
Here we go.

00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:05,956
Thank you for watching.

75
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,418
when i clicked plz

76
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:38,738
help

77
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:38,919
black

78
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:39,099
yes

79
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,179
yes

80
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,420
yes

81
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,520
yes

82
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,041
NO

83
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:40,381
DUDE

84
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:44,248
MAKE A GAME

85
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,657
from Donkey Kong Country 2 or 1, not sure which one.

86
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,518
It's one of the Donkey Kong Country games.

87
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:00,319
They're both fantastic soundtracks.

88
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,840
So that featured me playing, at the beginning you heard a looping section

89
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,701
featuring the drums and all my percussion instruments.

90
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:09,963
Then I think I picked up playing piano and also Fender Rhodes using this keyboard.

91
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,265
Also the eewee, which is the electronic wind instrument.

92
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,347
A saxophone solo, and then drums to finish it off.

93
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,428
I really enjoy playing lots of different instruments.

94
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:28,368
I'm going to introduce one more in the next song, which is my upright bass back here, in a song I haven't performed live before.

95
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,092
This one is from an indie game that I really, really love. Amazing art style and soundtrack.

96
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:43,434
This is Green Path from the game Hollow Knight, which was composed by Christopher Larkin.

97
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:10,112
Thank you for watching.

98
00:17:55,075 --> 00:18:03,041
Thank you for watching.

99
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:20,722
Thank you so much.

100
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:28,457
Have a great day and have a wonderful day.

101
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:26,042
We hope you enjoyed reading these transcripts.

102
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:33,731
We do hope you check out our first two albums of this series.

103
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:40,159
You can find the links down below in the description.

104
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,420
And, until next time,

105
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,801
stay wild.

106
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,314
It's not.

107
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:26,148
So

108
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:05,582
This may not be entirely accurate, though.

111
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,009
Whew, that was Greenpath from Hollow Knight.

112
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,771
What a beautiful, beautiful ballad

113
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:42,653
that I arranged into a jazz arrangement.

114
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:46,457
That featured, started with bass.

115
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,598
We had some piano.

116
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:48,879
We had some tenor saxophone.

117
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,501
Great piece of music.

118
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,142
There was also a bass clarinet in the background

119
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:58,026
of that recording, if you could hear that.

120
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:58,367
Cool.

121
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:01,409
This next song, actually, let me, I'm going to wipe this,

122
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:02,650
grab a little cloth.

123
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:03,531
Here I have.

124
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:23,964
Much better. I was feeling easier.

125
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,143
As fun as it is to play all these things myself and set up all this looping,

126
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:53,587
it is a lot more fun when you have a bunch of other musicians.

127
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,872
And that is such a wonderful experience, to have a bunch of other musicians there,

128
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:05,079
ready to do your bidding, as I say, as sometimes the crazy arranger that I am.

129
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:10,373
This next tune is from my favorite video game soundtrack of all time.

130
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:11,873
I had to put one in there.

131
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:14,354
I'm currently doing a project around this game,

132
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:20,275
where I am essentially taking most of the original soundtrack

133
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:22,996
and arranging it with my jazz vision,

134
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:24,996
turning it into what I like,

135
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,277
putting the music in the best way I possibly can.

136
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:31,078
And that soundtrack is Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl.

137
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:35,242
I grew up as a... I remember getting Pok√©mon Red at like a Goodwill with my mom when I was a kid.

138
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:39,065
And, um, that music has become so important to me.

139
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:44,890
So, I only find it... I find it super fitting that I'm, you know, arranging it and performing it.

140
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:51,256
So this selection is, uh, Eterna Forest, which is one of my favorite songs of gaming in totality.

141
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:52,897
It's just such an amazing composition.

142
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,339
This was originally composed by Go Ichinose.

143
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,181
Here's Eterna Forest.

144
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:30,384
We're doing a bit of pressure here.

147
00:32:49,539 --> 00:33:00,142
Oh man, that tune is so wonderful. That was A Turn of Forest from Pokemon David and Pearl, composed by Go Ichinose, arranged by me back in 2016, I think. I'm working on a new version of that right now.

148
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:03,143
That song was... I love the melody of that song.

149
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:10,124
So good. I love it.

150
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:10,564
I love it.

151
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,186
Oh, right. What is that?

152
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,356
We should be good for this.

153
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,280
This next tune is from a Sega franchise.

154
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,524
I know I had to get Sega in there somewhere.

155
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,788
Sonic music. I love Sonic.

156
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,213
I played Sonic Advance as a kid on my Game Boy.

157
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:40,588
I didn't really quite understand how it worked or how to beat the game, but I knew that it

158
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,348
was fun to play.

159
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:45,651
And sometimes I think that's forgotten, is that we have all these complex games that

160
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,253
have so many complex mechanics, but they're not fun.

161
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,774
Or they're not like...

162
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:56,298
There's something to be said about just visceral joy of just moving around the character.

163
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,963
When a game can nail having a character move around and have that be fun in and of itself,

164
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:03,943
that is something special.

165
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:09,814
I am presenting Studiopolis Zone from Sonic Mania.

166
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:15,055
I believe this is composed by T-Lopes. I know he did a lot of arrangements for this soundtrack.

167
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:18,716
He's a great dude. Happy to be playing his music.

168
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,277
This is Studiopolis Zone.

169
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:25,438
It's funky.

170
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,286
session.

171
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:43,608
Here we go.

00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,165
Studiopolis Zone from Sonic Mania, featuring...

178
00:39:57,426 --> 00:39:59,487
This is... I haven't introduced this instrument yet, I think.

179
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:04,392
This is the EWI. This is the Electronic Wind Instrument.

180
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:07,174
What a beautiful... a beautiful instrument it is.

181
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,757
It's so fun. It's like the electric guitar version of the saxophone.

182
00:40:10,857 --> 00:40:13,400
There's so many different sounds I can make, and there's a lot of different...

183
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,643
It's so fun to play. So, I'm glad to be playing it for you tonight.

184
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,940
Oh, what is next on our wonderful list?

185
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,001
I had to move my keyboard off my keyboard, so I'll put my keyboard back on my keyboard.

186
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,424
Ah, yes. So, for this next tune,

187
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:37,164
um,

188
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,265
I want to do something a little different from the rest of the set.

189
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,426
This song is solo piano, which is completely different.

190
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,491
It is a beautiful song composed by Yasunori Mitsuda

191
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:51,552
from the video game Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which is one of my favorite games.

192
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,573
I played it last year, favorite games of all time.

193
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,153
It just has such a beautiful soundtrack.

194
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:59,714
And this is the opening theme from the game or like the title screen

195
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:03,675
called Where We Used to Be, also known as Elysium in the Blue Sky.

196
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:06,215
And this is a solo piano piece.

197
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:09,116
I took I'm also a classical pianist to some degree.

198
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,297
I can play notes on the piano.

199
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:13,397
So I'm going to tie my shoe.

200
00:41:14,077 --> 00:41:14,678
Then I'm going to play that.

201
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:34,546
Sometimes you're just bopping, then you lose a shoe. It happens.

202
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:39,668
Xenoblade! I love Xenoblade. I just finished the first one.

203
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:51,542
And here is where we used to be from Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

204
00:41:53,323 --> 00:41:54,063
By Yasunori Mitsuda.

205
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:50,655
Thank you everybody, that was Where We Used To Be from Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

206
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:54,158
God, such a... that melody of um...

207
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,505
It's one of my favorite melodies in all of video gaming.

208
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:04,486
Augh!

209
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,129
Woo, boy, it's so good.

210
00:45:15,134 --> 00:45:18,675
Oh yes, because next we have the one non-video game song on the setlist.

211
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:21,377
This is an original song of mine, titled...

212
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:22,957
What's it called?

213
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:23,878
Oh, it's called Forward.

214
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:29,240
I wrote this after a bad period of my life, and I was at the airport leaving MagFest,

215
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:32,062
and I was like, huh, this is a good idea for a song.

216
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:33,523
So, I wrote a song.

217
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:38,645
It's in the style of a lot of Japanese jazz fusion, which is probably my favorite genre music ever.

218
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:40,226
So here is...

219
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:41,687
Forward.

220
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:22,627
There are various types of lenses, in which the dubbing of the sound styles found in the

221
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:33,834
game and an interactive orientation to the character of the character by looking at the

222
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:35,876
sources of the sound.

223
00:47:43,524 --> 00:47:50,849

225
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,955

And if you like my video, please like it.

227
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:08,741
Thank you for watching it.

228
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:50,026
That was my original song, Forward, not from a video game, but probably could be in a video

229
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:50,306
game.

230
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:51,947
I'd be happy if it was in a video game.

231
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:55,751
That song was so much fun.

232
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:58,273
Jumping back and forth between the eewee and the saxophone is, uh...

233
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:03,176
They have pretty much the same fingering system, so it's easy, but the act of switching them

234
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:04,377
physically is hard.

235
00:51:06,238 --> 00:51:06,978
Hope you guys enjoyed that.

236
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:14,122
My last selection is from a game called Animal Crossing, but it's probably not the cute Animal

237
00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:15,683
Crossing type music you're thinking of.

238
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:15,763
Oh.

239
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:17,484
Oh, what is this?

240
00:51:17,504 --> 00:51:17,544
Oh.

241
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:17,765
Here we go.

242
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:18,025
Oh, that's it.

243
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:18,365
That's the first...

244
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:18,565
I thought...

245
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:18,725
Oh, wait.

246
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:19,125
Maybe I should do a...

247
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:19,185
Oh.

248
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:19,586
Maybe I should do a...

249
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:19,646
Oh.

250
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:19,706
Oh.

251
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:19,766
Oh.

252
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:19,826
Oh.

253
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:19,886
Oh.

254
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:19,946
Oh.

255
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:22,387
Oh.

256
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:22,447
Oh.

257
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:22,507
Oh.

258
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:22,568
Oh.

259
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:22,748
Oh.

260
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:22,828
Oh.

261
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:22,888
Oh.

262
00:51:22,908 --> 00:51:22,948
Oh.

263
00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:23,028
Oh.

264
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:23,088
Oh.

265
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,332
Okay, reverb time. Let me turn that off while I'm talking.

266
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:28,614
Uh-huh.

267
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:32,117
Talk off. Okay, great.

268
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,164
So this next tune, I was inspired by this tune by the wonderful dog, K.K. Slider,

269
00:51:43,825 --> 00:51:48,448
who speaks in animalese, which is a wonderful, nuanced language.

270
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:52,071
I thought I would perform one of his songs. This is K.K. Cruisin'.

271
00:51:54,556 --> 00:51:55,644
In the voice of TK Slater.

272
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,263
WAIT TILL THE TRANSCRIPT IS DONE

273
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:05,779
ÏÉâ√≥s Six rays.

Yeah, there's your leg for you.

Oh yeah, oh.

00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:15,502
Oh yeah, oh, oh, oh.

289
00:54:15,642 --> 00:54:16,082
Oh yeah.

290
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:16,802
Having fun.

291
00:54:16,842 --> 00:54:17,943
We have laugh a lot.

292
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:19,863
It's just all we can do.

293
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:20,583
It's fun.

294
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:23,664
Around when you're having fun, let your head down.

295
00:54:23,704 --> 00:54:24,124
Oh, oh.

296
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:24,945
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

297
00:54:25,025 --> 00:54:25,525
Oh yeah.

298
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:26,085
Oh yeah.

299
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,707
Alright guys, let's try something fun.

300
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:23,289
I'm gonna sing some lines, and at home,

301
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,352
I encourage you to sing along, call and response style.

302
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:27,072
Here we go.

303
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,615
Bop, bop, boop, bop.

304
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:34,278
Bop, bop, boop, bop.

305
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:37,060
Bop, bop, boop, bop.

306
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,042
Bop, bop, boop, bop.

307
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:42,384
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

308
00:55:42,444 --> 00:55:43,225
KK messed up there.

309
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,540
So, let's get started.

310
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:37,451
Oh man.

311
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:53,145
I wonder if KK could actually sing using this thing.

312
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:55,787
Huh.

313
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:21,163
Alright folks, we're nearing the end of our show tonight.

314
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:29,549
I want to give a big thank you to all of you who tuned in for this precedent-setting, live-streamed GDC event.

315
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:35,873
Probably wasn't how most of us imagined it, but it means I get to be here playing music for you, which I very much enjoy.

316
00:57:38,275 --> 00:57:39,896
So, thank you very much for the opportunity.

317
00:57:41,197 --> 00:57:47,741
I'll play you guys out with the rest of this K.K. Kruisin arrangement, which is my favorite K.K. songs from Animal Crossing.

318
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:51,287
Here we go.

319
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:55,170
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

320
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,251
Do, do, do, do.

321
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,441
I love it!

322
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:27,401
Bye everyone!

323
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:11,165
Thank you so much for listening to me play!
