1
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:08,702
Diversity is the mix, woo,

2
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:11,684
and inclusion is making the mix work.

3
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:15,226
Who here thinks that we need to improve on our diversity

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,846
and inclusion in the games industry?

5
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:18,867
Lovely.

6
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:24,290
This is not a talk on defining diversity and inclusion,

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,492
and nor to convince you that we need diversity

8
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:29,933
and inclusion in the game industry.

9
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:31,634
I'd refer you to...

10
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:36,446
the GDC vault or ask the neighbor who raised their hands.

11
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:45,529
What this talk is one studio's how for starting a DNI.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,430
This will be a comprehensive talk

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,291
and I will use all my 30 minutes.

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:54,173
Questions will be answered after the talk across this hall

15
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:58,194
and I would appreciate you filling out the evaluation form.

16
00:00:58,214 --> 00:00:59,295
I'm sure you've heard that already.

17
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:07,105
This talk is about sharing the D&I journey of Avalanche Studios New York from 2016 to 2018.

18
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:14,088
I will share lessons we learned, challenges we continue to face, best practices we discovered,

19
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,748
and successes we've had.

20
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:22,631
This is intended to be a starter kit for you to have a sustainable and active D&I initiative

21
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:23,251
in your company.

22
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,627
like we did in the New York studio.

23
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:29,689
Since this is a grassroot initiative,

24
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,070
this talk is specific to the New York studio.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,411
In this talk, I won't offer any shortcuts,

26
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,912
nor magic pill or bullets.

27
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:41,213
It's not to vilify white males,

28
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,534
who are still the majority of this industry.

29
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,356
Rather, this highlights the importance of white males

30
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,157
to be an active ally in this D&I journey.

31
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,153
There's a lot of heart required to starting a D&I initiative.

32
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,134
Before embarking on this journey,

33
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:04,237
find out what's your with them, your what's in it for me,

34
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,319
your why for doing D&I.

35
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,080
It could be global competitiveness,

36
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,662
increasing your bottom line, being an ally and advocate,

37
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:16,584
avoiding lawsuits and bad publicity.

38
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,570
Or like me, you've been unlucky in the lottery of birth

39
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,891
and would like to make things better for you

40
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,691
and others who are also marginalized.

41
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,392
My with them is this.

42
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,353
I grew up thinking that discrimination

43
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:33,234
is just a part of life and that you don't have a choice,

44
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,255
but to accept that those who are fair-skinned,

45
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:41,917
rich, tall, and white get all the opportunities

46
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:44,978
in the world and those that are not are just unlucky.

47
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:52,555
I grew up in the Philippines, born and raised in the Philippines, and at a young age I've

48
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,316
seen the inequality of life.

49
00:02:54,896 --> 00:03:00,897
I moved to Singapore and was treated like a second class because of my color, which

50
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:01,617
is brown.

51
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:10,079
I moved to the U.S. and I'm an immigrant, and I experienced the microaggressions, but

52
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,960
it was only here that I got woke.

53
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,947
I could actually try to do something about the inequality

54
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,308
and make things better for me and folks like me.

55
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,769
Heads up, not everything that I'll share today

56
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,310
may be applicable to your team.

57
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,031
However, the answer is within your team.

58
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,211
It'll make you ask questions after this.

59
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,773
I am incredibly excited to be here and share with you

60
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,833
our ongoing journey with D&I.

61
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,235
The more we explore, the more we find out

62
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,015
that there's still a lot of work to be done.

63
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,896
We are a work in progress.

64
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,351
Here's some background on Avalanche Studios.

65
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,852
The company was founded in Stockholm, Sweden 15 years ago.

66
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,133
New York is the only studio outside of Sweden

67
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:55,553
and opened in 2011.

68
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,733
Avalanche Studios developed Mad Max,

69
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,974
the Just Cause series, the Hunter series,

70
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,214
Rage 2, and Generation Zero.

71
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:09,455
I was hired for Avalanche Studios three years ago

72
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:13,156
and I was ecstatic that part of my marching orders

73
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,276
was to do something about DNI.

74
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:18,130
Like most small to medium video game companies,

75
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,834
it's a struggle to have time, budget, and resources.

76
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:27,039
DNI is like, aw, that's nice, but nobody really gives time

77
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,222
and prioritize it, so it easily gets deprioritized.

78
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,706
I am an HR department of one, of a triple-A studio.

79
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,189
So I, too, have an alibi of being swamped.

80
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:42,613
So in 2016, I kick-started our D&I initiative

81
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:45,899
by hiring an external trainer to teach us about D&I.

82
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,326
Unfortunately, the training was not satisfactory.

83
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,290
For the one day event.

84
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,185
We were grouped and asked to complete tasks

85
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,046
around New York City.

86
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:59,188
Draw on the street, duct tape a tree,

87
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,450
copy a tattoo of a stranger,

88
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,172
eat something we haven't eaten before at Chinatown,

89
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,414
invade a store to take a picture,

90
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,696
climb to a rooftop to take a picture.

91
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,098
It was funny when we were doing it,

92
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,520
but the training ended and we realized

93
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,023
we didn't learn anything about DNI.

94
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,326
I felt personally responsible for that failed training.

95
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,422
We did get some of our money back.

96
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:26,525
The harder part was to gain the trust of employees

97
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:28,066
that they will not be misled again.

98
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,409
It was fun because it turned out to be a team bonding.

99
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,871
Again, we didn't learn anything about D&I.

100
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,275
This is not to discredit external trainers.

101
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,078
A failed training is actually common

102
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,179
according to the Society of Diversity

103
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,823
where I recently got certified to be a diversity practitioner.

104
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,022
Why?

105
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:57,729
The trainings are the go-to for starting a D&I initiative, and it almost always fails

106
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,216
because it tries to address a huge and complicated topic, which is D&I, in a one-day event.

107
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:11,943
The more fatal reason why D&I training fails is most companies just stop any initiative

108
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,245
after a failed training.

109
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,439
So the overarching lesson for starting a D&I initiative

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,701
is slow and consistent steps.

111
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:25,285
So like this baby, they have milk first

112
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:26,786
before they move on to solid food.

113
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,672
My first immediate lesson for when I started in 2016

114
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,276
after that D&I failed training

115
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:40,619
is humility partnered with curiosity.

116
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:51,284
Humility to accept that this is not a problem that can be solved by one person alone.

117
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,707
And curiosity to start asking questions of what will.

118
00:06:55,427 --> 00:07:03,054
So I did one-on-ones, Google Forum surveys, focus groups to find out what our employees

119
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:07,097
need, what are the pressing issues, and what are the long-term goals.

120
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,549
The second lesson is commitment to transform by the leadership.

121
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,713
This is done through creating and modeling a psychologically safe environment

122
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,794
where people are comfortable to give feedback.

123
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:21,177
I'm going to say it again, comfortable to give feedback.

124
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,620
We haven't perfected this and this is a never-ending effort.

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,783
A few steps that we started were we updated the handbook.

126
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,819
communicated the updates to our employees,

127
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,061
called out behavior through one-on-ones

128
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:34,762
that do not support this initiative,

129
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:38,124
and leadership also started implementing changes

130
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:39,425
suggested by employees.

131
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,427
The third lesson is establishing

132
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:45,028
internal and external partners.

133
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,150
After admitting that the first attempt was a failure,

134
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,331
I partnered with the leadership team,

135
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,033
our employees, and specific external groups

136
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:54,834
to boost our agenda.

137
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,336
I'll give examples in the next slides.

138
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:03,169
The second overarching lesson is diversity and inclusion

139
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,150
go hand in hand.

140
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,051
One cannot work without the other.

141
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,754
So you can't just hire a bunch of diverse folks

142
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:12,358
and say, good luck, because they will not thrive.

143
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:16,462
So our two goals are foster inclusivity in the company

144
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:20,025
and increase diversity representation

145
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,268
in the demographics of our employee.

146
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,988
So what are our actions to foster inclusivity?

147
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,388
If I could sum it up in one word,

148
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:33,029
it's called it's partnership, or creating partnership.

149
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,530
We have three ongoing internal partners.

150
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,651
Number one is the full support of a leadership who listens.

151
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:43,072
Having D&I considered in our events was a good start.

152
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,773
For example, in representing the company externally,

153
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,853
one small easy step is to make sure

154
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,554
that there's diversity in the representatives we send out.

155
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,161
In video game development, the industry is notoriously known for crunch.

156
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,902
You don't like crunch too, right? Or overtime? No?

157
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:07,083
Admittedly, this is a little easier for us because the company already is established

158
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:09,544
to be a huge advocate of work-life balance.

159
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:15,166
We have seven weeks of paid time off and our health, dental, vision insurances

160
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:20,787
are 100% paid by the company for employee plus dependents, including domestic partners.

161
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,390
Updating policies are also vital.

162
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,314
An easy win for us was changing one of our company paid

163
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:31,560
holidays, Good Friday holiday, which is a holiday for

164
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,385
Christians, to a floating holiday so that others who

165
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:38,469
don't observe Lent can observe their own holidays.

166
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:47,015
Establishing our business resource group or BRG is the heart of our D&I team.

167
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,696
How did we start the team?

168
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:53,338
I scheduled a one-on-one to those who emailed me and spoke to me about the failed training.

169
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:57,380
I asked them if they were willing to do voluntary work for D&I.

170
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,742
Employees who get it and want to do something about it.

171
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:04,203
Instructions for a project will remain a priority.

172
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:08,699
We will meet two to three times a month, and we would plan for activities.

173
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,140
They will not be policing employees.

174
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,182
We started out with eight volunteers and three studio management.

175
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:19,385
As time went on, there were attrition and addition within the team.

176
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,707
I would like you to be mindful of the word diversity fatigue.

177
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:29,511
It is a real issue where people get tired and impatient to see immediate changes.

178
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,384
As of this writing, there are six D&I team members.

179
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,931
I'm giving a shout out to our remaining OGs.

180
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:46,408
Third and important partners are every one of us, or employees, who turn out to be our

181
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:52,151
allies, creating awareness for ourselves and employees about microaggressions, educating

182
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:57,114
employees of interruptions during meetings and discussions, and implementing zero tolerance

183
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:02,196
for harassment, plus educating them on how to be an ally, foster an environment ready

184
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:03,037
for more diversity.

185
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:09,205
I heard a comment today on if you're a white male and you want to be an ally, what do you do?

186
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,830
Ask that question to the person you want to be an ally to.

187
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:21,096
In 2017, we started partnering with the following external allies, the academia,

188
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:24,118
non-profit organizations, and local New York groups.

189
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:28,420
We've hired incredible talents from our partner universities.

190
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,303
These employees also help out with school outreach.

191
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:36,286
Since there are not a lot of guides and materials out there to

192
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:39,333
Help us make D&I work.

193
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,354
Partnering with non-profit organizations

194
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,515
have been extremely helpful to our cause.

195
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,197
Tapping on their specialities are vital

196
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,157
and time plus cost efficient for us.

197
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:52,279
Lastly, our local New York video game groups.

198
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,560
New York is home to talented indie game developers.

199
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,941
Our being at events show our support and oneness.

200
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:01,922
We provide resources through talks by our developers

201
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,963
and we also share our expertise.

202
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:09,848
It has been a struggle and a balancing act to find thoughtful activities that make our

203
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,311
D&I initiative sustainable and efficient.

204
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,056
A few of our favorite and successful activities are awareness activities.

205
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:19,739
These are high impact, educational,

206
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,868
and the cost is minimal.

207
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,228
Here are some examples.

208
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:26,269
Roundtables are made of a panel.

209
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,509
They are volunteers, depending on the topic,

210
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,070
who have stories to tell, and there's a moderator.

211
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,590
We've had good success with our roundtables,

212
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,470
but they require a lot of preparation.

213
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:38,971
One learning experience for me from a roundtable

214
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:43,392
is I have an employee who I have difficulty talking to

215
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:46,092
because at times he has difficulty understanding.

216
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,413
At that roundtable, he shared that

217
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:56,087
Spanish is his second language, and he felt really bad that his parents didn't speak English,

218
00:12:56,147 --> 00:13:00,751
that he wished that they did so that he won't be in this predicament.

219
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:05,936
Him having shared that really helped me in terms of communicating with him.

220
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,879
The next one is documentaries.

221
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,521
These are easy and have high impact.

222
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,763
We choose a documentary that's based on a monthly theme.

223
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,325
Newsletters are a collection of research

224
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,727
on a topic that we would like for our employees to know.

225
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,510
Based on feedback, we hired a trainer again,

226
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,532
geared to empowering women and the marginalized.

227
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,274
This time it was useful because it was targeted

228
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:30,375
and it was specific.

229
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:36,509
More importantly, our conversations are the soul of our D&I initiatives.

230
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,612
For management, making sure all issues and concerns are listened to

231
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:46,878
and resolved as much as we can. For employees, encouraging difficult conversations,

232
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,121
help foster a good working relationship with their co-workers.

233
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,340
Two key things to maintain an active D&I initiatives

234
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,922
are planning a monthly theme as focus for the D&I initiatives.

235
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,522
This helps immensely since the D&I team all

236
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,343
have full-time jobs in the company.

237
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,944
Next is sending a feedback form through Google Form.

238
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:09,664
That's free.

239
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:13,025
After every event, to know real time if the activity

240
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,225
was effective or not.

241
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,466
I'm going to share and spend some time talking

242
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:18,306
about our 2018 calendar.

243
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:25,234
so you would be able to picture what a D&I initiative may look like when you implement it.

244
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:31,222
I will also share selected feedback from some activities. 2018 was our year two of our D&I

245
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:31,463
journey.

246
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,395
In January, our theme was global citizens.

247
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,177
We have diversity and nationality being in New York,

248
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,158
and a majority of us relocated from somewhere to work there.

249
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:46,980
Our roundtable activity was to understand the struggles

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,462
or differences and challenges of relocating.

251
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:53,784
We had four volunteers who are immigrants, relocators,

252
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,985
and people who have worked abroad.

253
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,293
And they shared their personal stories and their struggles

254
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,433
and their triumphs, all to create awareness.

255
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:06,275
My takeaway was those who have to get visas, especially

256
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,636
in the US, have a lot to worry about

257
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,237
versus someone who's local who don't

258
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,478
have to worry about that on top of their work.

259
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,240
In February, for Black History Month,

260
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,883
we sent out a newsletter educating our employees

261
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:21,246
on why in the US this is celebrated.

262
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,209
We showed 13th, a Netflix documentary

263
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:25,290
at a bring your own lunch,

264
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,713
and had a debrief at a lunch the week after.

265
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,576
This thought provoking documentary analyzed

266
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,719
the criminalization of African Americans

267
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,481
and the US prison boom.

268
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:39,553
In March, for Women's Month, we sent out a newsletter,

269
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:42,134
watched the documentary Misrepresentation,

270
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:45,115
a film showcasing the horrifying realities

271
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,875
of female media representation.

272
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:50,016
Video games as a form of media is powerful

273
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:51,417
in influencing our audience.

274
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:55,078
As creators, knowing the misrepresentation of women

275
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,538
is useful for being mindful on what we create.

276
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:03,300
We had four women as well participated from Avalanche Studios at an external

277
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
event in New York.

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,741
And a lot were happily surprised that, wow, there are women in Avalanche Studios?

279
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:13,962
Also, the women in the company started Ladies Who Pastry.

280
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:18,763
It's a half an hour get together biweekly of ladies to fika and chat.

281
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:23,684
Fika is a Swedish tradition of a short break or downtime with coffee or snacks.

282
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,834
In April for Spanish American Heritage Month,

283
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:30,536
we taught our employees how to say the correct pronunciation

284
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,076
of the Spanish words in our game.

285
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:35,118
Just Cause 4 is set in South America.

286
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:37,659
For May, we sent out a newsletter

287
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,699
on Asian Pacific Heritage Month.

288
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,461
One of my favorite activities is the Privilege Walk.

289
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,002
You can search this on YouTube.

290
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,603
I think it's the best way to talk about privilege

291
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,103
without going into semantics,

292
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,064
but just share personal stories.

293
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:56,420
There are 35 questions, all of you start in one line,

294
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,924
and depending on the question,

295
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,607
you either step forward or step back.

296
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,857
And the discussions after that was just priceless.

297
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:09,466
Another thing that happened in May came from the feedback we got from women,

298
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:14,349
which was the need for a training for respect in the workplace and assertiveness.

299
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,633
This was in the height of the Me Too movement, and aside from enforcing a zero tolerance in the workplace,

300
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:24,976
we got a trainer to equip the women and marginalize with skills to face this issue.

301
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,505
My personal takeaway from this is that as women and minorities,

302
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:33,608
we tend to say sorry way too many times.

303
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:38,112
So at times, just avoid saying sorry and say excuse me.

304
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,635
Like, sorry, I got this rule in book.

305
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,817
Just say excuse me, I have this rule in book.

306
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,458
It improves our assertiveness.

307
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:51,456
In June for Pride Month, we had the roundtable where some LGBTQ plus employees volunteered

308
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,456
to share their stories.

309
00:17:52,996 --> 00:18:01,339
Our goal was to normalize LGBTQ plus and hearing a familiar person's story was vital to this

310
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:02,459
goal.

311
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,820
Their comfort in coming out showed that they trust the organization and that they felt

312
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,861
that they have co-workers who are ready to listen.

313
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,137
We went on a three-month hiatus.

314
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:14,339
In July, our studio closed for two weeks

315
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,000
for our summer break tradition.

316
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,362
August and September, we were extremely busy

317
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,242
finishing the game.

318
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:24,405
We restarted in October for Indigenous Peoples Month.

319
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,287
We had a presentation at a company meeting

320
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:29,968
on what and who are the indigenous people.

321
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,090
We mindfully looked for ways to link our initiatives

322
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,571
to be industry-specific.

323
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,354
Again, info is not readily available.

324
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:44,383
So for Indigenous Peoples Month, we looked for games that have Native Americans as protagonists

325
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:48,168
and we made it available for employees to play during their break.

326
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:52,419
Our final activity for 2018 was Disability in Games,

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,541
and we partnered with a non-profit organization,

328
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:59,203
Able Gamers, to educate us on what we can do as developers

329
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,204
to make games that are more accommodating

330
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,524
to disabled players.

331
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:06,306
They helped design the new Xbox Adaptive Controller.

332
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,368
We invited them to our studio in New York,

333
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,009
and we also hosted an event where we opened our studio

334
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,630
to external folks so that they can spread the message

335
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,352
of enhancing the disabled player experience

336
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:18,452
so more people can play.

337
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,741
New York recently passed a law to require an interactive

338
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:24,822
preventing harassment training for all employees.

339
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:28,603
We achieved 100% compliance in this educated our employees

340
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,663
on preventing harassment.

341
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,804
I believe that laws can help the DNI initiative in that,

342
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,904
for instance, when you're requesting for more budget,

343
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:40,285
if it's for compliance issue or purposes,

344
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,785
then the budget is easy to get.

345
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,566
The other New York law that I like a lot

346
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,586
is making it illegal to ask candidates

347
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,066
their current salary.

348
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,923
This way employers just pay the market and not a previous salary, which historically

349
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,103
is lower for women and minorities.

350
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,524
And that was our 2018 calendar.

351
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:03,445
Thank you.

352
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:07,706
I wasn't expecting that.

353
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:10,387
But you think you can do one activity from that list?

354
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:13,055
Good.

355
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,397
Our second goal was to improve our diversity hires.

356
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,197
Improving our diversity numbers in the company

357
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,878
is all good for creativity.

358
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:24,159
A common thing to hear from naysayers,

359
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,800
though, is that they're colorblind

360
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,880
and that DNI is not a problem.

361
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,381
And think that we lower the quality of hires

362
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,122
when we start diversity hiring.

363
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,883
Diversity hiring, however, is just

364
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,144
to create a level playing field for all.

365
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,002
Not empowering some while disenfranchising others.

366
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,204
It is just casting a wider net and still hire the best out of that pool.

367
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:54,128
To cast a wider net, one of the first few things we reviewed were our initiatives in sourcing and recruiting.

368
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,897
First, I conducted an internal interviewer's training with tools and

369
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:00,498
best practices for interviewing.

370
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,323
Making hiring managers aware of their biases was a goal of the training.

371
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:09,907
Interviewers are instructed to focus on competencies and potential of a candidate

372
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:12,409
versus hiring how they normally used to,

373
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:16,813
which is usually hiring someone who looks like them and are like them.

374
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:20,516
To expect change, you must change our interviewing habits.

375
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,108
Second is better sourcing process.

376
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:27,431
There's data to prove that updating the job descriptions

377
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,833
to be gender neutral, providing a description

378
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:33,277
of what the role is, versus itemizing required

379
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:35,339
qualifications increases the likelihood

380
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:36,701
that females would apply.

381
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:41,766
Best practices include avoiding ninja or bro language

382
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,789
and painting a culture of just always partying and drinking.

383
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,656
Discovering new job sites to post our jobs that would have different reach was another thing we did.

384
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:56,484
We also increased our referral bonus. We saved on recruitment fees and got quality candidates from referrals.

385
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:04,794
Third, we are aware that the first thing that candidates look at specifically in the U.S. to find out about the company is Glassdoor.

386
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,756
They are known as the quote unquote enemy of the company, most companies.

387
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:14,119
We partnered with them instead to make sure that information on Glassdoor about

388
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,640
Avalanche Studios is accurate.

389
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,063
A few of easy updates are correcting what our benefits are and

390
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,464
sharing our activities and news.

391
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:24,387
Candidates find out about our commitment to work life balance, and

392
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:27,389
this is attractive to women and those with families.

393
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,592
We continue to work on what needs improvement based on reviews, and

394
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:35,215
increase our engagement by replying to reviews, good or bad.

395
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:39,412
The next two actions are for long-term results.

396
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,693
We increased our studio visits.

397
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,894
We accommodated requests for more schools and students

398
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:48,195
to come to the studio, meet and greet the developers,

399
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:51,636
and know that making video games is a real job

400
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:52,377
that they can have.

401
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,392
Same goal of Take Your Kids to Work Day on a grander scale.

402
00:22:57,012 --> 00:23:00,897
The visit includes basic information on what are the different roles that they can be on

403
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:06,422
a AAA project, and the tools or software that they can start learning and enhancing.

404
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:11,408
It is heartwarming to inspire and motivate young, underprivileged, diverse kids to pursue

405
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:12,709
their passion in video games.

406
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,373
We believe that we can have a more diverse pool of candidates in the future.

407
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:21,076
When we start educating a more diverse group of youngsters,

408
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:25,540
that video game making is a wonderful possibility and career for everyone.

409
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:31,145
Just two weeks ago, there were ten year olds who come to the studio and

410
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,366
want to learn programming.

411
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:35,369
And it blew my mind because their questions are about C++.

412
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,351
And I'm like, what did I do when I was ten?

413
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,934
Fifth, we extended our reach to minorities

414
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,696
and marginalized groups by being present at their events.

415
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:49,477
Examples are Game Devs of Color Expo, PlayNYC,

416
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:52,378
AbleGamers, New York City Video Game Critics Circle,

417
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:53,719
and Animation Project.

418
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:59,567
We have improved our number of hits and minimize our misses in our activities as

419
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:00,267
time goes on.

420
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,109
I would like you to be aware and learn from our challenges as well.

421
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:09,011
The main thing is there are not a lot of materials out there, nor

422
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,092
guides to help us.

423
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:14,774
Knowing what works for your demographics is the most important part.

424
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:19,276
And knowing comes from conversations, surveys, asking questions,

425
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:22,297
being curious, don't be afraid to look dumb.

426
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:27,430
We often have production schedule conflict because we have a game to finish.

427
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:31,674
The D&I team has to be mindful of that when planning for activities.

428
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:36,097
In the beginning of this talk, I shared that D&I requires a lot of heart.

429
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,299
There will be discouragements from others,

430
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,921
primarily because of their hardwired biases.

431
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:45,485
And thoughtfully looking for activities is taxing because we don't want

432
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,128
to alienate others who are not yet our allies.

433
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,820
We are restricted with not having the biggest budget

434
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,601
in the world to do grander things.

435
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:58,042
And we've also experienced members of our D&I team leave,

436
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,163
and since it's a voluntary work, we don't hold them back,

437
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:02,604
and it's never easy.

438
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:07,805
It is hard work, time-consuming,

439
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:09,366
but I'm proud to share with you

440
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,767
that this is one of the most fulfilling initiatives

441
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:13,987
I've been fortunate to be a part of,

442
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,688
and I've learned so much.

443
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,916
I'm happy to report that in two years, our different activities and

444
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,176
partnerships resulted into the following.

445
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,797
We have nearly doubled our women hires.

446
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:30,139
Our active and sustainable D&I initiatives made noticeable impact to the lives

447
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,240
of all employees, especially the marginalized.

448
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,401
By just casting a wider net, we've hired our first woman programmer,

449
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,642
promoted from within a woman to senior producer.

450
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:43,463
We hired interns where three out of four were women.

451
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,984
One of the women got hired as a full-time employee.

452
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:49,877
Our retention rates for women has also been very high.

453
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:51,639
True story.

454
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:55,001
We were having our Coney Island trip in June,

455
00:25:56,102 --> 00:25:58,083
and one of the high tech companies,

456
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,666
their names may have book and face in it,

457
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,048
and they challenged us to a tug of war.

458
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:08,130
They lost the first round and asked for a redo,

459
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,871
asking for more women from our team.

460
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:13,014
We still won the second round, but I'm more happy

461
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:14,395
that we have more than enough women

462
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:16,156
to even participate in a tug of war.

463
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:22,163
We also have increased our people of color hires to half.

464
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:25,766
Our activities have fostered a comfortable environment

465
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,226
for employees to give feedback

466
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,628
as to what we can improve in our games.

467
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:33,550
One African-American employee suggested to change the name

468
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,832
of one of our characters because the original name

469
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,653
was offensive to African-Americans.

470
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,535
A Hispanic employee suggested the initiative

471
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:43,396
to teach our employee how to pronounce the Spanish words

472
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,377
in our game correctly.

473
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:51,984
This same comfortable environment led to LGBTQ plus employees saying that they're comfortable

474
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,145
to be themselves and comfortable coming out.

475
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:59,746
I haven't even mentioned the many ripple effect that we've had to everyone since we started.

476
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:04,867
The bright ideas that come from our employees and connections we've made are priceless.

477
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:08,348
These are tangible changes that fuel our efforts.

478
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:14,609
2019 and onwards, we would like to continue on the journey to the ultimate goal of D&I

479
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,610
protecting our games.

480
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,123
If you could only take three takeaways from today,

481
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:23,206
here's a summary of what you can bring back

482
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:25,150
to your organizations depending on your role

483
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,433
immediately when you get back next week,

484
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,178
or unless you're on vacation next week.

485
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,981
For those in management.

486
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,545
Humility is the way for D&I to start.

487
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:38,966
Without your support, D&I will not fly.

488
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:41,186
Remain curious as to what would make

489
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,406
your organizations better.

490
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:45,167
Listen and commit to transform.

491
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:48,048
For the content developers and creators,

492
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,868
you are the most important part of the equation.

493
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:53,029
You are most needed to be an ally.

494
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:56,009
If you don't know how, ask.

495
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,970
Keep the feedback loop by continuing to care

496
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,030
and advocate for equity and equality.

497
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:06,069
To my fellow HR, our people business needs a lot of heart.

498
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:11,072
Our best ammunition is creating awareness, exercising compassion,

499
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,593
and continued dialogue with our stakeholders.

500
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,594
Easier said than done?

501
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:16,255
Yeah.

502
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:18,436
Worth it?

503
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:19,297
It will be.

504
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:22,499
Why am I here today?

505
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,900
I'm not an expert.

506
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,081
I don't work for the perfect company.

507
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,922
Newsflash, there's none out there.

508
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:31,107
I haven't been working long in video games,

509
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,988
and in this industry, it seems to matter.

510
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:35,809
The probability of being listened to

511
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,311
is directly proportional to how long you've been in games.

512
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,053
Budget and resources are always scarce.

513
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,896
I'm here to share that in spite and despite

514
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:48,157
of what we're up against, you can start an active

515
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,719
and sustainable D&I initiative in your company.

516
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,881
I hope you go back to work and implement ideas

517
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:56,102
from the starter kit, no matter what your position

518
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:56,822
is in the company.

519
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,344
you can be part of the solution.

520
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:03,205
It is an uphill battle and some days are more challenging

521
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,846
that it's easy to not do it.

522
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:07,227
There are days when we step back two times

523
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:08,467
and we make mistakes,

524
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:11,668
or others who we work with make it harder.

525
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:18,132
There's a definite cost to doing nothing.

526
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:20,953
With globalization and changing demographics,

527
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,154
DNI is no longer a, aw, that's nice.

528
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:27,715
It is a business strategy that every company,

529
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:30,736
whatever their size is, must have to be competitive.

530
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,397
Bring the starter kit to someone who gets it

531
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,718
and also wants to do something about it.

532
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:38,679
This can't be done alone.

533
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,620
Who will you share the starter kit to?

534
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,560
Together, we can all be the change

535
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:49,566
that we wish to see for improving D&I in games.

536
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,793
Thanks for being here.
