1
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,170
First of all, thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,231
I'm very happy to see so many people interested

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,931
in this topic that I care so much about.

4
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:14,293
I really appreciate your time, especially GDC time,

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,414
which is really precious time.

6
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,915
Thank you GDC for giving me this platform

7
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:18,715
on which to speak.

8
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:20,956
It's very important to me and to every Muslim in the world,

9
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:21,596
all 1.6 billion of us.

10
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,220
There are two things that I have to tell you. I want to tell you as well, don't worry.

11
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,663
So please turn down the volumes on your phones or turn them off.

12
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,208
And when you came in, if you weren't scanned, please go and get scanned because we're going to send you a questionnaire.

13
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:40,011
I would really appreciate the feedback if there's anything I could do better.

14
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,234
The other last thing is that this talk is subjective.

15
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:47,016
There are a lot of Muslims in the world with a lot of different opinions.

16
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:51,740
I've shown it to a lot of Muslims and I've gotten their feedback and I think it covers a lot of bases.

17
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:54,482
but if a Muslim tells you otherwise, they're also right.

18
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,884
That goes without question. Thank you.

19
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,126
So, this is me.

20
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,448
My name, well, in sim form, at least.

21
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,170
My name is Ossama Dorias.

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,032
I'm a senior game designer at WB Games in Montreal.

23
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:11,575
I'm also the coordinator of the video game programs at Dawson College,

24
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,597
and I'm the co-founder and organizer of the Montreal Independent Games Festival,

25
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,038
and I do a lot of other things.

26
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,600
See, these are some of the games that I've shipped.

27
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:29,527
What I'm going to be addressing today, because this talk was really long and I had to scale it back a lot,

28
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:33,852
because there's a lot of content and it's impossible to talk about everything, so I had to make some hard choices.

29
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:39,898
So I'm going to go very briefly about why positive Muslim representation is important.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,724
I'm going to debunk a few myths, and there are volumes that could be said about myths

31
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:50,927
about Islam, so I just chose a few select things that I think a lot of people don't

32
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,548
know that are relevant to the talk.

33
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:56,791
And then I get into the nitty-gritty, the meat of the talk, which is the how-to guide.

34
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:01,855
At some point I might lose my voice, it's happened before, so bear with me.

35
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:06,579
What this talk is not about is trying to convince you that not all Muslims are bad.

36
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:10,145
if you believe this, not a problem, come meet me later,

37
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,265
we'll be friends and hopefully I'll prove you wrong.

38
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,546
But I'm not gonna dread this,

39
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:15,886
I'm gonna assume that everybody's here on good faith.

40
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,967
And the other is, my intention is not to shame

41
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,007
any companies or people

42
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,688
who've misrepresented Muslims before.

43
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,008
The truth is I've worked on games

44
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,169
that misrepresented Muslims,

45
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:26,469
and I had no choice in the matter.

46
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,629
And I tried to make it better,

47
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,070
and sometimes it did get better after a little bit of time,

48
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,710
and other times not.

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,331
Everyone's situation is different.

50
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,372
I'm not even trying to shame the companies

51
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,212
that make the decisions.

52
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:37,853
A lot of times, they just don't know better.

53
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,713
The intention behind this talk

54
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,254
is that you will know better for the future.

55
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:41,874
That is all.

56
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,335
So if I mention your game or a movie

57
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,496
or something that you worked on,

58
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:46,936
it's not personal at all.

59
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,297
No pointing at people in the audience, please.

60
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,878
So let's start with why this is important.

61
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,369
Islamophobia is on the rise.

62
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,950
After September 11, it was at its highest point.

63
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,091
And then it started to die down.

64
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,153
Then a few things happened in the States

65
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:07,254
with political things, and now it's spiked.

66
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:11,596
In the last two years, the rate of Islamophobia-related crimes

67
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,256
has doubled.

68
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,997
And it's unprecedented, and it continues to grow.

69
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,981
Most of the time it happens just on the street, insults or what have you, attacks.

70
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:26,270
Sometimes it happens in the workplace and other times it takes the form of bullying in schools.

71
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:31,397
Most of the victims are women and most of the perpetrators are men.

72
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:37,945
And 10% of the cases are of extreme violence, including death.

73
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:42,166
Where I come from, in Canada, our neighboring city, Quebec,

74
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:45,828
just had a shooting last year where six Muslims were killed while they were praying.

75
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,048
So it is serious.

76
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:53,601
15% of North American children, and this is a very conservative number,

77
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:57,683
I've heard it go up as much as 50% on occasion, hide their faith.

78
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:00,705
And I know this is true because I used to do the same when I was young,

79
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,766
and it wasn't even that bad back then,

80
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,167
so I could only imagine how bad it is now for Muslim children.

81
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,790
Muslims have a public image problem,

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,292
and it's sometimes dangerous to be Muslim.

83
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,053
So we need help addressing the public image problem.

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,042
During the American elections in 2016,

85
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:23,104
a few well-intentioned politicians said some things

86
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:24,504
that misrepresented Muslims.

87
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,726
Of course, I'm not talking about this gentleman,

88
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:29,927
because everything he says is poop.

89
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,469
I am talking about people who should know better.

90
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,611
Now, bear with me as I quote them.

91
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,832
So I'm gonna go in a little, okay.

92
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:41,053
Oh, I see it clear there.

93
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:48,330
If we're to succeed in defeating terrorism, we must enlist Muslim communities as some

94
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,553
of our strongest allies, rather than push them away through suspicion and hate.

95
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,574
So enlist and allies.

96
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:04,197
We need to be cooperating with the Muslim nations and with the Muslim American community.

97
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,438
They're on the front lines.

98
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,540
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.

99
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:13,132
So, I was born in Iraq.

100
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,754
I moved to Canada 30 years ago.

101
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:17,315
I've been Muslim ever since.

102
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:18,836
I've been active in the Muslim community

103
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,096
as well as the video game community

104
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,537
since I started working in the industry.

105
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,278
I have never met a terrorist.

106
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm not privy to any information.

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,721
I don't know how to be your ally in this fight.

108
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,743
This is a tweet that went viral

109
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,584
by a person who goes by the name of Kash Ali.

110
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,335
I don't understand why non-Muslims think we British Muslims can stop ISIS.

111
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:41,457
I can't even get a text back from the girl I like, can you expect me to stop a terrorist

112
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:42,157
organization?

113
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:46,499
For better or worse, these are the things we're dealing with.

114
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,180
They're strangely very similar to things that normal people deal with.

115
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,323
So you don't need us to be your allies.

116
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,784
We need you to be ours.

117
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:08,958
In the movie Three Kings, there was a very troubling scene where a Muslim woman was shot

118
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,979
point blank by an insurgent.

119
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,262
And the reason that this scene exists is to drum up support for the noble American soldiers

120
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,843
who are there to stop the insurgency.

121
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:27,115
This is not necessarily entirely false because 97% of the world's victims of terrorism are

122
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:34,220
Muslim. Look it up. Nobody hates terrorists more than us on both fronts. We are the victims

123
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,243
in number of deaths and we are the victims in the number of bigoted acts that happen

124
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:43,825
because we're blamed for our own deaths and the deaths of others of course as a result.

125
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:49,789
So what this does is it brings the

126
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:56,866
It makes people think that we have to go and kill Muslims that kill Muslims.

127
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:01,768
And if Muslims die as a result, well, isn't that why we're there to begin with?

128
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,769
And it devalues our lives to begin with.

129
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,130
It devalues the value of our life.

130
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,272
Solely portraying us as victims justifies the wars that make us victims.

131
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,893
So this is not good.

132
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,829
There's another movie called The Siege in the 90s.

133
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,849
It happened actually, it took place before September 11.

134
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,310
And in this, there was a terrorist act

135
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,951
and Muslims were the perpetrators.

136
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,311
And Muslims were portrayed,

137
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:31,412
the terrorists were portrayed as being very religious.

138
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,593
They even linked a lot of our religious acts

139
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,214
to the terrorist acts.

140
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,075
And there was a CIA agent who was Muslim,

141
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,756
but he was one of the good Muslims.

142
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,837
And he drank alcohol and he went to parties

143
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,357
and there's nothing wrong with that.

144
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:46,178
The problem,

145
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,605
is the association that they created in this.

146
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:52,468
Because when you create a direct link

147
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,829
between the religion and terrorism,

148
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,790
what you're telling us is that we could be Muslim,

149
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,511
but not too Muslim.

150
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,233
And you're creating that association

151
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,495
between our religion and terrorism.

152
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:04,917
Not you personally, just.

153
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,800
So some Muslims practice more than others.

154
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,083
We can practice Islam on a spectrum, and that's okay.

155
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:18,800
Now to debunking some of the misconceptions.

156
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,963
Like I said, we could write volumes about what people think Islam is and isn't,

157
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:23,905
but I just picked out a few things.

158
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,508
To start, most Muslims come from these countries.

159
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,209
Of course, there are Muslims everywhere.

160
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:31,012
I'm from Montreal, there are Muslims here in San Francisco,

161
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:32,173
but it's mostly from here.

162
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,957
Fewer than 15% of Muslims are Arab.

163
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,038
What I mean by this is that they speak Arabic as their primary language.

164
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,959
There are a few more that speak it as their secondary language or it's equal.

165
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,301
So it could go up to about 20% depending on how you define what an Arab is.

166
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,062
But as primary language, it's about 15%.

167
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:51,984
The biggest Muslim country is Indonesia.

168
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,766
A country nobody ever hears anything about.

169
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,987
And that might have something to do with them not having oil to say.

170
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:02,197
Indonesia is a peaceful country, it doesn't get involved in anything,

171
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,539
and it is the biggest Muslim country in the world.

172
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,601
The second biggest Muslim population is in India,

173
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:09,583
where they're actually a minority.

174
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:13,346
And there are almost as many Muslims in India

175
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,828
as there are Muslims who are primarily Arab.

176
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,710
And yet they get very little representation.

177
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,853
When was the last time you saw an Indonesian character in anything?

178
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,675
I can't name one. Well, I can name one,

179
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,216
but that's because I did research, it's different.

180
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:29,800
So what do Muslims look like?

181
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:33,244
Give you a little bit of time to think about it.

182
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,226
Okay, before I answer that question,

183
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:37,688
what does a Christian look like?

184
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,172
What does an atheist look like?

185
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:44,655
Most of you, I bet, when I asked you

186
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:45,356
what a Muslim looks like,

187
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,817
you conjured up an image in your mind.

188
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,780
But it was much harder, or maybe even impossible,

189
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,502
to do the same for Christians and atheists.

190
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:52,342
And why is this?

191
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:55,449
is because you have a bigger pool to draw on

192
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,930
where you live right now for Christians and atheists,

193
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,471
and so the stereotypes don't make sense.

194
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:02,172
If you ask this question in a Muslim country,

195
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:03,112
it would be the inverse.

196
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,433
They wouldn't know what a Muslim looks like,

197
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,173
so what are you talking about?

198
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:06,694
Like, anyone's Muslim, everyone's Muslim.

199
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,235
But they would have the Hollywood hero

200
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,496
as either the Christian or the atheist,

201
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:14,338
and that's how, because that's what they see, the hero.

202
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:17,759
Most people here have a very skewed image

203
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,660
of what a Muslim look like.

204
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:24,914
Depending on a few variations, it might be these two

205
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,715
with varying degrees of dress.

206
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,195
And if you were a little more well-traveled,

207
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:32,096
it might be a little bit more diverse.

208
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,656
But the truth is, the spectrum is very, very wide

209
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,597
and a Muslim can look like anyone, right?

210
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:42,858
And the more Muslims you meet, the more this is a no-brainer.

211
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,018
So I don't know who you are,

212
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,418
but you might have imagined something along these lines

213
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:46,999
and that's okay.

214
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:49,539
So let's play a game.

215
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:51,895
I'm a game designer, I like games.

216
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,076
I call it 50 Shades of Brown.

217
00:10:56,978 --> 00:11:01,219
I'm going to show you an image, and if you think this person is not Muslim, raise your

218
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:01,400
hand.

219
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,660
Don't overthink it.

220
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,861
I want your first impulse.

221
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:04,701
Deal?

222
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:09,483
About half of you.

223
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,064
Sikh.

224
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:16,306
About half of you.

225
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:18,027
Hindu.

226
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:25,557
Okay, some hesitation, but not many people at all.

227
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:27,178
Christian.

228
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,861
Syrian Christian.

229
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:30,722
You see the cross.

230
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,066
A lot of you.

231
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:37,989
Ethiopian Jew.

232
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:44,656
Buddhist.

233
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,833
It's interesting, like you're about halfway for most of them.

234
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,374
The Buddhists stumped almost everyone

235
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,816
because nobody knows that Buddhists can dress this way.

236
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:56,798
The truth is you're not far from being right regardless of what you said

237
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:58,779
because all of these people come from countries

238
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,021
that have large populations of Muslim,

239
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:04,883
and culture generally dictates dress way more than religion.

240
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:09,106
Christian Arabs in certain places are indistinguishable from Muslim Arabs.

241
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,008
You cannot tell them apart, in certain places again,

242
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,949
because culture works that way.

243
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,761
So Muslims wear turbans, Muslims wear saris,

244
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:17,982
Muslims cover their heads.

245
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:21,164
It's just in the details that sometimes you could tell

246
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:22,185
what's different and what's not.

247
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:23,246
So keep that in mind.

248
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,810
We are diverse, just like everyone else.

249
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,973
Now I'm gonna get to the how-to guide.

250
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,014
So if you want to represent Muslims in your games,

251
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,175
and I hope that's why you're here,

252
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:37,796
these are a few pointers.

253
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:41,699
The first is, if you have a platform, give it to us.

254
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,878
This is Kamala Khan, she's Mrs. Marvel.

255
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,661
She is a character from comics, not from,

256
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,843
because there's very little positive representation

257
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:50,603
of Muslim in video games.

258
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,505
I apologize, that's why I'm drawing from so many media.

259
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,787
Kamala Khan is Pakistani,

260
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,129
she's a teenager and she's a Muslim.

261
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,592
And her comics speak to my experience growing up

262
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:01,053
in the West more than any other character

263
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,114
in fiction I've ever seen.

264
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:04,436
Even though I'm not Pakistani and I'm not a woman,

265
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:05,617
I'm no longer a teenager.

266
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:06,738
Why is that?

267
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,359
It's because it's authentic.

268
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,080
Because it was written by two Muslim women,

269
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,280
G. Willow Wilson and Sanaa Manat.

270
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,641
In fact, when they first started writing the book,

271
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,721
they only had the story for about three comics.

272
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,522
They didn't expect this to be the great success that it was.

273
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:23,042
And then it is.

274
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,982
It's still printed now and it's a big deal

275
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:25,762
and people love it.

276
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:26,683
Why is that?

277
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,343
It's because there's no competition.

278
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,103
We want this and nobody's giving it to us.

279
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,204
So whatever form we get it, it's good at this point.

280
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,692
Later on we'll see.

281
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,994
So if you wanna be in the front,

282
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,158
you wanna represent us now.

283
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,403
So if you have a platform, give it to us.

284
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:49,365
And we need you to amplify our voices.

285
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,627
The next step is to talk to us.

286
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,949
So let's say, for example, you don't have a platform,

287
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:55,871
but you do have a game, and there are Muslims among you,

288
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:57,732
either as your friends or as your co-workers,

289
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,073
then come and ask us.

290
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:00,314
Ask us questions.

291
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:04,038
What I find is a lot of people are afraid to offend us.

292
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:06,840
So they don't ask, and they misrepresent us,

293
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,022
which is far more offensive.

294
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:14,005
And what happens is, if you ask us even an offensive question and we answer it once,

295
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,486
you'll never offend us that way again.

296
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,588
But if you offend us in a video game, it's kind of permanent.

297
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:19,649
All right?

298
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,671
So we'll take it. Just come and talk to us.

299
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:24,912
And everyone might have different questions, and that's totally okay.

300
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,094
As I proved before, Islam is very diverse, and it doesn't matter.

301
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,736
As long as you have a consultant that's Muslim, it'll go.

302
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:33,858
Don't stack tokens.

303
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,335
There's a lot I could say about that.

304
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,357
What I mean to say is that right now there's a need and a desire

305
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,760
to represent people, to have diversity in our games, which is great.

306
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,382
And we're seeing how that's a very good thing.

307
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,845
However, if you have a character, let's say,

308
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,887
who's a black, Muslim, amputee woman,

309
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:52,428
sounds like a great character,

310
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:55,331
but if everyone else in your game is a white guy,

311
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:57,793
you're not doing anyone any favors.

312
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:03,101
And that character, even though it sounds like an interesting character that would love to know what they have to go through,

313
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,844
if you don't have a consultant that could speak to their actual experience...

314
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,614
That's dangerous as well.

315
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,636
It's not going to come off as being authentic.

316
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,317
And sometimes you cannot find a consultant that

317
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:13,278
has that experience.

318
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:14,759
So then no problem.

319
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,481
Get consultants who are from all those different marginalized

320
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:17,802
groups.

321
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:22,005
And in addition to this, spread out the diversity

322
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:22,626
among your cast.

323
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:22,986
You'll see.

324
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,287
It's going to be a lot better.

325
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,829
There are a lot of games right now that are more successful

326
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:27,469
because of it.

327
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,351
So what I'm saying is, I'm not saying

328
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,033
don't make characters that are from different marginalized

329
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:32,273
groups.

330
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,275
I'm saying don't stack tokens.

331
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,477
It's not a checklist that you can do all with one character.

332
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:40,377
Insist on authentic VOs.

333
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:43,578
So for better or worse, when I was young, I loved Aladdin.

334
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:45,579
Because there were not a lot of different ways

335
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,440
that Arabs were represented in video games at all.

336
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,100
I am Arab.

337
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,821
And Aladdin could have been about Muslims.

338
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,562
They say Allah, Allah, et cetera.

339
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,304
So I didn't know any better and I loved it as a result.

340
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:57,924
Today I have a different opinion about Aladdin,

341
00:15:57,944 --> 00:15:58,765
but I won't go into that.

342
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:02,547
So the one thing that even as a child that I did notice

343
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:04,267
is Aladdin did not sound like me.

344
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,829
And that is something that could have been easily addressed.

345
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,253
This is Anna Amari.

346
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:13,216
Her voice actress is in Egypt.

347
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,378
And I was told by some Egyptian friends

348
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:16,619
that if you are Egyptian,

349
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,701
you know exactly what part of Egypt she's from.

350
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:19,922
It's that authentic.

351
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,803
And on top of that, what's amazing

352
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:25,367
is she's actually about the right age

353
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,748
for the character that she's playing,

354
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:31,072
which is really unique, sadly, in our industry.

355
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:32,753
So when Anna speaks,

356
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,915
you will never mistake her for another character.

357
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:35,636
It's impossible.

358
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,279
Isn't that awesome?

359
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,021
That's amazing.

360
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:39,963
Even for gameplay reasons, that's amazing.

361
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,387
So insist on authentic VOs.

362
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,114
If you have a roster, include us.

363
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,146
Now, these characters might not even be Muslim, and it doesn't matter.

364
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:55,411
They come from Muslim-majority countries, and that's what's important.

365
00:16:56,252 --> 00:17:00,136
If you don't address, if you don't point out the religion of any other characters,

366
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,557
then do the same for the Muslims.

367
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:04,200
You don't have to have a banner on their front that says,

368
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,543
Muslim, Muslim, Muslim. We don't need that. That's not important.

369
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:09,446
What's important is that you represent people from where we come from.

370
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,411
Haqqan might not be Muslim, but he's from Turkey,

371
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,874
and we don't have a lot of characters that come from Turkey,

372
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:17,815
and the same is true for all of these characters.

373
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,856
So if you have a roster,

374
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:20,598
please include people from our countries.

375
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,061
So you need to include us.

376
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:30,066
If you have NPCs, please have Muslim NPCs.

377
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,068
And don't make Islam their focal point.

378
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,050
So this is Farida Malik from the Deus Ex series.

379
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,752
She's a badass, who happens to be Muslim,

380
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,473
which is amazing.

381
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:45,039
Sarah Hasmadi is a brilliant scientist who happens to be Muslim.

382
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,302
And Islam is mentioned, which is amazing,

383
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:50,765
because what this does is it normalizes us.

384
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,628
We can be something other than the Muslim character.

385
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:55,470
We're a character that's also Muslim.

386
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,843
There are very few characters that are like that.

387
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:01,546
We are normal, as I've shown you with different slides before.

388
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,769
So we need your help into pushing that to other people

389
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,211
so they can see us as normal as well.

390
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:09,734
We have other interests and other aspects

391
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:12,056
of our personality other than just being Muslim.

392
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:17,201
This is a movie called Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves,

393
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:17,701
from the 90s.

394
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,866
Actually, Azim is a pretty good character,

395
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,167
especially from the 90s when it comes

396
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,308
to Muslim representation, because he's nuanced.

397
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:29,210
He's not a pillar of virtue who's perfect in every way.

398
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,471
That's not the only kind of Muslim representation

399
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,032
I'm asking for.

400
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:33,793
It would be great if at least one of the characters

401
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,614
was like that, but it doesn't have to be that.

402
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,535
He's nuanced.

403
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:39,097
He was an exile, and it's ambiguous as to why,

404
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:42,319
but he has a moral code, and he calls everyone Christian.

405
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,240
So it's like there's this level of,

406
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,121
okay, he seems like he could be real,

407
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:47,662
and this takes place in the Crusades.

408
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:48,323
Everything felt.

409
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:53,285
good, and I love that they had this character who was not portrayed in just a negative light,

410
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,586
where he was balanced.

411
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,048
And then he bowed down to pray, and I didn't recognize what he was doing.

412
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:00,229
Our rituals are precise.

413
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,430
My friends from First Nations have the exact same comments.

414
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,873
If you're not going to do the research and hire a consultant, then just don't include

415
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,273
the ritual.

416
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,393
It's an easy shortcut.

417
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:15,775
Alternate skins are great and they mean a lot.

418
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:19,198
So this is Farah and very recently she had a hijab skin

419
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,080
that actually had a lot of research that went to do it

420
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,842
because it looks like a Bedouin hijab

421
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,423
from Egypt specifically.

422
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:26,644
It's an option.

423
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,446
So if people don't wanna wear it, no problem.

424
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:31,268
And if people do, they will and it will mean a lot to them.

425
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,531
Exhibit A, this is Jasmine Loves You.

426
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:35,752
Although this was during Halloween

427
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,173
so her name was Jasmine Kills You.

428
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,496
Farah is wearing a hijab, I'm Muslim.

429
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:42,037
You don't know how much this means to me.

430
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,398
I've been waiting all my life.

431
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,179
I've been waiting all my life too.

432
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,781
We've all been waiting all our lives to be included.

433
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,564
What's interesting is if you look at her Twitter avatar,

434
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,788
her icon, it's a beaten but victorious Kamala Khan

435
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:01,692
because Muslims will absorb all media that represent us

436
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:02,753
because there's so little of it.

437
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,375
So it is meaningful and you will find success.

438
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,256
Now, if you are representing people from specific countries,

439
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,797
do your research.

440
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:13,860
Even if you think you're well-traveled and well-versed,

441
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,041
we're not all the same.

442
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,863
And even something as simple as a head covering

443
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:20,867
has extremely different manifestations based

444
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:21,808
on where the people come from.

445
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,971
So just hire a consultant, do some research,

446
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:25,972
and no problem, include us.

447
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,835
But if we're talking about character customization,

448
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,098
then go crazy.

449
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:36,305
Because as long as you don't say this is an Indonesian headdress

450
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,626
or this is from Somalia, then go crazy.

451
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:39,826
Any kind of headdress.

452
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,547
It's an option.

453
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,147
Anyone can wear it of any gender,

454
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:42,947
and there's not a problem.

455
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,368
We appreciate these options.

456
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,988
A lot of games are going this route, and it's great.

457
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,469
So just have fun with it.

458
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,750
So can anyone tell me what country this takes place in?

459
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,491
Again, I'm not shaming the people who worked on this game.

460
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:59,091
This screenshot could have been taken

461
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,392
from a lot of different games.

462
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:01,692
I had to choose one.

463
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:08,397
Maybe I call it Arabistan.

464
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,647
It's a generic war-torn Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, broken down rubble place where many

465
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,428
of our FPS matches take place.

466
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:29,693
The problem here is that we see this and we think, no I'm not pointing out, we think Iraq.

467
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:32,566
When most of Iraq does not look like this.

468
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,707
Even war-torn Iraq, most of it does not look like this.

469
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:37,728
And for sure, if you go back 10 years or 20 years or 30 years,

470
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,388
most of the Middle East did not look like this.

471
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:40,989
But this is all we recognize.

472
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,789
It desensitizes us to,

473
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:44,670
we don't even know what the reality

474
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,550
of these countries look like.

475
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,610
Again, I'm sorry, I'm not pointing anyone out.

476
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,792
This is Syria before and after the war.

477
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:54,132
And sadly, the before is the one we don't recognize.

478
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,753
And when we see it in the news,

479
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,873
oh, I fought a match in that location.

480
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,419
And if a stray bullet hits someone, well, whatever,

481
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm aiming for people there all the time anyway.

482
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,100
It completely dehumanizes us.

483
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,583
This is a tweet from my friend, Nicolas Barriere.

484
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:12,905
He was talking about Oasis, which is a map

485
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:15,506
from Blizzard, from Overwatch,

486
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,307
that was set in a future Iraq.

487
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,328
And it glorifies the Middle East

488
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,929
instead of the usual depictions.

489
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:23,890
He showed it to his Iraqi-Canadian friend,

490
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,652
and it brought his friend to tears at work.

491
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,220
And if it's not clear who that friend is, it was me.

492
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,420
And the reason this was meaningful

493
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,641
is because I spent a lot of time thinking about this

494
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,381
and talking about this and writing about this.

495
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:41,322
And never once, I'm from Iraq,

496
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,123
never once did I project a bright future

497
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:45,183
for my own country.

498
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:50,364
And to see someone else do it, it was, sorry.

499
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:04,303
I'm sorry.

500
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,667
I hope you realize how meaningful this is.

501
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,028
I needed it.

502
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:30,448
Thank you.

503
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:33,368
I love you, buddy.

504
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:38,487
Thank you.

505
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:41,108
I'm sorry.

506
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:46,631
Boomer, hug you.

507
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,994
I hope this proves the point that this is actually

508
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:54,376
very meaningful and it touches people in a positive way.

509
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,177
Things have been getting better.

510
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:59,199
I've been in the video game industry about 10 years now.

511
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,141
And things have been getting a lot better.

512
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:11,118
We're not there, we're not where we want to be and Muslims, all we want is just to be included in this conversation.

513
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:14,020
And that's really all I have to say. Thank you

514
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,613
Okay, so we have six minutes for questions if anybody wants to ask anything

515
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,894
Movies to watch for ideas is a very good question.

516
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:47,255
I would say, okay, so he's asking if there are any good movies, I guess, that represent

517
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,176
Muslims positively.

518
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:51,337
The first one that comes to mind is Pitch Black.

519
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:55,698
In it, there are Muslims who just happen to be there in the future who have nothing to

520
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:57,279
do with the violence that's happening there.

521
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:10,167
So, pitch black is one, but to be honest, I haven't,

522
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,252
I can't really think of anything right now.

523
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:14,537
But if you want, poke me and I'll make you a list.

524
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:16,401
Thank you.

525
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:24,864
Hi, I've worked on a bunch of big Japanese AAA games, and the problem that I've always

526
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:31,889
found when we were doing localization to English is that our actual actor pool is all dudes

527
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,712
from California who have that accent and we're like, well, how about this character, he's

528
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:40,234
like Muslim, and they're like, well, how about we use the guy who played whoever in Dragon

529
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:40,394
Ball?

530
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:41,035
And we're like, oh, no.

531
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:46,620
Do you use ACTRA actors? Because I could connect you to a person who could find you diverse people.

532
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:56,866
Yeah, basically what I'd like to ask is, how do I find Muslim actors who are both union and non-union?

533
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:01,688
And I just would like to know so I can pass that on to people who are still doing that.

534
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:06,525
Absolutely. Well, my friend Lili, she works in Montreal and she has, she actually, it's

535
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,287
not just Muslims or people from Muslim countries that she has a pool of names, but if anyone

536
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:15,089
wants to have actors from there, come see me, poke me, and I'll connect you to her.

537
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:20,632
She does have a pool of both act, of unionized and non-unionized actor, voice actors. So,

538
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:25,995
oops. So yeah. Awesome. Thank you. Anyone else? Hi.

539
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:28,705
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

540
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,606
This is also an actor question.

541
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,388
It's two part.

542
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:36,949
When you are searching for actors,

543
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,970
I know that you're not allowed to say they must be from.

544
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:42,052
We have laws against that.

545
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:46,534
So do you find that there are certain ways around that?

546
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:51,576
Or is it best done by I know this person who has people?

547
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:55,140
Yes, that's what I would do because I don't want to do anything illegal.

548
00:26:56,441 --> 00:27:00,785
I'm not a lawyer and I'm sorry, even lawyers don't give this kind of advice.

549
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:06,090
So I would just connect you to the people who have this pool and if you tell them what you need,

550
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,032
they can find someone for you.

551
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,149
I'm sorry if that didn't answer your question.

552
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,029
No, no, you're fine.

553
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:11,509
You're fine.

554
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,050
Yes.

555
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:21,893
So my next question is, how specific do you suggest, say you have a Muslim character that

556
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:26,915
you haven't given a huge background, nobody has a huge background in this, do you suggest

557
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:27,515
finding...

558
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:35,177
someone with very specific, like, in neighborhoods, in a certain town, like, do you have anything like that?

559
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:40,559
It's not necessary. There's a game I was playing on the plane ride here, I think it's called Good Pizza, something along those lines,

560
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,122
and it just, I was making a pizza and a Muslim, a seemingly Muslim woman with hijab walked in,

561
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:50,164
I know nothing about her or where she's from or anything along those lines, and that's totally okay.

562
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:53,685
If you're going to put other labels on top of it,

563
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,306
then you have to do the research to make sure that

564
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,347
whatever you're saying about this person is accurate.

565
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:00,248
But if it's just a person who happens to wear a veil,

566
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,769
go for it. There's really no problem whatsoever.

567
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,269
The people can fill in the blanks themselves.

568
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,070
There are people who are not Muslims who wear veils,

569
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:06,770
so no problem.

570
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,011
That's just an example of a veil.

571
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:10,293
We could talk about a dark-skinned person

572
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,295
with a big beard, and he happens to be in a,

573
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:14,357
I don't know, a Guitar Hero type game.

574
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:15,538
That's totally okay.

575
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,439
We don't need to say he's from this country or that.

576
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,341
But try to treat them at the same level

577
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,622
as everyone else on the roster.

578
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,744
So if everyone else on the roster has a backstory,

579
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:24,205
then you probably need a backstory.

580
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:25,726
If you're mentioning their country of origin,

581
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,887
and if you're mentioning the other things

582
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:27,648
that they're interested in,

583
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,130
then you would need someone to speak to that.

584
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,671
Great, thank you. Is that fair?

585
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:32,512
Yeah. Thank you.

586
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:33,979
Yes.

587
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:34,120
Hi.

588
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,740
How are you?

589
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,541
Amazing.

590
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:37,222
How are you doing?

591
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:37,322
Good.

592
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,804
So a lot of the customization these days,

593
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:44,268
especially on live game, goes through microtransaction.

594
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:44,708
Yes.

595
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:52,155
Do you think it would be still OK to have, for example,

596
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:57,759
women headwear in microtransaction customization,

597
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,521
like all the other headwear a game has?

598
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:03,877
But because there is, yes there is a cultural part,

599
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,118
but there's also a religious part to it.

600
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:09,939
So I don't know how, can we monetize something

601
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,680
that has a religious connotation to it?

602
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,881
That's a very difficult question to answer.

603
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:16,621
I would say.

604
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,282
Because for example, if you're in a game

605
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:19,902
and you wanna offer more customization,

606
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,523
but most of your customization

607
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,983
goes through microtransaction.

608
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:26,027
It's more of a PR question than everything else.

609
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:27,468
It depends how you formulate it.

610
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:29,730
If you say we need the budget to make this

611
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,712
and so forth, we're transferring the cost to you

612
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,033
if you want your representation, it might fly.

613
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,256
But otherwise, if you're representing everyone else

614
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:39,558
for free, then we should.

615
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:39,618
No.

616
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:40,398
Okay.

617
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:45,708
So if all other customization options are also charged,

618
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,329
then no problems.

619
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,570
Yeah, everything's charged.

620
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,670
Does that make sense?

621
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,111
That's not true.

622
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,011
Sorry.

623
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:52,653
No, no.

624
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:53,553
I'm just clarifying.

625
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,155
But if all your customization is on the same level,

626
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:59,398
would it be OK to include something that has more of it?

627
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:00,718
We want you to normalize us.

628
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:02,480
If everyone else is the same, we want

629
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,661
to be the same as everyone else.

630
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,122
All right?

631
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:05,502
Thank you.

632
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,142
It's a good question.

633
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:08,824
I don't know who was here first.

634
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:09,125
Go ahead.

635
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:19,604
So it's clearly given that players like to see themselves represented in games, especially in their player characters is super important

636
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:27,187
What advice do you have for people doing like far modern sci-fi games or fantasy games or alternate universe games?

637
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:34,630
To let the players still feel like they see themselves in the game, but maybe our you know current earth religions don't exist

638
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,232
Yeah, well, Star Trek does a great job of that.

639
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,333
So follow them as a good example.

640
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,755
One thing to stay away from is don't create a race

641
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:45,657
that's a caricature of a culture that exists in real life.

642
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:47,358
That's not the right way to go.

643
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:48,779
But if you're having people who,

644
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,721
if in your fiction, Islam doesn't exist anymore

645
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:52,762
and no other religion exists,

646
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,723
or even if another religion survived and it didn't,

647
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,184
that's not a problem at all.

648
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:58,945
So you could represent people who have evolved

649
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,647
from those countries and just tell the story

650
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:02,388
of what happened to them.

651
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:03,548
It's fiction, right?

652
00:31:03,668 --> 00:31:07,570
If you wanted to include a character that looks like they're in hijab, even though you

653
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,411
don't have Islam in your game or in your universe.

654
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:15,613
That's okay as long as you have a good reason for why the hijab persisted afterwards and

655
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:16,674
you've given it some thought.

656
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:21,896
Because that doesn't become Muslim representation, it's just Muslim symbolism at that point.

657
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:25,218
So if you need Muslim symbolism and you have a good reason for it, go for it.

658
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:30,682
There are a lot of sci-fi authors that are Muslim who write about similar situations,

659
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:34,386
so maybe asking them and consulting with them about what they learned and what they did

660
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:35,026
would be great.

661
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:39,030
I could, there's a few, the names don't come to mind, but I could maybe give you a few,

662
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,053
I think Saladin was the name of one of them who writes sci-fi, yeah.

663
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:46,477
So he'd be a great person to ask specifically for that, but this is my opinion.

664
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:47,598
Okay, thank you.

665
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:48,659
Yes, sir.

666
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,282
Great presentation, great talk, thank you.

667
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,730
Thank you.

668
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,793
My perspective is different because I don't directly make

669
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,377
content, but I think if we're going to make more

670
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,261
representative games, we have to have more representation in

671
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,063
the industry in general.

672
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:06,450
So from a work environment perspective, what do you think would be the most impactful change

673
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,450
that you would see at a studio in terms of work environment?

674
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,871
Well hire more Muslims.

675
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:18,472
A good way to do that organically and naturally is maybe don't show the names on the CVs when

676
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:20,813
you're going through the hiring process until the interview.

677
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:22,373
It's going to be a happy surprise.

678
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:27,714
More Muslims will make it to video games and then you'll have consultants out of the pool

679
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:28,774
of people that you work with.

680
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,955
And everything else is going to come organically from that.

681
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:32,982
beyond recruiting though.

682
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:38,596
work as an environment, what would be the most impactful changes like if you're thinking

683
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,277
about a place that's going to make it more comfortable and more inclusive for people?

684
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,857
Like specifically accommodating Muslims?

685
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,157
Yeah.

686
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:43,617
Oh, okay.

687
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:44,678
Or people in general, I mean, I think.

688
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:46,338
That's a great question.

689
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,178
I could actually give a completely different talk on just that.

690
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:48,438
Yeah, I know.

691
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,299
It's kind of like a side.

692
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,999
But like a clean place to pray would be amazing.

693
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:54,800
It doesn't have to be big, but a clean place to pray would be amazing.

694
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,161
If you have a lot of activities, networking activities that revolve around alcohol, having

695
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,401
a few that don't would be great.

696
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:02,382
Tea socials, ice cream socials.

697
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:03,202
Muslims love ice cream.

698
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:11,449
And generally accommodating, like right now it's gotten much better. When I started in the industry,

699
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:16,333
there were rarely any vegetarian or vegan options. So Muslims who keep to halal can have vegetarian

700
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:21,378
and vegan food and they love it. So but now that already seems to be taken care of. So I'll

701
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:24,861
mention it anyway, just in case you don't have any, I don't know how you would not have vegetarians

702
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:25,982
in your workforce, but just in case.

703
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:29,243
but that's taken care of. These little things go a long way

704
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,504
because at the end Muslims will tell you when they need something, right?

705
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:35,765
I mean there's also the Friday prayer that some Muslims go to if you

706
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:39,807
give them a slot where they could work later on Fridays and have a longer lunch

707
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:43,008
anything like that goes a long way.

708
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,689
Sorry. I'm new to this, forgive me.

709
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,690
Thank you. Yeah, thank you. My pleasure.

710
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:53,951
Last question, I think. Is that the last one or do we have time for more?

711
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:55,972
Who am I looking at?

712
00:33:58,147 --> 00:33:58,947
Okay, nobody seems to know.

713
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:00,508
I'll keep going until they kick us out.

714
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:01,349
Go for it.

715
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:03,671
I want to say thank you first as an Egyptian Muslim myself,

716
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,072
a lot of this is very close to home.

717
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,494
I've often found myself talking to folks

718
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:12,016
who think that as far as protagonists go,

719
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:14,879
that it has to sort of always be a cis white man

720
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,520
and that we need an excuse for it to be anyone else.

721
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:21,043
And that they throw out this garbage idea of gender for,

722
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:23,965
or excuse me, diversity for diversity's sake.

723
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:27,614
What do you think needs to be done?

724
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:28,735
Or what do you tell those people?

725
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,937
What do you think conversations need to be happened

726
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:32,639
for people to be trained out of that idea?

727
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,421
Maybe what would be great if there are any journalists here,

728
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,864
if someone does choose a white cis male

729
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:40,206
as a main protagonist, start asking them why.

730
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:41,968
That could be a good first step.

731
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,632
But otherwise, to be honest,

732
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:46,693
I don't have an answer to that.

733
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:47,574
This is something that's...

734
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,627
you could write volumes on it, right?

735
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:53,408
I mean, this is seen as the norm,

736
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,928
and that's why bigotry exists.

737
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:56,508
How do we tackle bigotry?

738
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,909
It's so above what I can answer in this talk,

739
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,509
but I would love to have that answer.

740
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:02,729
So if anyone else gives it to you,

741
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,710
please reach out and let me know.

742
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,470
I appreciate that, thank you.

743
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:06,830
Thank you.

744
00:35:08,611 --> 00:35:09,931
We're still not kicked out, so.

745
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:12,451
We're over, like, what, 10 minutes?

746
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:13,692
Five.

747
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:15,012
Five minutes, okay.

748
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:15,872
That's fine.

749
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:21,020
Uh, so, uh, when you're looking for consultants, uh, being a consultant can

750
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,965
often be a big form of emotional labor, particularly when, uh, you are already a

751
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:29,986
minority in your particular group.

752
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:34,009
Do you have good strategies for asking people like, Hey, do you want to consult

753
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,632
without like forcing that on them if they don't want to, like, what's, what's a

754
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,453
good inline for like, Hey, you want to consult on this?

755
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:46,382
I'm actually working to start up a SIG with IGDA for Muslims in Games right now.

756
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:49,825
We're still in the beginning steps, but we want to be able to answer these kind of questions

757
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:54,629
by having a pool of people that you could ask, both paid consultants for the companies

758
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,871
that could afford it and volunteers for the ones that don't.

759
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,773
We haven't established what the rule set is.

760
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:04,477
This is still the infancy and the beginning of being able to answer that question, but

761
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:08,140
it is something that some of our members did bring up and that we do want to address.

762
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,222
Because it is, it's taxing, right?

763
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,845
But eventually from what I heard from consultants who consult for other things,

764
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,387
especially for First Nations and the like,

765
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,950
is that the people who do this as a job,

766
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,013
they do develop some kind of, what's the word to use?

767
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,715
Like they're able to cope with it better

768
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,636
because they've done it so much for so many different studios

769
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:27,878
that they have answers to that.

770
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:31,621
And they're able to separate their emotion from the consulting work.

771
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,483
So I'm hoping that's going to happen for us.

772
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:36,807
As far as I know, there are no Muslim consultants for video games or for media in general.

773
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:37,468
I could be wrong.

774
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:39,050
I looked for them and I could not find them.

775
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,594
So we're trying to establish that ourselves, and then we'll see when the problems arise,

776
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:43,455
we'll try to tackle it.

777
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:44,696
But thank you.

778
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:45,297
That's a good question.

779
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:49,588
So, oh, hi, squeezed in right at the end.

780
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,390
What is the difference between representation

781
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,670
and cultural appropriation?

782
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,652
I mean, where is the line that separates representation

783
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:01,054
from cultural appropriation?

784
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,754
Cultural education, okay.

785
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,195
What I would- Appropriation.

786
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,157
Appropriation, I heard completely wrong.

787
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:11,979
Okay, well in this case we're talking about video games specifically, right?

788
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:16,403
So if you're talking about a character who you're saying this person is a Muslim,

789
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,947
then that is representation, or someone who comes from a Muslim country.

790
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:24,091
If you're talking about a character who appears to be Muslim,

791
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:26,954
but you explicitly go out of your way to say that they're not,

792
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:29,715
then that would be cultural appropriation.

793
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,636
However, I've never seen that before.

794
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,836
Not in video games or any other media,

795
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,056
not for Muslims specifically,

796
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:36,777
because to be quite honest,

797
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:37,917
there's a lot of bigotry

798
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,777
that's going against Muslims right now.

799
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:41,558
The only thing that's close is I see like

800
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,338
there's a huge trend for hummus right now.

801
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:44,898
So maybe that has something to do with it,

802
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:46,679
where like people are making

803
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,699
all their different brands of hummus.

804
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,400
But I know that's not what you're asking.

805
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,002
But so, that was what I would say. If you have a character who appears to be Muslim,

806
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:59,185
but you explicitly go out of your way to say they're not, you better have a pretty good reason why that is.

807
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:01,006
That's good.

808
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:03,078
A little announcement.

809
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,501
We are sadly out of time, but if anyone still has any

810
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:10,024
further questions, we can take this conversation over to the

811
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,987
overlooks over there in room 20, 22, and 20, 24.

812
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:15,409
Anyone is fine.

813
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:16,489
They have tables, chairs.

814
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,951
We can have a nice conversation.

815
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,353
And you have been incredibly amazing.

816
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,534
Thank you very much.
