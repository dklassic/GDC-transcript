1
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,886
I think in game writing circles my official title is The Other Richard.

2
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:15,258
So today I'm tired to are we good on the Mike there is this

3
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,939
one this one's good and this one's off all right.

4
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,861
So thanks everybody for coming to a dynamic stories for

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,402
dynamic games, I always start off and saying split a little

6
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:27,984
bit of a spoiler warning. People always complain when I

7
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,465
maybe talk about and things of games during talks I don't do

8
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:33,046
it too badly in this, but if you see a game you're really

9
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:35,207
intent on not knowing anything about I recommend you cover

10
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:37,068
your duck your head and cover your ears quickly.

11
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,390
I don't spoil anything that's come out in the last couple years.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,611
Also, I have a lot of references to some other articles in this.

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,772
I will be putting the slides up on my website by this time tomorrow.

14
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,512
Let's say that's my deadline.

15
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:52,794
So you can go grab them off of here if you want to get some of those references

16
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,834
and some other links that I had to cut out for time.

17
00:00:55,795 --> 00:01:00,677
So, it's funny, when I come to GDC, and I swear it's like this alternate reality, where

18
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:05,380
everyone is talking about narratives and branching and player choices and empowerment and innovative

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,582
stuff and to do with stories and games, but I found the world outside of GDC is a little

20
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:10,022
bit different.

21
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:13,644
You go back to your development team and like, we should do this cool thing I saw, and they're

22
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:14,584
like, why would we do that?

23
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:15,425
Dynamic stories?

24
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:15,985
That doesn't matter.

25
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:16,585
It's crazy.

26
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,826
You got to get back in your hole, writer.

27
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:22,267
So why, you know, so I get this question a lot.

28
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:23,848
Why do you care about dynamic stories?

29
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:24,448
Why do that?

30
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,350
Why do you want to have multiple endings?

31
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,771
Why do you want to change the story

32
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,192
based on what the player does?

33
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,414
You know, and for me, literally,

34
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:34,256
it's why I wanted to get into working on games

35
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:34,996
and making games,

36
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,058
is I love the idea of setting up situations

37
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:37,638
where the player,

38
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:43,089
comes into a situation and has to make difficult choices and then sees the ramifications of those.

39
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,251
So for me it's so innate that I want to tell these stories. So it's tricky to explain it.

40
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:50,992
And believe me I've heard all the reasons not to do this from all the different disciplines.

41
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,734
So you have reasons not to from programmers. Programs always talk about how incredibly hard

42
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:58,796
it can be to do interactive storytelling. And they're right. It can be incredibly hard,

43
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:03,058
if you take it to that sort of extreme. But programmers, you just need to tell them,

44
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,759
look you guys are really smart. You're able to, you know, simulate incredibly complex physics.

45
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,960
You're able to render things that look like the real world.

46
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,422
and you had to make concessions and trade-offs to do that,

47
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:14,585
and we can do the same thing with any sort of dynamic storytelling.

48
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:17,708
You know, I also hear from producers,

49
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,630
and usually the answer there is, not surprisingly,

50
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,711
it'll cost too much money.

51
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,934
But that's what producers say about everything you ask them for, right?

52
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:27,816
It's just like when the artists go and ask for their fancy shader set,

53
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,277
or the combat designers want to do some crazy motion capture suit.

54
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:33,039
You know, they're shot down by the producers too, but they go back and they fight,

55
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,859
and they say, no, we need this to push the game forward,

56
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,820
and this is what's going to make it great.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,702
We need to get used to fighting, you know, to have dynamic elements in our stories,

58
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,743
if we really want them, just like the other departments do.

59
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:48,045
But I also hear reasons not to from writers sometimes.

60
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,326
And probably some of the people in this room right now are saying,

61
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:52,788
well I came to this talk because I know I hate dynamic stories

62
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,108
and we'll see if he can change my mind.

63
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,809
And I think there's a lot of good reasons for that, right?

64
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,731
The history of storytelling, you know, outside of games

65
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,013
is certainly very linear and is used to certain structures that have worked well

66
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,374
and things we've learned over many years of telling stories

67
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,815
to which I say, you're right, those things are true,

68
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,976
those things do work and they have worked in some games.

69
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,119
But I think this is a new medium. We need to try new things.

70
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,223
I know it's a little scary, but I'm hoping it'll be better in the end.

71
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,546
And finally, from designers, the answer I always get there is,

72
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,769
but players only play the game once, so who cares?

73
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,952
And I want to, you know, as an answer to that,

74
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:29,716
look at the types of games that are the most popular right now out in the world.

75
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,940
you know if you set aside sort of multiplayer games as sort of a separate

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,841
entity we can look at

77
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:37,745
a lot of the other successful games are ones with these big gigantic open worlds

78
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,907
of one kind with tons of things you can do them tons of

79
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:42,930
dynamic things you can do with the gameplay often still with sort of a

80
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,991
linear story in the middle

81
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,415
uh... but they end up having a lot of dynamic storytelling elements around

82
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:47,575
that

83
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,380
And these games typically have tons of content to support all of this.

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,645
If we look on the other side of the spectrum, though, we'll see for smaller, single-player games,

85
00:03:56,105 --> 00:04:00,530
players have been gravitating towards a different type of style, things that are procedurally generated.

86
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,095
Things like roguelikes or roguelike-likes or roguelites or whatever we're calling them this week.

87
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:10,597
These present games that provide an infinite variety of challenge to players.

88
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:13,678
And interestingly, most of them eschew traditional storytelling,

89
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,118
opting just to set the tone and the setting,

90
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,079
and then go from there with Sunless Sea maybe being a notable exception.

91
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,360
So why do players like these games despite their lack of narrative?

92
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,321
Well, players, we have to recognize, have a limited amount of money, right?

93
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,482
They want to buy a game they can really get value out of,

94
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,983
that they can play over and over again, that they can...

95
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,975
feel that is really challenging they feel that is

96
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,439
is reacting to what they're doing you know another reason that is

97
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,001
recently arrived is the

98
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,023
advent of streaming as a thing

99
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:46,227
that is everywhere uh... and you know everyone watches games being streamed

100
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:46,427
now

101
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,451
and if you want to make you know a narrative game but it's the same every

102
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,071
time you play it

103
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,414
it's not going to be that interesting stream frankly

104
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:55,777
you know and both of the consoles now have really easy clip sharing where you

105
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:56,158
can share

106
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:59,721
game pay clips with your friends and there's nothing more depressing than

107
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,762
sharing a clip with someone else only to look at his clips

108
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:04,845
and see his clips of the game is exactly the same as your clips of the game

109
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,808
and to realize hey wait a minute maybe these games aren't as dynamic as I

110
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,328
thought they were.

111
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,332
So now we can't get away with that and I think we need to work

112
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:16,574
at you know making games that are dynamic that people react to well

113
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:20,457
in a variety of ways including streaming and sharing and I think

114
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:23,540
you know as long as we're doing that we should also focus on how can we make the

115
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,920
stories

116
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:25,882
in those things dynamic as well.

117
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:34,231
So I still wonder why these games are focusing on having such static stories in the middle of it,

118
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,815
but not all of it is. And I think there's a lot of techniques that games are doing already that we can use

119
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,537
that can really open things up and tell dynamic stories.

120
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:44,060
So I'm going to go through a number of techniques that games are already doing today

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,724
and talk about how those have been done before and how you might apply them to your game.

122
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,088
The first thing I want to talk about is something I call the explorable story space.

123
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:59,674
So I'm going to go through this technique fairly quickly because it's pretty basic and it's used in a lot of games

124
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:01,314
successfully already.

125
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,675
So we look at something like Fallout or the Bethesda games in general.

126
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,415
These are often, you know, these giant RPGs and these giant worlds that have that core

127
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,116
narrative, but then they have a lot of side narrative around them.

128
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:12,996
Little stories that you can do or not do.

129
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:16,497
And we can look at this in smaller games as well, like Gone Home,

130
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,938
you know, despite being a much smaller scale game,

131
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,679
still had a lot of pieces on the side of it that you might find or not find,

132
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,919
depending on how you looked, how long you looked at the game.

133
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,761
and how thorough you are trying to be.

134
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,564
The important thing for this sort of side content

135
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:31,667
is that it has to be completely optional.

136
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,290
And that allows different players to find different pieces

137
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,192
and to come up with their own version of the story

138
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,513
based on the pieces they find.

139
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:38,585
uh...

140
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,367
and the players who want to put more time into it will find more of it

141
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,148
and the other ones who just want to get through it quickly

142
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:46,090
uh... can do that and then when they compare stories later

143
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,132
they will be talking about a different experience they both had and this will

144
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,133
increase their engagement

145
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:50,853
uh... in the

146
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:52,514
in the work. Now when I say

147
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,716
explorable story space I don't necessarily mean physically exploring

148
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:56,137
the space

149
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,218
obviously her story is a recent example

150
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,821
uh... where you were literally sitting glued in a chair in front of a computer

151
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,762
terminal the whole time in the fiction of the game

152
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,504
but you were exploring the story through all these clips you were finding on the

153
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:06,864
computer

154
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,500
Another, one more example I want to bring up of this before we move on

155
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,801
is the excellent adventure game the Last Express from a number of years ago.

156
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,942
Amazingly well-written and structured

157
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,264
where you're sort of moving through this very last, the last Orient Express

158
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,344
right before World War I

159
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,525
and seeing all these different stories in different parts of the train.

160
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,286
I don't think you can actually get the entire story

161
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,567
through one playthrough because of all the layers of it

162
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,088
that you can see depending where you are at what point in the game.

163
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:37,251
So the next technique I want to talk about is something I call the open-ended story.

164
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:41,256
And it's hard to call this a game technique because really this works

165
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,999
in stories you might be writing, you know, in any medium.

166
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,590
So if we look at, say, novels, we can look at novels like Slaughterhouse-Five

167
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,832
or the Martian Chronicles, tell stories that leave a lot out or that are

168
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:57,873
fairly convoluted and involve you, you know, trying to interpret what's going on

169
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,694
in them, trying to figure out what's going on.

170
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,055
Certainly there are a lot of movies like this as well.

171
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,596
If we look at something like The Shining or Inception,

172
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,677
a lot is left up to personal interpretation in these movies about what exactly is happening.

173
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:12,899
These tend to have, these type of works that are still linear,

174
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,102
Encourage repeated viewings just to try to figure out what's going on.

175
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,985
And fans come up with their own theories and debate them with each other,

176
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,429
and in so doing, make these stories interactive in a way.

177
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,313
Indeed, Brian Upton, in his excellent book, The Aesthetic of Play,

178
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,395
talks about this, where he says,

179
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,679
as we leap from beat to beat, we choose a set of interpretive constraints

180
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,000
to explain each beat's presence.

181
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:38,385
These interpretive constraints generate expectations about the direction and significance of the story.

182
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,508
Future beats either confirm or falsify these expectations,

183
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,971
triggering either satisfaction or frustration.

184
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:46,854
It's a really fascinating book to check out.

185
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:50,378
He talks about how just the act of reading and interpreting is interactive in its own way.

186
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:55,720
So if we extend this to games and we look at something like, you know, Dear Esther,

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,561
which is on some level completely non-interactive in terms of the story, because it's really

188
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,682
just the voiceover narration you're hearing juxtaposed with the imagery you're seeing,

189
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:07,843
there's really nothing you can change about it, but it's so sort of minimalist in its

190
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:12,204
structure that you really have to, you know, you can't help but interpret what you're seeing

191
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:16,425
and hearing as you're playing and coming up with your own theory to figure out what exactly

192
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:17,665
is going on and being said here.

193
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:23,636
Another example of a way to do that is to make your characters, you know, really abstract

194
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:28,440
and cartoony would be one word even, where, you know, maybe they don't necessarily say

195
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,463
words that you even understand, but that you get just a sense of them from these sort of

196
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,946
broad strokes and you end up having to bring a lot of yourself to the experience to fill

197
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:39,629
in those details yourself and get invested in the work that way.

198
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,853
Or, you know, you can take another approach.

199
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:45,200
In Silent Hill, they have a very specific, very detailed story,

200
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:48,166
but they just show you only these tiny slices of it,

201
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:51,573
and you're just left with these big holes that you have to fill in one way or the other.

202
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:55,098
So a final thought about open-ended stories.

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,682
You know, a word of warning I guess, I've seen a lot of games have really great open-ended

204
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:03,426
stories that you're interpreting as you're going and then at the end they feel, you know,

205
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,328
at the end of the game they feel the need to resolve it all and explain exactly what

206
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:06,648
happened.

207
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,990
And that can be very frustrating.

208
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,593
I think some of the best open-ended stories in other mediums, like say the end of The

209
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,894
Shining or the end of Inception.

210
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:15,715
they kind of open it up again, right?

211
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,236
They bring in some sort of resolution

212
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,057
to help you understand what the heck just happened

213
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,877
in the movie, but then they have something at the end

214
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,958
that twists it a bit and is like, well, actually this,

215
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,679
and then you're left sitting there going,

216
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,400
oh, wait, maybe my theory's still valid.

217
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,100
The worst thing you can do, I think,

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,101
is get to the end of one of these very open-ended experiences

219
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,662
and then shut it all down so the player feels like

220
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:34,143
all of their theories are thrown out the window.

221
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:40,676
So the next thing I want to talk about I refer to as reacting to player actions.

222
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,357
You know this is one of the most common things that people talk about when they

223
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:43,818
talk about

224
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,299
interactive storytelling and branching.

225
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,141
So obviously I'm going to go through this quickly as well.

226
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,923
You know we're all familiar with Bioshock that had the choice

227
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:56,605
of the little sisters, whether you harvested or rescued them, basically the

228
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:57,185
same choice

229
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:59,446
that you're making over and over again throughout the game.

230
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,963
Mass Effect handled this differently with their, you know, blue for Paragon, red for Renegade type of choices.

231
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:12,205
But the game is balanced in such a way that you're really encouraged to pick one and just keep making that choice for the entire game.

232
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:15,027
Sort of having that same shortcoming that Bioshock had.

233
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:18,560
Some interesting other examples of this where it worked a little better.

234
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,663
If you look at the indie game The Novelist,

235
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,686
you have much fewer choices than you have in Bioshock or Mass Effect,

236
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,187
but they're not coupled to each other really.

237
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,030
You're able to make one choice here and make one choice here,

238
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,412
and it doesn't push you to any one of them as the right ending

239
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:32,834
or the right choice to make.

240
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,196
And it can have all these sort of interesting ramifications

241
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,898
in the story, and there is no right answer.

242
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,980
The Walking Dead game certainly, that first season,

243
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,106
had a lot of interesting choice points throughout it and never labeled which

244
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:49,371
one was good or which one was bad or anything like that. It had so many of them

245
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:52,134
throughout the game that they started feeling like a real system and you never

246
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:52,795
knew which one

247
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,479
was going to be the important one that would be remembered.

248
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:00,710
and they were really good at setting up complex situations that didn't have a clear right or wrong answer.

249
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,313
Interestingly, Firewatch is an interesting evolution of this, right, where

250
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:08,856
Firewatch builds on that same idea of tons of little dialogue choices affecting things

251
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:11,579
and it's interesting to see online a few complaints that

252
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,061
oh well, all the choices you make don't actually affect the plot of that game very much

253
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:19,405
but to me the heart and soul of that game is really the relationship you have with Delilah, the other radio tower operator

254
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,446
and that does change substantially based on

255
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,569
how you talk to her and that's sort of what's most important about the game so

256
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:24,649
it

257
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:28,572
it is very impactful what happens even if the plot is is relatively similar.

258
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:33,745
Of course there are other games that approach branching not through these just narrative choices,

259
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,186
but actually through the choices you make in gameplay.

260
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,608
Like this is the classic way to do it in an immersive sim,

261
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,349
like Dishonored sort of situation,

262
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,931
where the way you go about playing the levels affect not only gameplay ramifications,

263
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,193
like those rats that swarm you, but also narrative changes.

264
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:50,995
And this is sort of aggregating all the choices you're making throughout the game.

265
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:53,476
Not dissimilar to Papers, Please,

266
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,038
which does the same thing where all the choices you're making are during gameplay

267
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
and add up to the different endings you can get.

268
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,580
There's been a lot of exploration of branching.

269
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,761
It's very interesting in the interactive fiction space.

270
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:05,261
If you want to check that out, I recommend

271
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:07,622
Googling Patterns and Choice Games.

272
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:11,323
There's a great blog post by the Sam Cabot-Ashwell,

273
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,723
I hope I pronounced that right, where

274
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,004
he talks about all the different structures that

275
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,024
have been done in different games.

276
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:18,785
And it was a really fascinating, quick read on the subject.

277
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,666
So next we have shifting story elements.

278
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:26,827
And this is something that's really not done as much in games

279
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,528
and is really fascinating to me as a result.

280
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:33,040
So this is, we can think of this,

281
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,542
if you think of this in terms of say adapting

282
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,664
a murder mystery, like one can think of

283
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,705
the act of reading a mystery novel,

284
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,606
like one of these books,

285
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:42,608
it's really a puzzle of a sort, right?

286
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,409
You're trying to figure out the, you know,

287
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,030
who did the murder.

288
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,734
before you get to the end, you're trying to find a resolution to that puzzle yourself

289
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:53,557
before the private investigator or whatever gets to it by the end.

290
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,501
The second time you read a book like this, it's much less interesting because you already

291
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,704
know who is responsible for doing the killing.

292
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,587
Even for books like this that are expertly well-written, it's definitely a different

293
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,209
experience when you read it the second time.

294
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,912
So when they adapted this into board game form originally

295
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,194
uh... they made board game clue which I'm sure you're all familiar with

296
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:17,477
and here they randomized who was responsible for the murder and who did

297
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:17,957
the murdering

298
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,059
and voila you now have a replayable murder mystery.

299
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,562
Interestingly when they turned this into a movie they said hey well

300
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,924
so we've got this clue board game it's got random

301
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,926
uh... you know random people who are guilty what if we did something similar

302
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,787
with this movie where we had different endings

303
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:36,230
that would give you different people who were uh... who were guilty of the crime.

304
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,153
Of course this kind of doesn't really work very well because

305
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,276
because they had to make the endings work with any of the possible

306
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,218
you know they had only one version of the main film and then these different

307
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,360
endings sort of tacked on

308
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,543
the main version of the movie had to support any ending that happened to come up

309
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:52,466
so now you had no way to actually figure out who did the murder because all of

310
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:53,687
these different endings were possible.

311
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:57,377
So of course when you adapt this into game form you can do better than that.

312
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:01,279
So the example I like, and there were a number of these in the 80s that did this actually,

313
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:07,423
that had these murder mystery games where you were trying to solve a mystery but who actually had done the killing

314
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,885
and who was killed was randomized each time you play.

315
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:14,407
And because it was a game they were able to plant little clues all along the way that you were playing

316
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:17,308
and you would be able to solve it unlike the clue movie.

317
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,450
Another example I like to bring up all the time is the...

318
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,535
blade runner game where each character in the game could be a

319
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,297
replicant or not depending on whether

320
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:28,662
uh... depending on basically a die roll at the beginning of the game and then this

321
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,625
would affect what you had to do with them because you were you know

322
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:31,886
hunting for these people and had to

323
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,190
make choices about about what happened to them

324
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,867
So some of the really interesting work in this sort of randomized story space is

325
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,048
actually done in board games.

326
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:45,490
You know, going back to the classic Arabian Nights game

327
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,394
or more modern games that sort of randomize the narrative in different ways.

328
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:51,716
Obviously these have the benefit of having multiple players in them,

329
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,879
but they still do good things to change up the story every time, so it feels like

330
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,221
a very dynamic experience and different every time you play.

331
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:02,514
An interesting example you might want to check out is this game, The Black Closet,

332
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:07,276
which is actually nominated for an IGF award this year, and I believe you can go play it on the show floor.

333
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:11,618
This is sort of an interesting mix-match of several different game types,

334
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,660
sort of like a dating sim mixed with sort of an adventure game.

335
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,582
And here you're in this all-female boarding school,

336
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,903
and there are these things like who's going to betray you,

337
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:26,344
and each game is randomized each time you play along with the other stuff.

338
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,885
By making, by sort of combining it with the...

339
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,814
sim in these random narrative elements you're really uh...

340
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:32,259
getting to uh...

341
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,366
very different experience each time you play

342
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:48,815
So my own game, The Church in the Darkment, which is now in development, is set inside a religious cult in the 1970s, but the player doesn't know whether that cult group is merely happy socialists who want to go live in the jungle, or if something more dark and apocalyptic is going to happen there.

343
00:16:49,435 --> 00:17:01,559
And the key to this is the leader's personality is randomized each time you play the game, so you don't know what exactly you're dealing with, and you're sort of acting as a detective going into their sort of jungle compound to figure out what's going on.

344
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,661
So beyond just the interesting factor from a replay factor,

345
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,542
I thought it was also interesting because

346
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,424
I felt it fit thematically with the hard to understand nature of cults,

347
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,445
where they can be really hard to tell if it's actually a good group or

348
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,607
or something more sinister from the outside.

349
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,248
So it's my hope that by including this shifting story element,

350
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,950
you're able to see both sides of what can be a very complex story.

351
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,431
and I like specifically games that combine this sort of

352
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:29,072
uh... you know shifting story elements

353
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,873
with player choices like that the unfortunate thing about player choices

354
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:36,113
when you make them in a game if you ever want to go back and replay the game

355
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:38,754
you know naturally you're probably going to want to make the same choices

356
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:41,895
uh... and often when you go back if you want to see all the content you'll force

357
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:44,976
yourself to just make the choices you don't want to make which is not really a

358
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:45,776
great experience

359
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,076
however if the context of the game is shifting

360
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:52,078
you know, so that it's different this time, you'll want to make different choices the second time you're playing

361
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:55,660
because the context is different, because the reasons you're making these choices are different

362
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,882
and that makes games like these hopefully replayable in a more interesting way.

363
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,964
Alright, so the next thing I want to talk about a bit is character simulation.

364
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,205
So this is one of the harder methods to implement,

365
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:12,888
but also represents sort of one of the less charted areas, so I think a great area for future experimentation.

366
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:17,789
With character simulation techniques, each character in your story has a simulated personality

367
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,390
with their own wants and needs, desires, friendship, allegiances, and these dynamically change

368
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,172
based on your behavior as you're moving through the story, sort of based on what you do.

369
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:31,153
This sounds super complicated, and it can be, but its simpler forms are possible that

370
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,554
still produce some interesting results.

371
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:36,595
So probably the most commercially successful example of this is The Sims, right?

372
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,557
In The Sims, you're able to manipulate the personalities of these people

373
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,018
and play them off each other in these interesting ways.

374
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:47,341
The possibility space of The Sims is intentionally, I think, quite broad.

375
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:51,263
It lets anyone live out whatever version of American suburban life they want,

376
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:52,483
whether that's getting married and...

377
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:58,230
whatever fashion they find suitable, or having a goth family, or even torturing their sims.

378
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:03,056
This all feels like it fits because the game is so cartoony, because it's so broad.

379
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,920
Any goofy thing that happens feels like it fits okay into the game.

380
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:11,054
Another game that people don't often think of as a storytelling experience, but I think

381
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:14,598
is doing this, is Civilization, and the different sort of leaders of the different countries

382
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:15,879
that you meet as you're playing.

383
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,603
And they'll come to you, you know, trying to negotiate peace, or talking about threatening

384
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:23,647
war, or setting up a trade deal, or whatever it is, and they'll remember your past interactions

385
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:24,608
with them, and they'll remember...

386
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,891
whether you betrayed them before, who else you're having a fight with,

387
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:30,292
and then try and negotiate.

388
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:34,755
And this was taken even farther in the sort of cousin of civilization, Alpha Centauri,

389
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,257
which treated the heads of state even more like believable characters.

390
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,060
And they each had their own sort of political agenda and their own philosophical beliefs

391
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,482
that affected whether they were going to want to side with you.

392
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:47,743
And they sort of gave you feedback based on how you were playing the game,

393
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,824
whether they agreed with it or not.

394
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:53,725
Few consider these types of games really story games, yet there's no reason this sort of

395
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:58,166
faction-based reaction system of these games couldn't work to, you know, emphasize it even

396
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,986
more and make it feel even more like a narrative.

397
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:04,927
There's a couple of games that used character simulation that were definitely going for

398
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:07,387
something more narrative, and the first of those is Versu.

399
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:12,208
This was an interactive fiction system that used a much stronger story framework and much

400
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:16,609
more limited player choices than you would find in The Sims or something like that.

401
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,786
So this was a much more confined social situation.

402
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,549
The player was able to engage with all the characters

403
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,790
in a number of different ways,

404
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,252
and these choices would persist

405
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,974
and then affect their relationships with each other.

406
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,436
And the first setting for the Versus stories

407
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,699
was this sort of Jane Austen-ish social settings

408
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,921
where character dynamics are everything.

409
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:40,921
Prom week is another interesting example of this sort of social simulation

410
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:44,105
in a very carefully chosen setting, the week before high school prom,

411
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:48,330
a time rich with narrative possibilities and potential conflicts.

412
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,854
It takes a Sims-like approach to controlling these characters

413
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:55,938
where your only goal is not, you're not just playing dollhouse like you're

414
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,721
playing in the Sims, you're actually trying to get people to pair up with each other.

415
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:03,205
and following some pretty, you know, more confined goals.

416
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,747
The game uses a pretty elaborate personality model

417
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,949
that replicates the social graft you might find

418
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,891
in that hellish time of high school.

419
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,193
But to work both, you know, it's interesting to look

420
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,894
that Versu and Prom Week, you know,

421
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,916
both had really elaborate AI systems.

422
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:20,858
So in addition to requiring, you know, a kick-ass AI team

423
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,019
to implement something like this,

424
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,441
they also made very specific, careful choices

425
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:25,502
about the setting they were in.

426
00:21:25,522 --> 00:21:27,163
They would have a tone that would allow

427
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,304
this kind of gameplay to work.

428
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:34,487
So you want something that allows for these interesting narrative simulations in the case of sort of the Jane Austenish story

429
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:37,288
or a prom type of situation.

430
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:42,911
And they both sort of chose a tone that was very deliberately silly, even slapstick, farcey,

431
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:49,055
where the player might try to do all these goofy things but they would still feel like they would fit in with the game.

432
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:55,218
You know, there's many potential settings, I think, where if you tried to do character simulation, it would be much harder to do,

433
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,320
particularly when I think the technique is in its infancy.

434
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,120
as it is now.

435
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,965
And the other thing these games were really good at was telegraphing what was going on

436
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:04,505
to the player.

437
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:08,128
And I think that's super important when you're trying to do something as complex than this.

438
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:13,994
You know, Versu used, or rather Promweek used a menu system that was very much like the

439
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:17,977
Sims that really gave you all sorts of bars and graphs and things about how everybody

440
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:18,858
felt with everyone else.

441
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,922
And even with all of that, it still was very hard to try to understand what was going on

442
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,184
in the game if you didn't understand the simulation decently.

443
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:30,407
Versu tried a more integrated approach where they had those little images at the bottom of the page

444
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:35,190
and they would actually change facial expression based on what their social state was at the time.

445
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,112
And if you wanted more information you could tap on them and a little box would pop up

446
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,594
that would explain to you why they felt the way they did.

447
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:44,796
And I know that over-telegraphing something like this can feel sort of aesthetically jarring,

448
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:45,796
particularly as a writer.

449
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:47,537
You know, I feel that way myself.

450
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:51,819
But I think a technique like this is in such its infancy that we really have to overdo it

451
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,320
to give players, you know, a chance to catch up.

452
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,662
It's like people didn't learn how to watch movies, you know, they learned over the years

453
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:00,163
and films get more and more subtle in their techniques.

454
00:23:00,183 --> 00:23:04,525
And I think we have to see games the same way when trying something this ambitious and different.

455
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,891
And indeed, Emily Short, the co-creator of Versu,

456
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:09,772
had this great quote.

457
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,054
She said, my general rule of thumb

458
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:12,876
is it's pointless to simulate anything in AI

459
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:14,918
that you don't also have a plan for communicating

460
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,458
to the player.

461
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,441
Otherwise, they don't see how clever you're being, or worse,

462
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,625
what is actually sophisticated behavior winds up

463
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:22,405
looking like a button.

464
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:28,124
And if you want to hear more about Versu or Prom Week,

465
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:30,105
there's this excellent talk on the GDC Vault.

466
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:31,547
It's up there for free.

467
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,989
You can just search for Beyond Eliza, and it pops up.

468
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,530
And they talk about both of those projects

469
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,551
and how they worked in there.

470
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:40,719
Now the final example I want to talk about is drama management.

471
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,621
You know, I like to think of drama management as the flip side of character

472
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,102
simulation, whereas character simulation, the characters can sort of

473
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,043
drift in sort of interesting ways,

474
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:51,165
but that maybe don't end up feeling as much like stories.

475
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:55,207
Here this is actually steering things back towards something that feels like a

476
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,048
story. You can think of this as

477
00:23:57,248 --> 00:24:00,370
akin to a D&D session. We have a really good DM who's trying to shape

478
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,150
things into a

479
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,172
into a certain narrative form. He allows a lot of agency for the players.

480
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:08,605
but he is constantly steering things back to the story he wants to tell

481
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:11,028
while still letting the players feel empowered.

482
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:14,072
So the most interesting example of this in digital form,

483
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:17,015
or the most well-known example, is Fassad.

484
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:21,521
In this game, the player enters into the apartment of a couple that is having an argument.

485
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:27,130
before as part of a dinner party and you're sort of there while their marriage is falling apart.

486
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,438
The player here has a tremendous amount of agency, you can say whatever you want to the characters and they'll try to react to it

487
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,224
and the game really does a pretty good job of steering it back to the main story it wants to tell.

488
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:44,154
So, Facade was always, you know, sort of interesting as an academic project, as a PhD project like it was when it was released.

489
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:50,082
But then it found this interesting second life on the internet because it became very popular as a Let's Play thing.

490
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:56,289
And people loved streaming this game because it was so reactive to whatever they would try and they would make all these Let's Play videos.

491
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,493
of like, oh let me try to get it to do this.

492
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:03,681
And this is sort of going back to what I was saying before about streaming being a thing that's popular.

493
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:09,491
Where people who are streamers really want to find games that will do crazy interesting things each time you play them.

494
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,142
The other example I wanted to bring up of something that I consider to be drama management

495
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:17,003
is the Nemesis system in Shadow of Mordor.

496
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:20,706
You know this is obviously a much more commercial application of it,

497
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:25,408
but it takes all the interesting sort of simulation elements of an open world game with combat in it

498
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,750
and shapes them into these little player stories

499
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,152
that give you a lot of motivation to keep playing the game.

500
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:33,693
And indeed Michael Platter, who's sitting right over there,

501
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:37,436
has said that the Nemesis system is emergent procedural narrative

502
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,357
that's neither linear nor branching.

503
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:43,638
Which is an interesting way to think of what drama management is really trying to do.

504
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,239
So just to give a quick summary of how this works,

505
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:50,400
the game turns the common experience of dying in the game,

506
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,501
turns it into a little piece of fiction basically, where the player

507
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:56,842
dies but the world keeps going without him and the player reincarnates

508
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:59,203
and the enemy who killed him is sort of

509
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:02,184
shown how he's moving up in the ranks because he did this great thing

510
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:05,465
of killing the player and indeed he might get a promotion or something like that.

511
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,926
and you now are, he is marked as a nemesis for you to go kill later in the game

512
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:15,229
and it's very good at creating these little vignettes when you come and find these characters

513
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:19,010
they'll show you a little cutscene of this guy and they have all these lines of dialogue that they'll say

514
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,851
to sort of taunt you at this time, they all have custom names

515
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:25,173
and all these little elements that went into the system that made it work well.

516
00:26:25,913 --> 00:26:30,060
And it's interesting that it's just taking completely the thing that you do in every open world game

517
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,944
and just giving it all this context that makes it extra meaningful.

518
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:37,191
Sort of creating drama out of the simulation so that when you finally find this guy and kill him,

519
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:39,054
it's a very satisfying moment.

520
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,231
Alright, so those are the six techniques I wanted to go through today.

521
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:49,553
You know, I think it can be interesting to look at your own projects and try to see which of these six things you're doing already.

522
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,974
I'm not saying that every game should try to do all of these things, though

523
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:55,635
that might be interesting if someone were to pull that off, but

524
00:26:55,955 --> 00:27:01,797
you know, if maybe you're doing one or two of them, maybe you can add a third of some kind, really depends on the needs of your game.

525
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:07,499
But I think if you find that you're doing zero of these things, I would argue maybe you're not making a great game story.

526
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,307
And I think, you know, at the beginning of the talk I talked about how it was important

527
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,408
to look at this because of streaming and sharing and all of that stuff.

528
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:22,230
And I think the reality is that streaming has revealed a dirty little secret that we've had in making single player games for a while.

529
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,011
And that's that we made the experiences feel dynamic to the player, but they weren't actually, right?

530
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:31,033
That everybody felt they were having a unique experience, but really it was just exactly what we wanted to happen.

531
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:33,793
And I think we can't hide behind that anymore.

532
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:38,687
And I think even if a player never actually streams a game,

533
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,868
or never actually shares it or sees it in any other form,

534
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:43,109
it's still important just for player investment.

535
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,629
It's still important for players to feel like they're

536
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:47,730
involved in the story, if it's dynamic in some way,

537
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,431
and that they can affect it.

538
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:55,148
I think you have to recognize that there have been many games that are very successful using this technique.

539
00:27:55,168 --> 00:28:02,971
Whether it's, you know, finding that last safe that has the final clue to the side story and the part of the game you really want to figure out and feeling that you found that.

540
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:10,574
Or, you know, the abstract experience that really lets you invest yourself in it and feel that, you know, this becomes your story through that.

541
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,775
Or even just hunting down that guy and finally killing him.

542
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:21,040
after he's been your nemesis for a while, or that scene at the end where you remember all that time we had together and all the choices we made along the way.

543
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,503
I think if, in short, you know, I think when dynamic storytelling really works,

544
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:31,366
you know, players really love it, really become invested in it, and feel that they've told their own story.

545
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:32,587
So, thanks.
