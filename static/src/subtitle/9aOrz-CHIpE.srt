1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,309
This is a perennial favorite.

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:09,011
We love doing the rants.

3
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,614
It lets us get things off our mind.

4
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:16,399
Things get said that cannot be unsaid.

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,281
So lots of fun, lots of fun.

6
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,884
And we're going to just get this going right away and just

7
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,406
kick this off with Brian Schwab.

8
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,803
All right, so you guys know kind of how this goes.

9
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,926
Usually you put up some awesome title,

10
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:35,648
I talk about a problem y'all have,

11
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,710
I offer some sort of solution,

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,472
I make loud noises, I pause dramatically,

13
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,816
then I give a surprising blurb!

14
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:46,618
And a final twist involving current events

15
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,500
which then leads to a timeless truth.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,021
Rousing call to action.

17
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,762
Nope, fuck all that.

18
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:57,785
This is mine. You're in my house right now, and I just want to yell a little bit.

19
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:01,247
And I realized that I'm actually one of the oldest people I know in Game AI,

20
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:04,689
so I get to do an old man rant for the first time ever.

21
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:13,113
So, back in my day, I got a computer and a sleeping bag. That was the day one.

22
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:17,015
And by the way, I had to take that computer home nine months after the company folded

23
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:19,177
because they didn't pay me that last month.

24
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,540
Network? Nope. We had no network for the first two companies I worked at. If you wanted to

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,623
actually use version control, you stood up and you said, who has the game? And somebody

26
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:35,746
gave you three disks with a rubber band on it. And if you had the disks at your desk,

27
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:43,870
you could check in, check in code. So don't bitch to me about like not wanting to use

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,371
version control. Imagine not having it.

29
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:51,131
So by the way, no network also means no internet.

30
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,294
There's no reference materials.

31
00:01:53,294 --> 00:01:55,877
You know that big box of books behind your desk

32
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:57,118
that give you all kinds of stuff?

33
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:57,799
Nope, none of it.

34
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,043
You know that few people that work at the company

35
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,105
that have been there for 10 years

36
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:06,128
or maybe some website that has a buttload of information?

37
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:06,489
None of it.

38
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,453
You guys live in a freaking world soaked with information.

39
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,334
When I was back then, none of it.

40
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,534
In fact, this conference was horrifying back then

41
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:17,795
because you would come here,

42
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:20,495
everybody was scared crapless to tell each other anything.

43
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,836
And so I remember the first two round tables I went to,

44
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,737
everybody stood there looking at each other.

45
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,077
They were afraid to not come to the round table

46
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,958
in case somebody did give up a deep secret.

47
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,134
But nobody gave up any deep secrets.

48
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:36,097
They all just stood there like horrified poker players

49
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:38,939
with $3 in their pocket.

50
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,140
And quality of life?

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,441
I actually thought that that meant

52
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,364
I was in the game industry until somebody described

53
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,065
what quality of life was.

54
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,687
And then I realized, no, that's not for me.

55
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:52,270
That's not why I went into the game industry.

56
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,733
I'm not sure why there's a square on this screen.

57
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,455
Anyways, that's another thing to rant about.

58
00:02:57,455 --> 00:02:58,756
All right.

59
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,627
Finally, what I wanted to go over for you young'uns

60
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:04,968
is some vocabulary lessons,

61
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,690
things that maybe you've never heard of before.

62
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,052
The first one, optimization.

63
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:10,832
And I'll say that word again

64
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:14,134
because I don't think a lot of you

65
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:17,156
have ever seen it in print.

66
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,277
Optimization.

67
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,004
This is when you take your game and you scrunch it down so it runs in a good fashion.

68
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,886
You make sure that the assets are meaningfully sized.

69
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:33,190
You make sure that the code runs at a good frame rate.

70
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,675
All of the things, instead of just waiting for next year's computers to get twice as

71
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,616
fast and memory to go down in price.

72
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,415
Restrictions are actually good for you.

73
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:47,518
They actually force you to do a better job.

74
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,380
We barely had any memory and CPU

75
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,644
when I was first in games.

76
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:57,069
My first game, I think the entire game engine

77
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,451
fit in 32K with the data.

78
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:00,753
It was ridiculous.

79
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:03,576
Like, I have icons on my desktop that are bigger than that.

80
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:08,590
I actually built a mechanic into a game once,

81
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,953
which effectively had the players choosing the people

82
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:15,175
that went into a mission so that it would budget

83
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,857
out the video RAM for me.

84
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,198
It forced me to come up with things

85
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,181
that would actually help make the game better

86
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,462
that took into account the restrictions of the system.

87
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:27,205
We didn't have any polygons.

88
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,126
We had to make good behaviors

89
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,347
because we couldn't do it in art.

90
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,988
We could not do it in art.

91
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:32,949
We barely had anything.

92
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,513
We barely had any people.

93
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,614
That's one of the things that bugs me the most

94
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,355
is when people are like,

95
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,897
oh, well, but my game has three million man years of content.

96
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:45,179
And it's like, yeah, and you've got 700 people on the team.

97
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,800
Back in the old days,

98
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,302
I was not only the lead programmer and the designer,

99
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,563
I was also head of HR and the janitor.

100
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:55,065
And let me tell you, I still have my broom and I'm proud.

101
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:56,626
My first game had less pixels

102
00:04:56,626 --> 00:05:00,228
than your average tweet litter count.

103
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:03,210
That is dangerously close to true.

104
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:13,833
Second word, debugging. I don't know when this became a lost art, but it is a lost art.

105
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,595
Coding is only 8% of the battle.

106
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:21,876
When I was around, a debugger was actually just log statements and you had to pray that

107
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:25,478
it wouldn't slow the machine down enough that you could still actually find the bugs.

108
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,038
And a profiler?

109
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,739
That was even lamer.

110
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:33,480
Like you were printing out a counter during loops or during different parts of pauses

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,802
so that you could determine how much time was spent in between chunks of your code.

112
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:42,344
Nowadays you've got beautiful debuggers with hardware breakpoints and all sorts of crazy

113
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,185
goodness and profilers that visually show you code.

114
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,479
stack traces and the whole nine yards.

115
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,200
This needs to be taught.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,721
I can't for the life of me understand

117
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,022
why this has never been taught in schools.

118
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,943
I've never seen a class in debugging.

119
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,864
I've never once in any curriculum

120
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:01,986
I've ever seen a class in just debugging.

121
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,147
And we don't need to just teach programmers this.

122
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,828
I have, because of the profligation

123
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:10,730
of design driven content,

124
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,833
a lot of designers are doing a lot of scripted,

125
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:19,896
logical sort of notions, and they don't know how to debug it either. I have literally had

126
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:25,080
this conversation with a designer, with a fairly high-level designer. I'm now a high-level

127
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:35,668
designer. The AI is broke. The AI is broke. Did you just pull down code? No. Did you just

128
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:43,374
change something in your script? Yes. Did it work before you did that change? Yes.

129
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:50,675
At which point, I fight down the urge to throw them into outer space.

130
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:56,358
The queen is not amused with your debugging skills.

131
00:06:56,358 --> 00:07:02,342
And the awesome thing is, once we actually start teaching debugging skills, once we actually

132
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:06,164
start putting more debugging systems into our games, we can get more people to debug

133
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,144
our games.

134
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,666
We can have QA people that can actually help debug.

135
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,787
Even your mom can help debug.

136
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,809
Because if we don't start teaching people how to debug,

137
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,270
I am going to finish the infinity snippet,

138
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,951
and I am going to get rid of most of you myself.

139
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:24,412
And don't make me snap more than once.

140
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:27,373
Finally, the last one, innovation.

141
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,394
And I don't mean innovation in games.

142
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,495
We're actually in a fairly nice renaissance

143
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,635
for innovation in games.

144
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,416
There's so many indies pushing so many different types

145
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,697
of games right now that innovation in games

146
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:39,477
is not the problem.

147
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,838
What I'm talking about is actual game dev.

148
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,026
That is really horrible.

149
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:47,134
And it's because of two things that I say,

150
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,940
not invented here syndrome and game education.

151
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,925
And what do I mean by that?

152
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,898
Right now, a lot of people just learned how to code.

153
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,360
They quickly went to school, they learned how to code.

154
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,002
They don't really know how to program.

155
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,144
They know how to code in maybe one language.

156
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,807
When I went to engineering school,

157
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,248
I actually took a single course

158
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:07,690
in assembly language programming

159
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,372
where they taught us 11 different processors

160
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,613
in one semester.

161
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:12,554
And what did that teach me?

162
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,996
It didn't teach me 11 processors.

163
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:14,917
It taught me

164
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:23,626
a data and code flow with different types of architectures all over the place. It taught

165
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:28,930
me that syntax barely matters, that what matters is what types of inputs, what types of outputs,

166
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,013
how much time do you have, blah, blah, blah. All these things, it taught me how to program.

167
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:39,277
We don't do that much anymore, and it makes me sad. The other thing that sucks is that

168
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,294
In, especially in game AI, we kind of had this quote unquote revolution where we stopped

169
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:53,259
kind of using state machines and we started using a different structure.

170
00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:01,265
And you know, when Damian Isla, as much as I love him, as much as I love him, when Damian

171
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:07,210
kind of introduced everybody, or a large chunk of you, to behavior trees, I really get the

172
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,333
feeling like he sort of traded out cubicles for an open floor plan.

173
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:16,124
He kind of took us from one hell to a slightly different hell.

174
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:19,006
And the sucky thing about it, like,

175
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:22,308
cause I agree that for a huge swath of video games,

176
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:25,150
behavior trees are actually better than state machines

177
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,072
because of their reactivity

178
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,653
and because they're easy to add to for a long time.

179
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,595
But that's when games were like that.

180
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:37,137
Like nowadays games are barely like that and I see talk after talk after talk of people that are like,

181
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:42,099
well we started with behavior trees and we spent two and a half years getting around the problems

182
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:46,801
of behavior trees. And then the next talk is somebody doing the same thing from a different

183
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:52,243
direction and on and on and on. One tool is not the only way to go and you really need to sit

184
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:56,245
down and realize again what is your inputs, what is your outputs, what are the types of...

185
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,126
things that you want to do because most games nowadays

186
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:02,127
are not as reactive as behavior trees want you to be.

187
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,927
And you spend a lot of time trying to make sequences,

188
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,048
a lot of time trying to make more authored content,

189
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,689
all of those things easier to do

190
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,289
without blowing up your behavior tree.

191
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:15,350
And lastly, I really, really want, like I said,

192
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,050
to get a full curriculum in education.

193
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,171
Right now I see too many classes being,

194
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:22,411
quickly teach them a little bit of CS,

195
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,652
quickly teach them a tiny, tiny bit of game design,

196
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:25,452
and then.

197
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,159
jam them into a game engine and start making a game.

198
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,020
Nobody's teaching anybody how to do the actual things

199
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,321
that are right, and nobody is teaching debugging,

200
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,481
like I said before.

201
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,682
And then finally, I think the reason that they're doing this

202
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,403
is because they're trying to say, it's so easy,

203
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,184
it's so easy, you can do it, you can do it.

204
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,784
But the other part of this realistic expectations

205
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,865
that I mentioned is that there's not as many game jobs

206
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,347
as there are people getting game job education.

207
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:54,107
And we really need to get around that problem as well.

208
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,148
It's because.

209
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:59,555
I think if people understood that there isn't a lot of jobs, they might actually work harder

210
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:04,579
at becoming better at the job in order to go out there and become the people that we

211
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,001
do choose to work in the industry.

212
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,924
So finally, any questions?

213
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:16,969
Because the only answers I have are, get the hell off my lawn, get off my lawn, and yes,

214
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:17,750
get off my lawn.

215
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:31,875
Right, so I wanted to draw attention to this title.

216
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,838
Seen this title before, but I wanted to show it again

217
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,500
because this is a rant session, and I

218
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,542
have to say that I find the rant format extremely challenging.

219
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,284
Because even though there's a lot of encouragement

220
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:49,587
out there for women to express rage and really put out

221
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,549
what they feel angry about and own that feeling,

222
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,147
I'm really shit at rage.

223
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,429
I'm just bad at it.

224
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,832
I've never been that good at anger.

225
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,416
If it were a skill, I'd roll low.

226
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:08,064
I mean, I do feel anger about quite a lot of things, and quite serious anger.

227
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:13,347
And I think these are kinds of things that we tend not to talk about in this rant session

228
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:17,209
because they're terrifying and maybe they feel a bit off topic and who really wants

229
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,150
to bring down their day with this stuff.

230
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,852
I am going back to live in the UK and I'm not sure in two weeks whether it will be part

231
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:24,572
of the EU or not.

232
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,353
That pisses me off, okay?

233
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:34,077
But what I struggle with here is the effectiveness of the form.

234
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:36,318
Like an angry rant is basically a bug report.

235
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:42,242
You're letting people know what is wrong with the relationship

236
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:45,526
or the community or the institutional system

237
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,229
that you're part of.

238
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,031
And maybe if you're a ranty person,

239
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,855
you get the reputation that you file all of your bugs

240
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,977
as critical.

241
00:12:53,557 --> 00:13:00,403
and there's a huge backlog anyway, nobody ever has time to clean up, so, you know.

242
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:05,087
And besides, you can hurt people's feelings. Again, a blank slide, it's on purpose,

243
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:10,331
I didn't screw up. It's because I'm bad at this, right? You can hurt people's feelings by being

244
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:15,435
angry, I'm not keen at doing that, but there are times when it's necessary. The thing is that the

245
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:20,899
expression of the anger doesn't fix anything by itself, it's not a patch for the problem.

246
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,408
And wherever possible, I'd like to be suggesting

247
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:27,356
possible solutions, although for some problems,

248
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,702
I have to admit that I'm really out of my depth.

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,487
So, last year I did the rant session, and I thought, okay, I'm not good at anger, but

250
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,910
the rant is a genre, it's a format.

251
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,034
You get up here and you do a kind of stand-up routine about something you'd like to see

252
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:49,320
changed, and everybody who's coming to the rant knows how that works, and it's a particular

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,842
context, so this is fine.

254
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:58,006
So last year I wanted to do a talk about how we need to do a better job of inserting nuance

255
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:02,908
when we're asked broad questions about AI that miss the point of what AI is and how

256
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,949
it works.

257
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:09,452
And I wanted in particular for fellow devs to think about how we pick what to say about

258
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:11,493
AI, how we represent it to the public.

259
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,638
and even to each other within development teams.

260
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,682
But it was a rant, so I picked a ranty title,

261
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,466
and the consequence here was that Games Industry Biz

262
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,289
published coverage of my talk with this headline.

263
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,212
Which gets better if you read the subtitle.

264
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:31,833
And the journalists did get in a number of quotes where I think it's clear that I was

265
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:36,714
talking to devs about the role of devs, but naturally people honed in on the title.

266
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:41,755
So the next day I had a bunch of annoyed journalists on Twitter asking if I realized how hard their

267
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:46,456
job was and complaining about my contempt for laypeople, which was not the point.

268
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:52,339
So, obviously that was a relatively low stakes case where no one really got that angry or

269
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:58,007
offended and it was basically fine, but it has me thinking about the way that our format

270
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,989
shapes what we communicate and how.

271
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:05,979
There's an interactive fiction author I greatly respect named Porpentine who recently said

272
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:10,240
that she writes fiction more than she writes nonfiction because stories allow her to be

273
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,821
more truthful.

274
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:16,082
And now she didn't elaborate very much on that statement, but what I took from it is

275
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,523
that when you're writing an essay, the genre of essays takes over from you a little.

276
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:22,865
So if you're writing an essay or an opinion piece,

277
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,587
you're supposed to have a thesis statement.

278
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,708
You're supposed to support it with arguments.

279
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,170
You're supposed to know what you think,

280
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,871
and it's supposed to be orderly.

281
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,172
You might have some nuances.

282
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:34,195
You might admit some exceptions to the case you're making.

283
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,237
But structuring all of that information into an argument

284
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,639
means that you're enforcing a hierarchy of meaning.

285
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
on the thing that you're writing,

286
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,821
you're saying some of it matters more than the rest.

287
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,302
And in fact, one of the things that I like about writing

288
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,683
is that it forces you to come to that kind of understanding.

289
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:50,224
To write an essay about something you're not sure about

290
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,785
is a way to understand your own thoughts.

291
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,066
But there are things that are hard to communicate that way,

292
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,547
and the same thing is true for telling a story,

293
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:00,349
except that a story invites you to present struggles

294
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:01,929
that might have no simple answer

295
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,871
or describe character experiences as they are

296
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,552
without putting an interpretation

297
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:08,813
or a priority set on them.

298
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:13,421
And of course, there are a host of other genres and sub-genres we can use, depending on what

299
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,828
exactly we're trying to communicate and how much we care about wearing shirts.

300
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,774
not only to entertain and amuse ourselves,

301
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,975
but to structure different types of information

302
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,735
and different meanings.

303
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,856
Now, at this point in the rant, you may be thinking,

304
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,096
I see the AI Summit logo at the top of the slide,

305
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,217
but are you sure this is an AI Summit talk?

306
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:32,557
I mean, Emily, are you lost?

307
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,378
Did you wander in here by accident

308
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:37,538
from the Narrative Summit or the Game Educators Summit

309
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,879
or maybe the Advocacy Track?

310
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:45,251
Could you say something about machine learning now, or at the very least, procedural content generation?

311
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,719
And to be honest, by the way, the climate change pictures kind of ruined the mood.

312
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,661
But maybe some of you are ahead of me,

313
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,045
because what I want us to think about sometimes

314
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:59,009
is AI as a practice that lets us understand the world

315
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:00,331
and communicate in new ways.

316
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:03,214
Simulations are how we write about systems,

317
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:05,997
how we imagine possible functioning worlds,

318
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:08,780
and ask ourselves whether we've imagined them right

319
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,202
or gotten something terribly wrong.

320
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,312
Last year I argued that we could do better at not exaggerating what AI is actually doing,

321
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:19,954
that we shouldn't present decisions as belonging to human-level thinking when they don't.

322
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:23,816
We should be precise as we can about what it means for an AI character to think about

323
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,977
something or prefer something or like something.

324
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:31,559
But to pair with that, I want us to think about the practice of AI as an art form and

325
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,300
as a means of expression.

326
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,641
So when we talk about metrics for machine learning models, we often use words like false

327
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:42,944
positives and accuracy that make it sound as though there are no human being was involved

328
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:46,805
in determining what counts as a positive in the first place, when in fact that is often

329
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,806
the most important thing that is going into the system.

330
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,803
And if we are going to solve the really big problems,

331
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:56,345
it will be through the practices of data science and AI.

332
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,086
Not because we'll reach the singularity

333
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,948
or build an artificial general intelligence

334
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,549
capable of perfecting the world's broken systems,

335
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,531
but because the discipline of thinking

336
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,772
towards good artificial intelligence

337
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:10,054
requires us to understand the important features of our data,

338
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:12,576
requires us to seek and actively work against

339
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,997
biases in our information.

340
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:16,959
requires us to decide what experience we want our systems

341
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,681
to produce and how many failures we're

342
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,103
willing to accept for which users.

343
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,565
And the thing about game AI specifically,

344
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,887
and finally I bring it back to actually this summit

345
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,389
at this conference, the thing about game AI

346
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,491
is that in games, we're allowed to talk about the fact

347
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,774
that we're building aesthetic experiences on purpose.

348
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:38,357
We can admit that the AI we are building is not objective,

349
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:41,139
and it is important for us to tell the world how that works.

350
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:54,675
Hey everyone, I'm Ben.

351
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,237
I actually wasn't sure whether to put this talk here

352
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,879
or in the simplest trick in the book session.

353
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:00,980
Like, it's helpful advice,

354
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,061
but there's a lot of fuck words in it.

355
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,863
Anyways, so here's my one simple trick

356
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:08,285
for a way to improve your AIs,

357
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:10,366
is tell them to shut the fuck up.

358
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,208
It's enough with the rants.

359
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:17,271
Ever since, I think maybe the game Fear, we've been giving NPCs all these lines where they're

360
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:21,834
just describing the situation they're in, which is fine I guess, even members of an

361
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:26,578
elite paramilitary force sometimes just gotta tweet about their feels, but these barks are

362
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:27,078
not helping you.

363
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,420
You've been doing them for all the wrong reasons.

364
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:35,521
Like, we're not usually making games, to be honest, where intelligence really organically

365
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,021
comes up.

366
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,983
So instead we feel a need to just shove it in there.

367
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:43,685
Like the player throws a grenade, and so an AI character says, shit, a grenade!

368
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:48,027
I guess so that the player's supposed to think, wow, he comprehended my grenade, what incredible

369
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:48,107
AI.

370
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,242
Listen man, you saw me holding that thing for like three seconds, and you didn't mention

371
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,743
the topic then, let alone try to take cover.

372
00:19:56,743 --> 00:20:02,545
If I see somebody holding a grenade and like imagining parabolas at me, I'm not gonna stand

373
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,086
there and see how the situation plays out.

374
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:08,548
And if they end up throwing it at me, I'm not gonna waste time yelling at the thing.

375
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,642
Now, one idea behind Barks, I will admit,

376
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,524
is reasonable, if a little cowardly,

377
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:16,886
because players can misinterpret the AI, right?

378
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:20,189
Like, a character decides to flank,

379
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,330
but from the player's perspective,

380
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,172
what's happening is the guy ran off,

381
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,354
and then later on, somebody else magically appeared

382
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,435
behind them and shot them, and that's not fun.

383
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,458
Whereas, if the character says, I'm gonna flank left,

384
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,401
no, the player's left, while he's rather lost

385
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:36,584
the element of surprise, at least you get some credit

386
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,404
for what your AI's doing.

387
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,829
Also, the idea of companion AI in a mixed world game

388
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:43,150
prompting the player where to look.

389
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,652
That's a really good idea.

390
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:45,793
A really bad idea?

391
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:47,195
Well, okay, so true story.

392
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,957
I was playing a game, a stealth game,

393
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,159
and I was hiding, and somebody was looking for me,

394
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,243
and the character said the line, and this is the line,

395
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:56,925
he's gotta be around here somewhere.

396
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:03,440
What? He's gotta be around here somewhere is not a sentence you use with grownups.

397
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,702
It's something you say if you're playing hide and seek with your five-year-old and you hear

398
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:11,683
giggling coming from behind the couch. It's not something you say if you think there might be

399
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:17,945
somebody hiding in the rafters with a gun. People, your fellow developers are doing their best to

400
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:22,827
make the player feel immersed, like they really are hiding in the rafters. And then you gotta

401
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:26,548
come in and deflate that balloon with he's gotta be around here somewhere.

402
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:30,019
Of course, what the guy is really saying is,

403
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,699
I'm in search mode so the player knows to stay hidden.

404
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,921
Even in the midst of showing off his intelligence,

405
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,261
he's undercutting it by showcasing

406
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,862
the stupid, unnatural limitations

407
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,463
that the genre places on him.

408
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:44,223
He's got to be around here somewhere.

409
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:45,724
He's got to be around here somewhere.

410
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:47,664
Must have been the wind.

411
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:48,925
It's OK, guy.

412
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:51,226
I'm back to patrol mode.

413
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:51,466
No.

414
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:55,407
The real irony is that we think of Barks as a one trip.

415
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,710
as a one simple trick sort of thing.

416
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,653
Like, it's an easy way to bump up the intelligence quotient

417
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,374
just by playing sound files.

418
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:06,437
It's like we're trying to cheat on a Turing test.

419
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:08,359
Like, instead of having an actual conversation

420
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,321
with the player, the player can't talk,

421
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,583
and instead, our guys are just monologuing

422
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,305
about taking an arrow to the knee.

423
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:15,946
Like, if the player could talk,

424
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:17,628
that's what they would be asking about.

425
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:22,277
Well guess what? Your one simple trick, it's not fucking working.

426
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:24,619
Of course it's not. Ask any artist,

427
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,261
what's the hardest thing to draw?

428
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,683
And they will say,

429
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:31,046
the human body, or in particular the human face.

430
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,349
Not because the human face is...

431
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:39,330
inherently complicated, but because we humans are so good at analyzing human faces,

432
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,331
at picking out small problems.

433
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:44,552
Well, we humans are also pretty good at communicating.

434
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:47,012
We know that people don't walk around saying,

435
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,713
must have been the wind to nobody in particular.

436
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:53,094
And we certainly understand the risks of sharing information

437
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,654
with somebody who's trying to kill us.

438
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,160
And this isn't about having good writing.

439
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,801
It isn't about having good voice acting.

440
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:01,202
You can have those things, and it doesn't matter.

441
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:02,984
Even when it doesn't sound artificial,

442
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:05,425
it still sounds unintelligent.

443
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,266
It has to because it is.

444
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,488
You cannot make someone seem intelligent and threatening

445
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:13,170
if you make them complicit in their own defeat.

446
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:19,900
It's like what Brian Schwab said a few years ago about game AI's job being to lose with style.

447
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,780
Fuck you, Schwab!

448
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,281
Lose with style. There's no such fucking thing.

449
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,342
A character losing with style means that their style is to lose.

450
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:31,143
Don't patronize your player. How is that challenging? How does it engage the player?

451
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,404
He's gotta be around here somewhere. That style?

452
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:38,245
How do you imagine the player reacting to that?

453
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:42,606
Well reasoned, my friend. I do have to be around here somewhere.

454
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,547
You truly are a worthy opponent.

455
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,226
Enough with the barks.

456
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,648
Enough with the insincere, I'm gonna get you, play acting

457
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,988
from characters designed and programmed

458
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,569
to be shooting gallery targets.

459
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,670
If you wanna show the player how intelligent your AI is,

460
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,751
make it outsmart them.

461
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:03,552
You wanna challenge the player, engage them.

462
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:06,473
Give them opponents who shut up and try to win.

463
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:07,053
Thanks.

464
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,218
All right, I'm gonna channel some anger.

465
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:25,021
Might have forgotten to make it funny.

466
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:28,083
Um, I've been talking about this for a long time.

467
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,264
And for those of you who saw my session earlier,

468
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:32,306
there might have been a bit of a disconnect

469
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,348
because I took a lot of anger from that session.

470
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,289
And I brought it here.

471
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,810
So, let's get started.

472
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:44,860
A couple of years ago, maybe five years ago, somebody came up to me and they were like,

473
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,242
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Game AI. 90% of Game AI is A-Star.

474
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:53,145
And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

475
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:58,928
And then more recently I got given this quote, 90% of AI in games is NPCs.

476
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:00,589
And that's fucking bullshit.

477
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:04,371
So, if you take a very myopic view on what AI in games is...

478
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:10,670
Yeah, okay. We'll sit here and we'll talk about NPCs and we'll talk about pathfinding

479
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,853
and we'll talk about bugs. Not that I'm picking on you, Ben.

480
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,455
Who fucking cares?

481
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:22,740
We stifle ourselves by focusing on NPCs. We limit our impact.

482
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,986
And if you think that 90% of AI in games is NPCs, it might be because you've only thought

483
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:30,747
about NPCs.

484
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,515
This is what the games industry looks like.

485
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:37,315
2.4 billion gamers in 2019.

486
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:40,118
The sector revenue is $148 billion.

487
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:44,062
Half of that is gonna come from mobile.

488
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,984
That means we've got a big secret here.

489
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:50,628
A significant percent of our industry

490
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:51,969
doesn't even have NPCs.

491
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:55,773
And our industry is an industry.

492
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,290
And our studios, our businesses, and our games are products.

493
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,597
Maybe, just maybe, we ought to think about AI in bigger context than just fucking NPCs.

494
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,703
The AI revolution is here.

495
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:15,610
The AI as a sector is going to hit $168 billion in the next six years.

496
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:20,192
We're adding value across all sorts of sectors.

497
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:23,596
Autonomous vehicles, home automation, you name it.

498
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:25,638
AI is adding value right now.

499
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:28,200
And in this city in particular,

500
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,065
AI practitioners are the gods of modern technology.

501
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:35,628
We have the capacity to rethink and reshape

502
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,289
how we do things.

503
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:37,950
And you know what?

504
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:43,857
We've been doing this shit longer than everybody in this city calling themselves a machine learning expert.

505
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:50,702
We've forgotten more than they fucking know because we've been doing it for 30 fucking years.

506
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:56,986
So, you can focus on your NPCs if you want, I guess.

507
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:59,867
If you want to chase a cool line in a review somewhere about,

508
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:03,730
oh, and then the NPC said, oh, he threw a grenade.

509
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,391
Like, what's the point?

510
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:11,638
You have the capacity to add millions of dollars of value to your businesses.

511
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:16,503
So if I hear one more fucking talk about pathfinding, I'm gonna lose it!

512
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:17,043
So yeah, that's it.

513
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:42,909
All right, so, Nicole Lazaro.

514
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:47,672
And this is, yeah, we're gonna see about this.

515
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:50,693
All right, so this is my rant.

516
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:54,095
So I've worked on, in games, emotion for 26 years,

517
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:55,776
about emotion and interaction,

518
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,037
so that's where I'm gonna channel.

519
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,458
We're working on creating an emotion engine

520
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,879
for some of our games.

521
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,521
And therefore, my rant is about self-driving cars.

522
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:10,909
Now, I don't know what about this is,

523
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:15,514
or why we are so obsessed as a Silicon Valley

524
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:19,798
and as a planet with this concept of self-driving cars.

525
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,702
But it seems to be grabbing a lot of lion's share

526
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,583
of industry and what we're trying to do,

527
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,025
or what some companies are trying to do.

528
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:30,827
And is it, I mean, what is the value proposition of a self-driving car?

529
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:33,008
Some people, you know, claim that we'll reduce traffic.

530
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:33,428
Maybe.

531
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,249
It'll be, you know, a couple of iterations down the road.

532
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,911
Is it that we want to read our comics, you know, as we drive to work or as we get driven

533
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:40,371
to work?

534
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:42,852
Do we want a Facebook on the back seat like Michael Jordan here?

535
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:48,715
Or do we want the cheery face of a automobile saying, hey, I'm on my way on the grill as

536
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,575
it picks you up?

537
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,757
By the way, I think that there's something wrong with her because she looks like she's

538
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:54,397
in a neck brace.

539
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:59,259
And I think that this problem is like, is this a problem to solve?

540
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,159
And that really is the heart of my rant.

541
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,081
Is a self-driving vehicle with all of the expense that goes into it,

542
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:09,562
all of the earth resources that will have to be created or mined

543
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:13,484
in order to create, replace the entire ecosystem of cars,

544
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:17,825
is that really worth it and is that a problem we're trying to solve?

545
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,306
And then the problem we're solving is not this one either,

546
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:22,327
which is on the AI aspect of like,

547
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,288
how do we keep them safe?

548
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:24,449
How do we make it more efficient?

549
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:27,610
How do we get people from here, from point A to point B?

550
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,512
No, you wanna think about, well, what is the real problem?

551
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:34,254
What are some real problems that we have as a society?

552
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:36,475
And as us, as interactive entertainers,

553
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,756
our mission is to help people imagine.

554
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:40,897
It's our mission is really to help people

555
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:43,459
of that next generation come up with new ideas,

556
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:46,160
to be able to see the world in a new way.

557
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,761
So what I say is that the real problem.

558
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:54,700
is this. We are a planet where depression is a worldwide epidemic.

559
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,221
We are losing connection with each other, with our loved ones.

560
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:02,543
We are getting sucked into things like social media.

561
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:05,344
And because I think there is an opportunity,

562
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,325
because I am both a ranter and a solution provider,

563
00:30:07,325 --> 00:30:10,666
is that because there is a connection between how we act

564
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:13,768
and how we feel, what we do in games and what we don't,

565
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,049
there really is a, if you saw my talk earlier,

566
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:19,410
there is a really opportunity to create new feelings,

567
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,351
new emotions, new patterns of behavior.

568
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:28,413
The problem to solve, I think, in AI for games is not this problem either.

569
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:32,355
It's not, you know, the threat of life is just one emotion that we have and that one

570
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:34,696
emotion that people experience.

571
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:39,097
It really is the relationship with others, sort of a human-centered approach to AI.

572
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:40,818
It's a people first.

573
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:45,279
Like, what could, what sort of value could AI add to this interactive experience that

574
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,580
makes us a better human, that improves our quality of life, that makes us smarter, that

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,321
makes us, you know, enjoy more time with our friends?

576
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,163
And WTF, where's the fun?

577
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,926
Where's the fun AI?

578
00:30:56,926 --> 00:31:01,770
We want that emotion to come forward.

579
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,392
And so with the opportunities in narrative AI,

580
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:07,935
sentiment analysis, and making players happier,

581
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,557
I think there's a real opportunity

582
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,678
to create not just more believable AI,

583
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:12,900
more better pathfinding,

584
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,121
and more intelligent barks, I guess.

585
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:20,826
But it really is to craft emotion and allow players not only the opportunity to experience

586
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:24,789
the emotion that you have, but really give them the steering wheel to create the emotions

587
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,310
that are missing in their life.

588
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:33,413
which is possible through the interaction design and through AI.

589
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:37,076
So with the four keys is just one lens into this space,

590
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:40,179
but we can actually through the actions in game help create

591
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,441
different emotional states, move them,

592
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,584
and they choose what actions they take so they can actually move themselves

593
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,025
to different emotional states.

594
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,987
So much of WITH is rather, it's not just really a choice between

595
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:51,309
the red pill or the blue pill.

596
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:57,554
It's really a choice of a different order, in a sense that we could provide games that

597
00:31:57,554 --> 00:32:02,938
give players their daily dose of dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphin.

598
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:07,122
These are wonderful chemicals that feel good.

599
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:11,906
Oxytocin is, of course, the cuddle hormone, but it's also produced in angry situations

600
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:12,467
as well.

601
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,547
Social bonding.

602
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,249
Social ranking is serotonin.

603
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,251
It's what drives the likes on Facebook.

604
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:19,372
And endorphins, of course, mask emotions.

605
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,533
And so you can actually get...

606
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:26,936
quite a long way if you give players these different emotions in sort of every layer

607
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,077
of your gameplay.

608
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:34,239
So imagine if your AI was really skilled at precisely targeting different emotional states

609
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:38,641
and that through the player whether or not they were consciously aware or at least behaviorally

610
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:43,243
aware of moving and using the game in this way or that way could really round out their

611
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:43,323
life.

612
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:47,185
You know, really could improve the quality of their interaction with their friends, could

613
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:52,867
make them feel more associated with their fellow peers, and that we could actually add,

614
00:32:52,867 --> 00:33:00,210
you know, these mechanics to create different emotions in the player at every level of the

615
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,651
game and, you know, connect us all as a planet.

616
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,812
We can create meaning in games.

617
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:09,113
We can create significance, the feeling that I matter.

618
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:13,675
And an AI that's trained to do that, that helps a player even,

619
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,955
to train themselves to give themselves, you know,

620
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:19,636
encouragement and move through the world, is a much better,

621
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:22,577
I think a much more nobler goal and a higher stretch.

622
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,177
And I think that's something that we're all very,

623
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,278
very capable in this room.

624
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:28,839
And so it's not so much, you know, what Tomb, you know,

625
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,719
Tomb Raider, Lara Croft raids.

626
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,260
It's really what makes, what really,

627
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,621
really matters is how you feel after the game, you know,

628
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:38,741
playing with your friends.

629
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,202
So, thank you.

630
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,331
So some of these rants, like that one,

631
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,832
were very feel-good type of rants.

632
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:53,932
Mine will not be that kind.

633
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:59,996
Um, several, what was it, like three years ago or something,

634
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,757
Brian Schwab did a rant where he's like,

635
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,338
everyone has like this point to make.

636
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:04,138
I have no point to make.

637
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm going to complain about five things that annoy me.

638
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,341
I could have easily made it 10, 15, whatever.

639
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:10,222
But these are five things that have

640
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,583
been pissing me off lately.

641
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,023
And that's the entire rant.

642
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:13,924
That's what it is.

643
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:15,305
So let's get started, all right?

644
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,766
Number one, a lack of tools.

645
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:22,132
If I come onto your project and there are no tools whatsoever to deal with the AI,

646
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,434
that's going to be the very first thing I advocate for.

647
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,957
I was on a project once that was pretty far along,

648
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:30,301
and the only AI visualization was setting a breakpoint.

649
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,704
Setting a breakpoint.

650
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,427
What dystopian horror is this?

651
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,432
Like, really?

652
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:39,694
I can't even see, like, you can dump a debug log

653
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,316
to a console window.

654
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,937
In fact, I am so annoyed by this

655
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:45,380
that tomorrow I'm giving a simplest,

656
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,581
my simplest trick in the book

657
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:49,604
is how to create a really simple debug log.

658
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:50,865
And not just a console window,

659
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:52,347
but like mixing a C sharp thing.

660
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,848
Like, you can do this trivially.

661
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,572
So if you don't have tools to actually see what your AI is doing,

662
00:34:57,572 --> 00:35:00,135
then what's the point? You're gonna step through, like,

663
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:04,520
walking through your horrible behavior tree? That sounds terrible.

664
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,882
Even on The Sims 4, in the very, very beginning,

665
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:10,506
when all The Sims looked exactly the same, and it was a green, flat plane,

666
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:13,289
and that's all we had, at least we had a console window

667
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,351
where I'd spool out a bunch of debug logs of, like,

668
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,693
why did The Sim make this choice?

669
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:19,055
At least do something, right?

670
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:21,257
Don't fuck us over on tools, come on.

671
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,317
What are you doing?

672
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:23,778
Okay, number two, and this one has gotten me

673
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:25,440
some interesting looks.

674
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,282
Single letters for template parameters.

675
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,743
Did we lose a war?

676
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,165
Like, what the fuck is this?

677
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,366
Single letters for, okay, T.

678
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,767
Really?

679
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:37,689
Okay, sure, it's type, all right.

680
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:38,830
Follow me here.

681
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,813
Bad, bad, bad, right?

682
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,294
These are all bad.

683
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:45,315
Why is this okay?

684
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:51,243
It's a slippery slope, right? Now there's this one. I don't know what that means. Sure, T is type,

685
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:57,284
but what is this or this or this? Like, and maybe you think it's hyperbole, right? You're like,

686
00:35:57,284 --> 00:36:01,805
oh, come on, Rez, you're just using letters in the alphabet. Well, I mean, this is EASTL's hash

687
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:07,926
table, right? Or it's insert, you know, it's hash table type. I mean, come on. Like, I know what

688
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:12,287
many of these do only because I know how it works on the inside. But just looking at this, I can't

689
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,848
tell what any of these fucking things do. Like, really?

690
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,251
So please, name them something useful.

691
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:19,992
Anything useful.

692
00:36:19,992 --> 00:36:21,693
All right.

693
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:23,594
Good God.

694
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:28,718
Number three, shitty interview questions.

695
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:29,579
Yeah!

696
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:30,039
Thank you.

697
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:33,534
You know who you are.

698
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,577
And when I first started interviewing,

699
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:37,961
I gave shitty interview questions, right?

700
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,203
Are you really gonna have,

701
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:41,225
like what value is it for me to stand

702
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:45,071
in front of a whiteboard and like write out in a pen

703
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:46,974
some algorithm that I could look up

704
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,496
in two seconds in any book?

705
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:52,759
Right? Like, okay, it's fair game to have me generally describe A star,

706
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,902
but to sit there and implement A star on the whiteboard

707
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:58,704
with five high-status engineers all staring at me?

708
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:01,105
That's exactly like my programming environment at home.

709
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:04,007
I don't know about you guys. Like, fuck you!

710
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:07,248
I mean, let's take something trivial, super trivial.

711
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:08,549
Binary search, right?

712
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:08,929
Super trivial.

713
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:11,829
If you had me go up and implement a binary search

714
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,890
on a whiteboard, there is at least 50% chance

715
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,791
I'm going to have some off by one error, certainly.

716
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,251
And what is that really showing you?

717
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:22,452
Because this is probably how I would implement binary search

718
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:24,212
in an actual game, right?

719
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:27,092
I would call binary search across whatever

720
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,193
that structure is.

721
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,779
So what are you doing?

722
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,087
Like what is that actually telling you

723
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:35,173
about the quality of that engineer that you're hiring?

724
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,368
Like, really?

725
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,150
Maybe a better thing to do if you want to check their coding ability

726
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,413
is to give them a game design and say, make this game design.

727
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,995
And then go away while they sit there with their headphones on

728
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:50,417
and Google in front of them so they can remember how some API works

729
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,799
and like actually implement a thing in Visual Studio

730
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,200
or whatever your, your poison of choice is.

731
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,102
That's maybe a better representation of how you write code.

732
00:37:58,102 --> 00:38:00,544
All right, number four, and I can say this one because I work in academia.

733
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:04,670
Yeah, and I'm going to look at you on this one as well.

734
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,456
Schools that focus on high-level CS concepts rather than actual practical software engineering.

735
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:08,576
Right?

736
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:08,856
It's true.

737
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:09,617
Like, okay, great.

738
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:10,178
Thank you.

739
00:38:10,178 --> 00:38:10,498
Thank you.

740
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:11,079
Thank you.

741
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:11,279
Thank you.

742
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:11,780
Thank you.

743
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,060
Thank you.

744
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,301
Thank you.

745
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:12,761
Thank you.

746
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:14,083
Thank you.

747
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,303
Thank you.

748
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:14,484
Thank you.

749
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:14,684
Thank you.

750
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:15,785
Thank you.

751
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:16,126
Thank you.

752
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:16,346
Thank you.

753
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:16,646
Thank you.

754
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:21,058
Fantastic.

755
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:25,679
You can do a whole proof on exactly why this algorithm is

756
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,900
perfectly theta of n squared or whatever.

757
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,660
That's fantastic.

758
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,941
I will never ask you to do that in any job anywhere.

759
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:35,321
I ask you to understand the basic concepts of how that

760
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:39,342
stuff works, but some of the really deep stuff, especially

761
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:42,303
to the exclusion of actual software

762
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,103
engineering techniques.

763
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:48,004
So one of the classes I teach is assembly language and

764
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:48,884
optimization.

765
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:49,424
You're welcome.

766
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,476
And there's a question that I give them.

767
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,777
I actually got this on an interview once,

768
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,018
and it's a really interesting question.

769
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:56,659
This is, I think, proves my point.

770
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:57,560
So bear with me here,

771
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,961
because you're all about to get an interview question.

772
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,541
Ready?

773
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,762
You have this function.

774
00:39:00,762 --> 00:39:03,784
This function, all it really does

775
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:05,505
is it takes in three parameters, right?

776
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,427
Has some, takes in three parameters,

777
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,569
an array, a size of the array,

778
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:11,390
and a value that we're looking for,

779
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,071
specifically a sum that we're looking for.

780
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:16,414
So it's gonna return true if any two values

781
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:19,896
in that array summed together equal val to find.

782
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,997
It returns false in any other case.

783
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:22,378
That's it.

784
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:23,738
That's the question.

785
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,159
How do you write this function?

786
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,960
So there are many ways to write this particular function.

787
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,562
There's sort of the brute force way.

788
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:33,022
So we can do that one.

789
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,423
And that's n squared, sure, if we

790
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:37,384
want to get into asymptotic complexity, which

791
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:39,405
where we just churn through the whole thing over and over

792
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:39,685
and over.

793
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:40,746
That's fun.

794
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:41,466
There's a sorting method.

795
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,807
We can sort the array.

796
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,568
And then we can basically take the.

797
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:49,911
The val define, subtract the value that we're looking for as we walk through the array

798
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:52,353
and then do a binary search across that array.

799
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:54,734
So now we have, okay, I'm gonna call it 2 n log n.

800
00:39:54,734 --> 00:40:00,078
You know, if we're going super froofy here, then it would actually be n log n

801
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:02,000
because multiplicative constants and so on, right?

802
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,361
Okay, moving on. Hash map, that's another way of doing this, right?

803
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,424
It's basically the same thing, except it amortizes towards more constant time,

804
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,285
but now you have n in memory, right?

805
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:10,826
Who gives a shit?

806
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:12,854
Because here's the reality.

807
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:15,915
I can take that input array and change the values,

808
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,415
just some constants, the values that are in it,

809
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:20,036
the range of the values that are in it.

810
00:40:20,036 --> 00:40:21,396
I can change how big the array is

811
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:23,057
and all sorts of different things.

812
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,697
By just changing a few of these constants,

813
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:27,998
I can make any one of these three in a real computer

814
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:30,359
greatly, vastly outperform any of the other three.

815
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,959
And that's the demo that I do to prove to them

816
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,940
that like, okay, asymptotic complexity,

817
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,500
you know, big O notation, that's a place to start.

818
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,521
But in real actual computing,

819
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:40,141
It's completely different, right?

820
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:43,303
Because there's CPU cache and there's all this other stuff that comes into play.

821
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,824
There's, what about all the memory?

822
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:46,785
What about all the allocations that are gonna happen in the hash map, right?

823
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,926
Does the hash map have to regrow a bunch of times?

824
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,046
Do we have to rehash everything?

825
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:53,068
All sorts of things come into play.

826
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:58,510
So, OK, sure, write your proof that shows me the exact perfect asymptotic complexity

827
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,351
of any of these methods, and I can show you a data set

828
00:41:01,351 --> 00:41:03,392
that will blow that completely out of the water.

829
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,453
Because that's the reality of how computing works.

830
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:05,533
OK.

831
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:11,426
Designers, and I love you designers,

832
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:13,910
but designers who are unwilling to learn technical things.

833
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,573
That's number five.

834
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,315
We are in a technical industry, right?

835
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:21,201
I have had designers who are unwilling to learn

836
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:23,484
how the AI works.

837
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:23,705
Really?

838
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:29,607
I've given it, I've around Maxis and I can say Maxis because all of the designers there

839
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:32,290
were wonderful, so I can say only positive things.

840
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,413
But there were many designers and I would say, okay, here's how the AI works.

841
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:42,278
And I would draw like math on the board and I would watch like the eyes go more and more

842
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:46,781
glassy as more like Greek letters started coming out.

843
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,263
And it's like, okay, let's distill this a little bit.

844
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:51,604
But to their credit, each and every one of them

845
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:54,405
stepped back and said, OK, let's really understand this.

846
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:55,326
Let's explain.

847
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,326
Walk me through this step by step.

848
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,827
And I see a lot of designers, especially new designers,

849
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:02,908
who come through and they're like, no, that's

850
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:03,849
programming's problem.

851
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:08,650
Our job as programmers, as AI developers,

852
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,751
is maybe not even to make the next cool thing.

853
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:15,053
My job, hopefully, is to enable designers to be creative.

854
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:18,699
But in order to give you those tools,

855
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,741
you have to meet me halfway.

856
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:23,984
I can't just miracle this thing in front of you.

857
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:27,488
And I'm not saying that you have to learn all this stuff.

858
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:29,109
You don't have to understand any of this stuff.

859
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,130
Any designers in the room?

860
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,331
Are there any designers in the room?

861
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:33,084
Okay, like three, oh yeah, a handful.

862
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,746
Right, I love you guys, I really do.

863
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:37,229
And you don't have to understand anything

864
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:39,191
that I said on the previous slide at all.

865
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:40,693
I don't care about that.

866
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,955
But I do expect you to understand the basic idea

867
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:46,039
and be willing to learn very basic things.

868
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:46,860
And here they are.

869
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,923
If you're a level designer, especially basic vector math,

870
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:51,944
basic vector math, not crazy, basic.

871
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,847
And for the love of God, probability theory.

872
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,330
If I will, I will just, and I'm gonna lose it

873
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,412
if I see one more designer that doesn't understand

874
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,814
the basics of probability theory, right?

875
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,476
And just basic probabilistic math and that sort of stuff.

876
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:08,859
Because that's the world that we live in.

877
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:09,940
Anyway, I don't know.

878
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,721
So that's me, thank you.

879
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,323
Okay, so to kind of end this,

880
00:43:25,323 --> 00:43:27,545
for my rant, maybe it's not so ranty,

881
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,446
but I wanted to really think hard

882
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:31,167
about moving the ball forward,

883
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:34,570
about pushing game AI really to the next level.

884
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,873
And really, Ben already ranted about this two years ago,

885
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:41,295
and he had some great things to say.

886
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:46,138
He said, what are you doing to save game AI?

887
00:43:46,138 --> 00:43:47,619
Because no one is coming to save us.

888
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:50,203
That was, and then he further went on to say,

889
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:52,543
a little bit more inspirationally,

890
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:55,664
but we need to build it into something worthy of notice.

891
00:43:55,664 --> 00:44:00,084
We need to get over our ideas of what is and is not possible.

892
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:02,925
We must do things that we do not know how to do.

893
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:04,645
We must create experiences

894
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:05,786
that we thought were not creatable.

895
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:09,526
And we need to push the ball forward.

896
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:13,227
And I started thinking back to when good old behavior trees

897
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:14,267
first came on the scene.

898
00:44:15,808 --> 00:44:17,049
what happened back then?

899
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:19,971
And planning happened just around that same time.

900
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:22,232
And so, as another old man in the talk,

901
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:27,896
I think I will regale the tale

902
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:30,978
that what was happening at the time

903
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,679
was games were starting to get more complicated,

904
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,902
more NPCs, more, oh, I said NPCs, more characters.

905
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:37,622
And

906
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:44,691
state machines weren't cutting it and independently people were trying to solve this problem.

907
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:50,175
It was sort of a crisis. And so behavior trees from Halo 2, planning from fear or GOAP.

908
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:57,761
So what this really comes down to is if you want to move the ball forward, it feels like there

909
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:01,364
needs to be incentives. Right? Incentives to make new things happen.

910
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:04,445
So, I mean, we all know about deep learning.

911
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:06,969
What the heck is going on with deep learning, right?

912
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:08,371
It's in the news all the time.

913
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,313
We're hearing lots about it.

914
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:12,136
We keep wondering how it might affect

915
00:45:12,136 --> 00:45:14,719
all the parts of our industry.

916
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:16,942
But with deep learning, what's really happening

917
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:18,545
is the incentives are right.

918
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:22,739
And it's not necessarily the game industry,

919
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:25,700
but what deep learning is about is it's about predicting things.

920
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,902
It makes the cost of predicting things cheaper.

921
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:31,883
And so Harvard Business Review, in an article,

922
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:34,184
thought that deep learning could actually

923
00:45:34,184 --> 00:45:37,106
deliver something like almost $6 trillion

924
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:39,547
in annual revenue to businesses, which

925
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:41,288
dwarfs the game industry.

926
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:44,890
And so in the article, it said, follow the money.

927
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,990
This is what's happening.

928
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,611
And so where in business is this happening?

929
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:51,552
Well, it's retail.

930
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:53,292
It's retail with serving ads and promotions

931
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,252
to the right people.

932
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,573
It's in operations.

933
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:58,874
If you can predict better, you can reduce inventory costs,

934
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:00,955
which can save a lot of money.

935
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:02,595
And manufacturing, if you can predict

936
00:46:02,595 --> 00:46:05,016
which machines are gonna go or fail,

937
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:07,657
you can keep everything going.

938
00:46:08,357 --> 00:46:13,801
Now, just very recently, AlphaStar was developed by DeepMind to play StarCraft II.

939
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:19,365
It was a deep neural network trained with supervised learning, reinforcement learning,

940
00:46:19,365 --> 00:46:24,089
and it did beat some top players, and it was an impressive feat.

941
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:29,132
A little less impressive when you find out what it took, right?

942
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:32,655
It had to train on half a million human games.

943
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,275
That's a lot.

944
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:34,796
That's a lot, a lot.

945
00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:40,311
And the agents that they trained started playing against each other and experienced up to 200

946
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:43,793
years of real-time StarCraft play.

947
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:50,577
Which kind of makes us like, well, how do I ship a title with any of this if I have

948
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:53,158
to collect all this training data and let the...

949
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:58,542
and then be done with the whole game before the bots can play each other too, right?

950
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:03,185
And is this really the biggest problem, trying to beat the top players, right?

951
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:08,728
And this wouldn't have made StarCraft 2 such a better game that it would have sold more.

952
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,370
What is DeepMind doing?

953
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,011
Right? Well, they don't care about games.

954
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,065
They like games, but they're using games as a platform to prove their tech.

955
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:22,908
So then they can apply it to the six trillion dollar industry, right,

956
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:24,149
where there's a lot of money.

957
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:31,175
So thinking about incentives, well, how do we move the ball forward?

958
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:33,837
Right, well, we're gonna need to create some incentives.

959
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,771
It might be what we can do.

960
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:40,974
So Ben gave his rant two years ago,

961
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:43,896
and his incentive sort of was,

962
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:47,137
his incentive strategy was shame.

963
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:54,722
Right, shame, to shame the audience,

964
00:47:54,722 --> 00:48:00,265
which that might work, but it probably won't.

965
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:03,927
It'll make him feel bad for a little while.

966
00:48:06,078 --> 00:48:09,922
Oh, okay, so what are some better incentives?

967
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:13,666
Right, so, well, just trying to make a groundbreaking game

968
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,708
is an incentive, right?

969
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,789
We saw with Spider-Man earlier this morning,

970
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:21,793
and we're gonna see tomorrow with the Division 2, right?

971
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:25,417
Groundbreaking games do push, do move the ball forward,

972
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:28,680
and that is one way, and that is great.

973
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,701
How about AI Summit Talks?

974
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:33,013
Right? Maybe, maybe they spur some innovation.

975
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:36,235
We're gonna have an experimental game AI session tomorrow,

976
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:38,177
which you should totally check out.

977
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:41,239
And hopefully that does help move the ball forward.

978
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,600
And we're doing what we can at the AI summit.

979
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,783
Maybe we should just get a billionaire to pay all of us.

980
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:47,223
That might.

981
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,885
Yeah. Yeah.

982
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,327
That might create some incentives.

983
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:54,588
So it's certainly on the table.

984
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,612
if we have any takers.

985
00:48:56,612 --> 00:48:58,832
A game jam or a hackathon.

986
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:01,893
I haven't really heard too many game jam or hackathons

987
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:03,614
completely centered on game AI.

988
00:49:03,614 --> 00:49:07,574
So that might be some incentives

989
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:09,835
or just maybe a well-designed contest.

990
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:12,776
So there have been some well-designed contests

991
00:49:12,776 --> 00:49:15,036
that have moved the ball forward.

992
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,557
This is Nathan Sturtevant.

993
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:19,737
He worked on the, or he created a grid-based

994
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,878
path planning competition.

995
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:23,838
This is not a memorial picture.

996
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:24,178
He did it.

997
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:32,476
I was reviewing my slides and I felt slightly bad.

998
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:37,899
He was not born in 2012, and he did not pass away in 2014.

999
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:43,522
He is still alive.

1000
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,504
He was able to get real maps from real games.

1001
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,493
a bunch of StarCraft maps, Dragon Age Origins,

1002
00:49:50,493 --> 00:49:55,036
because, well, he had worked on the game, and Warcraft III.

1003
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:57,077
And he had those maps, and he could

1004
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,119
use those maps in that contest, some real world examples.

1005
00:50:01,182 --> 00:50:03,364
And because over those short few years,

1006
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:06,905
a lot of neat algorithms were tested

1007
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:08,406
and they could be compared against each other

1008
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:11,008
and we could really understand, you know,

1009
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,789
what's the deal, what should we pay attention to?

1010
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:16,050
And it did spur things.

1011
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,631
I worked on Jump Point Search Plus with Goal Bounding

1012
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:21,433
and I gave a talk about it here in 2015.

1013
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:25,755
And that contest kind of helped me, you know,

1014
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,836
work on that problem and even be able

1015
00:50:27,836 --> 00:50:29,337
to compare my solution with other people.

1016
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,272
So that's something.

1017
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:34,176
This is Ben Weber.

1018
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:36,379
He is also currently alive.

1019
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,632
So in 2009, he started the StarCraft AI competition,

1020
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:46,973
which was wonderful.

1021
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:48,914
But recently, over the summer, he wrote an article

1022
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,395
called The End of AI Competitions.

1023
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:55,397
And what his, he kind of cited some issues

1024
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:57,858
with what's going on is, there's a lot of games

1025
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:00,359
where you still have closed APIs,

1026
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:03,541
which make it very hard to program what you need to program

1027
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:07,123
if you wanna make competitive AI within a game

1028
00:51:07,123 --> 00:51:08,143
that's a shipping game.

1029
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:14,416
With deep learning and a lot of these new techniques that are kicking some ass,

1030
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,899
the compute is very expensive.

1031
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:21,826
So Luke told me that, so Ben works at Zynga,

1032
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:26,229
and Luke told me that Ben uses way too much compute at Zynga.

1033
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,170
I didn't say too much, I said a lot.

1034
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,170
Oh, he uses a lot.

1035
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,892
A lot of money goes.

1036
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:33,873
But the problem is researchers can't do that,

1037
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:36,554
students can't do that, normal people can't do that.

1038
00:51:36,554 --> 00:51:39,736
They can't pay thousands of dollars a day or something

1039
00:51:39,736 --> 00:51:41,997
to pay for compute or for a project.

1040
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:44,879
And you need access to a lot of training data.

1041
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:47,662
right, for these techniques.

1042
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:50,947
So it seems to be this problem that is,

1043
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:52,589
and then DeepMind came along,

1044
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:53,851
and who's gonna compete with that?

1045
00:51:53,851 --> 00:51:58,336
Who's gonna compete with hundreds of the top AI researchers

1046
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:00,579
for deep learning in the world?

1047
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:02,924
So here's what he said.

1048
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:07,766
He said, in a way, my initial call for research on open AI problems failed.

1049
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:11,547
It was an open problem, but I didn't fully encourage participants to be open in their

1050
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:12,827
approach to the problem.

1051
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:18,349
So sometimes people don't share what they did accomplish, or even if they do share it,

1052
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:19,609
it's very hard to use.

1053
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:22,990
Have you heard of Kaggle?

1054
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:23,930
I've got to pronounce that right.

1055
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,451
It's not Kegel, it's Kegel.

1056
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:29,744
So this is a, well it's a website and a group

1057
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:32,306
where there's hundreds of competitions

1058
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:34,427
with real world open data sets

1059
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:35,828
to solve data science challenges

1060
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:40,092
and they give big money, like $50,000 to the winner.

1061
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:42,253
And what happens is they get corporations

1062
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:43,594
to come up with a problem,

1063
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:47,977
give away their, open up their data sets

1064
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:52,240
and then see if people can apply machine learning to it

1065
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,982
and come up with something that can help them

1066
00:52:53,982 --> 00:52:54,942
make their business better.

1067
00:52:55,723 --> 00:53:00,484
And Google has purchased Kaggle, so as they do,

1068
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:03,905
also own, I believe, DeepMind.

1069
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:07,245
But Kaggle has shown the power of certain machine learning

1070
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:07,966
techniques.

1071
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:10,306
And it's only by having these kind of contests out in the

1072
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:13,147
open that you really see and can test some of these things.

1073
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:16,148
So competitions do seem like there's some kind of incentive

1074
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:17,748
there that's interesting.

1075
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:21,449
So it would be interesting to think more about competitions

1076
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,089
for game AI.

1077
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:24,469
But what are some good incentives?

1078
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:25,090
You know what?

1079
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:25,350
I think.

1080
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,451
People already love to make new things.

1081
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:31,273
We all end this because we love making new things.

1082
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,093
Sometimes maybe the right incentive

1083
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:36,935
is just knowing what to make, right?

1084
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:40,677
Lots of us just don't maybe have the right ideas.

1085
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:44,039
So maybe the first step in moving the ball forward

1086
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:45,940
is making a list.

1087
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,762
Make a list of really great challenges, right?

1088
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:52,483
We need to start with a list.

1089
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:54,464
Challenges, aspirations.

1090
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,899
Goals, right?

1091
00:53:57,899 --> 00:54:00,722
And as, just to kind of recap what Ben said,

1092
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:03,064
you know, build game AI into something

1093
00:54:03,064 --> 00:54:04,585
where they've noticed.

1094
00:54:04,585 --> 00:54:07,407
Get over our ideas of what is not possible.

1095
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:08,789
Do things that we do not know how to do.

1096
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:12,512
Create experiences that we thought were not creatable.

1097
00:54:12,512 --> 00:54:15,274
So right, we don't want to maximize winning, right?

1098
00:54:15,274 --> 00:54:17,216
So the whole StarCraft competition is sort of,

1099
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:20,619
Sort of flawed.

1100
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,100
We're a little interested in maximizing performance.

1101
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,162
A little optimization there.

1102
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,943
Definitely speed of development.

1103
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:29,444
We want to do more with fewer people, right?

1104
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:31,526
So we can make more interesting games.

1105
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:33,567
We want to basically maximize entertainment,

1106
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:35,649
which is a very hard fitness function, right?

1107
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:39,071
That's very hard to measure.

1108
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,532
That is... we're in trouble.

1109
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:42,773
Is what we're... we're in trouble.

1110
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:49,804
No, we need to max, but if you think about it as maximizing wow moments, right?

1111
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:50,586
That would be something.

1112
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:56,756
So what are these things? I tried to list them out and I was a little disappointed in myself.

1113
00:54:56,756 --> 00:54:58,277
But we'll see what I have.

1114
00:54:58,277 --> 00:55:02,419
I want to author behavior quicker than I can do with behavior trees, right?

1115
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:07,102
Behavior trees, as Ben said in the previous— can't be the end of the line, right?

1116
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,364
This is not it. It wasn't invented 14 years ago and that's it.

1117
00:55:09,364 --> 00:55:15,127
Although in a way, play devil's advocate, behavior trees are a programming language.

1118
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:18,690
And we use programming languages that are old, like C++.

1119
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:20,282
There's reasons, right?

1120
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:22,163
They're solid, they're dependable,

1121
00:55:22,163 --> 00:55:24,243
there's certain reasons.

1122
00:55:24,243 --> 00:55:25,764
But we do wanna author behavior also

1123
00:55:25,764 --> 00:55:28,225
that's more nuanced than I can do with behavior trees.

1124
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:32,526
And I heard the word nuance from one of the speakers.

1125
00:55:32,526 --> 00:55:34,327
So there's something there too.

1126
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:36,608
But, and be able to just script wow moments

1127
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:39,109
faster and easier because sometimes that is,

1128
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:42,070
the way to do it is hand authored.

1129
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,051
And create innovative tools to create interactive dialogue

1130
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:48,212
or just all tools, so another shout out to tools.

1131
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:54,919
So I really think that all those kind of land in the realm of improved tools and languages,

1132
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:55,240
right?

1133
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,448
So if you could create incentives around that, if you could create contests or even just

1134
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:02,692
list out the challenges, I think there's something there.

1135
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:05,355
Here's some more.

1136
00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:08,017
So use game AI as an innovative gameplay mechanic.

1137
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:10,099
You don't see too many games that do that.

1138
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:13,021
There's a couple, like Damian Isla's Third Eye Crime.

1139
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,902
But to be able to see more like that

1140
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:17,685
would move the ball forward.

1141
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:19,326
Better ways to converse with the NPC.

1142
00:56:19,326 --> 00:56:24,650
It seems troubling that we can't really get farther on that.

1143
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,972
Better ways for the NPCs to express themselves.

1144
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:31,095
And heck, NPCs that grow as a person over time, why not?

1145
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:35,391
But we need kind of more loftier goals, right?

1146
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,334
You have to kind of make them a little out of reach

1147
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:39,919
or else you don't, you're not reaching.

1148
00:56:39,919 --> 00:56:42,664
And so those kind of go around improving AI

1149
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:44,587
and game design, right?

1150
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:45,208
This means.

1151
00:56:45,554 --> 00:56:50,657
like AI programmers need to talk to game designers more, like a lot more.

1152
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:55,641
I was just at our function party last night and talking to an AI designer

1153
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:59,443
and I found out that they in Seattle have a local meetup.

1154
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:05,247
And our AI programmers used to have a local meetup in Seattle and we didn't know about each other.

1155
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:10,970
Which is very weird. So now we got to get, we should try to get the designers with the programmers and just start talking.

1156
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,241
So I think my call to action is that we need to define the challenges, right?

1157
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:18,102
That's the first step.

1158
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,883
That's the first step to moving the ball forward.

1159
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:24,344
We need, let's inspire each other to create those wow experiences.

1160
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:30,207
Because, and then, and then the end of this is simply, well, this is not the end.

1161
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:33,008
We've got to keep the conversation going.

1162
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,429
But this is the end.

1163
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:37,670
This is the end of the first day of the AI Summit.

1164
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:42,763
So, with that, I wanna thank you,

1165
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,046
and tomorrow is a big day.

1166
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,768
We have a lot of great sessions.

1167
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:48,891
So let's give a round of applause to all of our speakers.
