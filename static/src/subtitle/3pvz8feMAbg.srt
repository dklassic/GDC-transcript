00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:07,620
Hey everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis. I am a contributing editor

2
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:16,443
at gamasutra.com. I am also the community manager for GDC. We are here today back on the GDC Twitch

3
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:22,025
channel playing a game you may have heard about called Bugsnax. What are Bugsnax? What adorable...

4
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,408
What happens when you eat them?

5
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,150
This is something that you will find out

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,174
when you watch the footage that is playing for us right here,

7
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,516
which unfortunately is pre-recorded.

8
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,739
Sadly, we are not playing live today.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,202
But hey, if you like bug snacks, you're

10
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,044
going to see some bug snacks.

11
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:38,327
If you would prefer not to get any spoilers...

12
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:44,352
I would suggest tuning away because this is going to be spoilers for the first hour of the game.

13
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:49,095
But, we're not just here to play Bugsnax, we're here to talk with some of the folks who made Bugsnax.

14
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:57,502
That's why we are your friends, Kevin Kessler and John Murphy, who will be appearing in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

15
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,784
Kevin and John, if you would please introduce yourselves.

16
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:08,310
Sure. Well, I'm Kevin. I'm a programmer at Young Horses, one of two of us.

17
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:22,274
I primarily worked on the PlayStation side of things, in addition to just my half of the rest of the gameplay logic.

18
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:28,139
I'm John, and I was a gameplay designer.

19
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:36,910
for Bugsnax, mostly, you know, designing the game mechanics, the sort of behaviors of Bugsnax,

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,278
and the tools and traps used to capture them in the game.

21
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:45,904
Right on. We're going to be talking a lot about tools and traps in just a minute while the intro to Bugsnax plays out before us.

22
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:52,572
If you're in the audience and you'd like to ask good design or development questions for the folks from Young Horses, feel free to do so.

23
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,876
I've got chat open in the window, and I will be asking them.

24
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,600
Kevin and John, if you wouldn't mind starting off, Bugsnax is a...

25
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:06,862
It's a weird game with an incredibly functional purpose and game logic that has just captured people's attention.

26
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,723
Where did this come from?

27
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:16,304
It's kind of like a multi-layered question because where did the idea for bug snacks, bugs which are snacks, come from?

28
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,525
Where did the idea of a systems-driven game where you interact with them come from?

29
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:25,306
Where did the idea of everyone is Grumpus Otter's thing come from?

30
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,927
There's so many layers to the question, where did this come from?

31
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:32,508
And I only hope you can answer some of them in the way I phrased this.

32
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:58,485
We as a team decided, hey let's try to do something new.

33
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,526
We've only done Octodad, that's been our lives.

34
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:11,750
Let's try to come up with some different ideas and prototype them and see where that gets us.

35
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,532
So, we had a number of prototypes.

36
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:24,560
After pitching a few dozen or more ideas that we ended up trying and making,

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,541
one of them, pitched by creative director Kevin Zoon,

38
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,122
was based on the idea of bugs as different real-life foods, such as...

39
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,337
You know, what we ended up with the game, like a crabapple.

40
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:58,662
And the idea was we would go on like a safari, sort of an on-rails, Pokemon Snap style adventure.

41
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:08,488
Where you are using different physics-based tools to sort of lure and capture them from your vehicle.

42
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:15,248
And we, over time, moved away from that when we decided,

43
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,110
uh, I'm not sure that on-rails is fun,

44
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,032
I'm not sure that Pokemon Snap is actually fun anymore.

45
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:26,836
Um, so from there we kind of ended up layering

46
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,638
a lot of other gameplay mechanics,

47
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:33,080
just even from our other pitches that we didn't go forward with.

48
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,202
Uh, and that's where we sort of brought in...

49
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:45,230
Like, oh, what if these characters are on this island?

50
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,172
What if they're reacting to eating different bug snacks?

51
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:55,053
What are their backstories? How does that change them?

52
00:04:55,233 --> 00:05:00,694
It really snowballed completely away from the original pitch,

53
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,495
but into something that I think we all wanted to actively work on.

54
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:14,654
Yeah, and I guess there were sort of like three games that we actually prototyped that like we...

55
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:21,716
None of them really worked by themselves. There was a game that was like a sort of like spooky

56
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:28,677
narrative summer camp sort of idea that we abandoned and then slowly over time like the sort of like...

57
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:47,883
Being a small community and bringing people into that community and exploring outward from that main camp crept back into the game.

58
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:52,985
There is a pitch for a game about...

59
00:05:56,094 --> 00:06:00,996
Where the name Grumpus came from was a pitch for a game called Gut City Grumpus

60
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:10,082
that was about changing the guts of these cute monsters that looked very similar to

61
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:18,607
to what Grumpuses ended up like and changing their behavior by feeding them things.

62
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,009
Some aspects of that ended up in there.

63
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:38,002
Yeah, um, and then the- when we were making the Pokemon Snap like on rails sort of thing, the

64
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:42,504
mechanics, we like basically were like, oh let's try to make something that's like

65
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:47,507
on rails like this, because this was- when we started making this it was like when like VR was

66
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:53,470
like really peaking as a thing, so that was like kind of in our minds that we could try to take

67
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,590
advantage of that, but then like

68
00:06:55,025 --> 00:07:00,653
That didn't end up working in our ways of trying to make it not just a...

69
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:07,560
The snapping pictures, like straight up Pokemon Snap sort of thing, those mechanics that we started to develop,

70
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,003
like, didn't work with being on rails because it just like felt like you're being rushed all the

71
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:16,466
time. Like you can't like set up a trap like this because then it's like, oh wait, there's my, like,

72
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:21,730
the thing that I'm trying to do is like I'm, I'm constantly moving past it on this roller coaster

73
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,913
and that's stressful and bad. So eventually we were just like, let's take some of these like

74
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,555
observing and capturing.

75
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,600
mechanics and make a little bit more of a chill, slower, um...

76
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:44,266
Chill, Slow, and Observational. I actually really mean, we're in the tutorial right now, so you're sort of getting the guided version of what these mechanics all look like.

77
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:55,390
But, yeah, I like that description. Chill, Slow, and Observational. That feels like the best part of this experience is when you're in that mode, making connections in your own head before you actually get to play in real life.

78
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,553
Before my questioning continues, I will give shouts to folks in chat like Saggycoffee, who just said hey! Hey, back at you, Saggycoffee!

79
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:03,813
I

80
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,894
didn't recognize the pronunciation.

81
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:34,940
Anyway, yeah, so if you've got questions feel free I'll also pull up your people's stream comments.

82
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,907
It's a stream, it's interactive, we're here, like I'm just an in-between guy for y'all to chat.

83
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,769
Anyway, more about Bugs Next.

84
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,974
John, you said you introduced yourself with kind of a like, um...

85
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:49,977
Yeah, like, this game has a lot of, like, kind of if-then logic that it invites you to pick up on.

86
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,378
Like, the simple logic right here of, this animal is scared.

87
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,919
If it's nearby, you can't capture it.

88
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:57,620
Like, that's the most... one of the most basic principles.

89
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,002
And then, as you'll see, this escalates really quickly with sort of once we get past the 30-minute mark.

90
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:07,144
What, uh... what makes good if-then logic in a game like this, I guess?

91
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:11,026
Like, what guided you through the process of making all these complex interactions?

92
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:22,010
Uh, that's very, it's funny to me because like, so like, on Octodad it was very much

93
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:29,892
like very linear if then logic, uh, like the sort of stuff that I was doing and so like

94
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:35,994
I did not know what I was getting myself into starting to create these sort of like much

95
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,075
more modular, um...

96
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,774
I guess pieces of the game about the traps and the bug snacks and everything where they

97
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:48,941
interact with each other in ways that I can't always predict.

98
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:56,011
And the if-then logic of basically building rudimentary AI was not really a thing.

99
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,426
that I'd ever done before.

100
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:03,011
And it took a lot of back and forth and help.

101
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:08,316
And Kevin, both Kevin and Devin, our other programmer,

102
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:11,860
making a lot of customized tech.

103
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:21,496
stuff and features for our editor to allow me to do this sort of more like class-based

104
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:28,179
stuff instead of having everything just be like flat triggers in a level that are very simple

105
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:35,321
and straightforward. Gotcha. Kevin, is there anything you'd like to throw in about making

106
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:39,062
this kind of in-game logic work like that you think other developers might benefit from knowing?

107
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:41,963
Um...

108
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:52,493
I don't know, because we really had a lot of iteration on different layers of gameplay.

109
00:10:53,293 --> 00:11:01,095
Like, some of the stuff didn't make the cut, but I would say once we hammered in some of

110
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:07,996
the little things, it was nice to be able to just broadly apply them to all of the bugs

111
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,777
as sort of behavior.

112
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,238
You know, like being able to run to a bush and hide.

113
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:26,375
Not necessarily restricting that to one single bug, but being able to allow a group of bugs to have that sort of behavior as part of their list of actions.

114
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:31,863
I guess my follow-up question about bug behavior would be,

115
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:37,445
the game is sort of working right now, as we can see in the footage,

116
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,447
to establish a logic for the player to understand about that behavior.

117
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,608
So this is obviously a tutorialization of it,

118
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:46,709
but down the line there are some very complex interactions that...

119
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,632
Um, that the player has to comprehend in order for them to be able to proceed.

120
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,073
Um, was there anything in this process where you sort of thought about,

121
00:11:56,193 --> 00:12:00,355
okay, this is cool and fun, but can we make sure players actually understand it?

122
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:03,176
Um, I'm curious if you had any particular challenges about that,

123
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:08,119
about making sure that like your good ideas were communicated to the player.

124
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:12,100
Well, I think in a lot of those cases, we ended up trying to make sure,

125
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,242
are there multiple ways to solve this, even if they seem...

126
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,582
uh, you know, unintuitive.

127
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,763
Because people may not get

128
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:30,308
maybe the most straightforward way we were trying to to guide them with some of these behaviors, but they'll usually creatively think of

129
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:37,633
at least one alternate, and there's especially cases where, you know, maybe most of us on the team

130
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:39,194
wouldn't

131
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,595
think of that solution at all

132
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,677
and are pleasantly surprised when that shows up.

133
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:50,644
I know one for me that I guess was intentional.

134
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:56,747
There's just some bugs I didn't realize you could just hit with a slingshot out of the

135
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,028
air and they'll just go flying.

136
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:06,292
I don't think the game explicitly tells you to try to do that, but me discovering that

137
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:11,175
on my own in this game that I worked on was actually very nice.

138
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:15,857
John, is there anything you learned about trying to help players understand Bugsnax logic?

139
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:25,132
Um, let's see. Well, one thing in terms of understanding sort of like the...

140
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:32,857
giving an impression of like what the the bug snacks were like thinking was uh the addition

141
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:40,201
of the little emoji bubbles. I think that that that helps one with just like a little bit of

142
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:45,125
very minor character building and helps reinforce like of this thing.

143
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,878
Like, don't do this, this is making it afraid.

144
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:55,726
Or like, this Bugsnax is attracted to this other Bugsnax in this situation.

145
00:13:55,786 --> 00:14:03,854
Another thing was, basically, we have like, not a huge set of behaviors.

146
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:05,976
There's like, Bugsnax can shoot things.

147
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:13,898
be on fire or be frosty so it's hard to catch them. They can be sort of quick-moving and evasive

148
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:20,863
and or they can be flying those sorts of things. There may be like 12 things like that.

149
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:30,410
And then kind of like hopefully be sort of like recombining those simple behavioral building

150
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,871
blocks.

151
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:40,919
would make it so that when a player comes across a new bug snack, they have enough experience

152
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:46,185
with other bug snacks that they can sort of piece together or quickly figure out by playing

153
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:52,752
around with it and using the snack scope to get some clues about it.

154
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,934
It's not entirely new every time.

155
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:01,248
Yeah, I guess the follow-up, like, what happens after players learn about Bugsnax, you know,

156
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:04,313
when they, like, they're also, you know, like, you're caught, like, we have a task right here,

157
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:09,421
you know, use ketchup to lure Burger Beetle, I forget the real name of it, sorry, Bunger,

158
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,763
Bunger, because they're on screen!

159
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:15,686
You know, then you have to create sort of puzzles for the player, I guess, on top of that.

160
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,687
So I guess, like, then the, um...

161
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,589
The, I, I, obviously, you know, making games is an iterative, multi-layered process.

162
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,511
Like, first, you know, you have to make logic, and then you're iterating on puzzles.

163
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:29,013
But I guess, like, from there, it was like, okay, now you have, like, a chain of logic.

164
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:35,577
And I guess along with, I mean we can talk about the narrative context later because the narrative context is delightful, but you know then

165
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:41,521
when you get down to it, we're gonna see some puzzles later where it's like find these bugs and deliver them to this person

166
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:48,666
becomes a structure for how things proceed and on some level that has to work and be understandable as well

167
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:54,590
even with the logic you've described. So I guess what were your thoughts about making objectives for players in that space?

168
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:14,031
So most of the quest design, our creative director Kevin Zoon did a lot of that, but we talked a lot about trying to make it so that it's essentially a series of fetch quests.

169
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:21,596
It's like the core loop of the bug catching and questing, but we tried to mix in some other...

170
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:27,374
non-bug catching things or other mechanics that are related to interacting with the bug

171
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,316
snacks.

172
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:30,280
For example a mini-game where you have to...

173
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,843
Use the buggy ball, your little hamster ball thing, to lead a bug snack through a maze.

174
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:44,347
Just like little things like that combined with, I mean, the storytelling and characters

175
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:51,211
do most of the work, I think, of breaking up all of that, but we also wanted to have some

176
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:57,735
mechanical variety in there while still having this sort of core loop.

177
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:00,417
Kevin, do you want to add anything?

178
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:02,958
Um...

179
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:27,580
I guess I'd just say or reiterate, well, this level that we're watching especially really just sets up sort of the sequence of how a lot of the rest of the game is, where it will give you a tool presented at its most basic to get you to understand that tool, but then give you an objective where you really have to

180
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,527
Combine it in sequence with another tool in order to accomplish a specific goal.

181
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,152
And I know this level in particular went through a lot of iteration,

182
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:48,260
making sure it was at the right difficulty and the right pacing,

183
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,584
which was kind of hard because we had...

184
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:57,856
a decently wide audience of people testing this level over and over

185
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:05,144
where you get some people who were just able to breeze through this and are like

186
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:11,070
this is too easy this is a very boring tutorial but then you have other people like

187
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:20,252
really struggling, uh, you know, either to get the puzzles or to, uh, grasp the, the sort of twitchiness

188
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:27,299
that the gameplay can sometimes require. Uh, and trying to figure out how to balance that, uh,

189
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:32,543
a lot of the work really went into this, you know, sequence of the game in particular.

190
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,405
But I think that's probably going to be true of us.

191
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:40,619
A lot of games, especially games that are trying to do something different with their mechanics,

192
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:50,984
they're going to spend a very large percentage of game development making sure this level or this sequence works.

193
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:53,938
Gotcha.

194
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:56,979
Like I said, this is the GDC Twitch channel.

195
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,861
Normally we are here talking about how games get made, like trying to crack them open and

196
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,582
discuss the internal logic.

197
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,563
Why do I bounce up right now when this bunker hits me?

198
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:11,066
But we're going to bring in a fun question from chat from Kinmoku87.

199
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,747
Kinmoku87 says, they love bug snacks.

200
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,248
Did you enjoy coming up with new snacks concepts?

201
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:21,050
And most importantly, who is your favorite snack and who is your favorite breakfast?

202
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,798
I guess I'll answer first.

203
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:28,979
Yeah, go for it.

204
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,284
I feel like Bilbo is my favorite character, but maybe that's because he's very inoffensive.

205
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:48,313
I just kind of like that, you know, no matter what, he's trying to push along both the player and...

206
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:53,039
uh, the other characters in the game to sorta come back together and

207
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,021
recover from the sorta split that has occurred.

208
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:03,644
Um, my favorite bug snack is probably

209
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:07,626
the Ribblepede, uh, which you really have to

210
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,127
watch it in action to see why it's such a good bug.

211
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:17,990
Um, even aside from that, the transforms, uh, that it gives, uh...

212
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:23,501
are a bit jarring, but incredibly well done.

213
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:26,584
Uh, Jon, what is your...

214
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,086
I need to know what your favorite Bugsnax is before we continue.

215
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:31,327
Also your favorite Grumble, but you know.

216
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:33,329
Yeah, so I'm gonna go...

217
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:38,053
So, the Ribble Pete is kind of centipede rib.

218
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:41,896
Uh, my favorite is the, um...

219
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:55,718
I'm gonna say it's the Sprinklepede, which is a donut millipede, mostly because of the animation and sound design on that one,

220
00:20:55,738 --> 00:21:03,904
because when you scare it out of hiding, it runs around the whole level and it rolls around like a wheel.

221
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,645
makes like a car screeching like peel out sound if you get too close to it.

222
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,168
And it's just a it's a great looking design.

223
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:26,436
And my favorite grumpus is Chandlo. It's kind of like a a a kind.

224
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:35,232
Chill bro, which is what I aspire to someday be.

225
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:39,353
Oh man, I think we should all aspire for kind, chill brodom.

226
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,693
Okay, let's dive into...

227
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,254
There's a big...

228
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:41,314
Um...

229
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:48,476
There's a PlayStation-y part of all this that I think is worth bringing up.

230
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:53,338
Um, I played this game on PlayStation 5. It's also available on PlayStation 4.

231
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,320
It's a game that you can buy... you don't even have to buy it if you have a PlayStation, you know...

232
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,121
I forget, uh, a PlayStation subscription. It's on PS Plus.

233
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,942
God, I forget my name of the service. I use the service, so...

234
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:05,803
This is very bad hosting of me.

235
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,844
But, um, uh, this is a game that is launching with the PS5.

236
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:14,005
It has some interesting features that take advantage of the controller, the new haptics.

237
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,446
Um, it also, because it's launching on PS5, it means you guys were developing for new hardware

238
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,287
before a lot of other developers were.

239
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:21,747
What was kind of that experience?

240
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:26,688
Um, and, uh, Octodad was also kind of an early PS4 game too,

241
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:30,910
so it seems like Young Horses has gotten two opportunities to sort of be part of the indie launch.

242
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,191
for Sony's new consoles.

243
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:37,295
Is there anything you guys have learned about this experience that was particular...

244
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:40,577
I don't know, like what do you think other developers should know about making games for this console?

245
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:46,142
Well, pleasantly, working on PS5 was

246
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,466
kind of identical to working on PS4.

247
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,829
We had put together our own tech

248
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,272
in order to do Octodad, and...

249
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:04,241
Basically after that, we kind of went with the decision,

250
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:09,263
well, we already ported it to, you know, like 11 platforms or whatever,

251
00:23:10,244 --> 00:23:12,384
let's try to get another game out,

252
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,706
you know, while this generation happens.

253
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,788
So me personally, I was anticipating we would release

254
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,930
this game before the next generation.

255
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,091
Which we, I guess, kind of made it.

256
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:46,016
Being a launch title for PS5 was pretty beneficial just because it gave us sort of like a talking point for when we announced our game.

257
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:49,117
Plus we still had the PlayStation 4 version.

258
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,412
that we had been working on this whole time.

259
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:58,636
As far as sort of the development differences,

260
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,741
I do think coming into this,

261
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:08,765
the controller was absolutely my favorite part to play with

262
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,146
in terms of development.

263
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:16,471
We ended up using FMOD for audio

264
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,995
and Seth, who did our

265
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:29,051
uh sounds and it ended up getting assigned doing all the the sort of haptic feedback and vibrations

266
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:34,473
for the game through that system and i'm not sure we really don't have any like

267
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:42,843
external game development experience. I can't say what games did before this, but a cool thing we

268
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:50,748
were able to do was with the audio, sort of just use that to feed into other systems. For instance,

269
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:56,272
the animations of the characters are all flapping jaw animations. It's just all driven by

270
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:01,875
amplitude coming out of FMOD. And now the controller vibrations are also just...

271
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:09,330
audio sent out from fmod. Seth can just hook up a sound and route it straight to the controller

272
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,831
as a vibration.

273
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:17,676
And on top of that, the work that went into the PS5 version,

274
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:19,857
wherever to put into the PS4 version,

275
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:24,961
where it may not have the cool rumble features,

276
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:29,824
but we can just track all that audio that was meant to be routed to the PlayStation controller,

277
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:35,588
and reroute it to just the controller rumble amplitude on other platforms.

278
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,650
So that was my...

279
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:47,906
favorite part uh the controller also had some cool stuff we did with the the triggers as well

280
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:56,032
just sort of trying to make those feel different uh in terms of like oh uh when you've got the

281
00:25:56,072 --> 00:26:01,657
scope open uh one of the triggers feels more like a clicking a shutter button

282
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:03,798
and then

283
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:12,995
Because I was sort of enamored with the controller, we also threw in controller sounds.

284
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:20,218
So like capturing the bug, the controller then speaks the bug's name right after capture it.

285
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,479
I wish we could have captured that for the stream, but you can't. Unless I have my phone

286
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,440
recording it, you can't. Like I'm just sitting here capturing bugs and it's just like,

287
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,421
like, bonger! Like just pops out of my hand. I'm like, okay.

288
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:34,683
Yeah. No, that one, that one really gets people.

289
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:35,063
Yeah.

290
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:40,475
I liked that you brought up the controller because I'm playing a couple other PS5 games

291
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:40,995
and I agree.

292
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,556
This thing is just such a cool device.

293
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:48,397
There's weird little ways that even though you kind of don't think these things are essential

294
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:51,338
for a game, they certainly make things feel really cool.

295
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:56,819
The fact that there's these special vibrations and the pressure, the different haptic pressure

296
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,839
you can get on the triggers.

297
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:09,274
We've sort of heard, like, developers, you know, you guys launched this game first on PS5, you mentioned Octodad got ported, so you've worked with other consoles.

298
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:14,401
We have been wondering, from talking to some of the developers, about...

299
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:21,326
Like, should developers like put extra time and effort, how much extra time and effort does it take to make things for this controller?

300
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:27,091
Um, what are your kind of thoughts about like what the payoff is for developers who are making games for multiple platforms

301
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:31,134
to be paying attention to the controller and putting work into making it feel special?

302
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:38,920
Um, the controller specifically, I think, is absolutely worth the effort.

303
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:45,203
But I guess, in terms of like, platform specific features, it was one of the things that took the least amount of time.

304
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:53,568
Uh, because there were certainly other things that we had to learn to use or to rethink.

305
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:58,171
Uh, but, I don't know. I think...

306
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,773
I think the controller is certainly...

307
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:09,440
A thing that adds an extra layer to playing the game that really didn't take that much

308
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,022
time to do compared to a lot of other things we've put in.

309
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:16,723
Um, ooh, uh...

310
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:17,083
Me?

311
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:18,324
Oh, that's interesting.

312
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:22,247
Excel Kobayashi would like to know, and you may not have an answer to this, but it's worth asking.

313
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,108
Ask away, I guess.

314
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:26,230
Does the PS5-style rumble work with the PS5 controller on PC?

315
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:32,835
Uh, Excel Kobayashi, I can answer part of that before they do, which is Steam just announced that the controller is supported,

316
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:36,478
but the special haptic features aren't being supported right now.

317
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:37,579
They're coming down the line.

318
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:43,853
Uh, but I don't know. Have you guys worked with it on PC at all? Do you know if it's gonna be like, um, as functional there?

319
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,654
I-I don't know anything beyond what I just said.

320
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,856
No, I read the same thing as you, and I don't know...

321
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:50,956
how...

322
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,037
uh...

323
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:58,599
you know, that gets implemented across different games, but...

324
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:58,820
uh...

325
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,702
I will say I wish, uh, Windows had better controller support.

326
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,263
They basically, you know, support an Xbox controller.

327
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:16,044
Or you use direct input and you have a lot of different under-the-hood hacks if you want other features to work.

328
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:26,193
And I know Steam has been doing a very good job of gaining access to a lot of these controller features and just automatically supporting it on their platform.

329
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:39,598
I wish it wasn't just a Steam-driven thing, but it'll be interesting to see if they actually do get the PS5-style rumble working on PC, because that would be pretty...

330
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:41,118
Pretty nice.

331
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:41,518
Yeah.

332
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,843
John, before we move off the controller, is there anything you'd like to weigh in with

333
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:50,428
about working on the PS5, I don't know, either working on the PS5 or working on the specific

334
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:54,532
controller, the new DualShock, that you particularly enjoyed in this process?

335
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:58,416
I know like you said it was your sound guy doing a lot of it, but if there are any thoughts

336
00:29:58,436 --> 00:29:59,677
you have, I'd love to hear them.

337
00:29:59,697 --> 00:29:59,938
Uh, yeah.

338
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:01,019
Yeah, like, yeah.

339
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,961
Like, I, like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

340
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:13,025
I didn't really have much direct input, but a post-release thing that players have noticed

341
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:22,686
that I think is worth mentioning is that the game help has been really nice for people,

342
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:27,647
having these little video hints about how to catch a particular bug snack.

343
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,308
Anyway, I'll be here if you need me.

344
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:41,408
We had a lot of help from Sony on actually generating all of that, but that is a thing

345
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:48,791
that I think, you know, I imagine in general that's a thing that developers are gonna have

346
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:55,233
to do if they want to support that, and I think that players are going to like it a lot, or like,

347
00:30:55,313 --> 00:31:00,555
at least for games like ours, like, it's like, oh, okay, next time I want to keep in the back of my

348
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:01,495
head that, like, uh...

349
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,872
If, like, maybe we're going to have to do this and it's going to be a lot of work, but it might be worth it.

350
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:15,258
Um, to- to- will probably be worth it, or at least it'll be a new expectation from- from players that it's there.

351
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:15,898
Um.

352
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,470
Yeah, people liked it a lot.

353
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:27,854
For, like, Bugsnax, I've seen people say that it is a particularly good use of that feature.

354
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:29,695
Yeah, I guess does that, um...

355
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:32,157
We're all talking kind of abstract here, because it seems like...

356
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:36,119
I mean, it's so hard to predict how these things will play out before they do.

357
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:41,001
I know, like, it's not accurate for me to say this influenced how puzzles got made in this game,

358
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:44,383
because no one makes puzzles with the expectations of how the guides will be.

359
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:51,528
But does it kind of help you as a designer to go, okay, I can push the boundaries on a puzzle if I'm confident that players...

360
00:31:51,568 --> 00:32:03,597
Some players will want to participate in that challenge, and others will have the ability to quickly and efficiently get a leg up, you know, and sort of without hurting the other player.

361
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:08,300
Like having that little bit of... like there is a crutch out there that players can rely on that's in the...

362
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,943
It's simple to understand, and to learn on mechanisms behind the molecular dissemination of snack-dev-ators.

363
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,926
This is the snack-de-vator. Feed me strabby. Poke snack-de-vator in foot. Foot turns into strabby. Understand?

364
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:42,063
I never really wanted really tough puzzles, I wanted a little bit of the expressive,

365
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:45,205
you've got different ways to do this, and sometimes it's tricky.

366
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:54,573
So for me it's more like, ah, this fills in the gaps in my bad design sometimes.

367
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,777
It feels like a safety net for me, so that's kind of similar to what you're talking about.

368
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:07,958
Yeah, if I was trying to make a hard puzzle game, yes, but in general that's not what I'm trying to do anyway.

369
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:17,608
I think the use case that I saw when we had started first implementing it was

370
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:23,794
this would be amazing for parents with children that...

371
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:29,544
Maybe can't get past a certain part and are stuck and are asking,

372
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,565
why won't this game do this?

373
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:36,847
Uh, and the parent then may come in and see,

374
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,168
well, I have no idea where you are.

375
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:40,528
I haven't been playing this game at all,

376
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,469
but they can jump into game help,

377
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,310
uh, and either, you know,

378
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,312
help them, uh, play through it or play through it for their child.

379
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:54,574
Um, and even aside from that type of relation,

380
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:05,104
I think players who haven't been playing the game in a while may want to return to any

381
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:12,769
sort of game and see, hey I've got these activities active, this is where I left off, but I have

382
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,650
no idea what I was supposed to be doing.

383
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:22,095
And while we try to give those instructions in the game, sometimes having that extra video

384
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:28,302
instruction can just sort of help them get the ball rolling again.

385
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:34,405
And I do think that's kind of what Sony was trying to go for with the activity cards in general,

386
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:43,789
was to keep players being able to move through a game and not just sort of languish on a specific

387
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,950
spot that they may have happened to get caught up on.

388
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:56,415
The activity cards though, I don't know if they're getting talked about as much as I think they ought to, but...

389
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:07,738
One thing I wish we had done, that I want to say that Spider-Man has done, is have specific activity cards that you can't access the content in the game otherwise.

390
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:12,960
You have to go through the activity card to do, you know, the singular activity.

391
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,540
And it's, you know...

392
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:21,156
completely unrelated to the rest of the main game story, but

393
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:30,158
for me, either continuing with Bugsnax or our next game, I'd love to do just weird non-canon

394
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:34,659
activities that you jump in where we don't have to worry about like does this flow with the game,

395
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,121
it's just sort of this, you know, limited thing to do and that's where I see

396
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:45,501
A lot of cool moments coming from the activities cards in the future.

397
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:52,427
A. You have made me now I have to go back in because I'm playing Miles Morales right now and I need to go check out those activity cards because I did not know that.

398
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:56,071
And B. I thought I read an article there's something about pigeons.

399
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,611
I did do a pigeon quest.

400
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:07,278
The first game had a pigeon's word big thing, but we can talk about Spider-Man and pigeons another time.

401
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:11,342
B, that's so... it's weird because it's the only PlayStation that's doing it, right?

402
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:15,386
I don't know, like we already have like content that's platform exclusive.

403
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:20,090
That is a thing that all, you know, developers shell out money for, but if it's gonna be

404
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,631
that way, like I do appreciate...

405
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:26,936
I'm excited by the idea of developers being able to make something special for people

406
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:31,440
who are paying attention, and only a few people see it, but it's the ones who like check the

407
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,881
activity cards and go, hey, wait a minute.

408
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:36,364
Like, that excites me because I like it, I feel like it makes relationships between...

409
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:41,308
players and developers like a little more concrete like you can sort of

410
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:45,571
subsection out a group of people who will go that far as opposed to the people who are like

411
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:49,093
oh this is like like you know like you can help to sort of categorize your fans

412
00:36:49,174 --> 00:37:01,062
I guess. For my next bug snacky question. There's also we skip over it there's a

413
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:04,665
interview system in this game where after a character you successfully get

414
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,726
characters back to town.

415
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:10,207
Like you said, you mentioned earlier, you know, it's from another Summer Camp prototype,

416
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:15,028
this whole notion of getting a community back together, like helping people solve their problems.

417
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:22,389
There is kind of this neat, like, oh, like players acquiring facts and piecing together those facts to do information,

418
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:28,090
which it's delightful that this is a game where you're a journalist because as an alleged journalist,

419
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,551
it's nice to play a game where I'm the hero for once instead of the side character who gets punched, like in Mass Effect 2.

420
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:41,179
I gotta say, what were sort of your thoughts about making a game where instead of just having a story that...

421
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:46,885
And there is kind of a straightforward story to it, and there are dialogue trees which are more conventional,

422
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:50,929
but this kind of like interviewing people, like it's low-key interrogation,

423
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:53,992
like the information that you get from these interviews needs to be, you know...

424
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:58,834
Like, what were... how did that sort of... I know this is maybe more of a question for your creative director,

425
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:02,776
but I'm curious what thoughts you guys had about making a system like that in a game when you're

426
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:07,398
already bogged down with, like, so much Bugsnax logic to also have this interview system logic.

427
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:19,782
Well, as we were playtesting, we would continuously get feedback that...

428
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:26,130
It was unclear who the player was or like why they were,

429
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,472
what their motivation was and things like that.

430
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:33,415
So we like slowly layered in, you know, like the sort of like opening scene

431
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:37,118
with your with your editor and then

432
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:41,442
the the interviewing mechanic and.

433
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:49,848
Yeah, so I guess we just wanted that sort of narrative frame for.

434
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:52,988
for who the player is.

435
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:57,691
And I think Kevin could talk a bit more about the iteration on the interview mechanic,

436
00:38:57,771 --> 00:39:03,254
because that was for a long time kind of tedious and not super...

437
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:09,598
It's like, okay, this is what we're trying to use to solve this problem of not knowing who the...

438
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,302
It's like the main reminder throughout the game that you are a journalist and why you're there.

439
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,435
But for a long time it was like, it took a while to get it right.

440
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:19,895
Yeah.

441
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:22,056
Kevin, do you wanna, do you have anything to throw in?

442
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:22,317
Heh.

443
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:28,420
Well I'll just say like, yeah the interview system I would say came in late.

444
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:34,884
And so a lot of things about our game were a bit scopey during development.

445
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:40,308
But I would say doing a 3D object journal...

446
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:49,141
Uh, imprinting the UI on that, uh, all while not having a, uh, a UI editor.

447
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,363
I had to code all the UI in this game.

448
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:53,504
Uh, yeah.

449
00:39:54,164 --> 00:39:55,925
And not having a UI artist for years.

450
00:39:56,386 --> 00:40:07,592
Yeah, I was about to say, uh, not having a few, sort of, key people that were, you know, kind of the driving force behind the interview system.

451
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:08,113
Like, uh...

452
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:15,824
We had Bryce come in about midway through the project, and then late in the project,

453
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:22,169
along with other people on the team, just sort of finally hammered out, like,

454
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,371
okay, we need to make this sequence actually look good.

455
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:30,597
It needs to be presented well, because otherwise, like,

456
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:36,702
the whole driving force of the story is that you're the journalist, so, like, if the interviews...

457
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,888
Just sort of act like the dialogue system, then, you know, what's the point?

458
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:43,989
But then of course we had...

459
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,551
We brought in Justine as a UI artist to help us

460
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:53,591
dress up all of the

461
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,912
the UI in addition to that to actually make

462
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:58,893
all this UI shine.

463
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:03,354
And then of course Seth's music and audio.

464
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:10,256
It helped make the sort of sequence kind of, you know, defining moments for the player

465
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:20,404
and sort of giving them a chance to, you know, narratively pick out, like, what is it that is driving these characters.

466
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:30,552
And, I don't know, it really helps create good moments and sort of sets the mood going forward for each of these characters.

467
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:40,415
I agree with that. I appreciate being in a game where being a journalist is just not an incentive for the main character to punch you.

468
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:46,756
Anyway, I also love Mass Effect 2 to be clear. It's one of my favorite games.

469
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:56,419
I'm not that hung up about it. It's just you guys, well the second you guys put out a trailer that showed you're a journalist, every game journalist I knew collectively went, oh no.

470
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:59,260
Like, not out of like fear, but just more out of like...

471
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:05,108
Oh no, it's us. Like, we're the hero. It's a specific thing.

472
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:09,650
For folks in chat, we only have a few more minutes to get questions in.

473
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:16,274
We would love to hear your questions if you have them, but if you also just want to hang out and admire the bugsnax, we're just happy to have you here.

474
00:42:16,294 --> 00:42:22,757
I am going to go ahead and ask one of my final questions, which is...

475
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:28,462
I know this would be more of a creative director question, but I am curious as to what your guys' thoughts are.

476
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:35,109
Bugsnax has a really interesting tone, where it's cute and also horrifying.

477
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:41,775
Like, there's low-key, it's low-key like the people transforming is kind of body-horror-y.

478
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:45,318
But it's also adorable.

479
00:42:45,538 --> 00:42:52,003
The plot is, on the one hand, like, it's cute and it's about an island with all these grumpuses and all these cute names.

480
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:56,106
On the other hand, I kind of get the vibe that there's something kind of serious going on.

481
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:01,549
I haven't seen the late game yet, so there's even other things that I have heard about but not seen for myself yet.

482
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:03,931
But I'm just kind of like...

483
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:10,593
Like this is such a specific intersection like this is sort of like it's not cutesy like a PBS show

484
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,914
It's not horror like David Lynch and yet so many people

485
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,315
I know when they saw this game were just like low-key like

486
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:23,057
What am I looking at like like this specific intersection of these two things that is perfectly natural and also like completely

487
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,698
What wrong like like how did you sort of feel as?

488
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:29,879
Creative people like working on a game that had this kind of tone

489
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:36,265
That is both of those things, like cute and maybe a little horrifying.

490
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:43,447
Well, I mean, I think it really just comes from like.

491
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,208
Like we are a very like collaborative team,

492
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:51,409
like we probably do a little bit too much of like everyone being

493
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:56,150
in everyone else's business, you know, like before the pandemic,

494
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:01,212
we were all in one room all the time and we all have like

495
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:02,372
there's a pretty.

496
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:12,185
Interesting range of tastes and influences on the team.

497
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:22,369
We all agreed that the intersection of what everyone likes is in the adventure time zone,

498
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:27,431
where there's serious real stuff, and it's also silly and it's also cute.

499
00:44:28,152 --> 00:44:31,073
So it's good that we're doing this.

500
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:37,206
We're able to actually get all that in there, you know, and we, you know, we have

501
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:45,551
influences that range all the way from like, you know, cute Muppets and stuff like that,

502
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:52,975
to like, you know, a thing that I always was like, was in the back of my head was like,

503
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:59,119
like, Apocalypse Now, you know, like, like someone looking for this missing person and

504
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,840
like, slowly descending into this.

505
00:45:02,023 --> 00:45:03,344
the new headlines, new voice.

506
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:04,344
That's the magic of voice.

507
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,085
Now my creative piece fails,

508
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,346
can't help but love you.

509
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:08,667
I know I'm flowing, I'm flowing.

510
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:08,987
Mmm-hmm.

511
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:09,427
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

512
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:09,727
Aa-a-a-ah!

513
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:10,188
La-la-la-la-la-la!

514
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:10,588
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

515
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:10,668
Yep.

516
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:11,969
I need you to turn it up, darling!

517
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:36,749
Yeah, would you like to throw anything in with that?

518
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:37,289
Kevin?

519
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:39,290
I don't know.

520
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,712
Certainly there were times where this game was brighter and there were definitely times

521
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:47,393
where this game was darker in terms of tone.

522
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:56,116
I think we were trying to find that kind of balance where it could still be for ages that

523
00:45:56,276 --> 00:45:59,417
could sort of competently play our game to the end.

524
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:08,077
I know a lot of us go back and we'll sometimes re-watch, you know, the family films that

525
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:14,040
were actually quite dark and there's still even some now, it's not just what we grew

526
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,480
up with.

527
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:25,024
So being able to take those sort of messages and put them through narratively through the

528
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:29,466
characters because not everything's going well for them and you're trying to help them

529
00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:29,746
through.

530
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:31,311
They're troubles.

531
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:38,073
But a lot of children's media doesn't shy away from that.

532
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:42,914
It's able to present it in a way that I think kids understand.

533
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:47,675
And, you know, I think older people sometimes look at kids and are like,

534
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:49,956
oh, they're going to be horrified by this.

535
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:52,416
Or, but I don't know.

536
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:56,778
I think kids probably see a lot more horrifying things.

537
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:03,413
that I don't think most of what happens in this game phases them.

538
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:08,879
Like if you turn a character into a giant apple or whatever,

539
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:12,363
it's not going to phase them as much as an adult who's like,

540
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:14,566
that looks weird.

541
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:19,040
Maybe it's just like, I feel like maybe it's like as adults, like there's just more...

542
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:20,241
Uh...

543
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:21,242
I...

544
00:47:21,962 --> 00:47:24,163
I am scared of more things than as an adult.

545
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:24,764
Well, I don't know.

546
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:28,966
Like, when I was a kid, I was scared of tornadoes, but I thought tornadoes were like these grumpy

547
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:30,647
looking monsters that lived in the basement.

548
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:31,607
Uh...

549
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:35,249
Not the actual windstorms that plagued us when I lived in Minnesota for a year.

550
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:41,681
As an adult, I have a mild case of tryptophobia, where if you show me a thing with too many holes,

551
00:47:42,441 --> 00:47:45,283
I'm bothered. As a kid, I would have been like, whatever, like, tryptophobia.

552
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:49,706
But like, I saw one tree when I was like 14 or something, and now that tree is with me for life.

553
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:51,407
Impossibly,

554
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:55,550
impossibly, that is definitely TMI, but...

555
00:47:57,832 --> 00:48:03,921
I, uh, uh, Kevin and, and, and John, thank you so much for joining us today.

556
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:06,565
Thank you for bringing us the wonderful world of Bugsnax.

557
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,788
Uh, we're going to wrap things up here.

558
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:12,173
Uh, Blader Coyote, uh, I'll, I'll address you in a second.

559
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:12,453
Um.

560
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:17,856
For those of you who are new to the GDC Twitch channel, this is a place where we interview developers,

561
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:21,317
talk about the games they're making, give you a chance to answer questions about them.

562
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,918
And GDC in general is all about the art and business of making games.

563
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:29,700
It's not just programming, it's design. It's not just design, it's the UI art.

564
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,782
It's not just the UI art, it's how do you sell and market games.

565
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:33,982
And sometimes we're talking about that.

566
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:37,524
We try to here and on gamasutra.com, that is what we are talking about.

567
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:39,705
So if you want to stick around, we'd love it if you click the follow button.

568
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:45,746
If you're a game developer, Talks for GEC 2021, you can submit your talks now.

569
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:49,787
Head over to our website, which is down at the bottom.

570
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:53,168
Trying to point... There we go. That direction on your screen.

571
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:55,689
You can go and look up information about submitting a talk.

572
00:48:56,949 --> 00:49:02,490
And Blader Coyote is going to ask the question that is most likely to get us all in trouble with Sony.

573
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:06,251
Can you guys confirm that the protagonist is Peter Parker on vacation?

574
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:09,954
Is the protagonist's name Grumpus Garp, I guess?

575
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:11,495
Huh.

576
00:49:13,156 --> 00:49:13,276
Uh...

577
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,439
It seems like no. Seems like the answer is no.

578
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah, I guess that's a no.

579
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:20,902
No comment.

580
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:23,523
No comment? Okay, we're gonna take that.

581
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:26,245
Um, with that, we're gonna end a little early over here.

582
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:29,967
And thank you all so much for doing this. I hope you all are doing well.

583
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:35,028
It is a pandemic plague year of many scary things and I hope everyone just stays inside,

584
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:40,369
wears a mask, and continues to keep each other alive.

585
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:43,650
This is the first stream we've had where we didn't have time to talk about making games remotely

586
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,691
in 2020 and I would have loved to, you know, pick your guys' brains about it,

587
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:51,572
but we spent too much time admiring the adorable foxes,

588
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:54,153
which I don't think you can actually spend too much time doing.

589
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:56,653
With that, have a good day everyone. Bye!

590
00:49:59,166 --> 00:49:59,473
Thank you.
