1
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:08,459
Good afternoon, welcome.

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:12,552
My name is Henke, and I'm a freelance composer for mobile

3
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,775
and VR games and films.

4
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:16,885
In the past, I also had co-composing credits

5
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:19,688
as an additional composer for some of these nice games.

6
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:23,430
And I wanted to share with you the findings

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,971
of the annual Game Audio Survey for 2017,

8
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:28,214
sponsored by the Game Audio Network Guild

9
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:29,895
and Game Sound Con.

10
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:33,638
We're very grateful to Brian Schmidt

11
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:36,300
for doing these amazing surveys.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,342
72% of the game composers also create sound effects.

13
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:43,546
50% of all game composers also provide audio integration.

14
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,989
So this is my message to all emerging composers

15
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,812
in the audience, and I mean this from my heart.

16
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:53,875
Learn sound design to expand your job possibilities.

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,539
Also, learn sound design to improve your own skills

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,541
and craft as a composer for games.

19
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:04,306
Having sound design skills makes you a more valuable collaborator

20
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:05,666
to game developers.

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,367
You could get in-house jobs and build the career more organically,

22
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,088
starting out as a sound designer for a game company

23
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:16,008
and then gradually composing as well.

24
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,209
Many sound designers have full-time staff positions.

25
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,950
On another hand, most composers are freelancers,

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,210
unless they're also sound designers.

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,175
So, I started out as a composer, so I learned all of this.

28
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,618
Each game has many people working on the sound.

29
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,521
Some may work on weapons, vehicles, combat, or foley.

30
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:41,284
Others may work on ambiences, dialogue, editing, implementation.

31
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:45,969
It's common for a game company to have a few staff audio specialists

32
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,372
and also farm out other audio tasks to freelancers.

33
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:52,774
Most indie games use only one composer.

34
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:56,035
The composer is brought in for a few months at the end

35
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:59,257
or the last few months of the development cycle.

36
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:03,859
I wanted to tell you a joke from the old world.

37
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,440
A son asks his son, what are you going

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,681
to become when you grow up?

39
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,762
And the son answers, I'm going to become a doctor.

40
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,763
And the father says, become a dentist.

41
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,704
People have 32 teeth and only one heart.

42
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:25,771
Most opportunities for emerging composers are in a mobile and casual field,

43
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,434
where having all audio skills, music, sound design, voiceover, editing,

44
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:33,377
audio middleware in implementation could help you land a great job.

45
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,280
This is why I encourage all of you to consider this path.

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,464
Another crucial reason to learn sound design is this.

47
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:44,648
Learning sound design improves your own craft and skills as a composer.

48
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,652
So this is, I'm speaking from my personal experience,

49
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:51,435
as a composer working on fantasy content where music, sound design,

50
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:55,319
and voiceover always dovetail and always mesh together,

51
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,021
it makes you a better game composer.

52
00:02:57,462 --> 00:03:00,745
to really know how to create diegetic and ambient sound design,

53
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:04,688
because it's all frequencies and it all comes through the ears.

54
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:08,852
By learning sound design, you learn how to compose around the frequencies

55
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:11,875
of diegetic sound and tonal ambiences.

56
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:17,761
You practice scoring hits and jump scares in horror or genre titles

57
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,884
without the music smearing what the sound design is already doing.

58
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:26,886
On the other hand, the music is going to soar in the theme, the menu, the boss battles,

59
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:30,788
obviously, and action cinematics without dialogue.

60
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:32,409
It was a real epiphany for me.

61
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,450
I learned this from my developer friends.

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,152
Game developers approach the hierarchy of audio like this.

63
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,833
The voiceover is primary because it tells the story.

64
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,373
Diegetic sound effects.

65
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:47,295
or sound effects directly related to what's visible on the screen are secondary.

66
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:52,637
Emotional sound design, this is kind of a loose term, is the non-diegetic such as drones,

67
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:58,040
ambiences, which is anything that makes you feel something, is also secondary.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,541
And music, the diegetic music, the non-diegetic music is tertiary.

69
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:05,762
So, in summary, I wanted...

70
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,483
You'll get staff jobs in game audio,

71
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:11,584
in game studio as a sound designer and implementer first,

72
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,404
and later as a composer.

73
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,905
And also, deep understanding of the sound in games

74
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,646
makes you definitely a greater game composer.

75
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:21,987
I wanted to briefly discuss one of my composing assignments.

76
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:26,148
I scored this Mummy VR game that is an arcade game.

77
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,429
And it's a shooter with zombies.

78
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,191
Genre projects always have a very elaborate...

79
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:36,034
By genre projects I mean horror, science fiction, fantasy, which I love and adore.

80
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,816
So these projects always have a very elaborate soundscape.

81
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:42,879
You have monster roars, you have fantasy creatures, voices, death,

82
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,681
sound of imaginary lands, interiors, dungeons, and so on.

83
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:49,323
So when scoring horror, I learned the hard way

84
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:55,187
to very carefully select the frequencies, timbres, instruments, and density of my music.

85
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:00,251
The Mummy VR is an eight minute experience.

86
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,332
It had helicopter diegetic sound

87
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,733
for the first four minutes throughout,

88
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,835
then a continued barrage of machine gun sound effects

89
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,316
for the next four minutes.

90
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:12,478
The game had a continuous voiceover for all eight minutes,

91
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,540
and my job as a composer was to figure out

92
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,941
a musical solution that would dovetail

93
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,423
with all sound design and the voiceover,

94
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,044
and I rescored the game twice

95
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,045
because my first approach failed.

96
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,687
It was too busy and too noisy and too orchestral.

97
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:32,289
So, my second approach was iconic sound for the characters, which were special forces and zombies,

98
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,410
and iconic sound for the genre.

99
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,714
And by iconic I mean a basic, like a basic signifier that instantly will telegraph to you who the characters are.

100
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:47,917
So the second big challenge in VR is that all the sound comes directly from headphones,

101
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,718
and usually they're crappy headphones in your brain.

102
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:52,439
In arcades, these are conventional headphones.

103
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,422
So the music needs to convey the emotions in a simple arrangement

104
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,344
that's not too busy, not too complicated, and won't burn your ears.

105
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:04,426
So this is how I approached the special forces without melody,

106
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,087
and with minimal chord changes.

107
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,148
with electronic arrangement that we associate

108
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:09,928
with like the special forces.

109
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,089
So I'm going to play the first half,

110
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,929
well, there's no video, you'll see the still image,

111
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,430
and you'll hear the music also dubbed

112
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,890
with the sound design and voiceover.

113
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,231
All strike team personnel report to your fields.

114
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,552
Target has been spotted.

115
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:27,454
Briefed on the target.

116
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:26,362
And the second half of the game was shooting at zombies and a lot of

117
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,926
creatures, a lot of noise. This is just a still image and I'll play just a little

118
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,570
bit of the second half of the game with the zombie shooting.

119
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:10,772
Because of the machine gun, I took out all percussion and really only had the pads and the brass,

120
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:14,095
because otherwise it would compete and it won't be good.

121
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,319
I wish you much success in your careers. Good luck and enjoy the rest of the panel. Thanks.

122
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,434
Hi, folks.

123
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,234
So I'm next, Bonnie Brogovich.

124
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,635
My talk, I have titled, I Have a Particular Set of Skills,

125
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,555
also known as How to Be Yourself

126
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,515
and Embrace Your Background.

127
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:39,956
And first off, I wanted to say that I was inspired

128
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,876
to take this twist on my micro talk

129
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:45,757
based on the results of being part of a panel

130
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,237
that was in 2016 titled,

131
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,017
Everyone at this Conference is a Fraud.

132
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,118
It was me, Stefan Schuetz, Laura Cartman,

133
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,678
Verun Nair, Austin Wintory, and D.B. Cooper.

134
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:59,843
And it was really inspiring to be on a panel of so many experts in the field who I personally admire,

135
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:06,548
and to hear that they also had fears about not being prepared for the industry that they're currently working in,

136
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:11,232
and the things that they encountered getting into the industry, and how to conquer them.

137
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,894
So I wanted to put a particular twist on it.

138
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:16,176
And first off, I kind of want to just quickly get a raise of hands.

139
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:20,981
Who here in the audience came from a non-direct-to-game path, or...

140
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:26,826
had a completely different career before going into the industry, something not game related.

141
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,574
Awesome, that's what I was hoping for.

142
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:34,156
So either if you're coming from a different industry

143
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:39,080
and hopping in or you're completely new to games

144
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,022
and you're trying to figure out how you can fit

145
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,644
into this wacky world, you know,

146
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,885
we'll enter a normal scenario that many of us have gone to.

147
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,067
You go to LinkedIn or you hear about a job posting

148
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,668
from someone and they're told,

149
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,490
oh yeah, you'd be perfect for this game opening.

150
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,312
Please go to it, check it out.

151
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,153
And you're like, sure, how bad could this be?

152
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,694
and you click on the apply now or the web link

153
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,474
and you start to read all of these descriptions

154
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:04,535
for crazy job titles and departmental needs

155
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,616
and must have 14 AAA products and must know why's

156
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,236
and all these other words are flashing at you

157
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,556
and suddenly you're like, oh my god,

158
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:12,557
I have no idea what I'm doing.

159
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:14,417
I don't have 14 titles under my belt.

160
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,858
I didn't go to a school for a degree in game audio

161
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:19,118
for most of us.

162
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,298
Like in my age group or older,

163
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,059
there weren't game audio degrees.

164
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,059
Heck, there sometimes weren't even music tech degrees

165
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,799
when we went to school.

166
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:30,624
So, it's like, what do you do when you're told, like,

167
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,666
yes, this is the field you wanna go to,

168
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,507
but you don't have a direct path?

169
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,789
And I wanna just assure a lot of you that,

170
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,450
especially those of you who have succeeded

171
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,731
in hopping into the industry,

172
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:42,673
not straight from a game path in the beginning,

173
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:45,996
just first, keep calm, take a deep breath,

174
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,038
know you're not alone, and...

175
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:52,780
I feel like many of us like to say that everything we learn,

176
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,802
especially bizarro quotes, we all learn from the movies of things to live by.

177
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,704
And I find Liam Neeson is a really good example.

178
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:02,706
Because we've all heard this quote, like, I have a very particular set of skills,

179
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,628
right, from Taken, and it's my bad impression.

180
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:10,333
And I want to remind all of us that we all have very unique sets of skills,

181
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:15,397
and we gather these skills through life and through all of the different experiences we have.

182
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:21,102
And often we forget that those skills can apply to dream jobs that we have,

183
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:23,544
or jobs that we don't even know exist yet.

184
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,447
So whenever you look at these giant lists of skills that are demanded for jobs,

185
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:29,809
especially wacky new careers in the game industry,

186
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,811
it's like, how do I gather all of these?

187
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:35,128
techniques, how do I gather this experience?

188
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,250
And you may be gathering it right now and you don't even know it.

189
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,672
You just need to start to learn to rethink your brain process and

190
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:46,614
know that you learn something every day if you pay attention.

191
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:46,794
And

192
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,754
You learn by doing, and often I think we forget this,

193
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,076
especially when we're not kids anymore.

194
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,439
We forget that we're all constantly learning.

195
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:59,465
And we learn it from every aspect of the day,

196
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:02,469
every job we've ever had, every mentor,

197
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:05,173
every experience, personally, before I worked in games.

198
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,755
I had many different jobs.

199
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,337
I came from, I was a fall spot operator,

200
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,839
boom operator for a while, I'm a chorus junkie,

201
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,282
I know a lot of people around GDC actually are.

202
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,463
Sing-along musician, stage manager, teaching assistant,

203
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,885
I've done multimedia, I do puppetry.

204
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,768
And I can assure you that I use skills

205
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,689
from every single one of these jobs every day

206
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:26,990
in my current career in game audio.

207
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,472
And you may think, oh God, that is crazy.

208
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,913
Do any of these relate to games?

209
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,016
Those of you in the audience who may have come from stage,

210
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,597
you're like, well, this is obvious.

211
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,319
For those of you who are not,

212
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,542
I'm gonna analyze one of my biggest career patterns

213
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,644
before I worked in games, which was a 10-year sprint

214
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:47,327
working as a touring stage manager in Pittsburgh

215
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,029
for opera companies, ballet,

216
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,511
and a bunch of modern art installations.

217
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:57,397
And while working as a stage manager, I acquired many different types of skills

218
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:01,502
that I realized later, when I eventually got in the game industry, were actually valid.

219
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:03,784
So I'm going to analyze two different sets of skills.

220
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:07,829
For those unfamiliar, there are hard skills and soft skills that you acquire.

221
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:11,610
Hard skills are practical knowledge you learn hands-on.

222
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,551
Software, handling rigging, things that actually

223
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,451
were hard skills that I worked on in theater

224
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:20,732
that I use in games, where I learned a ton about software,

225
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:23,953
spreadsheet management, organization.

226
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:26,033
Whenever you're working as a touring stage manager,

227
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,574
you have to manage actors' calendars and rehearsal

228
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:29,294
calendars.

229
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:31,734
Anyone who works in freelance is a game audio person.

230
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:36,376
Sometimes you have, oh, what, 700 color-coded calendars going

231
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,916
at the same time with different deadlines.

232
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:45,343
You learn about play testing when you work in theater because you do rehearsals and you try out stuff in front of audiences.

233
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,705
And in games you do that a lot too.

234
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:56,013
I learned a lot about working in different departments in software because I worked with some theater companies that had multimedia projection systems.

235
00:14:56,013 --> 00:15:03,260
And my knowledge of things that I learned through them prepared me for working side by side as an audio person with graphic people in the game industry.

236
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:08,304
So those are some examples of actual software-based technical things.

237
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,466
But one of the most important types of skills you can get

238
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:14,729
that people often forget whenever they're trying to look at a career in games

239
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:15,770
is soft skills.

240
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,852
And whenever I say soft, I mean personal skills,

241
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,654
ways to deal with people, emotions.

242
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,056
A big word that floats around this conference is stress.

243
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:29,541
burning out, learning how to say no whenever a task is impossible,

244
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,803
or not being afraid to admit whenever you need help.

245
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:36,447
Theatre can be really stressful for anyone who's been on the tech or acting side,

246
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,910
and sometimes when you're on a game project and there's crunch,

247
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,672
one of your teammates might start exploding,

248
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,834
or maybe they're just low on sugar,

249
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,196
and you need to have that sense in your brain in a meeting

250
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,939
to be nice and offer them a cookie, and suddenly that saves the game.

251
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,681
But these are skills that...

252
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:59,803
You know, you can read about, you can see online, but the only way to really learn a soft skill is to work a job.

253
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,625
Work as a barista, work in theater, work as an educator.

254
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:08,246
Teachers deal with stress often. I mean, my God, they're saints.

255
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:13,108
But again, stage management taught me all these things and I carried them through whenever I was in-house.

256
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,451
Now you may think to yourself, OK, so you get into this mindset,

257
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,512
you analyze every type of job you've ever had.

258
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,574
I had, what, 14 jobs, right, because freelance is insane.

259
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,375
It's like, oh my god, so I have 7 million skills.

260
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,016
I can do all the things.

261
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:29,479
What can possibly go wrong if you say yes to every possible opportunity that

262
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,940
comes up, no matter how little it pays?

263
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,241
And obviously, burnout is a problem.

264
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:37,504
So you should learn that even though you are now able to analyze your life

265
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:40,085
and that you have these skills and you can take on stuff,

266
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,926
like maybe you're really good at handling.

267
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:48,758
people and making them not fight with each other and stress and balancing calendars and schedules.

268
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,445
And you become that person that everybody wants to balance their calendars and schedules.

269
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:56,518
It's good to not take on everything.

270
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,461
And after you've analyzed all the skills you have,

271
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,022
learn how to narrow it down and actually admit

272
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,764
what you don't want to do anymore.

273
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:05,986
So even though I praise, when I talk to kids

274
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:07,768
or I go and speak in front of crowds

275
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,950
and I say stage management I still feel

276
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,771
gave me the most skills I use in games,

277
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:14,433
I never want to be a stage manager again.

278
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,874
Because it burned me out too many times.

279
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,715
If you're lucky, especially on tour, you sleep.

280
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,836
Some people are nodding. They've been in stage tech.

281
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,157
You sleep three hours a night.

282
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,797
You're the last person to leave the theater.

283
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:27,099
You're the first person in. Everything's always your fault.

284
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,240
So, you know, that's life.

285
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,500
And I know I'm really good at my job.

286
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,902
I worked a long time because people knew I could handle it.

287
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:38,623
But I knew that health-wise, it wasn't for me.

288
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,023
But hey.

289
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,097
It's okay to acknowledge that I don't like burning out

290
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,300
and sleeping three hours a night isn't my thing.

291
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,042
And maybe someone else is really good

292
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,305
at not ever getting a good night's sleep.

293
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,288
So I'm happy now that I know how that job works

294
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,210
to pass on stuff to other people,

295
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,735
but keep the parts that I really learn from

296
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:57,317
and apply them in other places.

297
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,838
Again, please always remember, especially in game jobs,

298
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:03,059
if you're looking at different companies you wanna work at

299
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,000
and you learn that through working these other experiences,

300
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,220
you don't like working 80 hours a week

301
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,841
or you do like having a family life,

302
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,901
it's okay to say no to jobs where you know

303
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:17,782
that that industry or that lifestyle of the community

304
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:19,982
that works there, they like to burn people out.

305
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,663
Just don't apply there.

306
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:23,243
Look for companies that actually value

307
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:24,363
taking care of their employees.

308
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:29,646
And long story short, never forget where you came from.

309
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:30,767
Every job is valid.

310
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,388
Every experience is valid.

311
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,009
You never know what you're going to learn from something

312
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:34,930
until you do it.

313
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,452
And you don't have to stick with it if you don't like it.

314
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:40,234
But always cherish where you came from and find some way to

315
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,615
use that towards a future job.

316
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,936
Never stop learning.

317
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,017
Life never stops teaching you.

318
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,139
And always remember Liam Neeson in your brain.

319
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,661
Whenever you're looking at any job post and it lists all

320
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:52,843
those crazy skills, and a lot of them are really crazy

321
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:54,324
words that you don't know what the heck's going on.

322
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:59,966
Remind yourself that you have your own secret skills, and it's up to you how you apply them.

323
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:03,088
So, always be yourself guys.

324
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,228
Unless you can be Batman.

325
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:05,949
And then be Batman.

326
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:15,792
Thank you.

327
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:21,394
Hello, my name is John-Amber Matts, I'm going to talk about music and sound, a match made

328
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,554
in Slack.

329
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:23,515
Not endorsed by Slack.

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,601
So, here's a thesis statement for you.

331
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,423
Sound design and music are two parts of a whole,

332
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:32,205
and as such, we need to approach them holistically.

333
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,027
Now, for some projects, the audio team's eyes is one.

334
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:36,988
Now, if that's you, congratulations,

335
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,129
you control everything.

336
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:38,870
Good luck with that.

337
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:43,479
On the other hand, if you're working as part of an audio team, you can specialize, right?

338
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,000
As a composer, a sound designer, etc.

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,083
You don't have to worry about what anyone else is doing, you only have your one little

340
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,365
world to worry about, and it's just great.

341
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,007
I don't know, wait, no, heck, that's not how it works at all.

342
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:56,989
Because everything you do has an effect on someone else's work.

343
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,050
So how do we communicate?

344
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,451
If you're like me.

345
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,191
If you're like me.

346
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:14,199
You're wincing right now, but that was the goal.

347
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,700
Anyway, so how do we communicate, right?

348
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,122
First, a word about remote work versus in-house work.

349
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:23,123
There's a bit of difference.

350
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:26,025
If you're in-house, you're very lucky.

351
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,106
You get to be in the same area as your team,

352
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:32,468
but you need to make sure you do everything, as Burr put it,

353
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,409
to be in the room where it happens.

354
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,991
All right.

355
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:39,636
So proximity and visibility are key.

356
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,779
Put your workstation in the midst of the development team.

357
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,942
Invest in good monitor headphones.

358
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,266
Make sure you find opportunities to share your works in progress

359
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:49,289
out loud when you reach milestones.

360
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,392
You want to make audio feel like it's part of the larger picture.

361
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:55,294
rather than something that's siloed off in a back room somewhere, an isolated element.

362
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:58,915
Go to the meetings, even if they don't have specifically things to do with audio.

363
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:02,977
And even if they're outside your normal area of expertise, be part of the team.

364
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:07,799
Now, if you're not fortunate enough to be in the same building as the rest of your team,

365
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,480
you need to find a way to...

366
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:17,889
communicate. Something, a solution that works to clearly show where you are on a project,

367
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,530
that show where everyone's working on, and allows you to easily share works in progress,

368
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,711
questions, insights, et cetera, and allows for quick and clear feedback on those works

369
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:30,413
in progress. And something, ideally, that fosters a sense of community within the team.

370
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,134
Now, I've used everything from Slack to Discord

371
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,935
to Skype to Facebook Messenger to communicate with my teams

372
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:38,075
and find that being able to pose a question

373
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:40,916
and share something I'm working on

374
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,957
and get feedback right away without having to worry

375
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:45,458
about a broken email chain or something like that

376
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,479
is super, super valuable.

377
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,560
It helps make you feel like you are

378
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,380
in the same room with the people.

379
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,501
No matter what your technical solution is

380
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,982
for communication, though,

381
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:58,223
it needs to be able to accomplish those goals.

382
00:21:58,223 --> 00:21:58,303
So.

383
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:03,376
Communications techniques aside, what do you actually say?

384
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:07,141
Every discipline in game development has unique language.

385
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,023
Most of my experience comes from indie teams

386
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:09,563
where you are.

387
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,661
one person or two people on an audio team,

388
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:15,043
working with like four or five other people.

389
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,305
Now, you don't need to know everything about a language

390
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:18,346
to communicate with them.

391
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:21,029
There are hundreds of terms

392
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,312
unique to every language and discipline.

393
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:27,716
But understanding the basics can help you

394
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,738
and help form a effective bridge

395
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:32,000
from one discipline to another.

396
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,462
Knowing basic terminology or.

397
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:35,995
the structural logic behind a discipline

398
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:37,496
will help make you more valuable to the team

399
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:40,217
and help make your own ideas come across much more clearly.

400
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,497
So, a couple examples.

401
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:44,318
These are gross generalizations,

402
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:47,279
but programmers tend to really like logical arguments

403
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,160
and or randomization sequences, if this, then that.

404
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,360
If it's a complicated idea,

405
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,941
but you can express it in a flow chart,

406
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,161
they're gonna love you.

407
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,042
Maybe not this flow chart, but still.

408
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:02,983
Now artists on the other hand, again, gross generalization,

409
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,564
but they tend to understand color and emotion and intent.

410
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,225
Same with writers, all right?

411
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:09,327
A plethora of things that can be ample fodder

412
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,607
for your creative mind,

413
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,509
either in music or sound effects fields.

414
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:15,910
All right, these are things that can inspire you

415
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,932
and give you an idea of where things are gonna go

416
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,853
even before there's something in the game.

417
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:22,915
They're also the only people you can legitimately ask

418
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,195
to make something more purple.

419
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,609
sound and music share a common language. So if you're a sound

420
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,832
designer or a composer, that's great. You can pretty much talk

421
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,695
with them naturally, but sometimes you have to decipher

422
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:39,119
the accent. So things like frequencies, compression, EQ,

423
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,501
audio mix, ducking, dissonance, etc, etc, etc.

424
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,123
These are things that you're going to have in common

425
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,564
with your sound designer or your composer, all right?

426
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:49,166
And you can use them to describe things pretty effectively.

427
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,248
If you don't understand a term or a term in this context,

428
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:52,709
ask, learn.

429
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,990
Remember that everyone on the team

430
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,111
wants to produce the best possible work of art.

431
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,613
So it's always better to clarify and add to your knowledge

432
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,015
rather than assume and smile and nod your way

433
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,415
through a conversation.

434
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,157
I know that may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised.

435
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,779
So sound and music, working in concert.

436
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:12,157
Music and sound both come out of the same speakers

437
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,558
and go into the same receiver, human ear, right?

438
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:16,219
So picture this.

439
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:20,181
You need to make sure you communicate your intents clearly,

440
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,903
leave room for each other's work as appropriate.

441
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:24,504
Here's an example.

442
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:29,752
You're writing a vital cue for a key moment in a game.

443
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:32,654
As the hero looks up at their goal so very far away,

444
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,254
we hear this plaintive horn theme.

445
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:36,715
It's quoting the theme of her quest,

446
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,217
the theme you painstakingly stitched

447
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:43,078
into the prophecy cut scene at the start of the game.

448
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:45,439
She's come so far and through so many trials

449
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,981
to reach this point, and she's never been more alone

450
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:49,461
or more determined.

451
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:52,222
Now your sound designer looks at this scene

452
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:54,223
and says, oh, this is super lonely.

453
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:59,662
You're on the top of this hill, there's a lot of wind.

454
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:00,682
I want to just make you feel isolated.

455
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:01,783
We'll do this.

456
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:06,226
Now, remember, everything you do has an effect

457
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:07,666
on someone else's work.

458
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,808
Both approaches are valid, but some communication

459
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,229
would have saved us from this.

460
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,010
I won't subject you to that anymore.

461
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,734
There's only so much space in the audio spectrum at any given point, as was mentioned earlier.

462
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:28,117
Sound effects and music need to be especially considerate of each other's requirements.

463
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:32,881
Gameplay in the end is king, and sound effects frequently provides vital player feedback.

464
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:36,884
So you always want to take into consideration the likely sound design of a scene before you score it.

465
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:39,145
Now, Penka touched on this earlier with Mummy, alright?

466
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:45,830
But also, last year, Will Roger was talking about stripping out percussion elements for his Call of Duty World War II score,

467
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,852
leaving it with just, like, brass and strings and woodwinds,

468
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:52,674
so that that left space for explosions and gunfire and other stuff.

469
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:58,218
You want to make sure, in addition, that the sounds you're using don't clash with the music, they'll be heard alongside.

470
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,383
Just like you want to make sure the music isn't going to get in with the sounds, vice versa.

471
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:07,188
The sound, you know, so say your sound has a pitched element to it.

472
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:10,672
You want to make sure that it's in a compatible key with the music it's going to be heard alongside.

473
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:13,715
It would take up huge swaths of the audio spectrum with it,

474
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:16,639
unless the score's not doing anything so that it won't interfere.

475
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,061
Compliment. Don't compete.

476
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:25,546
That's a little cue from a game I worked on called Fossil Echo.

477
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:29,430
In Fossil Echo, we had two possible ways

478
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,873
your character could die.

479
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:35,036
You could be shot, or you could fall to your death.

480
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:37,759
When you fell and didn't die, we got a good body thump kind

481
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,222
of impact, but he brushes and gets up, brushes himself off,

482
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:40,703
and goes on.

483
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,205
When you die in another way, you get this hit.

484
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:46,226
Early on, we had a body impact sound and this hit,

485
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:46,987
and that was a bad move.

486
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,967
But the musical hit proves much more effective

487
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,308
to tell you that, like, hey, that's the end for you.

488
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:53,208
Sorry, kid.

489
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,828
Anyway, what about musical sound design?

490
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:58,229
Good communication can help you find and capitalize

491
00:26:58,229 --> 00:26:59,449
on these opportunities.

492
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:02,050
Even as a composer working with a sound designer,

493
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,510
sometimes musical sound design elements

494
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,670
can be a vital aspect of a game's overall sound design

495
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,651
and help tie the score and sound together in a holistic way.

496
00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,068
Here are a few examples here.

497
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:14,850
So in For the King, when enemies pop up on the map,

498
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,491
we get these little horn stings.

499
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,292
Now, our sound designer was struggling to find,

500
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,913
well, he basically immediately realized

501
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:24,614
that there really was no good sound effect for these things.

502
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,535
It should be a musical element.

503
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,596
And so I used some of the instruments and timbres

504
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:32,457
that I'd used in the score to kind of cue these things in.

505
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:35,158
Same thing with rolling dice in this game.

506
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,719
Rather than actual dice sounds, we used

507
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:44,563
little drum and percussion sounds, all right, to further kind of cement the idea that this

508
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,164
was a sort of a collaborative musical thing.

509
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:53,165
In addition, we had a whole class of characters that were minstrels and bards, and they played

510
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:54,986
lutes and other things to cast magic spells.

511
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:59,447
And so we wanted to make sure that when we were in a battle, you were using these instruments

512
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:02,928
and the sounds that we would have coming out of there.

513
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,375
various accoutrements would mesh with the key of the combat music.

514
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:14,362
All right? Most of the time. Anyway, so in conclusion, ask questions.

515
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:18,346
Stay in the room where it happens, either physically or digitally. Find a way to do

516
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:20,668
that. Stay connected to the rest of the team's

517
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:25,073
development progress and process, and let them know that you are, what you are

518
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:25,513
doing as well.

519
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:31,230
Hopefully, I've impressed upon you the importance of good communication with your audio team

520
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,412
and within the larger development ecosystem.

521
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:38,737
Asking questions, knowing what everyone else is creating, and being able to get and give

522
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,939
feedback are vital to a unified project.

523
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,661
I hope you all have protective, communicative teams going forward.

524
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:44,702
Thank you very much.

525
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:55,924
Hello, everybody.

526
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:57,405
Hope you guys are having a great GDC.

527
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,766
I want to start this presentation

528
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,507
by apologizing in advance, because I am not

529
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,607
the best presenter.

530
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,108
Emmanuel, I don't know what you were thinking.

531
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:07,829
But here I am.

532
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,790
So never again.

533
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,691
I'm kidding.

534
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:16,012
So my name is Erika Escamez, and I am from Monterey, Mexico.

535
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:20,314
I live here in the city, though, and I'm the audio director

536
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,375
and lead sound designer for Ektra Games.

537
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,116
We work on a project called Torchlight Frontiers.

538
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:28,358
Like many of you here, I'm assuming,

539
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,258
how many of you are composers?

540
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:30,679
Raise a hand.

541
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,700
All right, all right, cool, cool.

542
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,961
And how many of you have done sound design

543
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:38,422
with your composing before?

544
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:40,043
All right, pretty much the same.

545
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:40,823
Cool, awesome.

546
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:43,844
So like many of you, I have a music background.

547
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:46,445
I went to Berklee College of Music,

548
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,966
the music one, not the impressive one from California.

549
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:55,616
And when I graduated I had no idea that sound design was even an option for me.

550
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:58,778
I didn't even know what it meant.

551
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:03,562
But believe me when I say that being a composer can only make you a better sound designer.

552
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:10,567
Almost everything will be covered by the amazing speakers and the amazing presentations they

553
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,248
have.

554
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:18,793
But I'm just going to jump in and go through this and let you know what I think.

555
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,208
you need to do to think like a sound designer

556
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,549
if this is your first time trying it out.

557
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:28,051
Where's the mouse?

558
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:31,033
Oh, there it is, okay.

559
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:34,515
First thing, the strategy.

560
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:39,538
It is not enough to just be able to create something cool.

561
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,859
How can you take it to the next level?

562
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,460
To have like a dynamic mix,

563
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,601
then showcase what's really important

564
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,542
and what really means something to the player.

565
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,623
And for that,

566
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,414
we need to think outside of the box.

567
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:54,256
Second, coming up with the questions and not the answers

568
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,718
on how to make a simple composition that loops,

569
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,799
for example, into something dynamic

570
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,881
that conveys information to the player

571
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:01,681
is what will set you apart.

572
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:04,603
Having the ability and thought process

573
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:06,965
to use your composition to do this

574
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,866
is what differentiates a composer from a sound designer.

575
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:15,790
Also, I'm sorry for my accent.

576
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,351
Not just composing the cue is enough.

577
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,452
but saying, hey, so you need a two minute piece of music

578
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:23,553
for the gloomy dark pond.

579
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:25,615
Well, how about I can give you a six minute piece

580
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:28,717
without actually going through over two minutes of content

581
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:30,198
and all the programmers will love you

582
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:31,418
because you'll save a bunch of memory

583
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:33,280
from streaming and all that.

584
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,222
So those are the kinds of things that you wanna be,

585
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:40,004
or the kind of way that you wanna be thinking about.

586
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:41,385
In our game, specifically,

587
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,726
everything's changing all the time.

588
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,891
And Matt Ullman, our composer, basically delivered me a four minute song.

589
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:50,373
And after 20 minutes of playing, I've heard the same motif five times.

590
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,034
And I already know it by heart.

591
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:57,298
So I said, how can we fix it so it's every time the timeline is going through,

592
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:58,039
changes a little bit?

593
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,439
It changes.

594
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,440
It's different every time.

595
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,002
How can we use this to our musical advantage

596
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,444
to convey the information that we need, and vice versa?

597
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:10,067
How can we use the information that we want to convey in a musical way?

598
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,210
I have a note that says next slide.

599
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,592
So come up with the questions and not the answers.

600
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:23,015
Here are some examples of questions you can ask yourself

601
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,796
while you are composing.

602
00:32:24,796 --> 00:32:26,617
How many enemies are on screen?

603
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,639
How far are they from my player?

604
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,899
How many other players are around?

605
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,180
How difficult is the enemy?

606
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,081
What's the environment like?

607
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,255
Just is there a monster skill happening?

608
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,035
Am I using a special skill?

609
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:39,655
Is there a UI?

610
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:41,936
Is there a hazard monster doing skill status?

611
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:43,936
And you can go on and on and on, man,

612
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:46,037
like with so many questions.

613
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:48,897
Why did I put so many?

614
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:50,257
So yeah, final questions.

615
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:51,638
Questions, not answers.

616
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,358
How does the music change based on all these factors

617
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:57,519
in a non-linear environment?

618
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,380
Next slide.

619
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,660
Using music as a sound skill

620
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:03,940
in your.

621
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:09,855
Using music is a sound design skill in your game.

622
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,636
Thought process.

623
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:15,779
I need to communicate all of the above questions,

624
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,741
all of the above questions.

625
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:20,403
And what better way to do that than using music

626
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:23,125
to communicate how much danger the player,

627
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,007
you the player, or me the player are in.

628
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:29,430
So the first thing we did is I sat down with Matt Ullman

629
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,072
and I came up with a way to write up music in a,

630
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:34,094
well we came up with a way to write the music

631
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,396
in a different way, not in a linear way.

632
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:42,797
And instead of creating music in one big loop,

633
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,398
we decided that we were gonna create the music

634
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,118
in four bar variations.

635
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:49,219
Imagine thousands upon thousands of four bar motifs

636
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:52,320
and hits coming together in a puzzle-like way

637
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,121
to make a song.

638
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,282
And then once we put those songs together,

639
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:58,122
two minutes long or four minutes long,

640
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:01,103
however the piece is,

641
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:04,244
we wanted these instruments to change the intensity

642
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,745
and drama as a game of,

643
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:08,685
drama increases or decreases.

644
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:13,453
So the result is the mix within our two minute piece would change dynamically and it will

645
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,795
never be the same.

646
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:21,185
I will show you how we did this in a second after I explain the next part.

647
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,462
So then I said, I couldn't do this by myself, obviously.

648
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,064
We came up with the idea, and we sat down with Guy,

649
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,347
who's right here, who is an amazing,

650
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,409
our lead programmer, audio programmer,

651
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,570
programmer extraordinaire.

652
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,033
He says he does not restructure the universe when he codes,

653
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,935
but I swear he does.

654
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:40,078
And we told them what we wanted to do

655
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,280
with this new music system.

656
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,443
And the way we came up with this is

657
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:49,519
how do we communicate how much drama is happening at once

658
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,180
by assigning things within the world a drama value

659
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,961
which then drives the code to set the instance

660
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:59,083
as low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity.

661
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,424
Next slide.

662
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,445
The result, flexible music.

663
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:05,315
flexible dynamic music.

664
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:08,116
The music should change if the tension increases,

665
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:10,157
if the drama increases.

666
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:12,018
For example, the drums should rise

667
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:14,720
if the enemy is particularly difficult

668
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,082
by assigning a higher drama value to that enemy.

669
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:20,342
And if you're just cruising,

670
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:22,443
then the intensity of the music should be low,

671
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:24,725
it should be calm, it should just fill your space.

672
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:26,045
And the most important thing,

673
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,906
it should not interfere with the sound effects

674
00:35:27,906 --> 00:35:28,767
or skills of the player.

675
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:32,915
which is something they've already talked about.

676
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,476
It should be cohesive.

677
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:38,378
So instead of having a sound effect that would say,

678
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:39,919
hey, here comes a big enemy,

679
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:42,560
the music is the one that triggers you.

680
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,621
The music is the one that says,

681
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:51,204
oh, I am in this amount of danger.

682
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:51,524
Hit escape.

683
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,084
And then tab.

684
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,645
Oh, there it is.

685
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:53,845
Cool.

686
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:55,886
So this is one of our music sessions.

687
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:02,037
We have a couple beds here, just to make it easier.

688
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:07,540
But to give you an example of

689
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:07,960
toms, here we go.

690
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,483
These toms, there is one, two, three, four variations.

691
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,224
This is fmod, by the way.

692
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:18,726
For those of you who do not know, it's a great tool.

693
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,408
Each tom is different, one from another.

694
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:34,604
You get the idea, right?

695
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:38,088
And if we solo this, every time the timeline goes through here,

696
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:42,433
it will pick a new one.

697
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,036
Well, I'll show you in a second.

698
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,799
Oh, yeah, yeah, cool.

699
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:49,902
I got to turn this up, and this mouse not, there we go.

700
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,613
and it just picked on a different one, and so on.

701
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:58,833
So every time the timeline goes there,

702
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,574
it randomly picks one, or we can choose

703
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:03,255
if we want a priority on a certain one.

704
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,837
So that's the way the variations were working,

705
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,679
and if you can see here, we have it with the toms,

706
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,759
we have it with the hi-hat,

707
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:13,881
we have it with Fuzz 16th bass notes,

708
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:18,003
the crash cymbals, the crash high only,

709
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:22,985
a kit, et cetera, et cetera, shakers, blah, blah, blah.

710
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:23,566
Okay, cool.

711
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:24,986
And so.

712
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:34,791
Then we had the system where basically it grabs all the drama values, so say 0 to 10.

713
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:40,335
If the game says it's 0 to 10 intensity, then play low intensity.

714
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,476
If it's 10 to 20, play medium.

715
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:43,116
If it's 20 to 30, play high.

716
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:49,720
So I'm just going to show you a little bit how that would work, basically what the engine

717
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,681
would be doing if that was the case.

718
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:01,583
We're on low intensity.

719
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:10,726
This is for a creepy bug world, by the way.

720
00:38:10,726 --> 00:38:23,771
And here come a couple monsters.

721
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,132
And then here comes a champion.

722
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:39,187
And it just stays there until you're done killing it.

723
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:42,190
We'll go back to medium.

724
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,957
Because you still have a couple other enemies.

725
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:55,743
You're done with them, you go back down.

726
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:56,244
And that is it.

727
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:59,187
Now to congratulate myself for getting through this

728
00:38:59,187 --> 00:38:59,887
without having a heart attack,

729
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:00,508
I'm gonna have a milkshake.

730
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:00,868
Thank you.

731
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:21,377
Hi, I'm Matthew Martinson. I don't have a very great title. So this is me. If you don't

732
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:23,019
know, I'm Matthew Martinson, like I just said.

733
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,176
I think I always repeat that twice, I don't know why.

734
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:27,697
I'm a sound designer at Clay Entertainment.

735
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:29,878
I've been doing game audio for 16 years.

736
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,459
I also do the Beards, Cats, and Needy game audio podcast

737
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:34,720
that some of you might know of, I'm not sure.

738
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,922
I'm a sound designer, not a composer,

739
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:39,183
so I'm coming from that end of things.

740
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,003
Bear with me.

741
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,045
Usually, I'm overly verbose about just about everything,

742
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:44,085
so seven minutes is a challenge,

743
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:45,486
but we're gonna try and speed run this.

744
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:48,209
So, you want to get into sound effects.

745
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:51,931
Right away, lots of people are going to tell you

746
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,172
that you need to spend a lot of money.

747
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,253
I've always had a problem with that,

748
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:57,374
and in the long run, doing sound design

749
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:59,495
is going to take a lot of investment on your part.

750
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,736
But when you're starting out,

751
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:02,497
when you're just trying to see

752
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:04,818
if you even enjoy doing this part of it,

753
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:05,779
now you don't need to do that.

754
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,824
I'm going to make a few assumptions here.

755
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,187
That you're a composer, you have a computer, a DAW,

756
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:13,309
an interface, some sort of monitoring,

757
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,593
your usual suite of plugins that comes with that.

758
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:20,318
And if that's what you've got, you don't need much more than

759
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,019
that to start out.

760
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,042
I think to note that the fanciest tools that you see a

761
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:26,105
lot of sound designers talk about and throw around that

762
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:27,066
they use all the time.

763
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,231
are really about speeding up workflows.

764
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,811
When you're starting out, you don't know

765
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:33,872
how you're going to work yet.

766
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:36,892
So don't worry about the special stuff

767
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,633
until you actually know what your workflows might be like,

768
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:44,535
and then you know which ones you want to speed up.

769
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:46,615
So what do you need to make sound effects?

770
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,196
You need a DAW, you already got that.

771
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,276
You need some sounds to layer with

772
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:50,857
and a way to record things.

773
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,057
Don't feel that you need to change the DAW

774
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:55,138
you're using to make music

775
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:57,238
because you're now doing sound effects and it's different.

776
00:40:57,815 --> 00:41:03,899
Some might be better in certain ways once you know what you're doing, but you're better off sticking with something you already know

777
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:09,383
Because you're not don't want to learn two skills at once you can use Pro Tools Reaper or Cubase logic live

778
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,564
Fruity loops, whatever

779
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:15,647
Whatever you use now keep doing that for sound effects

780
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,709
Sounds can come from libraries in your own recordings that

781
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,564
As long as you do this, it always comes from those.

782
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,766
Lots of sound effects providers will give small free

783
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:27,327
packages of sound effects that basically are the cost of an

784
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:30,328
email, so you can start to build a library for free or

785
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:30,929
next to nothing.

786
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:35,091
There's also freesound.org, but be careful.

787
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,232
Lots of sounds there need proper credit, and then you

788
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:40,614
need to keep track of that, which can add a workload that

789
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:41,354
you might not want to do.

790
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:42,295
I never want to do that.

791
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:47,739
And you also have to sift through a lot of garbage to find the good stuff, so you can

792
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,943
spend a lot of time trying to find something usable.

793
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:56,570
And there's also always rumors of copyright infringing sounds have been uploaded there

794
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,994
and you could get nailed for that infringement without even knowing it.

795
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:06,168
A portable recorder will be a really useful tool that you might not have that could be cool.

796
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:11,993
Even the really cheap ones from any of the reputable manufacturers will do just awesome, great job.

797
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:15,296
Don't worry about you got to spend thousands of dollars on that kind of stuff.

798
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:18,576
And if you don't have that and don't want to spend that,

799
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:20,717
your phone is a perfectly good recorder.

800
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:23,397
There's YouTube channels devoted to making sound effects

801
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,998
just from phone recordings.

802
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:28,478
They will show you just, you can do great results.

803
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:30,599
It doesn't really matter.

804
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,659
If you wanted to record at home,

805
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:33,499
you've already got a setup, you've got a DAW,

806
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:35,699
that means you have an interface.

807
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:38,920
Maybe all you need is a microphone then.

808
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,720
I found there's a $20 Chinese microphone

809
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,281
that is like way better than it should be.

810
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:49,225
buy that. There's lots of slightly higher priced ones from

811
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:51,447
reputable manufacturers that you can get into too. Anything on

812
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:55,010
the low end really is quite good these days. But the great thing

813
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,172
about cheap microphones is you can put them in really dangerous

814
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:01,455
places. You get some really interesting sounds until you get

815
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,077
no sound at all. I totally haven't melted any microphones

816
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:08,661
when recording things. Never happens. So, that said.

817
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:10,272
Always be recording.

818
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:15,234
Nothing is what it seems when you're building sound effects.

819
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:19,495
So it's all about reinterpreting sounds

820
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:20,896
from libraries and from recordings.

821
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:22,757
This is great for starting out

822
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:24,737
because you don't need to actually own

823
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:26,898
any of the things you're making sounds for.

824
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:29,599
You don't need to own a tank to make tank sounds.

825
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,000
Everything within arm's reach can become a source

826
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,002
of new and interesting sounds to make things from.

827
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:40,271
Think about bone breaking, it's always celery.

828
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:43,515
We don't break bones for those sounds.

829
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,359
So start taking things from around your house and putting

830
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,659
in front of a microphone.

831
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,340
Shake the thing, hit the thing, rub it, hit it with

832
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,180
something else.

833
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,561
Do these things softly, do these things hard.

834
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:56,502
Record them in all the different ways you possibly

835
00:43:56,502 --> 00:43:58,803
can, listen how the sound changes when you do different

836
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,243
actions, listen for the elements of the sound that you

837
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,944
can then use for something else.

838
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:06,405
Recording sound effects is then like any other

839
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:08,105
instrument, you need to practice at it.

840
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:10,217
So approach it with that mindset.

841
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:11,439
It's a performance.

842
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:14,943
You can get totally different things out of items

843
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:18,226
when you use them in different ways.

844
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:19,968
And just like any instrument with practice,

845
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:22,311
you gotta do a lot of it before you get good at it.

846
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:26,556
So, you actually wanna make some sense.

847
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:29,824
It's all about layers.

848
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:31,585
You layer lots of different things together

849
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,706
to make a new cohesive whole.

850
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:36,690
This is the same way you would approach orchestrating a song.

851
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,192
So you've already got that skill set.

852
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,574
Just think about making a sound effects

853
00:44:41,574 --> 00:44:43,475
like putting a band together.

854
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,117
You layer all these different bits

855
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,378
and you come up with something new.

856
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:48,640
You build up the lows, the mids, and the highs

857
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,962
and you balance all these elements into this new thing.

858
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:52,903
It's just the things are the body and the punch

859
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:54,185
and the mechanics of a gunshot.

860
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:57,196
instead of the bass guitar drums of a rock band

861
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:58,897
or the different sections of an orchestra.

862
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:02,218
It's all the same concept underlying it.

863
00:45:02,218 --> 00:45:05,479
So your direct compositional orchestration skills

864
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:08,021
will translate into making these sound effects.

865
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:09,841
Middleware, that's the other big part

866
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,643
of making sound effects.

867
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,844
You might already do some of that as a composer.

868
00:45:15,844 --> 00:45:19,906
If you don't, the implementation will definitely work

869
00:45:19,906 --> 00:45:21,647
into how your sound effects work into the game.

870
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:27,298
You will need to skill up on this middleware and game engines at some point, but worry about that second.

871
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:33,340
Don't take on too many things at once to embark on this new endeavor.

872
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,001
You can do it one step at a time.

873
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:42,763
So learn to be an effective sound designer first, then become an implementer.

874
00:45:42,763 --> 00:45:47,505
Your implementation will become way better if you already have an understanding of sound design to go into it with.

875
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,850
And once you are ready to tackle that,

876
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,211
just about all the major middleware programs

877
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:54,552
are available out there for free.

878
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,313
There's game engines that you can download for free.

879
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:58,894
Well, so that's a like no cost thing

880
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:01,376
to invest some time in and learn.

881
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:01,996
So there you go.

882
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:03,577
You don't need to spend a lot of money

883
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:04,617
if you wanna get into this.

884
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:07,399
Remember, you already know what you're doing.

885
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:09,219
Your skills are transferable.

886
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:12,241
You wanna record as much as you possibly can

887
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:15,543
and don't worry about learning everything at once.

888
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:15,863
Next.

889
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,553
Hi, I'm Emmanuel Lagoon-Bai, a freelance audio designer,

890
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,815
and I'm here to tell you how you can haz job.

891
00:46:30,815 --> 00:46:33,438
Is this you?

892
00:46:34,616 --> 00:46:40,760
I'm a composer, all I do is music, I love music, I love my sub-life, it's great.

893
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,901
Hey, do you need a composer for your game?

894
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,903
I know, I'll take my cards, I've got like plenty.

895
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:51,887
I'm like, it's actually like this musical, it's kind of like Star Wars, you know, it's awesome, it's a lot of fun.

896
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:53,528
I like machine games, I was wondering if you needed a composer.

897
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:56,130
Thank you, it's pretty awesome, I'm doing it with it.

898
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,733
Keep me in mind, dude, like here, let me give you my business card, let me just like...

899
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:01,614
Yeah, totally.

900
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:03,915
Yeah, I'll definitely keep you in mind.

901
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:16,612
Thank you.

902
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:20,117
If it is you, can you not?

903
00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:22,939
So anyway, who am I?

904
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:24,739
I'm a composer gone rogue.

905
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:27,320
Sound effects are now my best friend.

906
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,181
I worked on Ventureverse,

907
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:31,261
or I worked on a game called Ventureverse.

908
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:32,302
It's currently in early access.

909
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:34,723
I've contracted for Torchlight Frontiers,

910
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:35,883
though I think I might be fired

911
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:39,384
after putting Erica through that.

912
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:43,325
So, I've also done sound effects for the VR experience,

913
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:44,726
Wonderfall, A Tale of Two Realms.

914
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:46,946
And we're just gonna get started with some basic numbers

915
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:48,267
here before getting to the other details

916
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,947
of how you can start getting your jobs,

917
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:51,867
your first gigs as a sound designer.

918
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:57,609
So according to that same survey that Pinka referenced

919
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,969
in the beginning of the chat,

920
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:03,270
50.8% of 464 audio professionals said that they actually

921
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,390
got work from referrals or networking.

922
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,151
In other words, 50.8% of people are working

923
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:11,131
because they showed up and said hi.

924
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:13,912
So congratulations, half of you will all have jobs

925
00:48:13,912 --> 00:48:14,692
somewhere down the road.

926
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,852
Ventureverse, Wonderfall, Miracle Mia,

927
00:48:20,852 --> 00:48:23,534
those were all games I actually got the sound design for

928
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,955
because I actually knew the composers

929
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:26,596
that were working on it, or I was friends

930
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:30,419
with a few people that didn't want to take on that work.

931
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:32,581
There's another one I got to do

932
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,783
where I had a friend who's actually sitting here, Andrew,

933
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:37,405
who was out of the country, and he called me.

934
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:40,387
He said, hey, one of my deadlines got pushed back

935
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,269
to like two days from now.

936
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:44,462
Can you do the sound effects for me?

937
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:46,264
And I'm like, sure, man, yeah, I got you.

938
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:48,366
I'll get you covered.

939
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:51,470
So are you ready to be that person as part of the gig?

940
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,392
And I would much rather have six great relationships

941
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:56,374
than $60,000 of sound libraries.

942
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:59,117
While the libraries and friends can both comfort me

943
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:00,419
as I cry myself to sleep,

944
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:03,161
the sound libraries won't directly buy me alcohol

945
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:06,204
outside of the office.

946
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:06,445
And.

947
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,202
Yeah, sure, not everyone here gets jobs from other people.

948
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:11,182
I get that.

949
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:14,384
Some people have to talk to real people.

950
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,605
Some tips regarding that,

951
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:18,407
do not do what you saw in that video there.

952
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:20,508
Leading with, do you need a composer?

953
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:23,130
Makes us all look like really desperate and just kind of bad.

954
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,632
You will have plenty of time to talk about you

955
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,353
and your craft in the future

956
00:49:27,353 --> 00:49:29,614
if the relationship is there to begin with.

957
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:32,436
Also, please remember that people are hiring a person

958
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,237
and not just a role.

959
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:39,528
You can be an excellent designer, but you can be a complete ass that no one wants to work with.

960
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:43,890
So people will remember that.

961
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,951
Surprise! In the end, it's a numbers game.

962
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,692
And like Penka said, 72% of composers also do sound design.

963
00:49:49,692 --> 00:49:53,194
This means that everyone here is probably out to get you.

964
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:57,795
Which also probably means everyone out here is sometimes here to get you a job.

965
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,936
We're all competing at different tiers at all times.

966
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,894
People may work on student projects when they're starting out,

967
00:50:02,894 --> 00:50:04,957
they may move to indie, then they move to mid-tier,

968
00:50:04,957 --> 00:50:07,281
and then eventually AAA.

969
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:09,584
But there's always backwards compatibility between the two,

970
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:10,947
so if you're a AAA composer,

971
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:13,391
don't just consider yourself shoehorned into AAA.

972
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,213
You could be doing other work for other things too.

973
00:50:18,203 --> 00:50:20,065
Believe it or not, people in the industry

974
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:22,727
often get too much work, so if they don't want to take it,

975
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,670
are you ready to be that person they can go to as a referral?

976
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,111
But how do you prepare for that moment?

977
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,854
I'm assuming here that not everybody here

978
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,095
has fully gone into sound design.

979
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,116
Can I see people that have never sound designed before?

980
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,939
Yeah, there's a handful of people here.

981
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:36,940
Wow, I'm actually kind of impressed

982
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,441
that there's a handful of people

983
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,743
that a lot of you are doing sound design already.

984
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:42,184
Nice.

985
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:43,786
But if you aren't, you have to start

986
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:45,487
by putting together a demo reel.

987
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:48,403
what do you actually do?

988
00:50:48,403 --> 00:50:50,424
So putting together a demo reel is kind of like

989
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:52,345
picking clothes for GDC.

990
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,887
Are you gonna be wearing something fancy?

991
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,148
Are you gonna be wearing something nerdy?

992
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:57,249
The point at the end is just really

993
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:58,570
to be comfortable in your own skin.

994
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,652
Wear what you want, show what it is

995
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:02,213
that you want yourself to show,

996
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:05,055
and identify the niche you resonate with most.

997
00:51:05,055 --> 00:51:07,236
For instance, if you wanna work on shooters,

998
00:51:07,236 --> 00:51:08,898
you probably wanna be showing gun sounds,

999
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:11,860
explosions, vehicles, and not necessarily swords and shields.

1000
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:15,725
But E-man, I have no credits.

1001
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:16,385
I can't make a demo reel.

1002
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:17,446
That's a lie.

1003
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:18,947
No credits, no problem.

1004
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:21,889
So a lot of stuff comes from footage

1005
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:25,032
that you can actually just overlay sounds on.

1006
00:51:25,032 --> 00:51:26,753
Like when you're starting out,

1007
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,054
if you have a student project,

1008
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,295
you're often asked to do that kind of work.

1009
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,957
Find the footage which you can create opportunity with,

1010
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,018
and you feel that you can add to.

1011
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:37,501
Always try to be better than the original in your own way,

1012
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:39,222
because it's a lot easier to work on pieces

1013
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,643
that have room for growth,

1014
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:41,944
rather than those that have already

1015
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:43,005
a lot of established sound.

1016
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:45,430
For instance, I'm gonna later show you a demo

1017
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,931
of something I felt I could add to,

1018
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,052
rather than something I felt I couldn't elevate

1019
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,033
with my current skill in design.

1020
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:52,474
So you may be wondering though,

1021
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:55,095
why is there a delicious pineapple pizza on the screen?

1022
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:57,396
Thank you, thank you.

1023
00:51:57,396 --> 00:52:02,399
Exactly this, this is exactly it.

1024
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:04,560
You need to know your audience.

1025
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,142
If you buy a pizza for a group of friends,

1026
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:09,523
and you're the only person there that likes pineapple pizza,

1027
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:11,344
you've just disappointed a ton of people.

1028
00:52:12,993 --> 00:52:14,274
But you made yourself very, very happy.

1029
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:16,736
You're going to be the happiest guest at that table.

1030
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:19,058
My best friend, who actually isn't in audio,

1031
00:52:19,058 --> 00:52:21,960
stated it best for me while I was mentally freaking out

1032
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,581
about a lot of stuff.

1033
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:26,184
He said, it's a lot about, it's like cards against humanity.

1034
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,144
You have to know your audience.

1035
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,007
You have to appeal to the people that are voting for you.

1036
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:32,208
And if you think your work will benefit from something

1037
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,209
you add, then go for it.

1038
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:35,051
Get that pineapple on that pizza.

1039
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,773
If not, better to play it safe.

1040
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:39,974
Well, E-man, now I know what to do,

1041
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:40,855
but I don't know how to do it.

1042
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,577
That's okay.

1043
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:44,244
Ask for help.

1044
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,146
Contrary to popular belief, it's actually okay

1045
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:49,586
to ask other people their opinion

1046
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,847
before you submit their work,

1047
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,447
or before you submit your work,

1048
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:53,948
your work, before you submit your work.

1049
00:52:53,948 --> 00:52:54,488
I made this.

1050
00:52:54,488 --> 00:53:01,670
You don't know any sound designers?

1051
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,811
Well, there's plenty of composers out there

1052
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:04,731
that are actually pretty capable

1053
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,652
of providing some fantastic feedback.

1054
00:53:06,652 --> 00:53:08,833
And look around you now and start making friends.

1055
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,153
Everyone here is able to help each other grow.

1056
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,443
Some of these friends may even see your work down the line

1057
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:17,545
and may be the ones you work with in the future.

1058
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:20,668
I'm gonna go ahead and plug Reel Talk by Power Up Audio.

1059
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:25,292
That's a podcast slash stream in which people can

1060
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:27,834
submit their reels for review and it's fantastic.

1061
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:31,417
A lot of people can get a lot of great feedback from that.

1062
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,879
So I'm gonna go ahead and share

1063
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:37,041
my first ever sound design attempt.

1064
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,162
In 2017, this is when I decided

1065
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:39,583
to just jump into sound design.

1066
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,485
So as you can imagine, guys, I immediately got hired after that.

1067
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:11,847
The truth, though, is after many iterations and sending it to colleagues for some feedback,

1068
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:17,111
and then presenting that version to a panel of people at the demo derby, and then getting

1069
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:20,474
more feedback from them, I was able to present and create this.

1070
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,527
Thanks for watching!

1071
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:44,335
Far from perfect, but after two weeks of work really on it

1072
00:54:44,335 --> 00:54:45,375
and just jumping in and diving in

1073
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,076
and getting as much critique as I could,

1074
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,497
I was able to add an additional 30 or 40 seconds to it

1075
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:52,638
and secure the attention of some of my colleagues,

1076
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:54,399
which is really where it all began.

1077
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:55,980
After being super humbled and inspired

1078
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,820
to post it on Facebook

1079
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,001
and share my first sound design project,

1080
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:00,802
I actually turned the heads

1081
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:03,543
of my mostly audio employees friends list,

1082
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:07,305
which led to some of my first sound design gigs.

1083
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:09,606
So, I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts

1084
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,307
and things to remember.

1085
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,932
It takes time and effort to get better.

1086
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:18,895
It takes time and effort to build great relationships.

1087
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:21,377
It takes time and effort to be a good person.

1088
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:26,281
Don't just surrender after your first KO.

1089
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,663
Press continue, try again, see what happens,

1090
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,685
because everyone's path is different in the end.

1091
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:34,487
You may have noticed that this presentation

1092
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:37,689
was in Comic Sans, with some occasional inconsistencies

1093
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:40,151
and bullet points and spellings and dash marks here and there

1094
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:44,119
But the reality is that's kind of life.

1095
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:49,843
Not everyone likes Comic Sans, but someone out there may.

1096
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:53,567
While one person may hate and not like your reel,

1097
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:57,850
another might want to hire you for something that just might change your life.

1098
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:01,493
Because you picked Comic Sans.

1099
00:56:01,493 --> 00:56:03,835
So, if anyone out here is currently hiring and likes Comic Sans,

1100
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:07,619
I have a full stack of business cards for you.

1101
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:07,939
Thank you.

1102
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,443
We've got a few minutes left.

1103
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:21,893
I'd like to go ahead and share with you everybody here.

1104
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:25,338
Thanks to the panelists that decided to jump in on this and

1105
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:25,980
dive in with me.

1106
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,781
Pankaj, please stand up as well.

1107
00:56:32,137 --> 00:56:36,460
If you haven't already, you'll probably be receiving a survey, so please like, comment,

1108
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,804
subscribe, smash that like button. So that way we can actually get some great feedback and

1109
00:56:40,804 --> 00:56:45,127
just understand how to make this process better. We have a couple minutes for questions, so

1110
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:50,892
I'll take like maybe one or two. Run! Fight, fight, fight!

1111
00:56:54,651 --> 00:56:56,112
Hi everyone, thank you for your presentations.

1112
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,652
They were all great.

1113
00:56:56,652 --> 00:57:01,694
One of the first slides that was shown had percentages of,

1114
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:05,256
and one of those percentages said C-sharp in scripting.

1115
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:08,377
I was wondering how much of that falls on your role,

1116
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:14,180
or do you typically just send your content to a programmer

1117
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,101
and then it's their responsibility to implement?

1118
00:57:16,101 --> 00:57:16,501
Thank you.

1119
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:17,502
Erica, do you wanna take that one?

1120
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:18,482
That was Pankaj.

1121
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:19,302
Oh, gotcha.

1122
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,684
It was Pankaj, it's like with the game video.

1123
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,742
So my perspective is of a freelance composer who only writes the music.

1124
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:30,966
I talk very closely with all my bosses, my collaborators.

1125
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:35,270
I don't write the first note of music until I understand fully

1126
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:38,893
how the music is going to be implemented in gameplay, the different levels.

1127
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:42,676
So there are a lot of conversations and a lot of planning how to compose.

1128
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:48,180
I transitioned into game scoring from film, from linear media, and it was a learning curve.

1129
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,722
This is what I would encourage you to do.

1130
00:57:50,722 --> 00:57:56,666
Read the game audio survey from 2017, which is just Google it, it's going to pop up.

1131
00:57:56,666 --> 00:58:00,128
Brian Schmidt is providing this service to the community.

1132
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:02,329
It's an incredible learning tool.

1133
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:05,251
I myself have made the choice to be only a composer.

1134
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:07,453
This means I'm always hustling to get work.

1135
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:08,934
This is why I'm encouraging.

1136
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:15,842
the young composers, the emerging composers to also consider sound design because it's a very viable career path.

1137
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:19,727
But as far as programming, I put the slide there, and I'm not a programmer.

1138
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:20,288
Thank you.

1139
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:28,667
We're just about six sound designers now.

1140
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:32,069
And I don't touch a lot of code, but one of our sound designers

1141
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:33,791
is basically an audio programmer now.

1142
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:37,093
So even within our, it's going to change studio to studio

1143
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:38,815
how much code you might touch.

1144
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,797
Even within my studio, sound designers

1145
00:58:41,797 --> 00:58:43,759
touch different amounts of code.

1146
00:58:43,759 --> 00:58:46,201
It will never hurt you to learn some of that.

1147
00:58:46,201 --> 00:58:49,764
Even if you never touch it, you can communicate more effectively

1148
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,505
with your programmers.

1149
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:54,127
And being able to talk on their level will always be a plus.

1150
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:59,858
Rachel, do we have time for one more? All right, sounds good.

1151
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:04,485
Thank you all for presenting. This is to you as well as to the

1152
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:07,409
room. It is Thursday night, maybe night four or night five

1153
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:10,974
of GDC for some people. Audio people, where the party at?

1154
00:59:13,069 --> 00:59:16,651
So the Game Audio Network Gold has their award show tonight.

1155
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:19,213
It's going to be a second floor of Moscone 2016, 2018.

1156
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:24,816
It's an award ceremony, and there's also going to be an after party for that too.

1157
00:59:24,816 --> 00:59:25,076
Thank you.

1158
00:59:25,076 --> 00:59:28,398
There's also another talk about audio at the same time.

1159
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,419
Oh, so about VR, actually.

1160
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:32,520
VR and audio at the same time.

1161
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,101
So maybe that's why?

1162
00:59:34,723 --> 00:59:35,963
No, no, no, five and four.

1163
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,244
Isn't what it does?

1164
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,584
Oh, no, he's saying where the party at?

1165
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:39,124
Like where is she at?

1166
00:59:39,124 --> 00:59:39,844
Oh, the party!

1167
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:41,505
Yeah, where the party at?

1168
00:59:41,505 --> 00:59:44,846
Well, there's a lot of places around here

1169
00:59:44,846 --> 00:59:46,086
where you can party.

1170
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:46,226
Yeah.

1171
00:59:46,226 --> 00:59:49,467
You don't need the audio people to party, man.

1172
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:49,607
Yeah.

1173
00:59:49,607 --> 00:59:49,747
Cool.

1174
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:50,607
We bring the party.

1175
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:51,127
Brian.

1176
00:59:51,127 --> 00:59:52,748
All right, slam that next question in.

1177
00:59:52,748 --> 00:59:53,728
I'm a huge fan of Comic Sans, so.

1178
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:53,808
Yay!

1179
00:59:53,808 --> 00:59:55,468
I'll talk to you after.

1180
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:55,749
Sorry.

1181
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:56,109
Let's go.

1182
00:59:56,109 --> 01:00:00,930
We'll be outside if you guys have any more questions.

1183
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,150
Feel free to approach us at any time.
