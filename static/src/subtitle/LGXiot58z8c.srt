1
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:07,175
All right, well, I guess it's go time.

2
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:08,495
Thank you all for coming.

3
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:10,316
I am truly delighted to be here.

4
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:13,597
I am not exaggerating when I say that presenting to rooms

5
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:15,417
full of smart, creative people like you

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:17,538
is what I enjoy doing most.

7
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:19,519
Presenting at GDCs in the past has been

8
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,779
a career highlight for me, and hopefully this year

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,240
I won't trip and fall down, hurt myself,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,521
and have a career low light.

11
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,981
But anyway, thank you for coming.

12
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,832
For those who don't know me, I'm Scott Crabtree.

13
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:33,253
My life story in about 30 seconds goes like this.

14
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:37,395
I was born and raised in Massachusetts, born in Western Mass, raised mostly around the

15
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:38,295
town of Andover.

16
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:42,797
I went from there to Vassar College in upstate New York where I got a degree in cognitive

17
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:43,218
science.

18
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:49,440
This is where I really fell in love with the mind and thinking and what makes brains tick

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,601
and not tick so well.

20
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:55,264
From there I moved, long story short, to Oregon.

21
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,087
This is lovely Oregon, which I love not only for its

22
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:00,050
beautiful nature, but the awesome city of Portland,

23
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,331
Oregon, where I am from.

24
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,395
And I decided to stay in Portland, even though it's

25
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,637
been absolutely terrible for my video game

26
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:07,398
development career.

27
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,040
As you may know, there's very little game development going on in Portland, but there's

28
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,142
some games coming out of Portland and New Zealand where I spent a year.

29
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,385
And these are some of the games that I have shipped in my career, most recently the iPhone

30
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,246
game Middle Top.

31
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:25,369
And of course, probably like you, I've worked on some games that haven't shipped as well.

32
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,190
Enough about me.

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,733
I want to learn some things about you, and I want to start with a little experiment.

34
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:37,726
So, please do the following with me. When I say go, I want you silently in your head

35
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:43,989
to say the alphabet as fast as you can from A to Z, and then count from 1 to 26 as fast

36
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:50,212
as you can, and then stand up. Silently in your head, alphabet, 1 to 26, then stand up.

37
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,593
Ready? Mark, get set, go.

38
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,433
Okay, awesome.

39
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,956
And yes, my friend back there with the broken leg,

40
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:08,896
you don't need to stand up

41
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,758
and I'm not gonna force anyone to stand up,

42
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,621
but I'm encouraging you all to stand up.

43
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:13,701
Why?

44
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,083
Because solid neuroscience shows

45
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:17,565
that when your body gets in motion,

46
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,747
your brain produces what's called BDNF.

47
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:26,772
brain-derived neurotropic factor, which you can essentially think of as fertilizer for brains.

48
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:30,595
I want you to not just hear me but actually learn something today.

49
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:34,859
And so that means getting you in motion occasionally. Thank you. You can sit down.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,983
Now we're going to do it again, only I want you to alternate. So A1, B2, C3, D4.

51
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:44,346
Fast as you can, then stand up. On your mark, get set, go.

52
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,912
Okay, I'll spare you all the suffering. We're now at about 10 seconds

53
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,580
when the vast majority of you were standing up previously.

54
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,526
That is what multitasking does to your brain.

55
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:09,588
And we live in a multitasking society, so we feel like we're being more productive,

56
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,549
and the science is abundantly clear on this.

57
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:16,990
When you're talking about paying attention with your prefrontal cortex, multitasking is impossible.

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,831
All you can really do is rapidly switch your attention between tasks,

59
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,732
which is expensive not just for computers, but also for brains.

60
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:28,353
And in particular, this valuable brain real estate you have up here

61
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:33,014
called your prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for your executive function.

62
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:38,815
So that is why I want you to eliminate or at least minimize multitasking as we go through this talk.

63
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:44,036
Okay, on with learning more about who's here. Please stand up if you're a programmer.

64
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,157
Awesome, thank you. Many of you. Sit down.

65
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:53,838
QA people of any kind, managing QA, testing, etc.

66
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,059
Thank you. Sit down.

67
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:00,840
Artists, musicians, sound people, any kind of artist, animator, modeler, etc.

68
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:06,657
cool thank you and production people business people of any kind you're

69
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:09,039
managing production you're running a studio

70
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,741
you're suing people for a living whatever it is

71
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:13,543
thank you

72
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,648
now i want you to think about what you know about the brain

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,520
None of us know that much. It's one of the most complex things there is in the universe.

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,402
You all have 100 billion neurons in your head with average of many thousand connections

75
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:38,723
to other neurons. And the fact that that two to three pound blob of jelly can make any

76
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:43,403
sense out of my voice and this complex visual scene in front of you is nothing short of

77
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:47,684
miraculous. So none of us know everything about the brain, but there's been an explosion

78
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,445
of information coming out of neuroscience recently.

79
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:57,850
So stand up if you've read one or two books, watched one or two videos, read an article

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,331
or two about the brain, you know some stuff about the brain.

81
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:02,513
Awesome.

82
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:03,594
Thank you.

83
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,197
And stand up if you've read many more than that or more than that.

84
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:17,677
So this is the challenge. I have some people who know very little about the brain and some people who know a lot about the brain.

85
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:21,223
So, I'll do my best to strike the middle ground as we go.

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,382
The rest of this talk, basically my deal with you, is if you pay attention and focus and

87
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:33,364
participate for the next hour, I will teach some of you, hopefully all of you, some stuff

88
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:37,185
about the brain and how it works, and in particular about neuroplasticity.

89
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:42,067
And you will leave with some information and some tools that will help you rewire your

90
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:42,848
brain for the better.

91
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,690
The story of this talk is basically the story of your brain.

92
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:53,925
You are the lead character in this story, and if you went to school any time around

93
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:57,506
when I went to school, you were told roughly this about the brain.

94
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:02,388
You're born with a gazillion brain cells, they die throughout your lifetime, the brain

95
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,469
cells set like concrete when you're an adult, so suck it up, right?

96
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,570
You're getting stupider and you lose your ability to really grow and change throughout

97
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:10,990
your life.

98
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:15,272
That's a problem.

99
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:22,311
Part of the problem that results and the main problem that I'm here to focus on is that

100
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:29,154
I suggest you all spend a lot of time making your games better and very little time making

101
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,355
your brains better.

102
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:34,317
At least that's been true at the game companies where I have worked.

103
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,779
And if this conference is any indication, that's true, right?

104
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:43,002
There are lots and lots of sessions on how to make your game better.

105
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:47,564
And as far as I know, this is the only session on how to make your brain better.

106
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,354
but your brain is not only making your current game, it will make every game in

107
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,216
the future, which means investing in your own brain

108
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,477
pays enormous dividends as you go through your life.

109
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,813
So the solution is neuroplasticity.

110
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:06,857
Science is telling us a much better story of your brain now.

111
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:09,559
The story coming from science in recent years,

112
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,181
there was some controversy about this for a while,

113
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,803
and now there's virtually no controversy left.

114
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,325
The science about your brain is very clear

115
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,927
and telling an awesome story.

116
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:20,788
That story goes like this.

117
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,831
Yes, you learn more easily as a child,

118
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,591
but you continue to learn throughout your lifetime.

119
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,172
You don't just lose neurons throughout your lifetime,

120
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:32,112
you also add neurons throughout your lifetime

121
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:35,633
and make and break connections in your brain

122
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:36,893
throughout your life.

123
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:41,814
We're talking about real, physical, observable changes

124
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:42,434
to your brain.

125
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:46,435
Size changes, structure changes that you

126
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,296
can see in your brain if you do things right.

127
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,846
which means that you get to write how the story of your brain ends.

128
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,189
And that's what I want to ask you to do towards the end of this talk.

129
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,033
Those who got a handout, there's a space where you're going to fill in a little neuroplasticity

130
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:03,134
plan before we're done.

131
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:07,478
So as we're going, I encourage you to think about how do you want to apply this?

132
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,502
How do you want to use the fact that you can rewire your brain to be a different brain?

133
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:17,306
This is fantastic news.

134
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,905
It's nothing short of miraculous to me.

135
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:22,306
Your brain

136
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,428
produces your mind.

137
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,330
Your mind arises out of your brain, right?

138
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:31,732
With your mind, you can think new thoughts

139
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:33,514
that rewire your brain.

140
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:38,477
That is nothing short of miraculous to me. This is some of the biggest news we've

141
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,257
had about the brain

142
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:40,578
in four hundred years.

143
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:46,426
because for most of that time again we thought you're basically fixed once you're an adult

144
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,787
and we now know that's not true.

145
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,608
So it means that we all need

146
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:55,830
what Stanford professor Carol Dweck calls a growth mindset.

147
00:08:56,571 --> 00:09:00,613
She divides people into two categories. Those who have a fixed mindset say

148
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:01,293
things like

149
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,334
you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

150
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,335
I am the way I am.

151
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,135
he's just the way he is, she's just the way she is.

152
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:16,286
If you have a fixed mindset, you believe that we're basically all just set.

153
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:20,853
Now there is some truth to that. I don't want to overstate any of this.

154
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,372
I give separate talks on strengths and how to apply strengths, and that's largely because,

155
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,192
hey, guess what?

156
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:32,995
Everything you've done so far until this moment in your life has rewired your brain.

157
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:37,597
So some of you are really good at some things and not so good at other things, and you're

158
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:41,039
not going to think your way into a completely new skill overnight.

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,001
I, for example, play a lot of music and do a lot of programming.

160
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:49,503
If I work on growing as a musician or a programmer, I'm going to grow really well.

161
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,902
I am an absolutely fucking terrible artist.

162
00:09:54,942 --> 00:10:00,285
I mean, I could not draw you a picture to save my life unless it was a stick figure.

163
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:06,968
If I invested a lot of time and energy in growing as an artist, I would go from absolutely

164
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:12,011
freaking terrible to just a little bit less terrible.

165
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,235
So growth does not mean, hey, just pick whatever you want to be.

166
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,738
You can grow like crazy.

167
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:22,009
I can be a master artist in a matter of weeks if I turn my attention to it.

168
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:22,210
No.

169
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:28,647
Many of us take the philosophy that we can grow the most in our areas of weakness,

170
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:33,150
and science suggests, no, you can grow more in your areas of strength.

171
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,292
So try this data on for size from the Gallup organization.

172
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:42,074
If you send a random group of people into a speed reading class,

173
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,335
you give them a pre-test and a post-test.

174
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:50,058
The slow readers who go in, they all learn the same material in the same class.

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,959
The slow readers improve about 50%.

176
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,924
The fast readers improved 600%.

177
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:01,787
So growth doesn't mean pick where you know nothing and have no brain circuits and focus

178
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,067
there.

179
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:07,750
It means you can grow strongest where you already have some good circuits, where your

180
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,611
brain is already wired up to do some things.

181
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:15,295
But regardless, it means that we all should adopt what Carol Dweck calls a growth mindset.

182
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,246
which means the opposite of the fixed mindset.

183
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:23,147
You can learn and change in significant ways throughout your lifetime.

184
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,988
This turns out to be extremely important.

185
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:31,570
Virtually every great person in history, if you think of a person in history who you admire,

186
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,850
according to Dweck, that person had a growth mindset.

187
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,132
It's a consistent attribute of people who achieve greatness in their lives.

188
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:45,413
So I want you all to stand up if you as of this moment have a growth mindset.

189
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:54,492
And don't feel pressured to stand up if you don't. Awesome! Everybody's on board. Yay!

190
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:06,980
So, now that you believe and understand that you can substantially change your brain over time, how do you do it?

191
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,401
Step one, you've got to feel safe and relax.

192
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,303
When you're stressed out, you can learn facts like,

193
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:15,444
don't go there, there's a tiger over there,

194
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,907
but you are not in a space to learn and grow

195
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,268
and build new connections.

196
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,450
Now, I want to make clear about stress.

197
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,932
Stress is not a bad thing necessarily.

198
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:31,155
Most of us, I in the past, think stress, bad,

199
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:31,996
must avoid stress.

200
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:33,897
If you have zero stress,

201
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:35,698
you do not get out of bed in the morning.

202
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:44,503
We're talking about too much stress, excess stress, stress you can't control, and chronic stress.

203
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:52,512
That's the kind of stress that makes your brain work really poorly, and in fact, kills neurons.

204
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,896
The opposite of what we're focused on here today.

205
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:02,891
The problem here is that your fight or flight response is a really effective part of your

206
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,692
brain, historically speaking.

207
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:11,217
If there is a tiger in your midst, your limbic system, which is the older part of your brain

208
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:17,761
that looks very much like brains of cats and all other mammals, that emotional part of

209
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:20,663
your brain is wired for the fight or flight response.

210
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,104
So that if you feel any threat.

211
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,786
In fact, if there's a mix of things in your environment,

212
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,208
two good, one bad, you get stressed out, you go into fight or flight mode

213
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:33,270
to one degree or another. This is not a switch, this is a continuum.

214
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,972
When you go into fight or flight mode, your limbic system says,

215
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:40,354
I'm in charge now, because there are three ways to get out of this stressful situation.

216
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:44,156
Run, fight, or freeze. You hear about that less because

217
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,618
it doesn't rhyme, but in fact it's your number one option under stress.

218
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:52,760
Freeze, don't move, don't say anything because maybe Tiger hasn't seen you and you've shut up

219
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,923
and don't move, you stay alive. So you freeze and if that doesn't work you try to fight it off and

220
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:02,165
if that doesn't work you run and we see these in the office all the time and the problem is they're

221
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,887
absolutely terrible for coping with stress. Really terrible for coping with stress. Really

222
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:11,669
good for keeping you alive at Tigers and really terrible for helping you make games.

223
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:16,962
So the problem is that there seems to be a three to one ratio.

224
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,725
This is called the Losada line, if you want to look it up later.

225
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:24,931
And by the way, sources for my material are at the, in addition to the books I showed,

226
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:28,094
are in the tiny print you can't read at the bottom of the slides.

227
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,538
It's in tiny print you can't read because I don't want to distract you with it,

228
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,720
as I already told you multitasking sucks.

229
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,861
But I want you to be able to look into the studies later.

230
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:40,903
So if you don't have a handout, I can email you one or there are some at the back of the room.

231
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,404
And I'm happy to email you slides as well so that you can dig into sources.

232
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,665
I'm trying to give you as little of my opinion as possible, basically,

233
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:50,586
and as much scientific information as possible.

234
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:54,047
So what the science says is that when you go into fight or flight mode,

235
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,027
you suck.

236
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,908
oxygen and glucose and dopamine and all the stuff your brain needs to work

237
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:02,528
into your limbic system so that you can focus on fight or flight

238
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,309
and that is not a good way to use or learn

239
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,910
in your cortex, your uniquely human layers of brain

240
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,051
immediately under your scalp. So if you really want to learn and you want to

241
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,891
rewire your brain you have to relax

242
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:20,572
first. So I want to do a little stress poll. Stand up

243
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:22,452
if in the past six months

244
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,693
over half of those months, I'm going to give you three choices.

245
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:29,474
Not very stressful, moderately stressful, very stressful.

246
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:34,975
Okay? So stand up if the past six months for you on average have been not very stressful.

247
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:41,957
Awesome. Your peers want to work where you work. Okay, sit down.

248
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:46,418
Thank you. Stand up if the past six months on average have been moderately stressful.

249
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,321
Okay, thank you. Sit down and stand up if they have been very stressful.

250
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,403
Yes, you people should talk to the first group that stood up. Anyway, thank you.

251
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:05,966
Okay, so I want to teach you some quick relaxation techniques that you can use in the office.

252
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:13,929
Why? To get your brain working more, your brain working more better, I was starting to say, which I'm very proud of.

253
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,953
I want your brain to work more better in the moment and I want you to set the stage for

254
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:22,095
neuroplasticity and long-term learning and growth in your brain.

255
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:26,317
So here are a few things you can do and I want you to try them with me as we go.

256
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,358
The first one is visualization.

257
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,761
Roll your eyes now, have the gag reflex, because I know some of you are like, oh my God, spare

258
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,822
me the woo-woo, Oprah, BS, whatever.

259
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,664
But the science is clear, visualization works.

260
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:45,334
in part because visualization is not a healthy response to stress.

261
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,136
If you have a tiger in your midst,

262
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,418
picturing a beach in Hawaii, you're dead.

263
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,603
So when you visualize, when you picture something, it's a signal to your brain

264
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,664
that everything must be okay.

265
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,920
So I want you to try this right now.

266
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,141
Just take about 10 seconds and shut your eyes and in detail

267
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,122
picture a happy or safe place for you.

268
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,843
Home, beach in Hawaii, a hike, you want to,

269
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,364
whatever it is, just picture it in detail if you can.

270
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,570
Okay, I just went back to Mount Jefferson in Oregon.

271
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,910
I hope your spot was good for you.

272
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,613
If you're anything like me, you feel just a little bit more relaxed.

273
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,054
Now, I don't want to overstate this.

274
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:36,816
If somebody's screaming at you a string of George Carlin curses

275
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:39,758
and calling you an idiot and you're trying to visualize,

276
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:41,198
it's not going to help you enormously.

277
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,600
But if you've just come out of a stressful meeting

278
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,601
or you're even in a stressful meeting

279
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,482
and you can take a few seconds and visualize something,

280
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:51,284
again, it's a signal to your brain to relax.

281
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,946
Breathing also works really well.

282
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:57,527
Hopefully, most of you are breathing most of the time.

283
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,108
But deep breaths, again, your breathing corresponds to your stress really well.

284
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:05,712
When you're stressed out, you tend to breathe quickly and shallowly.

285
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:08,776
When you're calm, you tend to breathe more slowly and deeply.

286
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:13,381
So I want you all to try a breath with me now, but not your usual breath.

287
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:15,644
We're going to do a funky weird breath, which is.

288
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:20,747
We're going to count in for four and you're going to breathe in for four as much as you possibly can,

289
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:23,409
hold it for four, and then out for eight.

290
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,930
And while you're doing this, you're going to think thoughts like,

291
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,551
wow, this Crabtree guy is even weirder than people said,

292
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:33,414
or he's distracting me with his counting, or his counting is faster or slower.

293
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:37,876
Try to just put all those thoughts aside and focus on the sensation of your breath.

294
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:43,496
You have two circuits in your brain primarily that you're using in any moment.

295
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,797
One is the default or narrative circuit.

296
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,458
This one tells stories.

297
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:48,559
I'm at GDC.

298
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm going to this talk.

299
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,461
This guy's really weird, whatever.

300
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,683
And your direct sensory experience is just feeling your sensations.

301
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,125
Turns out that direct sensory experience, although we're in it less,

302
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,246
is a more relaxing circuit to be in.

303
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:06,712
So in addition to focusing on breathing, I want you to get into that direct sensory circuit

304
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,474
that is the alternative to your default narrative circuit.

305
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,197
So we're going to go in for four, hold for four, out for eight.

306
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:12,758
Here we go.

307
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:13,378
In for four.

308
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,601
One, two, three, four.

309
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:16,181
Hold it.

310
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,505
Out for eight.

311
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:29,879
And then as you go back to breathing normally, again, if you're anything like me, you feel

312
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,121
a little bit more relaxed than you did before.

313
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,464
Now you've got to watch your deep breathing in the office or people think you're a total

314
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:36,784
freak.

315
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:41,368
But, again, I'm trying to give you techniques that you can use in the middle of a stressful

316
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:41,908
situation.

317
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,352
If you just think to breathe into your belly

318
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,013
and just feel it for a second or two,

319
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,494
it refreshes your brain, helps you relax,

320
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,675
which puts you in a state of thinking better

321
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:54,576
and using some of your better brain real estate

322
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:56,157
and also setting the stage

323
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,118
for learning and growth in your brain.

324
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:03,562
Of course, there's a lot of relaxation techniques you should do whatever works with you, but

325
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,884
I want to share one more with you, which is touching your lips.

326
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:08,844
Now this is weird, right?

327
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:09,705
Touching your lips.

328
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:10,865
Why would this work?

329
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,266
Now the science is that it does work.

330
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,087
The following is Scott's speculation about why it works.

331
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:21,389
My speculation is that your lips don't get touched normally unless something good is

332
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:21,970
about to happen.

333
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:28,645
If your lips get touched, you're usually about to get something to drink.

334
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:29,946
Beer.

335
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:31,867
Or some food.

336
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,909
Or somebody's going to make out with you.

337
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,089
In any case, it's going to be good.

338
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:35,810
Right?

339
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,074
So again, somebody asks you a really difficult question, you feel yourself stressing out,

340
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,435
you go, let me think about that for a second.

341
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:45,877
And nobody's going to be like, what a freak, he's touching his lips.

342
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:50,840
You can touch your lips subtly, you can even lick your lips the way Kobe Bryant does.

343
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,421
Stand up if you're a basketball fan.

344
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:59,280
Wow! For a minute I thought we're only going to have one. Okay, thank you, you can sit down.

345
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:05,985
Okay, so as much as it pains me to show you Kobe Bryant because I'm a Celtics fan and he's about to score on my Celtics here.

346
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:11,049
Kobe, virtually every time he shoots a foul shot, he licks his lips first.

347
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:18,094
And I don't think it's because he knows the science of relaxation. I think it's because he's just developed the habit.

348
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,916
He even does it when he's getting interviewed.

349
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:24,079
Which the people who made...

350
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,982
NBA2K11 know and they have very good attention to detail. Watch this

351
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:31,384
giant lick lip after he gets fouled and is heading to the foul line.

352
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,032
So again, just try it right now, just touch your lips a little bit.

353
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,371
and you may not feel a dramatic difference. Again, this isn't going to suddenly make tigers

354
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:53,735
go away or suddenly make your unbelievably difficult boss go away, but it can help get

355
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:59,620
you further along the continuum towards relaxation, which is good brain function, which sets the

356
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,624
stage for neuroplasticity. Another thing that works really well is exercise.

357
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:10,989
I'm sorry to be the hundredth person to tell you you should get some exercise, but you

358
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,130
know it's good for your body.

359
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,192
You may have heard it's good for your brain.

360
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,573
It's very good for your brain.

361
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,835
If you go on a walk before a test, you score higher on the test.

362
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:22,138
Exercise adds gray matter to your brain.

363
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:27,882
Exercise produces BDNF, as I mentioned, brain-derived neurotropic, which you can think of as fertilizer

364
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:30,304
for brain, and we're here to talk about growing brains.

365
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:34,007
Social connections are also really good for brains.

366
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:40,211
If you're worried about your parents' cognitive decline, or your own, because you're getting

367
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:44,353
on in years, social connections is one of the best things you can do to keep your brain

368
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:44,953
thriving.

369
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:48,595
You can do this in the office with a walking one-on-one.

370
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:50,556
Many of us have one-on-one meetings.

371
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:55,619
Few of us go on a walk for those meetings, and it's a fantastic technique for getting

372
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:59,521
your blood pumping, building some social connection, and learning the meeting better.

373
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:02,043
So I want you all to try this right now.

374
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,872
pair up if a few of you end up in a group of three that's fine if you have a broken leg you don't

375
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:12,816
need to stand up but generally speaking i want you to pair up and then stand up and at least

376
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:16,519
fidget i can't have you all go on walking one-on-ones or it'll be total chaos for the next

377
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,723
20 minutes but stand up walk in place fidget whatever and talk with your partner what have

378
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:26,947
you heard so far and how do you want to apply this you have about one minute for this walking one-on-one

379
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:27,388
go

380
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:56,265
I'm just listening.

381
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:01,948
I'm sorry, no, no, no, it's all good.

382
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:14,513
Okay, a few more seconds.

383
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:19,135
If you're walking, make your way back to your seats, please.

384
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,142
Find your seats, take your seats please.

385
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,068
Thank you, you are a very cooperative audience and I appreciate it

386
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,510
and I hope it helps burn in some of these

387
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:38,732
new circuits of what you're learning.

388
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:43,437
Now that you're relaxed, you're ready to rewire and to rewire

389
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,798
I want you to reach.

390
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:51,411
This is the acronym I've come up with to summarize some of the key requisites, prerequisites

391
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,053
for rewiring your brain.

392
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:57,417
Not everything you do as an adult rewires your brain.

393
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:03,704
Essentially everything you do up until your early mid-twenties does rewire your brain.

394
00:25:04,384 --> 00:25:09,830
So this is why for a while we thought neuroplasticity, significant brain changes only happen in children.

395
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:15,787
And some things do happen more easily for children. Many things, many brain rewiring things,

396
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:20,234
happen more easily for children. Many of you have probably heard it's much easier to learn a new

397
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:25,442
language as a child than as an adult, and that's true. There are limits to neuroplasticity.

398
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:31,126
Essentially, your neuroplasticity machinery, if you will, the parts of your brain that

399
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:36,187
are responsible for neuroplasticity, those parts of your brain are always on as a kid.

400
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,227
They are not always on as an adult.

401
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:44,768
These are the things you need to do to turn on your neuroplasticity machinery in your

402
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:51,270
brain so that you can rewire your brain and develop new skills and even personality attributes.

403
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,670
So reach, R is for repetition.

404
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:01,730
R is for repetition. R is for repetition. I will stop now. And really that's enough said.

405
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,851
When you do something repeatedly, it's a signal to your brain that you're going to do it again,

406
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:12,533
and your brain adds clusters of neurons as opposed to a neuron here or a neuron there.

407
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:21,875
R is for repetition. E is for effort. If you're doing something that is essentially effortless,

408
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,095
you don't have to try very hard, you're not rewiring your brain.

409
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:31,451
Many of you have probably heard crosswords are really good for your brain and preventing

410
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,212
cognitive decline as you age, right?

411
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:35,814
Not if you're really good at crosswords.

412
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:39,257
If you're just going through crosswords and like...

413
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,690
Honey, this is awesome, I'm totally nailing this crossword.

414
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:44,571
You're not rewiring your brain.

415
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:50,194
You are not building the cognitive reserve, the rich networks that protect against cognitive

416
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,734
decline as we age.

417
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,196
The way that works is something like this.

418
00:26:54,776 --> 00:27:00,739
All of us, unfortunately, unless the science changes again, all of us will develop problem

419
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,080
spots in our brains as we age that are called plaques.

420
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,741
You can think of these essentially as dead spots.

421
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:14,076
So if you have a very sparse network, you can picture a few trails through the woods,

422
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:17,557
and there's a problem on one of those trails, you're screwed.

423
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:19,257
You can't get to that part of the woods anymore.

424
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:22,018
The woods being your brain, obviously, here.

425
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:28,539
If you have a rich network of neural pathways, like a rich network of paths in the forest,

426
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,320
if there's a problem shows up in one spot, I'll just take this other path.

427
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:37,644
So, we all tend to experience cognitive decline as we age.

428
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:43,187
Those with rich cognitive reserves are affected less by those problems because they have other

429
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:48,731
ways to get where they're going, which is why I think neuroplasticity is so important

430
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,311
to all of us.

431
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,233
You may live a very, very long time.

432
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:57,395
Stand up if you heard Ray Kurzweil give a keynote speech here a couple of years ago.

433
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:11,910
Thank you. Okay, so the rest of you, I'll very quickly tell you, for those who don't know, Ray Kurzweil is basically a genius, invented the flatbed scanner, the synthesizer, 16 honorary doctorates.

434
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:20,077
Now, he's a bit of a freak and a bit controversial, in particular in how he's applied this to humans and health.

435
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:25,180
But he is a fantastic predictor of technology trends.

436
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:30,104
And he ended his talk a couple years ago by saying something like the following.

437
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:40,794
We are just a few years from adding more than a year of life expectancy for every calendar

438
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:46,937
year that goes by, which means if you can live a little while longer, you will live

439
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:47,337
forever.

440
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:49,358
And he walked off the stage.

441
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,139
Now that's quite a statement, right?

442
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,340
You're going to live forever.

443
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,282
And I talk to my smartest friends who are doctors and they say, I don't buy it.

444
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,442
You can't apply technology.

445
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:00,663
I don't buy it.

446
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,607
Whether you believe or not you're going to live forever,

447
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:08,230
I am convinced by Kurzweil's talk and the science that we are going to live a

448
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,471
long time.

449
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,693
If you don't get hit by a bus during GDC or next year,

450
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,014
you could all easily

451
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:17,036
live to be well over a hundred.

452
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:21,779
I'm not guaranteeing that. I know that sounds far-fetched to some of you,

453
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,361
but I think we are all going to live longer than we expect to live.

454
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:32,424
which means you want your brain to live and work at least as long as well as your body does,

455
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:36,270
which means building cognitive reserve is important,

456
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,394
which means you want to do things that require effort.

457
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,019
If you play Tony Hawk...

458
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:48,869
or World of Warcraft for the thousandth time, it is not going to rewire your brain unless

459
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:54,750
it's more difficult. It's a new level. It's a new challenge. Novelty helps. Effort helps.

460
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:59,652
E is for effort. You want to be putting some effort into activities if you want them to

461
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:06,454
rewire your brain. So R is for repetition. E is for effort. And A is for attention. Stand

462
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,895
up if you went to the talk last night on attention.

463
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,420
A few of you, yes, excellent talk.

464
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:13,881
Okay.

465
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:18,424
So, for the rest of you, you might want to check it out on the Vault, the GDC Vault.

466
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,707
Attention turns out to be extremely important for neuroplasticity.

467
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:31,312
And not just a little attention, but the intense, rapt attention that new challenging activities

468
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:32,012
require.

469
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:38,376
Attention is extremely powerful, more powerful than many of you may realize.

470
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:40,197
It's also difficult.

471
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:43,346
So here's a little attention test for you.

472
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,447
If you know the answer, please don't give it away to your

473
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:46,847
neighbors.

474
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:48,628
Some of you have seen this video before.

475
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:52,050
You are about to see a video of two basketball teams, one

476
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,890
dressed all in white, one dressed all in black.

477
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,392
Your job is to count the passes on the team dressed

478
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:57,932
all in white.

479
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,154
He said, reaching for the audio.

480
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:02,534
Never mind.

481
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,335
You don't need the audio.

482
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,296
The audio says, count the passes on the team dressed

483
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:06,816
all in white.

484
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:08,617
Here we go.

485
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:08,937
Ready?

486
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,240
Stand up if you got 13.

487
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:43,203
Sit down. Stand up if you saw a moonwalking bear.

488
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,106
Awesome. Here it comes.

489
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,708
You can all sit down. It's going to come in from the right hand edge.

490
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,891
Right there. A guy in a bear suit.

491
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:56,993
Right in the middle.

492
00:31:58,193 --> 00:32:00,435
And moonwalking out the other side.

493
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,838
Stand up if you missed the moonwalking bear.

494
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,199
And this is consistently what happens in studies.

495
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:13,621
About half of the participants, when told to count the passes on the team dressed all

496
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,642
in white, miss the moonwalking bear.

497
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:20,923
Because attention is intensely powerful, it doesn't just focus you on something, it starts

498
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,384
blocking out other things.

499
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:26,846
Your attention is required for neuroplasticity.

500
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:31,267
And not just a little attention, a lot of attention, and strong attention.

501
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,715
And if you multitask a lot, you're going to have issues with attention.

502
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,960
Stand up if you are a frequent multitasker.

503
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:39,022
Don't be shy.

504
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:42,854
I know I've already made you feel bad or tried to for multitasking.

505
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:45,595
Okay, sit down. Right. This is the problem.

506
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,697
I think multitasking is a cultural disease.

507
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:52,059
You feel like you're getting more done, but you're not.

508
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,661
Why do you feel like you're getting more done? Because you're getting challenged.

509
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:58,043
And when you're getting challenged, because it's impossible, by the way.

510
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:00,544
Remember, all you can do is rapidly task switching,

511
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,886
and you felt at the beginning how difficult it is to rapidly task switch.

512
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:10,247
So when you multitask, your IQ essentially drops, you make more mistakes, and you become

513
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:13,870
what Clifford Nass at Stanford calls a sucker for irrelevancy.

514
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,534
You lose your ability to filter out the important from the unimportant.

515
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:22,619
You lose your ability to focus and sustain attention.

516
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,003
That attention ability is required to rewire your brain.

517
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:30,426
So how do you develop your ability to pay attention?

518
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:35,528
One way is with mindfulness and or meditation. You can think of them

519
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:36,928
largely as the same thing.

520
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,209
Stand up if you've ever meditated.

521
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,150
Okay, many of you. Good. So you won't think I'm a freak.

522
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,330
Stand up if you've never meditated. I know it's the other half of you. I'm just

523
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,251
trying to get your brains

524
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:53,291
producing BDNF. Thank you. Okay, those of you who were just standing

525
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,332
may think this sounds really weird and freaky. Don't get your spiritual crap on

526
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,052
me, Crabtree.

527
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:01,696
whatever it is, you may have associations, whether it's martial arts

528
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:05,701
or a particular kind of spirituality. I want you to try to put all those

529
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:10,927
associations aside, because meditation comes in many forms, and essentially the

530
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,869
kind I'm talking about is simply

531
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,231
focusing your attention.

532
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:19,493
Excellent meditators aren't better at sustaining their attention

533
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,955
as much as they're better at noticing when they've lost their attention.

534
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,516
It's kind of like balance.

535
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:29,058
People with great balance, you can't see me but I'm standing on one leg now.

536
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:33,990
people with great balance, it's not that they're just always right perfectly in line,

537
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,090
it's that they notice sooner that they're getting offline and a little to the left,

538
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,471
and they shift back right, and they notice sooner that a little bit of right,

539
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:43,611
and go back left, and that's what people with good attention skills do as well.

540
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,992
They notice sooner that their attention is drifted,

541
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:49,352
and they more quickly return their attention to the object of focus.

542
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:52,813
If you practice doing that, you will rewire your brain

543
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:57,854
to add neurons to your prefrontal cortex and improve your ability to sustain attention.

544
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:03,478
which is why I want you to try just 30 seconds of meditation with me.

545
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:09,641
Just sit comfortably, put your hands on your knees, in your lap, wherever is comfortable

546
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:10,021
for you.

547
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,142
Shut your eyes if you're comfortable doing so.

548
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:14,804
If you're not, you can just look at the chair or the floor in front of you.

549
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:18,626
I'm going to guide you through this a little bit, which means I'm going to talk, which

550
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,026
is going to drive some of you crazy.

551
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:24,769
All you want to do is focus your attention on the sensation of your breath.

552
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,573
Again, I want you to get into your direct sensory circuit.

553
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:33,238
Feel the breath wherever you feel it, in your nose, in your belly, wherever you feel the

554
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:33,519
breath.

555
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:39,466
Just focus on your breath, notice when you're not paying attention, and without judgment,

556
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:42,689
which is important, return your attention to your breath.

557
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:44,972
About 30 seconds of this.

558
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,996
If you're thinking thoughts, don't judge them, just return to the sensation of your breath.

559
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:15,095
Again, just return attention to your breath.

560
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:30,389
Okay, whenever you're ready, you can return your attention to everything around you and open your eyes.

561
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:34,611
And again, if you're anything like me, you feel a little refreshed, a little more relaxed,

562
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:40,334
and you also just started the process of strengthening your inner CEO.

563
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:45,889
Your prefrontal cortex is sometimes called your inner CEO, your prefrontal cortex is

564
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:50,031
this part of your brain right behind the middle of your forehead and it is fantastic brain

565
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:56,733
real estate, responsible for executive function like planning, decision making, initiation

566
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,974
of action, inhibition of action.

567
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,235
Wow, I really want to punch Paul in the face right now, he's such an asshole.

568
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:08,057
When you don't punch Paul in the face in the office, that's your prefrontal cortex helping

569
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:09,978
you out, helping you keep your job.

570
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:16,112
So your prefrontal cortex is awesome brain real estate and in addition to all that other

571
00:37:16,512 --> 00:37:20,595
inner CEO stuff, it helps you focus attention and return attention.

572
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:25,939
And when you practice being mindful or meditating, you add neurons to your prefrontal cortex

573
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:32,123
and you even, studies suggest, remove neurons from your amygdala and your limbic system

574
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:34,545
that gets you upset and irritated with people.

575
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,213
I encourage moments of mindfulness or meditation. If meditation feels weird for you,

576
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,955
try just being mindful moment to moment, which goes like something like this.

577
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:46,536
As you walk to your meeting,

578
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:52,740
don't think anything, just try to feel how your feet feel as they hit the ground as you're walking.

579
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:57,026
Or when you're driving, turn off the music and just focus completely on driving.

580
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,306
How does the steering wheel feel in your hands?

581
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:04,088
Or when your phone rings, instead of immediately, God damn it, I can't take that now, or, ah,

582
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,970
I've got to talk to Jim, listen to the sound of your phone ringing all the way until the

583
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,891
sound is gone, and then answer.

584
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:18,094
Little moments of mindfulness like that reinforce, refresh your brain with that direct sensory

585
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,935
circuit, and again, improve your ability to pay attention.

586
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:28,553
So A is for attention in reach, and attention is awesome and an important prerequisite for

587
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:29,694
rewiring your brain.

588
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:38,660
C is for complexity. Why complexity? Because the more complex the activity you're doing,

589
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,701
the more you're going to rewire your brain, the more benefits you're going to get,

590
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:47,763
which is why neuroplasticity experts recommend if you want to empower this neuroplasticity

591
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:53,264
machinery in your brain, you want to do something very complex that uses as much of your brain

592
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:59,006
as possible. If you're going to play a game, a game that uses your body as a controller is

593
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,366
better than a game that doesn't.

594
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:07,054
You hear neuroplasticity experts often talk about things like learning a language or even

595
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,734
better playing a musical instrument.

596
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:09,595
Why?

597
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:13,897
Because when you play a musical instrument, you're activating so much of your brain.

598
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:19,859
Visual systems are going to read the chords or the notes or pay it or visually see what

599
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,640
the other musicians you're playing with are doing.

600
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,262
Your auditory cortex is obviously heavily involved when you're playing music.

601
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:31,005
Your cerebellum is involved with timing and keeping the beat for you.

602
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:37,349
and your muscular cortex controlling your fingers as you play guitar or drums or whatever it is.

603
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,232
When you're learning a musical instrument, you're activating a lot of different parts of your brain

604
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:45,956
which brings you richer cognitive reserve which helps you prevent against cognitive decline

605
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:52,601
and strengthens your neuroplasticity machinery as neuroplasticity pioneer Mike Mersnick calls it.

606
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,083
So C is for complexity.

607
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,654
If you can rewire your brain with something simple, but you'll get more benefits if you

608
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:04,176
rewire your brain with something complex.

609
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:11,282
So R is for repetition, E is for effort, A is for attention, C is for complexity, and

610
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,363
H is for health.

611
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,148
I'm going to let you in on a shocking revelation from the world of science.

612
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:23,072
Your brain is in your body.

613
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,371
I know, it's weird, isn't it?

614
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:31,014
Not only that, but it's a huge part of your body resource speaking.

615
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,436
Speaking resource-wise.

616
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,758
Your brain is about two or three pounds.

617
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,862
But it takes 20 to 25% of the nutrients, blood sugar, and everything else that you consume.

618
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:47,723
Because it is an intense machine, as I described earlier.

619
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:54,625
So I'm sorry to tell you to be healthy at a conference like GDC, where many of us are not so healthy.

620
00:40:55,205 --> 00:41:00,347
But, this starts with eating right. Basically, any healthy food is good for your brain.

621
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:04,368
In particular, things with vitamin B, C, D, or E.

622
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:09,832
And antioxidants like omega-3 acids are good for your brain,

623
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:13,995
which means you should eat things like fish, drink things like tea,

624
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:18,658
eat berries, walnuts, and perhaps the best news of the whole talk, chocolate.

625
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,862
I've already mentioned exercise.

626
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:29,126
I don't mean to dwell on this, but again, exercise is fantastic for your brain.

627
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:37,507
And as disappointing and problematic as it may be to hear at GDC when there's so many

628
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:42,498
good parties going on, you need to sleep well to learn well and think well.

629
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:49,316
So in studies, if you teach a rat a maze during the day, and during the day it learns left,

630
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,678
left, right, right, left to find the cheese.

631
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:59,282
When you watch that rat brain sleep, at certain stages of sleep, it is running that maze back

632
00:41:59,322 --> 00:42:02,704
and forth way faster than it could in reality, learning that pathway.

633
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:07,046
During the night as it sleeps, that rat brain is going left, left, right, right, left, left,

634
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,228
left, right, right, left, left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, right, left.

635
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:11,429
Your brain will do the same thing when you sleep.

636
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:16,345
So if you want to learn more and add more circuits to your brain, sleep well.

637
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:19,846
So H is for health.

638
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,368
Reach to rewire.

639
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:28,771
With repetition, effort, attention, complexity, and health.

640
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:36,444
Again, because circuits get burned in when you talk out loud about something, and circuits

641
00:42:36,484 --> 00:42:40,185
get burned in when you physically move, I want you to do one more walking one-on-one

642
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,525
with your partner or partners.

643
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:46,227
Just for one minute, stand up, talk about what have you heard so far, how can you apply

644
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,388
this to your brain and your games.

645
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:48,808
Go!

646
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:26,600
Okay, make your way back to your seats, please.

647
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:33,826
Walk back to your seats if you went on a walk, which I appreciate.

648
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,488
Take a seat again.

649
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:38,470
Thank you.

650
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,311
I'm sorry I'm not giving you more time.

651
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:45,195
I would if I had it, but I want to encourage you to continue this stuff after the talk.

652
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:49,139
Talk about this stuff over lunch, and you'll learn it and burn it better.

653
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:51,300
So reach to rewire.

654
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,782
Once you've rewired your brain, this is a use it or lose it situation.

655
00:43:58,162 --> 00:44:01,644
Circuits in your brain that you don't lose gradually wither away.

656
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:07,547
I like the phrasing work it or waste it a little better, again, because it goes back

657
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:08,288
to that effort.

658
00:44:08,368 --> 00:44:12,170
If you're putting effort into something, it's a signal to your brain, you need this.

659
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,270
Let's build this up.

660
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:16,332
Video games can help.

661
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:18,073
which is great news.

662
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,014
I'm sure you all don't need to be convinced this, but

663
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:25,976
video games don't just rewire your brains in evil ways the way that some of

664
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:30,218
the general population thinks, and the media certainly seems to think. More and

665
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:33,999
more studies are showing that when you play video games, you build beneficial

666
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,500
circuits in your brains.

667
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,381
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal, I think just a few days ago,

668
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:40,902
describes some of these studies.

669
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:48,622
Any game will rewire your brain. These games, or these sites, are designed in particular

670
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:54,947
to rewire your brain for the better. I do not claim to have done an industry-wide, thorough

671
00:44:55,027 --> 00:45:00,991
survey of all braining training software out there, but these are some of the options available

672
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:07,756
to you. And basically, the higher on the screen, the more the activities seem to be research-based.

673
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:15,092
So, resources for you to consider using to rewire your brain include the games you're

674
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,838
already playing and maybe some of these.

675
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,666
We're going to go towards making plans in just a minute, but I have a couple of minutes

676
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:31,612
here for Q&A, which I want to do before you all make your neuroplasticity plans.

677
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:35,976
So for the sake of the recording, hi everybody watching on GDC Vault.

678
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:41,642
Please walk up to a microphone if you have a question and I will do my best to answer.

679
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,042
Yes, sir.

680
00:45:42,988 --> 00:45:50,072
Actually it wasn't a question. I just wanted to reinforce two things that you said that I knew intuitively, but I didn't understand the reason for it.

681
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:56,975
Number one, my wife, who like a lot of people, is under a lot of stress. We have two teenage sons.

682
00:45:57,475 --> 00:45:58,996
She uses a lot of lip balm.

683
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:06,760
It never occurred to me that maybe there's like a self-medicating relaxation thing that's going on there.

684
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:11,326
The second thing is, I don't know how many of you watched, I used to watch a show called

685
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:12,067
The West Wing.

686
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:14,370
I'm a politics junkie, I loved it.

687
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:18,536
If there's one thing they do in that show, it's walk and talk.

688
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:23,523
And they worked in a high-stress environment in the White House, so maybe there was intuitively

689
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:24,405
something going on there.

690
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:29,042
Awesome comments, and thank you. I think a lot of us know some of this stuff intuitively,

691
00:46:29,142 --> 00:46:34,788
and part of what I want to do is give you scientific backing to ground and instill

692
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:37,751
more motivation into some of the things you're probably already doing. Yes, sir.

693
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:43,277
So I've been very aware of the multitasking problem for a while now because I've noticed that as a

694
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:47,540
programmer some of the changes that I make sometimes take 5, 10 minutes to compile, run,

695
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,403
implement, stuff like that. And I find myself going off and responding to messages, writing

696
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:56,527
emails and stuff like that. And it's a problem I've been trying to address but I can't find a

697
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:00,590
good solution because I have to come back to the original problem. I can't do anything while

698
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,131
that's happening.

699
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,861
Are you looking for a suggestion? I'm looking for a suggestion, yes.

700
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:09,403
So I feel your pain, first of all. I come from a programming background and

701
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:13,884
despite all my former colleagues at Intel making processors faster and

702
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:17,086
faster, compiles still take a while because we keep writing more and more code.

703
00:47:19,563 --> 00:47:24,405
What comes to mind is the concept of flow. Stand up if you're familiar with flow.

704
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:27,166
Mike Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow.

705
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:30,147
Okay, many of you. Very quickly for the rest of you,

706
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,968
if you sustain attention on something that is challenging,

707
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:37,930
high level of challenge, and you have a high level of skill to do it,

708
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,731
and you stay focused for about twenty minutes, you get into what is called a flow channel.

709
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:46,797
speaking, all the right gates are open and closed in your brain.

710
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:56,731
you get in the zone, everything is clicking. If you've ever looked up at your watch and been like,

711
00:47:56,771 --> 00:48:02,052
well, is it that time already? I got to go. I had no idea. Then you've been in flow. Flow is an

712
00:48:02,352 --> 00:48:07,853
awesome, productive and happy state to be in. Peak experience is what Csikszentmihalyi wanted

713
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:13,715
to study and he came up with this concept of flow. So the difficulty about flow is that it

714
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:17,636
takes about 20 minutes to get into it. And guess how long to get out of it?

715
00:48:18,844 --> 00:48:21,307
maybe not as bad as you think, it's one or two minutes

716
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:22,227
to get out of it.

717
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:25,190
Which means a five minute compile takes you out of it.

718
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,293
So if you ever have a disruption of more than two

719
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,215
minutes and you go back to what you were doing, where you were

720
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,656
in flow, what do you think and feel?

721
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:32,897
Where was I?

722
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:38,039
right? Where was I is the loss of flow and it's killing your productivity and your happiness.

723
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,448
So the suggestion is this, not easily done, but the suggestion is this, you're writing code,

724
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:48,795
you hit compile, stay mentally on the code.

725
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:55,145
look at object design, do some inspecting, think about which assertions you're going

726
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:59,407
to put into which functions next, think about how you're going to test the code you've just

727
00:48:59,447 --> 00:48:59,667
written.

728
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:05,551
If you can stay on the same subject during that interruption, then when your compile

729
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,592
is done, you're right back in the flow.

730
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,694
Not easily done, but I hope that helps.

731
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:13,436
Few more minutes.

732
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,596
I may not get to all of you.

733
00:49:14,616 --> 00:49:15,417
I'm just going to warn you now.

734
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:15,937
Next, please.

735
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:24,680
This all sounds great and I'd love to try it, but when I get home, I have a husband and two small children and I'm the CEO of a company.

736
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:32,383
And when I get back home, it becomes, I need to get the kids out the door because they have to go to kindergarten and she needs her backpack and she needs her shoes.

737
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:37,065
And this one has a tummy ache and my mom is on the phone and she needs to find out what day she's coming.

738
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:41,587
And you know, you get caught up with your life and what can you do?

739
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:43,048
Can you do this in small doses?

740
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:44,568
What suggestions do you have?

741
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:49,323
you can do this in small doses. In fact, I would recommend, you're about to write

742
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:51,264
neuroplasticity plans for yourself.

743
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:56,868
In your plan, I suggest you write down, at most, one thing you want to work on.

744
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,536
Because what many of us ambitious people do is write down eight things we want to work

745
00:50:01,616 --> 00:50:03,917
on and we fail at all eight, we get frustrated and we give up.

746
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:09,738
If you pick one thing and you focus on it repeatedly for a month, you will rewire your

747
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:09,998
brain.

748
00:50:10,598 --> 00:50:13,698
Studies have shown physical changes in brain in as short as two weeks.

749
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:19,380
So, the other thing to try to do is to pick a goal that is intrinsically valued.

750
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,660
It's important to you, not your family or your kids or your husband or anyone else.

751
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,063
and an approach goal. Something you want to do as opposed to

752
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,386
I want to stop doing this. All of that helps you succeed

753
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:35,331
with your goals. Then try to lower the hurdles to doing it and integrate it

754
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:36,893
into your life. So here's an example.

755
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:41,867
As some people may know who saw me talk last year or the year before, I'm very into the

756
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:42,767
science of happiness.

757
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:45,288
Gratitude is extremely important for happiness.

758
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:46,029
Easy to do.

759
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:50,150
If you make a habit of feeling and expressing gratitude, you end up being a more happy person.

760
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:56,072
So I got into the rhythm of with my wife and three-year-old child, every time we sit down

761
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:58,033
at home at dinner, we hold hands.

762
00:50:58,113 --> 00:50:59,293
I know, cheesy, whatever.

763
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:03,675
We hold hands and we say, what's one thing we're each grateful for before we eat dinner?

764
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:07,676
As we have done that for more than a month, it is now a habit.

765
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:11,517
Habit equals brain circuit, essentially.

766
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:15,962
Habit equals brain circuit that you don't have to decide to do with your prefrontal cortex.

767
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:19,206
Your basal ganglia deep in the middle of your brain says,

768
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:21,429
time to do this, I'm habituated to do this.

769
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:25,894
Which means that even when my wife and I are running around stressed out and like,

770
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:27,116
oh my god.

771
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:31,478
Crap, gee, you just quit Intel. What are we going to do about health insurance? We're massively stressed out.

772
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:34,860
Are you really going to be able to make people happy for a living? This is insane.

773
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,961
We're going to be pouring on the street in no time. Let's eat.

774
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,342
My three-year-old says, hey, we didn't say what we were grateful for.

775
00:51:40,362 --> 00:51:42,343
Oh, man, awesome.

776
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:49,486
So if you can wire those habits in just one small change at a time,

777
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:51,687
it's less effort and it integrates with your life.

778
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:54,909
Again, more easily said than done, but does that help?

779
00:51:57,344 --> 00:52:00,547
I apologize, this is going to be the last question, and I'm happy to stick around for

780
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:02,069
the rest of you, but next please.

781
00:52:02,729 --> 00:52:07,434
So one, thank you for at least trying to bring this to this audience.

782
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:15,876
Culturally speaking, you know, working in game development, everybody wants to collaborate all the time and multitask and da-da-da.

783
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:21,098
So, you know, I work on a team for myself, you know, trying to get into that flow state.

784
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:28,241
I'm an artist, is important, but I am interrupted about every 15 minutes to discuss something or deal with something.

785
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,742
You know, is there, do you have any ideas about that?

786
00:52:31,572 --> 00:52:35,834
Again, easier said than done, seems to be the theme here on how do you apply this, which

787
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:40,077
is really, again, why I'm asking all of you in a minute, how are you going to apply this?

788
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:46,061
But what I've suggested to people, and some have applied, is to communicate about Flow

789
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:46,842
and getting into Flow.

790
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:51,665
I presented this material for years, not this exact material, but related material, including

791
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:57,568
Flow at Intel for years, which led to me sitting in my OpenCube environment and people walking

792
00:52:57,649 --> 00:53:01,071
up and I swear to God, first words out of their mouth, are you in Flow?

793
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:02,399
Awesome.

794
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:07,384
Because I could say, yeah, I'm really, can it wait or is it less than a minute?

795
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:10,807
And if it is less than a minute, you can do it and write back where you were.

796
00:53:11,327 --> 00:53:17,553
And if it's longer, most people say, ah, I can send an email, it's fine.

797
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:21,897
A group I presented to a couple of weeks ago, a person sent me a picture a few days later

798
00:53:21,977 --> 00:53:23,218
of their flow flag.

799
00:53:24,354 --> 00:53:27,756
They took a little dowel and cut out just a piece of paper,

800
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:29,637
and in small writing it said, can it wait?

801
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:31,518
I'm in giant letters flow.

802
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,820
And they stick it up on their cubicle when they're in flow.

803
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,802
Now, you're not always going to be in flow.

804
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:39,343
And for many of you, it's your job to get interrupted, right?

805
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:41,445
So you can't just say, don't talk to me.

806
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,646
But you can give signals to people.

807
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:47,529
And if nothing else, turn off your automatic interruption

808
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,969
machines.

809
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,071
The little Outlook thing that pops up and says,

810
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:52,052
you got an email?

811
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:53,213
You want to be distracted with this?

812
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:57,536
I'll show you the first few words just to suck you in.

813
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:57,997
Right?

814
00:53:58,137 --> 00:53:59,138
Turn it off.

815
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,620
Turn off IM.

816
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,381
Put yourself on do not disturb.

817
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,542
Go to a coffee shop.

818
00:54:04,622 --> 00:54:05,402
Work from home.

819
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:07,924
Whatever it is, try to block out times

820
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,065
where you don't get interrupted.

821
00:54:09,406 --> 00:54:12,088
And then allow times when it's like, yeah, green flag is up.

822
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:13,228
Interrupt me all you want.

823
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,271
Again, easier said than done, but I hope that helps.

824
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:17,912
OK.

825
00:54:18,624 --> 00:54:20,585
Time for you to make a plan.

826
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:23,968
This is a plan about who you want to be.

827
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:30,893
This is nothing short of miraculous to me. You can think or even just imagine things

828
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:35,876
and rewire your brain. Because for your brain, the difference between doing something and

829
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:41,360
imagining something is very slight. If I had half of you practice shooting foul shots on

830
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,483
a basketball court and the other half just imagine doing so, the imaginers would improve

831
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:51,647
almost as much as those who practiced. So you can literally think your way into being

832
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:52,187
a new person.

833
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:59,310
If you do something repeatedly and reach to rewire over the next month, you will rewire

834
00:54:59,350 --> 00:54:59,730
your brain.

835
00:55:01,151 --> 00:55:02,591
So now the question is to you.

836
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:04,352
Who do you want to be?

837
00:55:06,334 --> 00:55:06,974
What do you want to do?

838
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:14,178
Take a minute or two, write down a plan, then I'm going to have you talk about it and I'm

839
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:15,218
going to summarize and we'll end.

840
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:20,014
So about a minute and a half or so, who do you want to be?

841
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:23,820
What one thing do you want to do repeatedly

842
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,601
over the next month?

843
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,461
Hopefully your goal is something where you can notice small progress. Don't be over-ambitious

844
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:18,324
with this. Don't necessarily focus on something you're terrible at. Think about something you

845
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:22,286
can make progress on pretty quickly which reinforces the progress you're making.

846
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,681
Okay, now, because studies show that when you publicly share a plan, you are much more

847
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:40,104
likely to follow through on that plan, I want you all to publicly share your plans with

848
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:45,307
your walking one-on-one partner, and later, I encourage you to post this on Facebook,

849
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:46,928
Twitter, wherever you want.

850
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,130
If you publicly share your intention, you're much more likely to follow through.

851
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:54,053
So one last walking one-on-one for about 30 seconds.

852
00:56:54,133 --> 00:56:55,434
Stand up, talk to your partner.

853
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,094
What are you going to do?

854
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:32,793
All right, about 10 seconds left.

855
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,335
Make your way back to your seats if you can, please.

856
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:51,470
All right, wrap up and sit down, please.

857
00:57:53,993 --> 00:57:56,215
I'm sorry I'm not giving you more time.

858
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,363
But again, I encourage you to continue these conversations later.

859
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:06,427
But I have to get you out of here on time by wrapping up as follows.

860
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:10,870
You have every bit of potential for growth that this little baby has.

861
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,992
If you make your plan and follow through on your plan for the next month,

862
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:19,295
you will physically rewire your brain for the better.

863
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:26,639
So the problem I came here to address is that I think you all focus so much on improving

864
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:31,102
your games that you don't put enough focus on improving your brains.

865
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:35,986
Science gives us a truly miraculous solution.

866
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:37,707
Neuroplasticity.

867
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:43,452
The ability to rewire your brain in ways that you want to.

868
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:48,469
And neuroplasticity can rewire your brain in ways that you don't want to, so you have

869
00:58:48,509 --> 00:58:53,714
to be careful about what you're doing and thinking and rewiring your brain, which is

870
00:58:53,754 --> 00:58:56,256
why I want you to be intentional about rewiring your brain.

871
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:57,538
Who do you want to be?

872
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,447
Remember that neuroplasticity requires reach, repetition, effort, attention, complexity,

873
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:07,268
and health.

874
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:09,563
Reach to Rewire.

875
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:13,368
I would love to hear from you all about how this works or

876
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:13,928
doesn't work.

877
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:15,470
Questions I can help with.

878
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,652
Here are various ways to get in touch with me.

879
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,335
And some of my business cards are up here on the corners of

880
00:59:20,355 --> 00:59:22,778
the stage and by that video camera in the back.

881
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:25,381
I would love to hear from you how all this works.

882
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:27,062
Reach to Rewire.

883
00:59:27,883 --> 00:59:29,005
Thank you so much for coming.
