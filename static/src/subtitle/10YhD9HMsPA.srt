1
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:10,264
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:11,345
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

3
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:12,186
It's a great turnout.

4
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:20,231
Before I start, turn off your noise-making devices, and don't forget to fill out your evaluations.

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:21,932
Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:28,396
My name is Derek Liu, and this is Make the Trailer Before the Game, a marketing-first way to prototype.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:40,940
So my whole goal here is just to help you make more marketable games and for you to be more confident that you have a marketable game before you're just neck deep in production.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,160
So tell me if this sounds familiar.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,401
You can just nod.

10
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,762
You're just about finished with your game.

11
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:52,263
You've put in a lot of work, and you realize you need to make a trailer.

12
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:54,644
And you're like, oh, oh.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:07,276
what I show my trailer, which this is a terrible feeling to have because the less clear your answer in that moment, the less marketable your game probably is.

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,382
I mean it's also hard just work on your own projects too, but still

15
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:15,346
This is also really bad to discover late in production.

16
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:44,106
everything stands out, or like Papers, Please, you have this game, it's just so singular, this thing that's never existed before, and it's all about stamping passports, so you kind of can't help but show the thing that makes it look exciting.

17
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:51,408
But for a lot of games, their defining features are not immediately apparent.

18
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:57,430
This is my sister-in-law's dog, she sends these pictures sometimes, and says, which side is which?

19
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:07,732
all right is the head on the right on the left side or the right side sure for left sure for right

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,280
Anyway, that's an aside.

21
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,442
So yeah, a lot of games, their defining feature is not really apparent.

22
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:25,745
Or they're just kind of outside the norm, because maybe they combine two things that maybe you're not even sure if they should go together, but you've done it anyway.

23
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:35,149
In a lot of cases, you're just iterating on a popular genre, like Metroidvania, Legend of Zelda, cozy life sims, City Boulder, Roguelike.

24
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:38,190
So a lot of times, the answer isn't really clear.

25
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:49,457
And also, if your game is iterating on existing genre or genres, it's super easy to make a 90 second trailer that just never shows what's unique about your game.

26
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,318
Just like getting to the basics of gameplay.

27
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,660
It's really easy to do and kind of scary.

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:05,169
So wouldn't it be great if you just knew what should go into your trailer in advance and you're confident that your game is more marketable, which also, by the way, again, my name is Derek Liu.

29
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,810
I've worked on a lot of game trailers.

30
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,951
These are just a few of them.

31
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:16,338
I've been doing this for eight plus years, and I think a lot about what games need to do to show off their unique selling points.

32
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:22,052
Okay, so usually this is like a gross oversimplification of how this goes.

33
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,356
Make the game, make the trailer.

34
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,080
But what if...

35
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:39,785
which I know technically it's more like this, you're making the game and then at some point along the way you're like crap I need to make a trailer and that's more how it works but that's just me being pedantic.

36
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:52,595
Anyway I came up with the idea for this talk because there's an interview with Lucas Pope on Noteplip where he was talking about how when he thinks of game ideas he thinks about the trailer first and he says

37
00:03:53,936 --> 00:04:00,819
if he's prototyping and if he can't imagine right now a cool trailer for this, it's probably not worth pursuing, which this is just the way he works.

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:17,787
And I also interviewed him for this talk as well as a bunch of developers from these games because they've either done something similar where they think about the trailer very early or made videos to kind of help them through production or at least just thought of it.

39
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:23,151
So why think of it when you're prototyping?

40
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:27,994
Well, because first of all, trailer, essential marketing asset.

41
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,275
Of course I'd say that.

42
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,276
Shows what your game looks like.

43
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,458
Quickly shows the experience of your game.

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:46,122
communicates your game's vibe, shows your game's unique and similar qualities to other games, and it gets people interested and or excited, at least hopefully.

45
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:59,465
And so when you're making a prototype, you know, you're trying to brainstorm ideas, determine the experience slash fantasy of the game, whether, I don't know, you're a cat rescuer or something like that.

46
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:23,697
find the mood and tone, establish the themes, design the steps in the game's loop, look at the marketability of the idea, get buy-in from yourself, the team, and money people, and research genre viability, which what I'm going to do now is I'm going to bold all the things that a trailer will help you to do.

47
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:30,506
which you probably thought it was gonna be all of them, but I don't think it helps research on reliability.

48
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,287
But everything else, it can really help you with.

49
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:43,173
So another thing Lucas said was, when he's thinking of ideas, is can I pitch this game without comparing it to other games or letting someone play it for a couple of hours?

50
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:51,458
Which gets to this key point that game prototypes have some weaknesses.

51
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:57,680
A lot of times they can just be like a bunch of mechanics, sort of things that don't necessarily cohere.

52
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,121
They can be very rough and unpolished.

53
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:06,064
And it can take a long time to explain what makes them good.

54
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:11,787
You know, some things only really work when you combine all the things together.

55
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:20,011
And if you need to take that much time, that means that it's going to be harder to compress into a trailer, and therefore harder to just pitch.

56
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:24,519
So as an example, two very good games.

57
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:29,282
We have Unsighted and Untitled Goose Game.

58
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,625
If you haven't played Unsighted, it's a very, very good game.

59
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,226
One of my favorites from recent years.

60
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:42,612
So the things that make this game good are, as Metroidvania, Legend of Zelda design, nonlinear dungeon order.

61
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:51,401
post-apocalyptic world, weapon variety, tight controls, parry system, secrets, pets, and there's a lot more.

62
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:54,942
And in Untitled Goose Game, of course, the pitch is you're a horrible goose.

63
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:02,023
You know, these are both great games, but you can see why one's just easier to market overall.

64
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:03,684
Not saying Unsighted shouldn't exist.

65
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:04,704
It's a great game.

66
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:09,545
It's just, I could see why it'd be hard to market.

67
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:15,866
So trailer forces you to ask, what does this game look like when it's being played?

68
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:21,811
Which is really, it seems like a small distinction between just like, what does the game look like versus what does it look like when it's being played?

69
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:26,755
But like, it's also really easy to make a trailer where you have no idea how it plays.

70
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,757
You just have like a bunch of camera movements through the environment.

71
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:30,978
You're like, what's actually the game?

72
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:37,123
It also forces you to ask, how quickly can we show this game as unique selling points?

73
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:46,214
what audio and visuals will convey the game's story, and how will this game look different from its inspirations.

74
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:52,761
And Echo from Outerloop Games said, just so much of making a game is trying to sell the idea.

75
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,885
You're trying to get people to buy in before they play.

76
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,977
And so as an example, not all games can be easily described with words.

77
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,598
So here's two excerpts from reviews for Viewfinder.

78
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:13,763
Viewfinder is a first-person puzzle game that tasks you with placing photographs over existing geography to modify your terrain, allowing you to reach the stage's exit.

79
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,485
If you've played Viewfinder, that's pretty accurate, but not very evocative.

80
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:25,009
Or this is a world where you can bring photos to life, the 2D image becoming a 3D reality when you place it within the puzzle world.

81
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:29,133
Even still, it's a little bit hard to conjure images.

82
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:33,834
So here's a screenshot, which even then doesn't 100% get it across.

83
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:37,535
So here's a really early video that they released.

84
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:44,496
So the Viewfinder team, they spent six months making a prototype with the idea of making it into a trailer or a video montage.

85
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:48,697
And they did this because this game has to be seen to be understood.

86
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:52,978
And also, puzzle games are not super popular, so they needed a really strong way to pitch.

87
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,479
So that's why they really focused on

88
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,640
getting this whole thing together.

89
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:03,224
Because a trailer boils down the game and explains it visually.

90
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,366
This is the trailer I did for Noita.

91
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:16,073
And it's also a good tool to use when prototyping, because a trailer concept is a cheap framework to brainstorm ideas.

92
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:21,377
This is a screenshot of an animatic I did for an Among Us trailer, just in my office, filming on my iPhone.

93
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:26,099
And I have this quote from Jeff from Mediatonic.

94
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:33,043
He says, a trailer is a short-circuit way to think of the end product instead of getting bogged down in details, features, and mechanics.

95
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:37,945
And it really just forces you to think of the emotion or the holistic experience.

96
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:45,908
And another reason it can be good to think about early is because the core themes and premise can be gameplay agnostic.

97
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:46,908
I mean, it depends on your game.

98
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:55,733
But so Eka from Outerloop Games was saying that the themes of Thirsty Suitors were always the same, but the gameplay went through a lot of changes.

99
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:02,437
So having this sort of core to it helped things along the way.

100
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,250
and also describe a game based off its features.

101
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,153
Not super interesting.

102
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:16,342
This is just a trailer I made for Firewatch as an example of just the worst possible way to sell Firewatch.

103
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,660
And it's based off of trailers that I've watched.

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,222
I'm a little bit silly here, but there are a lot of games that just kind of point out features.

105
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:30,904
And it's not the best way to sell a game, especially with Firewatch.

106
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,165
So here's an example.

107
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:42,228
So we have Songs of Glimmerwick, which has a lot of moments which feel the same as other games, or superficially.

108
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:42,708
Every game

109
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:43,728
is

110
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,794
And they did this to hook the audience.

111
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:18,437
They created this moment for the trailer, and they added it to the game later on.

112
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:23,601
It did not exist before they were like, crap, we need to make a trailer and find a way to make it hooky.

113
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:28,544
So if you start off with this, and then you show the stuff from before, way more interesting.

114
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,587
Because the trailer helps you make standout moments.

115
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:41,382
You know, you don't want people to watch your game trailer or look at your game and just think like, I've kind of seen this before, but the art style is different.

116
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:44,944
You know, you want them to have at least a few things that make it memorable and unique.

117
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:52,289
And so yeah, Jeff, or sorry, Daniel from Eastshade said, I think making trailers is conducive to making memorable quests.

118
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:56,672
You guarantee you have at least one great set piece moment in the game.

119
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,755
And so here are more things that a trailer can reveal about your game.

120
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,938
does the art style stand out?

121
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,741
How visual are the game's hooks?

122
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:10,865
How does the game visually tell the story?

123
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,888
Is this interesting enough to hook an audience?

124
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,974
And how difficult is it to understand when watching but not playing?

125
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:28,429
because the worst case scenario is just art doesn't stand out, hooks aren't visible, story isn't told visually, and it's difficult to understand the gameplay.

126
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:35,670
Now, right now, some of you are probably thinking, but Derek, I want to make my game, which is not very visible, has really strong gameplay, and I get it.

127
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,012
But this exercise is still worth doing because if you have one of those games, which is not like super trailerable,

128
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:52,615
Thinking about this early would force you to think of maybe some solutions that might make your job a little bit easier by the time it comes to market your game.

129
00:12:54,555 --> 00:13:02,938
Instead of just thinking like, huh, there's all these things that the player does in the game that when it happens, you can't really tell that it was the player causing it.

130
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:06,299
That's not a good feeling to have when you have to make visuals for a trailer.

131
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:14,392
Because when you're watching a trailer, or people are watching a trailer, they're looking for on-screen feedback, which reflects the player's actions.

132
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,555
And you can build that in while making the game.

133
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:33,125
And so this is why Lens of a Trailer is a great tool, because you just have to pick and choose or create the images which will anchor your game in a space that's familiar and show enough of its hooks or unique selling points to make it look worth playing.

134
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:42,157
So it's really a difference between just having a bunch of mechanics and a bunch of mechanics which have visuals that correspond to them.

135
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:47,001
So here are a few ways that Atreya will help development.

136
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:57,130
First is that it sells the game to you, the team, the investors, aligns the team around a common goal, establishes a theme, story, mood, and tone.

137
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,953
makes you think of the game's visuals and readability, and I'll go down each of these one by one.

138
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,734
So first is sell the game.

139
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:08,335
It sounds like something you have to do last, but actually you have to do it first.

140
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:17,299
And Lucas gave me this really good point, which was just that games are so terrible for so long that it helps to have a vision of the finished game.

141
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,503
Sell it to yourself, and then you probably also have to sell it to people who will give you money to let you develop the game.

142
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:33,942
But selling it to yourself is really important, so then that you can stay sane when it's broken for two or three years or something.

143
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,744
And so aligning the team around a common goal.

144
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:41,607
So the example I have here is for Transistor, which is Supergiant Games' second game.

145
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:44,850
So after Bastion, they had a lot of trouble working on Transistor.

146
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,792
They were just floundering, trying to figure out what they were making.

147
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:51,415
They liked their basic setting, but the other things, like the protagonist, just weren't clicking.

148
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:54,577
The atmosphere, the story, and premise were all just up in the air.

149
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,331
And so the problem was they just didn't feel what they had, and they weren't really excited.

150
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:07,334
And Greg told me when I interviewed him, he said, if you're not excited at the start, it's not great to assume you're going to get excited later.

151
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:09,534
It's a big gamble.

152
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:18,057
And so meanwhile, engineers were experimenting with gameplay mechanics of this mix of turn-based and real-time action, but they didn't really have a game to fit it into.

153
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:26,028
And so Darren Korb, their composer and audio director, suggested they make a tone video since they couldn't make a vertical slice.

154
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:30,972
So Greg would write it, Darren did music, Gen Z did art, and Logan did voiceover.

155
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:38,278
And there's no sound here, but just the picture, just imagine some transistor music.

156
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,521
So they worked on it off and on for like a month.

157
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,059
and it forced them to get really specific.

158
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:59,054
So Jen had to design the transistor, Red and the antagonist environments, and Darren had to nail the musical tone, Greg had to land on the speaking voice style, and this was the first coherent, holistic expression of the world, the atmosphere, and the story.

159
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:04,400
And if you've played Transistor and you watch this, it feels really spot on.

160
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:08,894
And then the team was excited, yay!

161
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:23,182
And the designers and engineers also had an easier time doing their job because now they had this story to work within where they had this idea of the weapon absorbing powers from people and then that informed the design of the mechanics.

162
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:29,265
And Greg just said, work just goes slowly if you don't know what you're building when you're building it.

163
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:36,570
People really need to understand what they're making, and a trailer can show you where you're going even though you're not there yet.

164
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:45,494
And also, if you have that trailer or mock-up, you can just always ask yourself, does this serve the goal?

165
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:56,899
You could be experimenting with different mechanics and ideas, and if you have no particular goal, then of course you're probably gonna end up in any which way if you're not being directed.

166
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,703
And so as far as thinking of visuals and readability, I mean, there's so many ways you can go with this.

167
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:10,987
But, you know, thinking of a trailer just, like, forces you to think of visuals instead of just mechanics.

168
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,588
So, like, really simple example.

169
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:21,993
If you're making a horror game, you could just look at a whole bunch of other horror games, look at their color palettes, and see how you might differentiate yours from what else is on the market.

170
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:39,233
Or by the same tone, say you're making a thriller game, but not a horror game, then if you have two visuals, you can decide, is this more horrific or is this more thriller-like, and then make your decisions accordingly.

171
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:45,518
But if you don't have that shared vision, then it's harder to decide between those two sorts of things.

172
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:51,503
Just another simple example of just designing for something to be watched,

173
00:17:52,795 --> 00:18:21,368
versus played is um... the this is for walking dead season one and firewatch so uh... some people worked on the games and the dialogue selection system in firewatch was designed to be watched by other people because you can see when the little highlight thing hovers over you can see what the player is deciding on or they might linger on like hmm should I choose this one maybe not whereas walking dead when you have the face buttons you have no idea

174
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,870
what the player is thinking, what they're deciding between.

175
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,893
So that's like one small example of sort of designing for the audience, not player.

176
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:35,235
Okay, so how do you make a trailer prototype?

177
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,656
There's a bunch of different ways you can do it.

178
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:44,440
And depending, you might need an artist, writer, composer, sound designer, video editor, programmer, designer.

179
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:50,724
But so we have written description, mood boards, or Rippomatic, which I'll explain.

180
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:57,047
animatic sketches and music, game prototype clips, and vertical slice.

181
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:02,189
So the good news is the game doesn't have to be playable.

182
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,871
So if you're doing a written description, here are the ingredients.

183
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:08,611
Who is the player?

184
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:11,092
What fantasy is this fulfilling?

185
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,053
What is the mood and tone?

186
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:15,934
What is the emotional experience?

187
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,676
And what are the steps in the gameplay loop?

188
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,776
Those are the basic ingredients.

189
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:26,339
Now, if you want to get even more specific, what are the scenes of the trailer?

190
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,600
And this is in order.

191
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,722
This is just a template for making a trailer.

192
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:35,546
Hokey opening shot, and I'll have another example of this too in different words.

193
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:45,774
Introduction of the premise and mechanics, escalation and complications that arise, climactic moments, variety and scope, and then a fun ending, maybe.

194
00:19:47,148 --> 00:20:11,931
or another way to describe it is I could say this called this genre hook content which what I mean by that is beginning of your trailer like first 5 seconds you need people to know what genre space you're in then for most of the trailer you're showing why your game is different and at the end maybe if there's time you can say oh 50 boss battles and skins and stuff like that whereas usually a lot of indie game

195
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:16,975
Trailers start off with weapons and skins and environments and I'm like, no, what?

196
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,136
I don't even know what you're selling yet.

197
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:19,997
So establish a genre.

198
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:25,161
Explain your hook and then get the content if there's time.

199
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,624
Because people can't care that there's a lot of your game until they know what the game is.

200
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:32,326
So explain point by point.

201
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,067
So what is the game genre?

202
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,468
What opening shot would signal that?

203
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,917
How is this game unique within that genre?

204
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,920
Why is that interesting and or noteworthy?

205
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,402
Because it could be just different, but not interesting.

206
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:46,864
How does this game challenge me?

207
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,507
And does this game have depth and longevity?

208
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,329
So that's the template.

209
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,131
Just follow that when you're making trailers.

210
00:20:56,215 --> 00:21:00,199
So what I do, as far as I'm concerned, I make the exact same trailer over and over and over again.

211
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,101
I've been doing it for the last seven or eight years.

212
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,144
Okay, so written description.

213
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:06,706
This is just my mock-up idea for my talk.

214
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:10,150
So imagine, opening shot, a cat trap is open.

215
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,052
A cat takes the bait and they get trapped.

216
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:16,256
Introduction, voiceover, there are over half a million homeless cats in New York City.

217
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:20,638
and then you're showing the player trapping cats, getting them neutered, releasing them, posting them on social media.

218
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,439
Escalation, more difficult to capture cats.

219
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,141
Full shelters, finding fosters, getting donations, and TNRing more cats.

220
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:35,324
And then the climax, you get better shelters and facilities, more cities, more traps, cats in homes.

221
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:39,225
Pro, very cheap, doesn't require a specific skill set.

222
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:40,846
Con, no visuals.

223
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,647
But good for brainstorming.

224
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:57,890
mood board, ripomatic, this is just like a collection of visuals that evoke a mood, vibe, setting, genre, photos, movie stills, books, illustrations, color palettes, sound effects, music, voiceover, whatever you want.

225
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,812
Bring it together and then help people feel the idea of this game.

226
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:10,959
So Rippomatic is this like film industry term where you just like take a bunch of stuff from other sources.

227
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:14,643
So this is actually a fan trailer from YouTube before the Obi-Wan Kenobi show came out.

228
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:21,810
They just took this film where Ewan McGregor is like in the desert and they intercut it with shots of Star Wars and had some Star Wars music.

229
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,892
But this is basically what a Rippomatic is.

230
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:43,112
And so the pros here are strong visuals, it's evocative, communicates the message in many ways, but it can require video editing skills, it can create unrealistic expectations, and it's hard to visualize gameplay because you're cobbling it together from a bunch of stuff.

231
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:50,619
But I could easily see like taking some things from other games like a lever being pulled and then a door opening and another one or something like that.

232
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:55,489
So next is animatic, which this is like the transistor example.

233
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,792
The pro is that it's bespoke and specific to the idea.

234
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:13,922
And the con is that relies on art skills to make it look good and maybe having a composer or video editor, but you could just take the text description that you have and then turn them into scenes and make a piece.

235
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,834
And so the next one is game prototype clips, where you're just making game assets to create the shots in the trailer.

236
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:22,716
They don't have to function cohesively.

237
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:30,522
They could just be little scenes that on their own, it worked just well enough that you could capture it and then put it into your editing software.

238
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:33,124
It just has to look enough like gameplay to be captured.

239
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:46,061
And so Daniel from Eastshade said that when they were making the trailer for Songs of Glimmerwick, they basically scripted out what they thought would make a good trailer, and then they made the requisite content and assets for those shots.

240
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:52,124
And like I said, in some cases they wrote entire new quests around the beats that they thought would make good trailer shots.

241
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:59,308
So trailer design is really just designing mechanics which can concisely show in a trailer a shot that will interest people.

242
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:04,384
And then the pro looks a lot more like the game.

243
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:07,046
The game only has to work well enough.

244
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:10,929
The con is a lot more people required and technical skills.

245
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,132
And then last one is Vertical Slice.

246
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,673
So this is the trailer for Soup Pot.

247
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:18,515
They made the prototype with the trailer in mind.

248
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:21,497
We thought, okay, what are the parts of the gameplay loop which need to be shown?

249
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:28,523
And instead of doing gray box, they just used existing assets and spent about two weeks making it.

250
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,256
This is not displaying.

251
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:32,017
Oh, no, that's fine.

252
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,278
And actually it was playable.

253
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:43,506
And so, yeah, the pros can be played, much closer to the final vision of the game, but it's time and resource heavy.

254
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:44,827
Okay.

255
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,668
So here's some prompts to help you structure your trailer.

256
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:48,269
This is from

257
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:51,499
When we announced the game, how do we want to do it?

258
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,540
What do we want people to know?

259
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,722
Which I use a slide from their title card, because this is a really good copy for a trailer.

260
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:06,004
Next is, if we have this mechanic, what will it look like in the trailer?

261
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,906
And if that mechanic is not visible to the viewer, what changes will make it so?

262
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:15,368
Next one, what emotions should the viewer feel?

263
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:30,140
and what does our audience want to see, which this doesn't have to be like an existing fan base, it could just be a type of game player, like someone who likes roguelikes, what do they want to see in this new iteration.

264
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:37,243
Next is, if you showed someone this trailer, would they think it's this genre and mood?

265
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:39,645
And if not, what needs to be changed?

266
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,906
So this is a screenshot from Dredge.

267
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:50,330
So hopefully, when people see a trailer for Dredge, they feel like a foreboding presence and very sinister tone.

268
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:59,974
And so this one here, this is a very common prompt in AAA, which is just describe three standout moments that would sell the theme and attraction of the game.

269
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:09,497
Because people can't recite the entirety of a trailer normally, but they will probably remember a few standout moments.

270
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:11,138
So this is from Half-Life Alyx.

271
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:17,059
And when that came out, a lot of the comments were like, oh my god, did you see the shotgun shells on the shelf?

272
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,400
They pushed everything aside.

273
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,163
As long as they had like one little thing in there that got them excited, that's great.

274
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:28,547
So try to think of a handful of things that would stand out.

275
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,571
What would make someone at a trade show stop to look?

276
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:36,453
It's from Lucas Pope.

277
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:40,797
How do you express it to people in screenshots and generate interest?

278
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,692
and similar vein.

279
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:48,695
In a lineup of 100 games, could you pick it out from a screenshot or trailer?

280
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:52,937
Which, you know, make friends with really good art directors.

281
00:26:54,998 --> 00:26:55,218
Okay.

282
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:56,099
So how do you check your work?

283
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,195
Just show it to someone.

284
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:00,537
Show or explain your idea to someone.

285
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:02,519
You don't even have to ask for feedback.

286
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,161
I get this all the time when I'm editing something.

287
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:22,017
I'll just show someone an edit, they say nothing, but I instantly see like five things, and I'm like, oh crap, that's terrible, this is too long, this is too short, this is paste weird, this part's not understandable, because your brain will just start seeing it through other people's eyes once you show it to people, which I'm sure you have experience with, with like playtesting.

288
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:23,638
I'm

289
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:42,690
How can I do this quickly, and does it communicate quickly?

290
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:51,936
And Gwen from Satell Studios slash Chicon Club, she said, put a time limit on the project because you can just get stuck making things pretty forever.

291
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:55,518
So like I said, the team spent two weeks on this one.

292
00:27:56,699 --> 00:28:04,184
When I talked to Eka, he said that two weeks to a month was about the amount of time they'd spend on an early trailer concept.

293
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:07,727
and Gwen also said just throw away everything you do.

294
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:13,751
Get your point across and just be done with it so that you don't get too precious about the little tiny little details.

295
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:18,974
And work with visual thinkers, filmmakers, and game trailer editors.

296
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:22,837
People who are just wired to communicate ideas through images.

297
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:47,828
and also use what works for you because so, for example, Thirsty Shooters, like I said, it was kind of gameplay agnostic, so that could change around, whereas Supergiant Games, Greg was saying that they're a very design-first studio where the story emerges from the gameplay mechanics, so that's why Hades came to be, because the whole roguelike mechanic was conducive to the story that they want to tell with Hades.

298
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,730
And that's my talk.

299
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,630
Thank you for coming.

300
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,271
You can see...

301
00:28:51,991 --> 00:29:02,180
More of my terrible Firewatch trailer, which has everything you should not do in a trailer, starting with lots of logos that take a really long time to get through.

302
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,223
I have, like, one minute.

303
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:07,824
I don't... One question.

304
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:13,129
I'll be outside after this, because... Actually, you should come to my other talk, which is at 4.40 in this exact room.

305
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,730
It's about making marketing timelines.

306
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,491
I'm doing that with my friend Dana.

307
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:17,572
Okay, one question.

308
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:20,515
Mic is off.

309
00:29:21,582 --> 00:29:22,022
Please.

310
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:28,727
OK, so I'm running a small indie team like High School Kids.

311
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:36,292
How important is it getting a trailer up sooner rather than later, rather than just focusing on the mechanics of the game?

312
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,974
For those that are just up and coming and learning.

313
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,115
Is this the game you're selling?

314
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:46,239
Sorry, the question was how important is it to get the trailer up rather than working on mechanics?

315
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:46,880
Correct.

316
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,741
for like a new team of developers.

317
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:53,302
And you're selling this game, or is this like a side project?

318
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:55,103
This is a natural game we're selling, yes.

319
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:56,023
OK.

320
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:05,587
I mean, the sooner you get your store page up, the better, as long as your art style is locked down and it's not going to change a whole lot.

321
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,728
So very important.

322
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:12,970
And yes, I'm sorry, that's not a very in-depth answer.

323
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,168
No, thank you so much.

324
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:16,089
Appreciate it.

325
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:16,369
OK.

326
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,350
All right.

327
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,990
Thank you so much.

328
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,553
I'll be outside if you have more questions or anything.
