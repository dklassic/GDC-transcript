1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:04,353
Our next speaker is no stranger to sharing her stories with the GDC community.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:10,741
Here to discuss how her teams have found resolve and inspiration in stressful environments,

3
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,927
and how she has stayed optimistic and motivated through unforeseen challenges,

4
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,630
please welcome Laura Lynn McWilliams.

5
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:31,167
Hi, I'm Laura Lynn, and I apologize in advance

6
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:32,667
if I have to periodically take drinks of water

7
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:33,988
like a politician while I'm talking.

8
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,770
So, when I look at this group of people,

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,832
I'm absolutely certain that I'm looking at people

10
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:41,992
who feel a sense of purpose,

11
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,614
not just in being in this room or being at GDC,

12
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,196
but a sense of purpose in being a game developer.

13
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:51,357
And the reason I'm so confident about that,

14
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:53,738
the reason I can state that with certainty

15
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:57,140
that we all feel the drive and urgency, a sense of purpose,

16
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,280
is because if we didn't, I don't think we would have tools

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,041
or be able to deal with all the bullshit that

18
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,302
comes with this line of work.

19
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:07,924
And there's a lot of it sometimes.

20
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:12,827
So as of 2019, I've been a game developer for 25 years.

21
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,288
It's some of the games that I've worked on.

22
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:19,671
But what was interesting was my very first professional game

23
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,233
ever was canceled.

24
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,475
And it closed down the studio that I started to make it.

25
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,296
So welcome to game development.

26
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:31,797
And then after that point, probably one out of every three

27
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,518
games that I've worked on was canceled.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,341
And I've relocated long distance 11 times.

29
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,463
So I've got some familiarity with some

30
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:44,545
of the sacrifices we have to make to do this for a living.

31
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:50,689
So I wrote that intro in 2018 when I first pitched this talk.

32
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,211
And then when I opened this back up

33
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,612
to kind of finalize it for this talk today,

34
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:58,395
Yes, some stuff has happened.

35
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,258
It's been a long 2019, and we're three months in at this point.

36
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,421
And so I had to ask myself, am I really going to stand on stage in front of all of these

37
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,843
people and talk about optimism right now?

38
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:13,545
And the answer is yes, and I'll tell you why.

39
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,086
Because optimism gets a bad rap.

40
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,429
I think a lot of people think about optimism as, you know, lemonade from lemons.

41
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,090
They think about optimism as...

42
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,890
slapping a happy face on things that are terrible,

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,111
or ignoring the terrible things.

44
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:31,272
But I can say, personally, that if I had just

45
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:34,552
had a game canceled or part of my team laid off,

46
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:36,953
and I encountered that kind of optimism,

47
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:41,074
if I ran into that guy, I would probably slap that sticker

48
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:41,954
right off his forehead.

49
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,395
That's not optimism, and that's not what I mean.

50
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,896
When I talk about optimism, I talk about the fact that

51
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,745
Life brings you changes and difficulty.

52
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,105
You work through them.

53
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:53,886
They change you, and you grow.

54
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,986
For me, that's optimism.

55
00:02:57,147 --> 00:03:02,748
So just like some people say comedy equals tragedy plus time, for me, optimism and my

56
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,389
optimism fuel is the knowledge that trauma is building tools for me.

57
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,830
So I'm going to share some of those tools with you today, but more important, I reached

58
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,630
out to a lot of developers, and I'm sharing their tools with you too.

59
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:19,720
I ask developers between 15 and 38 years of experience, what gives you hope, what keeps

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,423
you going, and what are the habits and structures that you've developed that you'd recommend

61
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:23,863
to others?

62
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,465
So let's get going.

63
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,948
Optimism fuel number one is to remember your inspiration.

64
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,410
I like to think of this as remembering the horse that you rode in on.

65
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,554
You're a game developer for a reason.

66
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:39,719
It takes so much work to be a professional game developer.

67
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,763
Even if you have a degree, it's super hard to break in.

68
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,046
Something gave you the drive to do it.

69
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,008
What was it?

70
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,595
When I asked Teresa what keeps her going,

71
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,296
she says remembering why I got into games in the first place.

72
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,237
To provide better experiences for the next wave of kids,

73
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:56,918
to remember that gaming can be wonderfully creative,

74
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,360
thought-inducing, connecting, and sometimes

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,581
a disconnecting escapism away from a harsh reality.

76
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,002
So a couple of specific tips here.

77
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,846
You need to remember what inspired you.

78
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:11,749
This is some of the games that inspired me early in my career or before my career.

79
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,551
There's some of the reasons that I felt like I had to make games for a living.

80
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,333
You probably have your own list.

81
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:20,435
Break them out once or twice a year when things get tough.

82
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:21,095
Play them again.

83
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,217
Remind yourself why you're excited.

84
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:24,577
Why you are here.

85
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,210
And Gaurav has a great tip as well.

86
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,091
Put the launch date of all your projects

87
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,132
you've shipped on a calendar.

88
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:33,053
And celebrate those anniversaries

89
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,013
when they come up every year.

90
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,154
Reach out to old friends you worked with.

91
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:37,175
Play your old games.

92
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,656
Wear an old team shirt.

93
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,577
Remember what you loved about those games.

94
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:45,219
So optimism fuel number two, never

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,201
forget that this is a business.

96
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:54,385
So game development's kind of weird.

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,242
I've gotten feedback several times over my career when I referred to players as users

98
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:02,063
or customers.

99
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:07,105
I remember people getting seriously bent out of shape a couple of times when I called the

100
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,506
game we were working on a product.

101
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:10,867
Like that?

102
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:11,707
The controller?

103
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:12,388
That's a product.

104
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:12,768
Our game?

105
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:13,288
No way.

106
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:15,269
I don't think that's an accident.

107
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,191
Our industry is heavily motivated by passion.

108
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,055
And the thing is, the belief that it's all about passion.

109
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:27,020
It's a big part of our hiring process, E3, PAX, GDC,

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,741
all based around passion.

111
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:31,464
And we kind of neglect this other bit.

112
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:35,667
But I can tell you that passion is a two-way street.

113
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:38,010
And in the hands of some employers and some leaders,

114
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,732
passion is used as a rope that can bind us.

115
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,615
So never forget, it's a business.

116
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:48,890
Don't let your colleagues or teammates or bosses convince you that this is not a business.

117
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,413
You need your business hat on 24-7 when you're talking about your career.

118
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,754
That comes to things like what company you choose.

119
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:56,895
From Paul.

120
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:01,157
Learn the warning signs of bad culture and how to identify them in an interview.

121
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:08,261
If a studio seems interested in you only as a warm body or to throw out a problem or if

122
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,363
you see people in leadership roles being disrespectful to their own teams.

123
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:13,733
Those are all big red flags.

124
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,734
Don't take the bait.

125
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,937
And from Ann, you work with people, not with IPs.

126
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,959
You can chase after the passion project,

127
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,581
but at the end of the day, what will make a project good

128
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,722
is if you focus on working with good, decent,

129
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:26,523
and talented people.

130
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:28,945
Now, I'm not discounting passion.

131
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,011
It's an important part of our work.

132
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,214
If you're like me, you fall in love with every game that you work on, every game that you

133
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:35,434
make.

134
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,416
And that's important because love is what makes games great.

135
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,958
As Dylan says, each game you make is the most important one.

136
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:45,841
You might only get a handful in your career, so treat it well and make it the best it can

137
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:46,041
be.

138
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:50,824
But we all know from life that love leaves us open to heartbreak.

139
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:55,164
A game you love is going to be cancelled, or a publisher is going to give you changes

140
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:59,047
that decimate it, or you're going to release it and no one's going to care, no one's going

141
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,088
to listen, no one's going to buy it.

142
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:04,711
Those things are going to happen to you, and you need to be able to come back from those

143
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:04,911
things.

144
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:07,073
You need to be able to stand up after them.

145
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,374
Most important, you need to know when to hold and when to fold.

146
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,755
You need to know how to walk away.

147
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:14,918
And that goes for features and teams and companies as well.

148
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:17,888
I think Forrest has great advice here.

149
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,011
Brace yourself for change and instability.

150
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,873
The industry changes a lot every few years.

151
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,054
Jobs come and go.

152
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,317
Sometimes opportunities dry up where you are.

153
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,599
Sometimes you want to move to chase a new opportunity.

154
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,302
Prepare yourself for these possibilities from day one,

155
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,184
and you won't be surprised when they happen.

156
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,428
So, optimism field number three.

157
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,490
Focus on creativity and craft.

158
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,551
So over the years of game development,

159
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,212
I realized I made an interesting shift

160
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:44,394
from I make games I'm interested in

161
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,675
to I'm interested in making games.

162
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:48,416
And that's an important shift

163
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,077
because I learned to focus on my craft.

164
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,739
It became less important to me that I was making a game

165
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,740
that I would, as a consumer, actually play,

166
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,681
and more important that I was working on a game

167
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,143
that challenged me and made me think about new things

168
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:01,764
and made me learn in the process of developing it.

169
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:03,986
And I think that that's an important switch.

170
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:07,953
as Jennifer says.

171
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,415
Find something to fall in love with

172
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:11,796
in whatever work you're doing.

173
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,238
It's impossible to do creative work on demand

174
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,499
if you're resentful or bored.

175
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,660
No matter what your first impression is,

176
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,862
find a point of connection with the work

177
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,163
or with the audience,

178
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:23,825
and build off that to fall in love with what you're creating.

179
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,231
So another good tip, get a hobby.

180
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,213
Seriously, it doesn't have to be inside, outside games,

181
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:30,234
I don't care, just get a hobby.

182
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:31,915
You need something that you can own,

183
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,396
so when things are really difficult at work,

184
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,738
you can come home and there's something you own

185
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:37,159
that no one can tell you what to do with it

186
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,240
or how to do it, it's absolutely yours.

187
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:43,003
As Megan says, the phrase, do what you love

188
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,225
and you'll never work a day in your life, is toxic BS.

189
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,906
It's still work, and sometimes,

190
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:49,388
in order to keep being passionate about it,

191
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:51,469
you have to step back and be passionate

192
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,851
about something different, so you don't burn yourself out.

193
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,842
Stay open to learning.

194
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,304
Stay open to travel.

195
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,548
Find ways to embrace everything that life

196
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:01,889
has to offer beyond games.

197
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,851
Get out of the office.

198
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:05,093
Do your research in things that are not

199
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:05,954
about what you're working on.

200
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,518
As Brenda says, I limit my research

201
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,240
to stuff that fascinates me without regard

202
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,421
to whether it will make it into a game.

203
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:12,983
It usually does in some way.

204
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,126
Optimism tool number four is build from your mistakes and share them.

205
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:21,107
You hear all the time build from your mistakes, learn from your mistakes.

206
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,388
I like to say leverage your mistakes because that's your gold.

207
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:29,490
As you build experience, those mistakes that you carry with you are the things that enhance

208
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:29,970
your companies.

209
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,850
They make your work better.

210
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,252
You need to share them with other people as openly and often as you can.

211
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:40,073
As Jane says, actively find and face the things that make you feel like you're a total noob

212
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:44,035
and when you get through it again and again, you never feel old and certainly not stagnated.

213
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,057
I love this tip from Teresa.

214
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:51,399
Create an email folder titled postmortem and put anything you learned or those big issues

215
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:51,679
in it.

216
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,680
At the end of the project, revisit this and be better next time.

217
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,941
I never actually considered having a personal postmortem folder just for what I've learned

218
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,502
on a project.

219
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,492
Keep in mind that staying open to feedback

220
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,674
is also a way of learning from your mistakes,

221
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:06,935
and so are metrics, actually.

222
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,457
And it's important to be open to feedback,

223
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,700
no matter how harsh it seems, and even to ask for it.

224
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,102
As Brenda says, I surround myself

225
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,424
with incredibly talented people who genuinely

226
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,846
love making games, and I encourage them to give me

227
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:20,648
direct, hardcore feedback.

228
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,511
A lot of developers mentioned mentoring

229
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,533
as another way to leverage their mistakes

230
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:26,774
and also grow as individuals.

231
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:31,622
As Gaurav said, being a mentor is a great way to get a new perspective on game development,

232
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,903
bring a fresh energy into your daily routine, and use your experience to improve someone

233
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:36,583
else's life.

234
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,905
Or as Terry says, what keeps me going is mentoring and paving the way for young ladies who are

235
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,045
up and coming in the industry.

236
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:49,146
So optimism rule number five, seek balance and rest.

237
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,587
So use your PTO, people.

238
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:52,767
Like, seriously.

239
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,588
Every place I have worked.

240
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:00,958
There have been a significant number of people who,

241
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:03,259
every month, get that email that says you're at the cap.

242
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,301
If you don't spend your email, you're gonna lose it,

243
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,361
and then they take that one day

244
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,022
and stay just ahead of the cap.

245
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,644
There are so many reasons why you need a break

246
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,424
away from the office.

247
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,785
Of course, one of them is health.

248
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,027
As Anne says, the single biggest lesson I've learned,

249
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,929
don't sacrifice your health to make a game.

250
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,770
Years off our lives from stress or lack of sleep

251
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,471
are not worth it.

252
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:23,487
or from Sandra.

253
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,922
You may feel that it's more important to pour your soul into the game to meet the deadlines

254
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,849
even if you're crying tears of blood from exhaustion.

255
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,306
and that vacation can wait.

256
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:32,006
It can't.

257
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,187
It's good for your physical and mental health,

258
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:37,229
but also simply to renew your sources of inspiration.

259
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,470
And that, I think, is the key point for me,

260
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,312
is that creativity requires space.

261
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,613
There's a reason that you might be struggling

262
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,794
with a problem you need to solve all week at work,

263
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,855
and then all of a sudden on Sunday you're driving

264
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,416
or you're in the shower, you're at a barbecue,

265
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:51,576
and there's the answer.

266
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,637
It's because your brain finally got the space

267
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:56,499
away from the problem to noodle it over and figure it out.

268
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,900
And that space is important in your daily life too.

269
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,463
As Dan points out, set aside sacred time each day to doodle and dream.

270
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:08,428
Even after all these years, a hot cup of coffee, an ice pen, and a blank notebook are deeply

271
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:08,948
inspiring.

272
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,011
This is the heart of the process that I try to never lose.

273
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,835
Number six is find a community.

274
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,522
So yes, you absolutely need friends and family

275
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,123
that you can lean on when things get rough.

276
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:22,304
I don't know what I would have done

277
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,444
without my husband over the years.

278
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,446
As Terry says, I've always suffered greatly

279
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,266
when I didn't have a support system to prop me up

280
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,828
on days that were unfair, frustrating, or just plain dreary.

281
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,109
Whoever it is, friends or family,

282
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:35,810
make sure you have a set of healthy, supportive people there

283
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,591
to share good and bad moments with.

284
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,612
But I'd like to point out that you also need a game development

285
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:42,172
community.

286
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,113
It could be the people you work with now.

287
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,794
It could be the people you've worked with before.

288
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,015
But you need people who are going through the same things

289
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:48,476
that you are.

290
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:52,158
They need to share their mistakes with you.

291
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,399
And for you to share your mistakes with them.

292
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,281
If you're introverted or have been separated by distance,

293
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,661
there's Slack, there's Skype.

294
00:12:59,262 --> 00:12:59,822
Find a forum.

295
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:02,263
I love my game dev Twitter community personally.

296
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:04,464
But you need to find that community somewhere.

297
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,481
You also need to invest in the people that you work with.

298
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:10,305
As Dylan says, invest in the people around you,

299
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,327
your peers, your leads, and even your bosses.

300
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:13,348
Include them in your life.

301
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,391
The industry is small and tight-knit,

302
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,554
and they might help your career many years later,

303
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,555
even if you've moved on.

304
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,277
Every relationship is important.

305
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,945
and this especially moving bit from Tracy.

306
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,226
What keeps me going is the support of my friends

307
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:27,207
in the industry who help me stay connected.

308
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:28,927
They've recommended me for jobs,

309
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:30,788
moved me and my stuff, watched my cat,

310
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,869
and threw birthday parties I didn't know I needed.

311
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,630
They hugged me when my world shrank

312
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,610
and depression took hold.

313
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,252
Number seven is be the change.

314
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,292
I know it sounds hackneyed,

315
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,113
but I really believe that we're all in this together.

316
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:46,809
And the only hope we have for meaningful change in our lives,

317
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,890
in our games, in our companies, in our industry,

318
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,950
is for each of us to stand up for the things

319
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,650
that we believe in, even when it's hard,

320
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,691
and to also help our friends who are standing up.

321
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,912
And I don't just mean this about social issues.

322
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:58,852
I mean this about everything,

323
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,412
how we speak to each other in meetings,

324
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:01,733
how long those meetings are,

325
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,413
how we develop the games that we're working on.

326
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:06,114
All of these things require us

327
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:07,754
to put our effort into making them better.

328
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:10,654
And actually the effort of doing that,

329
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:13,316
the act of making a difference, you'll find opens you up.

330
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,596
My life has opened up tremendously

331
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,157
since I started speaking at things like this,

332
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,258
as hard as it is for me,

333
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,940
because I feel like I have a better sense of purpose now.

334
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:25,592
As Jen says, what keeps me going is knowing that I can make a difference to other people,

335
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,473
whether it's connecting an IGDA member with a perfect mentor, or a new opportunity, hearing

336
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:34,415
someone talk about how a life experience changed their life, or a game experience changed their

337
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:38,376
life, or having someone tell me how much they're looking forward to their next major anniversary

338
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:38,996
in game dev.

339
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:43,757
And now the last point, you need to discover and be willing to change your own path.

340
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:46,318
I have a great quote from Tristina.

341
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:47,826
Know your purpose.

342
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,108
Knowing what drives you to develop and create games and revisiting and reflecting on that

343
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:56,610
drive will give you the inner strength you need to make good decisions and overcome obstacles.

344
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:59,552
Having a driving force means you always have a compass to guide you.

345
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:05,074
So a lot of us are continually climbing that stair, right?

346
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:08,796
The never-ending accomplishment stairs of game development.

347
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,397
And it's bigger salary and better title.

348
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,454
more prestigious company, bigger game, more sales, right, we're all on that staircase.

349
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:22,258
So I'll take just a minute and tell you about my experience on that staircase to illustrate

350
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:22,598
the point.

351
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:28,123
So I loved all of the games that I worked on, every single one of them, but I wouldn't

352
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:32,847
really call any of them mine, and it's not just because they were colossal group efforts

353
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,548
because they totally were.

354
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,121
But it's because I was a commercial game developer.

355
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,464
I made the game that the company wanted me to make

356
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:40,946
for the audience we wanted to address

357
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,468
with the IP that we had.

358
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,970
I was never about expressing myself.

359
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,412
I could not be about expressing myself

360
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,214
because that would be the wrong thing for the game.

361
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,037
The game needed to have what was right for the audience.

362
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,737
So it meant I spent 25 years and I'd never shipped anything

363
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:57,138
that I thought expressed me as an individual or as a designer.

364
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,560
And I tried to get at that with side projects,

365
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,541
but realistically, after giving 200% of yourself

366
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,423
to game development during the day, you were too tired.

367
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,483
I was too tired.

368
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,665
And my brain capacity for game design was just exhausted.

369
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:12,287
So it never got any traction, regardless

370
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,048
of how important it was to me, which was very important.

371
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,821
So in 2012, I got stage four cancer, and it changed my life.

372
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,241
And even after that, I still didn't get any traction on this.

373
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,822
And I really can't tell you why, but I just didn't.

374
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,522
And then in 2015, I got lung cancer,

375
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:27,563
still didn't get any traction.

376
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,403
And then in 2016, the lung cancer came back,

377
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,124
incurable, metastatic, and terminal.

378
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:36,524
So I really was going to literally die

379
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:40,125
and have never shipped a single game that I felt

380
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,365
reflected me as a person.

381
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,045
That was really hard.

382
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,480
And I knew when I responded well to a clinical trial

383
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,842
and maybe had a little bit more time

384
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,444
that I had to make a change

385
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:52,528
or I was never gonna fill this hole that was in my soul.

386
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:54,130
And that's really how it felt.

387
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,272
So if you remember this from the start,

388
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,635
I am a design director at Microsoft,

389
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,318
but I don't work on games.

390
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,439
I'm the design director for Microsoft Stream,

391
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,780
which is enterprise video software.

392
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,041
It's like the YouTube for business.

393
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:07,623
It's a fantastic product.

394
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:08,283
I love the team.

395
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,345
Really interesting design problems.

396
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,727
Microsoft has a great work-life balance,

397
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,428
and they very much encourage creativity.

398
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,132
So now, when I leave work, I have the energy.

399
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:19,152
I have the mental space.

400
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,338
I have the freedom, I'm not under IP agreements.

401
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,720
I can ship games that matter to me.

402
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,742
I can tell my story for the first time ever.

403
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:32,548
And it made me hesitate to even do this talk, for while I felt like, does this make me an

404
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,388
imposter of some kind?

405
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,651
Am I betraying game development by not doing it for my full-time job?

406
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,856
But as I started to work toward this game that I'm actually going to ship, I realized,

407
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,438
no, for the first time ever, I'm free.

408
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:47,279
I can make whatever game I want to make for whatever audience I want to make.

409
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm an indie developer now.

410
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,641
I'm still a game developer, just a different kind of game developer.

411
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:59,603
And I'm working on a paranormal romance adventure game with a choice of games, which is certainly

412
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:03,124
not something I ever would have shipped as core console developer, but I'm really excited

413
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:03,464
about it.

414
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:07,865
And the reason I'm telling you all of this is because I want you to understand very personally

415
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,206
when I say that life is short.

416
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,012
You need to figure out what path is going to make you happy,

417
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:15,592
and you need to do it now.

418
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:17,813
Don't wait until you have a hole in your soul

419
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,374
and you're looking at an expiration date

420
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,215
and realize you haven't done the things that you need to do.

421
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,057
So that's my optimism fuel.

422
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:28,118
And when I reached out to developers to ask them,

423
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:31,159
hey, do you have some advice, which was very clearly

424
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,360
going into a list of advice.

425
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:36,399
I actually loved what Dave said, which was funny to me.

426
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,380
Don't farm advice from pithy sounding lists of good advice

427
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,540
administered in a vacuum.

428
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,901
Your situation is complex and unique,

429
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:45,502
and good advice from one can be terrible for another.

430
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:46,442
And I think that's true.

431
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:50,443
But I can say that we all share two things,

432
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:53,364
regardless of who we are.

433
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:55,605
First is that we're game developers.

434
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,965
And second is, whatever your path is,

435
00:18:58,884 --> 00:18:59,725
It's going to get wrecked.

436
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,627
And it's going to get wrecked multiple times.

437
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,268
Game development will do it, life will do it.

438
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,311
And honestly, to be truthful, time does it anyway.

439
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,192
Time changes all of us.

440
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:12,954
It evolves our needs, it evolves our goals.

441
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:17,096
So if I can leave you with one thing today, it's a challenge.

442
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,078
It's for you to think now about what makes you happy,

443
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:21,579
what will fill the holes in your soul.

444
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,621
What do you need to do to be happy?

445
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,282
What is your path?

446
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,421
How are you going to express your unique story?

447
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:32,946
What games are you going to make that tell other people about your story?

448
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,330
Because I personally can't wait to play them.

449
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:37,912
So thank you.
