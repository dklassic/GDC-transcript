1
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:11,947
This is the last session in Level Design in a Day, so thank you for being patient and

2
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:12,967
staying here.

3
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,929
This talk is called Level Design Histories and Futures.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,450
I'm Robert Yang.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,852
I'm part-time faculty at the MFADT program at Parsons New School for Design, as well

6
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:30,653
as the IDM program at NYU Poly, as well as the NYU Game Center.

7
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:33,375
Yeah, woo!

8
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,356
Sorry, I'm a student in the crowd.

9
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,838
I'm also a developer.

10
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:39,679
My most recent games have been

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,721
a spanking game called Hurt Me Plenty

12
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,942
as well as a game called Succulent

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,643
where you just watch a guy eat a popsicle

14
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,024
really erotically and slowly.

15
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,207
So I make games too.

16
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,568
I'm not just an academic.

17
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,169
A mouth-breathing academic.

18
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:58,073
And unlike the other talks today that have been super,

19
00:00:58,113 --> 00:01:00,594
like really heavily grounded in hands-on techniques

20
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:01,954
or practice or case studies,

21
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,575
this talk is kind of about taking a step back

22
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:07,476
and kind of reflecting on everything you've heard today.

23
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,158
How am I gonna do this?

24
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,944
So this talk is about analyzing level design

25
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:20,444
in kind of a more critical sense,

26
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:23,225
about going beyond ideas of layout or enemy placement

27
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:24,886
as interesting and important as those are,

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,246
and connecting it to kind of a bigger picture,

29
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:28,047
at least trying to.

30
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,468
It's about thinking about thinking, kind of.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,741
And if we can do that, then maybe we can get a better sense

32
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,142
of what level design is and what level design might be

33
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,264
in the future and maybe even open our mind

34
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:41,305
to new ways of being level designers.

35
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,526
And as with the other talks today,

36
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:46,467
this talk is gonna have a heavy bias

37
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,209
towards 3D games where you control a character.

38
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,390
There's many other traditions of level design.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,431
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna talk about those.

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,953
So let's imagine the world's most talented level designer.

41
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,916
I did some computer modeling to generate

42
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:10,198
what the greatest level design ever would look like.

43
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,439
I couldn't find a picture of Liz England,

44
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,700
so I just put a door there.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,980
There'll be Liz England.

46
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,022
This person can generate 3D geometry with code,

47
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:21,182
they can tell a story with careful prop placement,

48
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:23,583
they can also manage a team of 20 people,

49
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,543
but they also work really well alone,

50
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,784
but they also sculpt subcontinents,

51
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:31,484
but they also build cities made of several neighborhoods,

52
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,465
but they also hand paint houses,

53
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,246
and they also hand model the electrical cords

54
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,206
for each house lamp.

55
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,206
They did that and gone home, by the way.

56
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:44,776
Does it really make sense that level design is all of these things?

57
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,878
Because like every speaker you've come today, you've seen today,

58
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:52,039
they were coming to level design from a really different angle

59
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,640
and for a very different purpose.

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,681
So why are we trying so hard to like unite all of these things

61
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,102
under a banner of level design?

62
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:03,483
So I want to complicate what level design is.

63
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:08,205
Academics use the word complicate when we're going to talk a bunch.

64
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:13,047
I'd like to propose four different ways of thinking about level design.

65
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:17,089
There are actually infinite ways of thinking about level design, but 50 minutes, I'm just

66
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:17,809
going to talk about four.

67
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,771
In one sense, levels are just another piece of data.

68
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:26,673
So what's level design as a form of material in a game?

69
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,996
We can also think about the level designer as a job title in the game industry, as an

70
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,117
industrial process.

71
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:37,642
We can also think about level design as a theoretical branch of architecture, as well

72
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,085
as an act of design and control within a community.

73
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:46,610
And each level you make is interacting on all four of these dimensions.

74
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,535
Every level you make is actually a hypercube, where each face of the cube is another cube.

75
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:52,596
That's what a hypercube is.

76
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:04,477
So first, let's think about level design as material and data in a really kind of literal sense.

77
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,879
What is it on your computer?

78
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:14,936
We can think of a level as a bunch of data or an asset that references a bunch of other assets.

79
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:25,320
And in that case, a level editor might be software that visualizes this data as something really useful, friendly to humans.

80
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,702
And it lets us construct or modify this data, ideally easily and effectively.

81
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:33,423
So the question is, how do we fill these files with data?

82
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,005
And how do we manage these complex connections between all these files?

83
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:42,054
First, you could technically use a text editor,

84
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,715
or Excel as your level editor, and a lot of people do this.

85
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,375
The text on the left is actually data

86
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:49,896
that is for a map file in Source Engine 1.

87
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,296
It's just a series of keys and values.

88
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,057
You could technically make a Counter-Strike Go map

89
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,797
by just typing stuff in in Notepad or something.

90
00:04:58,238 --> 00:05:00,198
That'd be really awful, but I'm sure

91
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:01,638
you could technically do it.

92
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,642
And it's also worth knowing that not every game needs a dedicated level editor.

93
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:10,565
You know, if you're working procedurally or if you have a small amount of possible tiles,

94
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,927
it probably makes more sense to like code it or use text for this.

95
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:18,411
You saw David Pimmons' talk earlier today about procedural level design for Eldritch

96
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,332
and he showed the actual script files he does.

97
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,235
He's using a text editor as a level design in that case.

98
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:31,618
But so much of game development is about working with specialized tools.

99
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:35,819
And if we study these tools, we can kind of sense there's like a tension often between

100
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,920
data and a designer.

101
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,182
So as an example, this is Arsenal 3.

102
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:45,504
It's a StarCraft 1 modding tool that I used back in the day when I did StarCraft 1 modding.

103
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:49,425
And notice that red checkbox there on the right.

104
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:52,005
That red checkbox made me so angry.

105
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,706
Because, you know, that red checkbox,

106
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:58,387
if you don't check it, that means you don't have shields

107
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,287
on that unit in StarCraft.

108
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:03,148
Which made me upset, because I feel like

109
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,488
if you just type in a number greater than zero

110
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,589
into the shields box, can't you just assume

111
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,389
I want shields on my Terran Marine?

112
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,390
But if you uncheck it, it doesn't put shields on it,

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,970
and it just ignores the number you put in there.

114
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,491
That's just adding one more point of failure for me as a human being.

115
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:20,992
It's just really terrible.

116
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,793
So why can't the tool just check the box for me,

117
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,454
or maybe even hide it entirely?

118
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,055
So this is kind of what I mean by tension between data and designer.

119
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,995
The StarCraft engine might have a very good reason

120
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:37,556
for having a separate variable for needing that checkbox

121
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:38,837
in the game data file format,

122
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,938
but as a designer, do I really need to know about that?

123
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,522
So this series of all these steps and stuff we have to do

124
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,403
when working in a tool is called workflow.

125
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,005
And a history of level editing tools

126
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,106
would involve a history of workflow.

127
00:06:56,428 --> 00:07:02,013
So you might start in or the you might trace the origin of level editors back to AutoCAD in 1982

128
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:07,038
That's what the original AutoCAD looked like I guess. I don't know I wasn't alive

129
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:11,882
I was like a zygote or something a computer-aided design tool

130
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:15,946
AutoCAD is a computer-aided design tool using industrial design architecture

131
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:20,810
and the difference between AutoCAD and DoomEd on the right is that

132
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,654
AutoCAD is really scary and making Doom levels is really fun.

133
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:32,158
So Joel kind of touched upon this when he was talking about how modding made a lot of

134
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,999
working with 3D really accessible.

135
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,001
This is where level editors come into play.

136
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:40,644
They're stripped down versions of really scary architectural drafting tools.

137
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:43,166
So that's what's really nice about them.

138
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,426
So on the right, there's DoomEd.

139
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:47,427
That's the level editor used to make Doom 1.

140
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,668
And notice that's just one big top-down 2D view.

141
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,468
Doom is fundamentally a 2D game.

142
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:55,749
There's no floor-over-floor construction.

143
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:58,489
Well, I mean, now there is with the new engines and stuff.

144
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,670
But before it wasn't possible.

145
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,990
A bridge would not be possible in the original Doom.

146
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:05,051
So you don't get really a sense,

147
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:06,631
when you're working in DoomEd,

148
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,832
you don't really get a sense of height.

149
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,132
It's a top-down floor plan.

150
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,981
So I think these days we kind of view this type of workflow

151
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,942
as obsolete because it doesn't give us

152
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:18,463
a good sense of height.

153
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,046
But I kind of like it still a little

154
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,648
because I think it places a lot of emphasis

155
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,688
on lateral movement.

156
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,351
You have really good sense of the organization

157
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,411
of the general level here.

158
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:33,034
A lot of people criticize modern FPS design as having really bad simple layouts.

159
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:38,397
If you look at a single Doom or even a Wolfenstein 3D level, the layouts are like super complex

160
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,559
and that's because they were thinking in terms of floor plan and layout.

161
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,480
So maybe we can bring some of this back, I don't know.

162
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,184
And even in that early DoomEd screenshot from 1992,

163
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,485
you can see there was a texture browser.

164
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:53,966
And this is something Jim Brown from Epic talked about

165
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,987
in Level Design in a Day back in 2010,

166
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:59,588
that a good asset browser is so important for your workflow.

167
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,709
It might be weird to think of an asset browser

168
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,830
as a technology that someone had to develop and design,

169
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,491
but it's true, and here's an example of that.

170
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,352
The model browser for the original Hammer Editor

171
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,173
for Source One looked like the thing on the left.

172
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:20,835
where it relied on thumbnail JPEGs to know what the model even was, basically.

173
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:24,576
And you had to name it the same thing as your model file name and stuff.

174
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,596
And it wasn't there, it just said MDL.

175
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:32,778
This is really terrible, especially because Source actually embeds a lot of metadata into the models, too.

176
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,899
It's really important to have a good browser here.

177
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:36,419
And it was just really painful.

178
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,121
So thankfully they updated their model browser

179
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,082
to the one on the right.

180
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:45,243
And real-time 3D preview is very common

181
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,224
in most 3D tool sets these days.

182
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:56,217
And then next, kind of like in the evolution of level editors, we can also talk about QuakeEd.

183
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,339
This is the level editor for Quake 1.

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,546
It's kind of the great ancestor of today's radiant family of level editors.

185
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,689
And you can see two new features.

186
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:07,089
There's a...

187
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,532
3D camera preview in the upper left,

188
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,074
that like blue blotch thing,

189
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:14,458
as well as an elevation grid view.

190
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:18,082
That's that thin white window to the right of the floor plan

191
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,764
and that would show you the height

192
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,446
of wherever you're currently building.

193
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,128
And Radiant is kind of weird.

194
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,269
No one really copies this thing anymore.

195
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,910
And I don't know, I think Radiant's weird.

196
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,830
Like why would you press space bar all the time?

197
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,671
It's terrible.

198
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:33,791
Okay, but anyway.

199
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,632
The point is that this is kind of them transitioning

200
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:39,853
from thinking about 2D floor plans

201
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:43,934
to the true 3D thing that like Quake 1 offered, right?

202
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,972
And a lot of what makes that possible is, again,

203
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:53,694
much like how we didn't think of the asset browser

204
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,616
as a technology, MouseGluck and WASD is actually

205
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,498
a technology that we had to develop

206
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,200
and it's now taken for granted.

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,862
If you didn't have MouseGluck and WASD in our level editors,

208
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,684
our levels would be a lot worse.

209
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:09,506
Because if you talk to any level designer,

210
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:10,907
or if you're a level designer yourself,

211
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,809
you know that you'll spend five or 10 minutes

212
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,431
just flying around your level, not really doing anything.

213
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:20,756
And you'll feel really useless, like you're not really doing anything, but you're actually

214
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:21,857
doing something really important.

215
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,359
You're testing your level, you're testing the sense of space.

216
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,161
And that's really important.

217
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:31,626
It's almost kind of like this very conceptual, like situationist act where you're just drifting

218
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:32,427
around your level.

219
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:37,652
So you can say mouse look transforms us into like conceptual artists in a sense.

220
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:45,422
Oh, and a fun fact, Autodesk only added WASD and MouseClick to AutoCAD in 2007.

221
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,787
So be thankful you're not in that industry.

222
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:57,259
And now we get kind of get to what we might recognize more as level editors these days

223
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:02,780
This is the standard four pane view from 3d studio like one the first one in 1990

224
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,081
And then here's also world craft in hammer

225
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:10,322
I mean world craft or also known as hammer and also unreal ed

226
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:17,284
And they still made heavy use of this arrangement where you have one 3d view and then three 2d orthographic views now

227
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,845
And notice the 3d view is much more important than it was back in quake ed now

228
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,437
And I think the grid views here are really important

229
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:28,218
because when you're working in Quake lineage engines,

230
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:29,459
there's something called a leak.

231
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:33,780
And if you have a really small, one millimeter thin crack

232
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,421
in the outer shell of your level,

233
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:40,263
that crack will suck everyone in the game out to space

234
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,764
and everyone will die and your level will break

235
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,845
and the map compile process will break too.

236
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,245
It's just really terrible.

237
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:50,547
So you need really exact kind of solid manipulation here

238
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,048
and that's what grid views offer.

239
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,829
a lot of good accuracy when doing that stuff.

240
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,011
This type of window layout, I think,

241
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,572
is still supported in most packages,

242
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,733
but it's no longer the default, I think.

243
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,335
Instead, this is the default now.

244
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:07,695
This is pretty much the standard setup now.

245
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,436
It's one big interactive 3D view.

246
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,338
You know, across level editors, architecture tools,

247
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:17,259
3D modeling tools, Unity, Unreal, SketchUp, TrenchBroom,

248
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,840
which is a new Quake 1 editor.

249
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,601
People are still making Quake 1 editors.

250
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,783
Sandbox, Maya, they've all embraced

251
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,604
this one big 3D view interface now.

252
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,386
And supposedly this lets us work in 3D natively.

253
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:33,728
So again, several things make this possible.

254
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:36,309
We have less of a need to tightly optimize levels.

255
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,770
In Unity, there's no concept of a leak,

256
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,731
so you can just put objects wherever you want.

257
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,852
And also module workflows,

258
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,893
and also a gizmo interface metaphor.

259
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,140
Where is the future of level editors?

260
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,902
That was a history of level editors.

261
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,026
A future might be involving, like,

262
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,229
visualizing the unseen, you know?

263
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:04,012
We went from 2D to 3D, now we need to go

264
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,596
from 3D to, like, 4D or something.

265
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:14,505
I think the future will allow, will be more about automation of construction and design.

266
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:20,892
So there's a lot of people working on automation of construction, like Joiner by Tim Johnson.

267
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:25,277
He's a Team Fortress 2 mapper and he made this thing that automatically generates

268
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:30,640
wood beam girder details for TF2 maps.

269
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,461
Or there's also a thing called Improv 2 procedural ladders

270
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,483
for Unreal 4 by a developer named Joe Wintergreen.

271
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,824
And that one, it generates a ladder mesh

272
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,105
based on whatever you place in Unreal,

273
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:43,686
which is really cool.

274
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:47,948
So that's like the editor making your map for you

275
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,269
or constructing it for you.

276
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,150
And then we also might distinguish

277
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,511
this construction from design.

278
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,213
that top right diagram there,

279
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,977
that's an NPC guard placement algorithm

280
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:05,780
from some very good research going on at McGill University.

281
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,042
This tool can understand patrol paths

282
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,884
and line of sight and simulate player pathing.

283
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:13,706
So what if your NPCs could place themselves

284
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,047
in a certain sense, right?

285
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:21,713
Or, in the lower right, that's the interactive story toolkit, Versu, which has a plot visualizer,

286
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:25,616
and it draws all the possible paths between your different scenes, as well as any dead

287
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:25,956
ends.

288
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:30,199
So, what if your levels could test and analyze themselves as well?

289
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:38,045
So note that a lot of those solutions actually weren't really coming from the AAA space,

290
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,467
so now I do want to talk about the AAA space.

291
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:50,430
So, a common theme in past level design in today's

292
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,731
is that level design is so important yet at the same time

293
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,112
we don't really know what it is.

294
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,712
It's kind of this nebulous thing.

295
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:01,233
What does a level designer do?

296
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,513
Well, the advice is that every studio

297
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,694
will have a different definition

298
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:05,694
of what a level designer is.

299
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:09,137
And the key word there is the word studio.

300
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:13,761
The idea of a studio is kind of more of a triple A construct.

301
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:16,763
If I'm one person working alone,

302
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,205
I'm probably not going to call myself a level designer.

303
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:22,568
Because that implies there's other developers working alongside me.

304
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,394
So I think of level designer as something that's mainly dictated by the needs of triple A industry.

305
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:37,112
So now a disclaimer, I'm going to talk a lot about job postings for this next section.

306
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:43,354
In case you're not familiar, job postings are like bullshit.

307
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:47,276
It's mainly designed to scare you away most of the time.

308
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:52,518
If you don't know to read the lines between minimum one to two years experience means

309
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,678
have a portfolio and laugh at our jokes.

310
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:56,719
It doesn't mean have one to two years of experience.

311
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,500
And also with job listings, you know,

312
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,801
you might be hired for one thing,

313
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:04,121
but then you end up doing something else or whatever.

314
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,402
So again, they're kind of bullshit,

315
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:07,943
but I still think they're kind of useful

316
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:09,883
because it's kind of the story

317
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,644
the game industry is telling to itself.

318
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,444
So I don't think they're accurate,

319
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:17,865
but maybe they're true, if that makes sense.

320
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:26,049
So here is a Crytek ad for a level designer back in 2001,

321
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,371
a scrappy small company called Crytek.

322
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,515
That's a lot of text,

323
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,757
but I just wanted to show you the whole thing.

324
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,459
Here are the highlights that I wanted to focus on.

325
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,990
So I feel like this ad is actually very representative

326
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,271
of most level designer ads around that time.

327
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,532
You can see that there's an emphasis on art skills,

328
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,573
architecture, modeling 3D environments.

329
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:53,574
Also note that it's engine agnostic.

330
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:56,635
They want you to use a map editor.

331
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,916
What engine is that?

332
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:58,656
I don't even know.

333
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,016
This is map editor, okay.

334
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,758
because they'll just teach you how to use their tool set later.

335
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:08,379
Your ability to produce levels is not an engine-specific thing

336
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:10,859
because they'll just train you when they hire you.

337
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,380
Also note the language here. You collaborate with the lead designer.

338
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,481
You work closely with project artists.

339
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,901
It sounds like a wonderful creative paradise.

340
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:24,499
Here's another ad for a level designer at Crytek.

341
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:24,919
This time in 2008.

342
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,541
Crytek is now a bigger company.

343
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,563
It's growing hair in places it never had before.

344
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:33,365
It's, this is the full ad.

345
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,047
I wanna show you, it's about twice as much text as before.

346
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,231
You probably can't read that, that's okay.

347
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,652
What's exactly changed for level designers since 2001?

348
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,827
The language here is very different.

349
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,768
Now Crytek prescribes a specific engine,

350
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,788
tool, genre, and gameplay dynamic.

351
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,229
You have little choice about what this game

352
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,189
is going to be about.

353
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,050
Market forces and studio heads have decided

354
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,211
what you're going to do already.

355
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:03,872
You also have to use the CryEngine sandbox editor.

356
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,113
It's no longer engine agnostic.

357
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,293
You're supposed to train yourself

358
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:08,453
and just hit the ground running.

359
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,830
They also used the hard third person pronoun he.

360
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,592
I hope that's just an artifact from 2008.

361
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,355
I hope we know better by now.

362
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,958
And if you're one of the people

363
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,060
who thinks that doesn't matter,

364
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,302
I don't know, just tell me how many women

365
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,104
are on the Crytek level design team

366
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,146
and it's hopefully not zero.

367
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,413
There's also a weird bit about where the level designer writes NPC dialogue.

368
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:36,315
That's kind of unusual.

369
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:41,458
Maybe that explains some things about Crysis.

370
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,080
There's more emphasis on hierarchy.

371
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,143
You no longer collaborate, you report to your lead level designer.

372
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:54,568
And in contrast to that listing from 2001, here now in 2008, they don't care if you have

373
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:56,990
art skills or if you know 3DS Max.

374
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,633
even care if you have an architecture degree.

375
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,097
What would architecture have to do with level design?

376
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:12,303
So now here's an ad for another level design position, Crytek for 2012, and Crytek's now

377
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,404
this much, much bigger company now.

378
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:20,227
And it's for a tech level designer, which is actually still a really new kind of job

379
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:21,268
title in the industry.

380
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,510
Tech level designer is kind of like a tech artist title.

381
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,813
You know, you're interfacing more with level design and code, and still, again, a pretty

382
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:31,193
new thing.

383
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,468
Here are the highlights of that job ad.

384
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:40,973
You know, sure enough, the tech level designer is a bridge between design programming, mostly

385
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:44,535
geared towards optimization with an emphasis on profiling tools and AI.

386
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:48,138
AI is traditionally something that consumes a lot of CPU stuff, so that makes sense.

387
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,102
But the thing that really amazed me about this job listing is that second to last bullet

388
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,524
in bold, prior level design experience is a plus.

389
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,711
this is a level design position

390
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:03,295
where prior level design experience is optional.

391
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,903
So that's kind of a beautiful paradox, right?

392
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:12,008
But the weird thing is that it kinda does make sense to us

393
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,533
because level designer is an arbitrary title anyway.

394
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:23,950
So, this kind of specialization I'll link to a wider trend within the industry called

395
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,853
specialization where job titles and responsibilities are getting smaller, narrower, and more specific.

396
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:36,555
And it's important again to note that a lot of AAA studios operate differently.

397
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,657
They don't maybe hyper-specialize, maybe they're more generalist, but I think just as many

398
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,518
AAA studios do hyper-specialize.

399
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,121
And I think it's partly a response to something Ed Byrne of Ubisoft talked about in Level

400
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:48,961
Design in a Day 2011.

401
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:55,765
In his talk, Unscaping the Goat, Byrne was complaining about how his studio often blames

402
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:58,866
level designers for problems because the role seems arbitrary.

403
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:05,870
So their job is to make the game fun and make the frame rate not slow.

404
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,690
What does that mean?

405
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,751
It's actually a really complex problem, right?

406
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:15,275
So if you specialize, if you chop up the level designer role

407
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:19,179
into much smaller parts, these are all real job titles

408
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,541
that you probably used to be under the general purview

409
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,884
of level design, but now there are separate roles now

410
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:25,845
in a lot of studios.

411
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:28,687
And.

412
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,552
A lot of these job roles, I think, follow the form of data in the game engine.

413
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,834
So you can see some of them are working with the level scripting files, some of them are

414
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:44,356
working with the light entities, some of them are working with the quest scripting files,

415
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:44,876
and so on.

416
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:51,539
So the materiality of the levels is kind of bleeding into level design, and it's fascinating

417
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,320
the way that it happens.

418
00:22:55,884 --> 00:23:00,211
So in the past two sections, I've emphasized the material and technological aspect of level design,

419
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,995
as well as the industrial laborer side of it.

420
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:07,903
Now I want to address kind of what we might think of more as like the pure design part of level design.

421
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:16,259
You know, we often think of level design as virtual architecture, but the key word here

422
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:16,880
is virtual.

423
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,966
They're not real buildings made of steel, made to carry load or withstand earthquakes.

424
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:22,468
These are digital spaces.

425
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,453
So what is this space made of and how do we architect this space?

426
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,441
So let's say you want a job at a studio,

427
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:35,021
and you go in and they have you do a level design test.

428
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,242
And you make your level kind of like this,

429
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,002
where you're building it and detailing it

430
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:41,583
one room at a time, finishing one section

431
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:42,703
before moving on to the next.

432
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:45,604
If you do this for a design test at a AAA studio,

433
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:47,544
you've failed within the first minute

434
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:49,425
because you're just doing it all wrong.

435
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,726
This type of art test approach is common

436
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,146
for environment art, but in level design

437
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,686
we've erected a huge barrier.

438
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,289
between art and design, which we're thankfully taking down,

439
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:01,890
if you saw a Stephen Cates talk.

440
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,934
But these are not levels to a level designer.

441
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:08,075
These are dioramas.

442
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,738
And this is level design orthodoxy that argues

443
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:13,679
environment art is just another asset,

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,721
endlessly repetitive, replaceable.

445
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,722
Look, there's six different doc scenes.

446
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,385
Dual level designer, these are all the same doc scene

447
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:23,607
because we can just replace it with whatever asset we want.

448
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:27,176
Oh, and this is a Splash Damage art test.

449
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:30,217
I hope Splash Damage changes their art tests soon,

450
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,698
because I'm sick of looking at this doc scene all the time.

451
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:40,200
So the right way to level design looks something like this,

452
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,681
and this is taken from a CCP games.

453
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:46,991
write up about their level design process.

454
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,773
Level design orthodoxy argues that good level design

455
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:52,235
will start with a paper prototype or design document,

456
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,978
hand that off maybe for a concept art pass or something,

457
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:58,781
then do a geo pass or a block out or a gray box

458
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:02,063
where it's just rough 3D shapes and stuff,

459
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:05,246
and then do an art pass and do all that stuff later.

460
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,289
And this usually gets okay results.

461
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,471
And as we discussed before,

462
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,954
it's what AAA level designers were complaining about.

463
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,075
They wanted more formal processes.

464
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:18,297
So this is that formal process

465
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:20,039
of what level design is supposed to be.

466
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,923
But where's the shape of this even come from?

467
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:27,925
Like, when you say a level can be chopped up into parts,

468
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,067
you're making a lot of assumptions about what a level is.

469
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:34,091
And that assumption is something called formalism.

470
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,954
You might have heard about the word formalism lately.

471
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,856
Don't ask people about it.

472
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,839
I mean, maybe you can whisper formalism

473
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,340
and then Raph Koster will corner you in the bathroom

474
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,641
or something and tell you all about it.

475
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:55,005
One origin of formalism is the philosophical theory

476
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:56,165
of platonic form.

477
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,947
So whenever you see anyone talk about formalism,

478
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,629
they're kind of invoking this a little.

479
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:04,171
The ancient philosopher Plato might ask us,

480
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,333
what is the chariest chair?

481
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:08,915
I'll let that question sink in.

482
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,517
Is that chair more like this chair?

483
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,678
Is that chair chairier than that chair?

484
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:22,620
Plato argued that the perfect chair had to exist outside of human experience, only in

485
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,481
abstract thought.

486
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:29,623
Only by contemplating endless chairs, we come up with the real perfect chair, and only philosopher

487
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,243
kings have access to that power.

488
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:35,808
You know, this is where the idea of platonic friends comes from.

489
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:40,494
If you're platonic friends, you're not debasing each other with wicked, filthy sex.

490
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:45,380
You're such good friends that you resemble the divine essence of pure friendship.

491
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,744
So, platonic forms formalism.

492
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,307
It's interested in the essence of things.

493
00:26:54,802 --> 00:27:00,484
Formalism has some strong roots with Plato, so it makes sense that ancient Greek architecture

494
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:01,784
might be very formalist.

495
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:08,647
So there you can see ancient Greek architecture had very specific ideas about proportion.

496
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,947
There's three different types of columns.

497
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,108
No other types of columns are allowed.

498
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:15,169
Those aren't architecture.

499
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:23,075
And a lot of pre-modern architecture generally has similar appeals to divine form and inherent

500
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:26,636
beauty of shapes and stuff and what proper buildings are supposed to look like.

501
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,958
Today we mostly associate formalism in architecture with modernism in architecture.

502
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:36,119
where the famous phrase, form follows function, comes from,

503
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,859
prompting a push for an international style,

504
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,360
a way of building that transcended nationalism and culture.

505
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,302
So if you've ever heard the architects Louis Sullivan or Mies van der Rohe,

506
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:50,102
Frank Lloyd Wright or Le Corbusier,

507
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,604
these are all supposedly the forefathers of modernist architecture in the West.

508
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,644
So from form follows function,

509
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,125
we can also derive other theorems.

510
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,846
Ornament is crime, is something related

511
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,227
to another thing called truth to materials.

512
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:12,888
Here ornament is defined as unnecessary detail.

513
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:15,109
So if you're working with concrete,

514
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,570
why would you sculpt concrete to look like a leaf?

515
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,491
Concrete isn't a leaf.

516
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:21,652
Concrete is cast in blocks, so you

517
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,313
can keep concrete in block form.

518
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,494
You don't make it look like a leaf.

519
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,815
And that's what truth to materials kind of speaks to,

520
00:28:28,436 --> 00:28:30,757
that materials have their own details involved

521
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,258
with the process of their construction

522
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,458
and what they are inherently.

523
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,139
And that's beautiful in themselves.

524
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,501
So that's why you would leave the rebar marks

525
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:40,462
and the stains there, because that's what concrete is,

526
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:41,282
and it's beautiful.

527
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:48,778
In terms of the work level designers do, we generally follow this idea when we gray box things or block out maps.

528
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,102
Work at a human scale is also another modernist idea with roots in pre-modern formalism. So there's the Vitruvian Man

529
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:06,444
by the Roman writer Vitruvius, championed by Leonardo da Vinci and a lot of Renaissance architects.

530
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:14,069
And then there's the Modular Man, or the Modular by Le Corbusier, based on a six-foot-tall

531
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:19,353
Frenchman—actually, he was originally shorter, but then he said everyone should be six feet

532
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:25,217
tall, so he raised the height—imagined as this international unit to unite imperial

533
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:26,438
and metric units.

534
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:30,761
It's like the essential form of all buildings, the essential human.

535
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,260
And scale in video games is actually really arbitrary.

536
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,641
So a lot of video games and level design

537
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,902
follow this kind of idea about working at a human scale.

538
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:44,502
If you saw the first talk of this track,

539
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,303
the Firewatch talk by Nels and Jake,

540
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:50,764
they talked a lot about how the space didn't feel right,

541
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:53,124
and they were thinking a lot about

542
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:55,705
how the player actually experiences a space.

543
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,645
Same thing with Gone Home,

544
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,546
where Kate had to shrink these spaces

545
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,846
to feel more intimate, right?

546
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,060
It's about how this kind of space feels to humans.

547
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,666
That's what work at a human scale refers to.

548
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:18,794
And then another idea that we can borrow from formalism in architecture is the idea of a

549
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:25,057
Part T. And a Part T is usually like a simple sketch and statement that describes generally

550
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:27,458
what that building or structure is.

551
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:32,640
So there on the left you can see a page from 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School.

552
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,901
That's a really good text.

553
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,822
I recommend you check it out if you're a level designer.

554
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:40,961
But I don't think we've really adopted this language,

555
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,983
so I'm gonna impose that language

556
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,704
on some other level designery things.

557
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,668
On the right, that's a party diagram

558
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:50,190
of what we might call gated hub,

559
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,232
where you have to get a key, and then another key,

560
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:53,553
and then unlock another door,

561
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,355
and keep returning to the hub.

562
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:59,496
That's kind of a generalized sketch of how that building functions.

563
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:04,537
Same thing with this image of what we might call a funnel from leveldesign.org.

564
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:07,138
And if you really like this stuff, you should check out leveldesign.org.

565
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,038
They have a lot of good resources for that.

566
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,999
And again, that's the idea that it doesn't matter what those gray boxes are

567
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,420
or what that red box is or what that green box is.

568
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,641
There's an essential form to this kind of structure,

569
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,942
and that's what all levels inherit and use.

570
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,745
So now I actually want to look at a building because I feel like level designers don't look at buildings.

571
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,088
So this is me making level designers look at buildings.

572
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,953
This is the VC Morris gift shop and it's in San Francisco.

573
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:45,935
I totally urge you to go actually visit it.

574
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:48,097
It's a really great building by Frank Lloyd Wright.

575
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,201
I think it's just like a 20 minute walk from here I think.

576
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:52,881
Or maybe 30 minutes.

577
00:31:54,296 --> 00:32:00,899
The exterior of the building is just a big kind of blank windowless facade and it's made

578
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,701
of this beige brick with an archway entrance at the bottom and then inside there's a spiral

579
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:08,983
ramp leading up so there's a bit of like a Guggenheim kind of feel to this.

580
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:18,377
So to think and make arguments about buildings similar to how we might do it in architecture,

581
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:23,622
first you make an observation about what we call the significant form of a structure.

582
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:26,485
So that means the most important parts, the parti.

583
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:32,270
Then next you tell us how that thing functions or how you think people experience that parti.

584
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:40,516
So here I'm going to argue that big featureless brick wall is a really jarring contrast with other buildings

585
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:46,800
Surrounding it and by being featureless with no windows next to all these buildings with a lot of windows

586
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,281
It's actually drawing more attention to itself

587
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:53,950
And it's actually really interesting that it's brick.

588
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,211
Brick is actually a really rare material

589
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:57,811
to see in buildings in San Francisco

590
00:32:57,871 --> 00:33:00,433
because brick doesn't withstand earthquakes very well.

591
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,015
And then that's also why they had to use a lot of wood

592
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,056
in San Francisco too, and that's why they planted

593
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,137
eucalyptus trees, because they needed more wood.

594
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:10,637
Anyway, that's a tangent.

595
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,479
Anyway, the point is that they're highlighting

596
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,500
the brick here, and the brick is part of a system

597
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,122
within the whole site and the whole surrounding community.

598
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:30,106
Um, we can also do this on, uh, actual video game levels.

599
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:34,587
So here's a, a map called Dead Simple, uh, from Doom 2.

600
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:39,488
Um, and it's the first fight against these Macubus monster things,

601
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:43,409
these, like, giant blobby things, and these, uh, spider brain monsters.

602
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,229
Uh, so it's your first fight against these two new monsters.

603
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,310
Um, and floor plan wise, this is, uh...

604
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,494
kind of really simple structure.

605
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,738
It's just a large courtyard or cloister

606
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,060
with the exit in the middle.

607
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,322
You have to run to the middle

608
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,887
and press a button to actually exit the level,

609
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:00,350
and that's after you kill all the monsters.

610
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:08,717
So, an argument about the Part T in Dead Simple would be,

611
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:12,280
Dead Simple is mostly one courtyard with two new,

612
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,262
never-seen-before enemy types.

613
00:34:14,883 --> 00:34:16,265
And then why did they do that?

614
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,047
Well, the contrast between a simple floor plan

615
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:21,930
and fighting two new enemies you've never seen before

616
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:23,752
is kind of a joke.

617
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,995
You know, the level actually isn't so simple.

618
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,029
And I feel like we would never do that

619
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:33,331
in modern AAA level design these days.

620
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,832
You would never put two new enemy types.

621
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,513
You'd do one new enemy type,

622
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:37,914
and then make sure the player's watching

623
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:39,595
what that enemy does or something

624
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:40,776
before they even encounter it.

625
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,479
Not a fan, in case you can't tell.

626
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:49,282
Next I wanna talk about level design as politics

627
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:51,204
and as a part of a community dialogue.

628
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,385
And I think we rarely think of level design

629
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,107
in this kind of dimension, so I wanna emphasize it.

630
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,742
The question here might be who is allowed

631
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:00,863
to be a level designer?

632
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,808
Recall the root of Western formalism

633
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:09,270
in the theory of platonic forms

634
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:12,313
was the idea that human experience is fallible,

635
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,094
so it can't be the source of absolute truth.

636
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:16,276
So maybe you can only access it

637
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,338
through disinterested contemplation, blah, blah, blah.

638
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:21,962
the chairiest chair doesn't exist, it's only a mental prototype in our minds.

639
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:25,365
And post-modernism had a few things to say about that.

640
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:29,770
Maybe there is no absolute truth or universal form of a chair.

641
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,475
Maybe these are all culturally constructed ideas of what a chair is, you know.

642
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:39,060
If I sit on a milk crate, does that milk crate suddenly become a chair?

643
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:45,529
In the lower left, you can see a notorious story of a farmer who was denied permission

644
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:49,956
to build a horse shelter, so he built tables and chairs, and there was no ordinance against

645
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:50,938
building tables or chairs.

646
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:52,941
Are those still chairs?

647
00:35:55,991 --> 00:36:00,612
Or like, why are we even like contemplating and studying chairs anyway?

648
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:03,112
Like, if you stare at a chair for a few minutes,

649
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,373
people are going to think you're really weird

650
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:05,653
because you're staring at a chair.

651
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:07,173
Don't be so weird.

652
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:08,834
No one stares at chairs.

653
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,974
A chair means however you use it.

654
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:12,194
A chair means sitting.

655
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:15,055
A chair is an obstacle to stub your toes on.

656
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:16,515
Chairs do so much.

657
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:20,036
A chair is a weapon to lay smackdown on your opponent.

658
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,879
And in professional wrestling, it's actually really important that this is a metal folding

659
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:27,160
chair and not like a baseball bat, right?

660
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,443
It's really important that it's a chair, and that's what makes that moment amazing.

661
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:36,727
And if you're interested in this kind of philosophy, go find Ian Bogost and buy him a drink or

662
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:37,047
something.

663
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:46,867
So a political critique of the most famous architecture might be that it was just architecture for powerful people.

664
00:36:47,848 --> 00:36:53,652
Most of the preserved buildings you see around the world are for religious institutions, royalty, military, or just plain old rich people.

665
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:56,874
The same point applies to a lot of modern architecture.

666
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:02,896
A lot of the modern masterpieces are vacation homes, corporate headquarters, huge institutions.

667
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:05,037
The message here is kind of clear.

668
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:11,019
Architecture with a capital A serves rich people, while the weak and poor must suffer

669
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:11,819
architecture.

670
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,821
So who gets to live in Frank Lloyd Wright's falling water?

671
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,802
Who gets to even visit it?

672
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,863
How do you even find out where it is?

673
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:22,204
How do you, do you have to rent a car to go drive it?

674
00:37:22,444 --> 00:37:24,165
Well, now you have to have a driver's license

675
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:25,085
and car insurance.

676
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:29,848
So that's a political critique of this kind of architecture.

677
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,649
We need to think about who actually gets to use it

678
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:33,529
and experience it.

679
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:39,334
And in the middle there, that's Le Corbusier's plan called Plan Voisin.

680
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:43,461
His plan was to bulldoze the middle of Paris and replace it with housing projects.

681
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:45,844
Wasn't too popular.

682
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:52,508
The other plan over there on the right was the notorious New York planners, Robert Moses's

683
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:59,514
plan to go through West Village or Greenwich Village in New York and bulldoze all of it

684
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:01,136
and put a giant highway going through it.

685
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:04,219
And that was kind of the fall of Robert Moses.

686
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,244
Basically architects wanted to govern and people rebelled.

687
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:19,126
Another story about architecture, how many people are familiar with the Vietnam War Veterans

688
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:22,647
Memorial in Washington, D.C.?

689
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:29,089
It's one of the most beloved pieces of American architecture, which is kind of amazing because

690
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:34,671
the Vietnam War is not the most popular or proud war in American history.

691
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,532
And it was designed by Maya Lin.

692
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:41,273
She was a young architecture student at Yale who was an underdog in the competition.

693
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,454
She proposed a really bold design.

694
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:46,715
It's this dark metallic cut into the landscape.

695
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:50,698
It breaks with most memorial architecture in Washington, D.C.

696
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:54,159
Usually like Greek temples with a giant statue of a dude or something.

697
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,981
This is the opposite of that kind of.

698
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:04,207
So Lin's design was a wound in the landscape and as you slowly descend into the ground

699
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,872
past all these names until you reach the date of the first death in the middle.

700
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:14,638
She wrote in her brief, for death in the end is a personal and private matter and the area

701
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:19,843
contained within this memorial is a quiet place meant for personal reflection and private

702
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:20,323
mourning.

703
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:26,453
Mai Lin won the competition, but only because it was a blind competition.

704
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:29,775
And when her identity was revealed, all hell broke loose.

705
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:38,940
Like, don't get me wrong, I really like white men.

706
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,962
Some of my best friends are white men.

707
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:51,903
I'm married to a white man, so I probably love a white man more than most white men

708
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:52,504
love white men.

709
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:59,247
But love also means knowing when to tell someone they fucked up.

710
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:05,169
So this is kind of a case of racism in architecture that probably couldn't even be more clear.

711
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,070
It was a blind competition.

712
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,691
They find out the winner was Mai Lin, a young Asian woman.

713
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:14,773
U.S. Senator Ross Perot called her an egg roll.

714
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,557
And then he and Jim Webb, another racist white senator,

715
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:21,658
withdrew support for the design.

716
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,820
You know, so before it was really great,

717
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,882
but once they found out who the architect was,

718
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,924
oh no, we can't have that at all.

719
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:32,587
And, you know, the argument was that, oh, it's insensitive

720
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:35,569
to have an Asian person make the Vietnam War Veterans Memorial,

721
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,051
which is one, racist, and two, like,

722
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,313
even if you believe that logic, Myelin was

723
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,114
like from like Ohio or something.

724
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:42,795
Like, it's not.

725
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:47,154
It's like totally not relevant even if you follow the racist logic.

726
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:52,137
Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James Watt threatened to revoke the permit

727
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:52,938
for building it.

728
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:56,360
It was basically just all these white men conspiring to destroy her.

729
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:01,483
And architecture, just like tech, there's actually a lot of architecture events about

730
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,284
women right now.

731
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:06,267
Architecture just like tech has a huge sexism and diversity problem.

732
00:41:07,107 --> 00:41:10,069
You know, who is society permitted to succeed, who wins competitions.

733
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:15,644
So what these white guys did to Maya Lin was kind of like...

734
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:18,872
an architectural murder, kind of.

735
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,533
I mean, they reached a compromise, and by compromise, I mean, they did their very best

736
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:26,034
to destroy Myelin's design.

737
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:33,396
So what they did is they wanted to put this big, tacky, bronze statue cast by Frederick

738
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:37,818
Hart, he's the white guy in the upper right, to symbolize all the soldiers who died.

739
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:43,019
But the whole point of the memorial was to communicate the sheer scope of all the lives

740
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:43,400
lost.

741
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,344
to give every soul some space and respect, to defy any co-optation of their lives by the government

742
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:56,988
by refusing to reduce 50,000 lives to three symbolic figures of melting pot patriotism.

743
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,433
But they did it anyway, and the statue is like right next to the memorial now, and it kind of

744
00:42:04,473 --> 00:42:10,196
ruins it. But as a final slap in the face, they paid the sculptor four times what they awarded to Mai Lin.

745
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:14,051
So this is why modernism kind of died.

746
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:20,136
Because even giant racists like Ross Perot, they have to admit that buildings are more

747
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:23,019
than just their party, more than just their shape.

748
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,945
Buildings also have their politics, and they might even be conservative politics too.

749
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:35,346
So maybe it's not form follows function.

750
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:38,669
Maybe it's more form follows worldview.

751
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,232
You have to ask whose function are we following?

752
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:44,534
What's the common language?

753
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:46,595
Whose terms become the common language

754
00:42:46,636 --> 00:42:47,796
for an entire discipline?

755
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:53,261
So therefore, form follows worldview,

756
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,542
architecture is political.

757
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,504
Listen and include the communities you build for.

758
00:42:57,544 --> 00:42:58,886
So here's some examples of that.

759
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:08,431
This building is Inner City Arts in Los Angeles and there they provided an underserved neighborhood

760
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:10,251
with arts programs and community events.

761
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:15,513
They specifically chose to paint it white to show that they would invest and maintain

762
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,614
in this building and infrastructure.

763
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:23,496
They also kept the garage doors to kind of harken back to their past as a converted car

764
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:25,316
garage in industrial Los Angeles.

765
00:43:27,077 --> 00:43:29,358
They also built the facility in several stages.

766
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:33,380
You can see on the left, they just started with that core there and then they actually

767
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,661
expanded it and added more buildings on later.

768
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:39,343
So you can think of it as kind of early access architecture.

769
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:43,425
They could immediately start making an impact and earn more funding and get the trust of

770
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:45,806
the community before doing more with it.

771
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:58,155
Another example here is the El Guadal Children's Center in Columbia, where, you know, building

772
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:02,478
with prefabricated sheetrock and steel frames might make sense in New York, but it doesn't

773
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,219
make sense here.

774
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,701
So they used local building techniques.

775
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:11,546
They cast the concrete with bamboo, local bamboo, and they also got local craftsmen.

776
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,468
They trained the local craftsmen to do all this.

777
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,231
And there's no big, expensive HVAC systems.

778
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:22,635
They spent three years consulting with the community as to what they wanted and needed

779
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:27,899
and the result was really wide sidewalks, a really large courtyard, bathrooms in every

780
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:30,861
classroom so a student doesn't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom.

781
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:38,047
So the postmodern critique of modernism might be that architecture must not just be site

782
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,428
specific, it should also be community specific.

783
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:47,220
Next there's also the Quinta Monroy housing development in Chile.

784
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:53,424
A firm was hired by the government to renovate a neighborhood popularly named by squatters.

785
00:44:54,704 --> 00:45:00,047
So instead of evicting the squatters and building a condo or something or replacing with a housing

786
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:04,250
project, they actually talked to them and found out what their needs were and what they

787
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:04,590
wanted.

788
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:10,315
And they actually turned their limited budget, too, into a design strength.

789
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:15,459
Rather than build an entire project at a low and cheap standard, they chose to just build

790
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,400
half of a house.

791
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,343
But that half of a house was an entry-level, middle-class living standard.

792
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:25,628
And then the squatters are used to improvising their own structures and building structures.

793
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:30,432
So they made use of that, and they let the residents fill in the rest of the building

794
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:32,554
as they need it, according to their own needs.

795
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:37,137
And that way it's kind of they're making the neighborhood their own still,

796
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:41,380
improves their living conditions, and you're sharing control over the

797
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,122
appearance and structure of neighborhoods with the architects.

798
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:52,288
So there's already kind of a rich tradition actually of post-modern level

799
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:57,351
design existing in video games. So I kind of want to highlight that.

800
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,685
So a lot of post-modern level design comes from modding

801
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,905
and multiplayer communities.

802
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:06,427
There on the very left is a notorious map

803
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,367
called Achievement All V4.

804
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:11,329
So in Team Fortress 2, they had this thing

805
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,750
where you could get achievements to get items.

806
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,931
So people started grinding achievements

807
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,832
and idling in servers where they could

808
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:20,773
just grind achievements in order to get items.

809
00:46:21,293 --> 00:46:23,834
So what happened was all these achievement grinding maps,

810
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:26,895
and then someone made an achievement trap map.

811
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:29,698
where it's all these players playing in the achievements,

812
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:31,119
grinding achievements, blah, blah, blah.

813
00:46:31,419 --> 00:46:34,322
And after a few minutes, a giant cat comes out of the ground

814
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,325
and then shoots lasers at everyone and kills everyone

815
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:40,448
and keeps killing them and then nukes the entire level

816
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:43,071
and punishes them all for grinding for achievements.

817
00:46:44,672 --> 00:46:45,872
It's really beautiful.

818
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:48,273
It's a really beautiful map.

819
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:52,434
And then their second is a map called Surf Thunderboom.

820
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:57,235
Surf map and surf map culture is a really interesting thing that's coming out of the

821
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,375
CS Counter-Strike community.

822
00:47:00,336 --> 00:47:02,016
And it's this really beautiful architecture.

823
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,637
It's all these surreal kind of slanted shapes.

824
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:07,217
Very unusual in FPS level design.

825
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:11,198
Maybe like Quake 3 floaters are the nearest analog maybe.

826
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:18,667
And then next there's FY Ice World, which is a very notorious map played in countless land cafes.

827
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,848
And it's, by our terms, a really bad map.

828
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:27,109
But it doesn't matter, because it fit a need within a community, and they're going to play it anyway.

829
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:29,950
Instead of like, D.E. Paranessi or something.

830
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,091
So the idea of an achievement trap, or a surf map, or a fight yard ice world map,

831
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:39,592
those came more from players, not from developers.

832
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:46,460
Or we can also consider maps like the Gary Hudson project, there on the lower left.

833
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:49,884
That was a marriage proposal made in the form of a Portal 2 map.

834
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:52,707
Or the next one is Love Punks.

835
00:47:52,887 --> 00:47:57,271
That's an amazing game made in collaboration with Neighbourhood Kids in rural Western

836
00:47:57,351 --> 00:47:57,912
Australia.

837
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:04,078
It imagines game development as a kind of community mural kind of thing.

838
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:09,985
Or we can talk about the work going on in countless schools that use Minecraft as a teaching tool.

839
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:12,446
So, you know, how did Greek architecture work?

840
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:17,109
Well, let's try to build a Greek temple and we'll find out a lot about how Greek architecture worked.

841
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:20,329
What matters more is the story around the level, right?

842
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:21,549
The process of making it.

843
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,890
Playing the Portal 2 marriage proposal

844
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,351
might be an okay level, but what we care more about is,

845
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:31,772
oh, did he make it himself as a labor of love

846
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:32,952
or did he pay someone to do it?

847
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,013
Did the person say yes or no, right?

848
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,773
Those are more important than what the actual puzzle

849
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:41,114
in the Portal 2 marriage proposal was, right?

850
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:43,814
So what matters is the process, the context,

851
00:48:43,874 --> 00:48:45,815
not so much the actual puzzle

852
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,615
or game mechanic stuff going on.

853
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:53,880
here. And again, these are all rich traditions of level design that exist

854
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,583
outside of Steam storefronts and Humble bundles and I think it's

855
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:01,126
important we acknowledge how much happens outside of our developer bubble.

856
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:09,899
So I'd like to end this talk with a discussion of what might be the future of level design.

857
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,001
What will level design look like?

858
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:16,044
What other alternate level designs can we imagine?

859
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:22,710
This is a picture by a speculative architect named Libas Woods.

860
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:25,812
If you're not familiar with him, you should look up his work.

861
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:31,577
Chances are your favorite sci-fi movie in the last five years stole shamelessly from

862
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:31,938
his work.

863
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:39,179
So I want to imagine three possible level design futures.

864
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,440
There are in reality an infinite amount of futures,

865
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,341
blah, blah, blah, but these are just the three

866
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:47,122
that I can kind of semi-coherently describe.

867
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:49,883
So, and they're already happening right now.

868
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:52,964
And they'll continue to happen probably.

869
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:57,845
So first, industrial.

870
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:03,393
I'd characterize industrial level design as the main ideology of the AAA game industry.

871
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:08,678
Here we see attempts at a lot of universal theories, things like the idea of like a vista

872
00:50:08,858 --> 00:50:13,661
and all your maps should have vistas every now and then, or Ubisoft has something called

873
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:17,645
rational game design where they kind of put a lot of their games through that kind of

874
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:18,145
framework.

875
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:22,750
Or even when you're working on Sunset Overdrive and you come up with a thing called a bouncy,

876
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,170
right?

877
00:50:24,512 --> 00:50:27,775
You're coming up with your formalism, you're coming up with your grammar, and it's the

878
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:29,257
developers dictating that.

879
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,224
But I mean, it doesn't always apply to things like...

880
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,297
Does Gone Home have vistas?

881
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:43,178
Does the concept of vistas really apply to Gone Home?

882
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:44,579
Because you're inside all the time.

883
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:46,600
Or what about Dear Esther?

884
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,461
Does the concept of vistas apply to Dear Esther?

885
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:50,422
Dear Esther's 100% vistas, right?

886
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:53,503
It's almost like redundant to call out

887
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:54,784
every vista in that game.

888
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:58,906
So, you know, these grammars, I would argue,

889
00:50:58,966 --> 00:51:00,987
are often problematic and can't be applied

890
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:03,908
to any game, just lazily.

891
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:08,863
And over time, I also think we're going to see increased specializational labor.

892
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:12,104
So already we're seeing absurd things like a content designer.

893
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:15,105
What's a content designer?

894
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:15,945
What's content?

895
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:21,246
Maybe job titles you can get so specialized, there's going to be a junior rock rotator.

896
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,327
That person will just rotate rocks and levels.

897
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:25,407
Or a tree intern.

898
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:27,588
They rotate the trees and your levels.

899
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:31,549
Junior trash placer.

900
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:34,649
You know, like, will labor get more specialized?

901
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:38,350
Maybe. It'll depend on the changing nature of AAA games, I guess.

902
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:43,691
So industrial level design imagines level design as this fundamentally human-oriented thing.

903
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:47,312
The solution to better levels is for humans to think better,

904
00:51:47,512 --> 00:51:50,133
or to put more humans to work on the problem.

905
00:51:50,453 --> 00:51:52,873
And that's generally how you solve problems within this mindset.

906
00:51:54,064 --> 00:51:57,327
The critique of this is that it's kind of pretending postmodernism never happened.

907
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,951
It's kind of pretending you can just kind of work your way out of things when maybe

908
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:05,475
you might have to adopt a different approach or a different kind of formalism.

909
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:13,101
Future B might be what I call cyborg level design.

910
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:16,884
You know, much like how there are different programming languages,

911
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:19,846
all with their different strengths and weaknesses, there are a lot of different ways

912
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,208
to generate levels and code simulations of levels.

913
00:52:22,228 --> 00:52:23,028
So...

914
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,762
You'll often hear them talk about them,

915
00:52:29,822 --> 00:52:31,743
I mean like Proc Gen, level designers,

916
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:33,904
talk about this framework worked for this problem.

917
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:36,586
Prim's algorithm worked for this thing in Eldritch,

918
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,867
but I had to modify it for this other thing.

919
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:40,388
But when I'm making this new game,

920
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,689
I'm not gonna use Prim's algorithm

921
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:43,009
because that didn't work for this.

922
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,491
So you see kind of multiplicity of different formalisms,

923
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:49,473
and these are all just tools instead of one formalism

924
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:51,254
that you just use for the entire game maybe.

925
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:56,807
And the concept of a cyborg is kind of funny, you know, like we usually think of cyborgs

926
00:52:56,887 --> 00:53:01,589
as something like the Borg from Star Trek, full of all these invasive implants.

927
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:04,350
But a lot of theorists argue that we're already cyborgs.

928
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:08,112
The way we use smartphones, they might as well be implanted in our hands.

929
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:11,874
We've been using books to augment our memory.

930
00:53:12,215 --> 00:53:13,815
We use wheels to augment mobility.

931
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:19,218
To a certain sense, a cyborg isn't a technological construct, it's a social construct.

932
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:25,643
So that's what leads us into the politics of human machine authorship.

933
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:29,425
You know, what is a good procedural level generation algorithm?

934
00:53:29,865 --> 00:53:31,206
Well, it depends, right?

935
00:53:32,027 --> 00:53:37,151
But I think a lot of people would say good procedural generation output would ideally,

936
00:53:37,191 --> 00:53:40,953
like the most perfect one, would resemble human authored output.

937
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:46,517
You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between procedural generation and handmade human generation.

938
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:49,417
But why should we do that?

939
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:51,318
Well, if we judge procedural generation

940
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:53,659
on its different terms.

941
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,120
And I think that's what David was getting at

942
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,200
in his Eldridge talk.

943
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,181
He was talking about how he was aiming for semi-coherency

944
00:54:00,461 --> 00:54:03,002
and he was involving Lovecraft Cthulhu stuff.

945
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:05,423
So that means the levels didn't have to look

946
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:08,324
like they were hand built because it works

947
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:10,445
when they're not totally elegant.

948
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,556
And currently I don't think of this as a very like AAA kind of domain because I think it

949
00:54:18,576 --> 00:54:23,221
needs immediate, AAA usually needs immediate payoff and they don't want to invest in long-term

950
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:26,785
research or if they do they treat it as a trade secret and not tell anyone.

951
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:31,330
So I think this is mostly an academic or indie endeavor for now.

952
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,007
And then the last feature I want to talk about might be local level design.

953
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:43,372
What if we made levels that were just for our clan, for our multiplayer server, for

954
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:44,793
our school, for our church?

955
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:49,217
What if levels were community murals that told our collective stories?

956
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:52,400
What if we made marriage proposal levels?

957
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,043
What if we made levels just to give as small gifts to each other?

958
00:54:58,205 --> 00:55:02,407
Local level design is characterized by rejection of top-down formalism.

959
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:08,250
If the purpose of a level is to deceive its players and make for really good YouTube fodder,

960
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:12,632
how does that change the structure of a level, right? You're not going to be thinking in terms

961
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:16,414
of choke points, you're going to think in terms of what will look cool on YouTube or something,

962
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:18,155
or what will PewDiePie like or something.

963
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:24,129
Local levels speak to things outside of video games.

964
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:25,510
They speak to ourselves.

965
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,871
They imagine level design, game development

966
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,672
as something we do for specific people,

967
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:33,313
not an abstract player derived from market research.

968
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:36,554
Local levels are process oriented.

969
00:55:36,974 --> 00:55:38,515
They care about how they were made

970
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:39,836
and that story's part of the level.

971
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:41,256
Again, the wedding proposal,

972
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:43,937
you wanna know if that player said yes or no

973
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:45,058
in response to it, right?

974
00:55:45,338 --> 00:55:46,918
That's an important part of that level.

975
00:55:48,624 --> 00:55:52,767
You know, meanwhile you don't, might care a lot less about how DE Dust was made or something.

976
00:55:53,428 --> 00:55:57,191
I care a lot, but I recognize a lot of people wouldn't.

977
00:55:58,252 --> 00:56:01,855
It's also about thinking about who you talk to.

978
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:03,116
Did you consult everyone?

979
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:07,659
If you're making a level set in Harlem or in the Arab world, why do you have to make

980
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,660
it into a war zone?

981
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,761
Is that kind of racist?

982
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:12,103
What are you saying when you make levels like this?

983
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:15,886
So critique of this.

984
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,272
might be that it's kind of slow, it's labor intensive,

985
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:20,233
it's unpredictable,

986
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,715
because if you're genuinely keeping your mind open

987
00:56:22,775 --> 00:56:23,935
to a dialogue with players,

988
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:25,657
you don't know what's gonna happen.

989
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:28,779
So maybe that's one reason why you'd be scared

990
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,341
to adopt this kind of design methodology.

991
00:56:33,596 --> 00:56:37,258
So to sum up, level design is no longer a big monolithic practice.

992
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,559
The idea of just level design is dead.

993
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,661
Sorry, no level design in a day for next year.

994
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:45,463
I just said so, it's final.

995
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:49,945
So what we might propose instead is an intersectional level design.

996
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:53,767
You know, you draw on as many different level design traditions as possible.

997
00:56:54,508 --> 00:56:58,670
When someone says level design, you say which level design are you talking about maybe?

998
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:00,852
Thanks for listening.
