1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello?

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,421
All right.

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:06,781
Hi.

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,543
So my name is Debra Henderson and I'm going to be talking today about how design can ensure

5
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:13,704
the impartial scientific fairness in user research.

6
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,586
But first I want to introduce myself and ask you to please turn off all of your phones

7
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,367
and various noise devices, those are what they're referring to.

8
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:26,290
I'm going to talk today about a bunch of different things.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,771
But first, I am a user researcher.

10
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:32,672
I have a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology.

11
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,073
I've worked on a whole bunch of games.

12
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,294
You'll see a lot of examples from the games that I've worked on in this talk.

13
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:40,575
But first and foremost, what I am is I am a designer.

14
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:47,903
I am a designer of research, and I have come to ask a favor of those of you in the audience

15
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:53,330
who design games, which is, I'd really like to stop talking about methods.

16
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:58,309
And this may seem like a very odd request to make as a researcher.

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,491
I in fact love methods.

18
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,812
Boy do I love methods.

19
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:06,356
But the reason I want to stop talking about them is because what methods are for me is

20
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:07,257
they are tools.

21
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:10,100
They are tools that I use to design things.

22
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:15,365
And when people want to know whether or not my designs are good, the question you want

23
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,727
to ask is not, did you use an axe?

24
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,010
But are you an axe murderer?

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,433
The way that you use a tool is actually vastly more important than the tool itself.

26
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:31,837
And so instead of talking about methods, these are the three things that I want to discuss.

27
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:35,439
One, I want to talk about what UR needs from game design.

28
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,083
Because, let me be clear, without the assistance of game designers, I will never be successful.

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,273
Two, I want to talk about how I design bespoke research,

30
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:50,156
because every single piece of research I design is in fact bespoke.

31
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,060
And three, I want to talk about how to ensure a just interpretation of data,

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,403
because I think this is probably the largest friction point between game design and research,

33
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:02,526
is making sure that the interpretation is in fact fair.

34
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:08,126
So to begin with, I'm going to talk about what you are needs from game designers.

35
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,907
And to talk through this, I'm going to use a case study.

36
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,209
It's a little bit of an unusual case study because it's from the 1740s.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,811
Allow me to introduce you to a designer.

38
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,272
This is Samuel Richardson.

39
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,853
And he is a very good designer.

40
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:26,996
He designed, he's known as sort of the father of the modern novel.

41
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:31,180
So the field that he is working in is the novel, right?

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,063
That's the hot new technological wonder for entertainment of the day.

43
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,606
And he builds basically the first successful franchise.

44
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:39,847
And that I mean, he writes two books.

45
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,649
One's named Pamela, one is named Clarissa.

46
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,310
In the tradition of all fine franchises,

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,712
they are essentially identical books with different titles.

48
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,735
And he is hugely successful with both of them.

49
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:57,077
Okay, and the real problem that he wants to solve is how do you get people to care about fiction?

50
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,878
And this might seem like a problem that some of you in this room are also working about how you get people to care about

51
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:07,299
your imaginary imaginary worlds and things like that, but he means this really literally because

52
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,580
this may not be obvious, but the problem with fiction is it's all lies.

53
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:18,286
Why would anyone care about a character they know is imaginary?

54
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:21,673
This is the kind of problem he is trying to solve.

55
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:26,076
And his main theory for how to solve this is something that's going to be known as the

56
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:27,537
willing suspension of disbelief.

57
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:34,720
He thinks that if you just get people to treat fiction the same way they would treat nonfiction,

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,901
you can get the right kind of engagement.

59
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,542
You can build presence, right?

60
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:43,444
So this is an idea that Coleridge is later going to sort of codify when he says, a semblance

61
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:44,124
of truth.

62
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:52,188
sufficient to procure for those these shadows of imagination, that willing suspension of disbelief, for the moment

63
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:59,831
which constitutes poetic faith. And so the goal that Richardson has is to sort of minimize the gap between

64
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:04,094
fiction and nonfiction, so people can treat his fiction as though it is nonfiction.

65
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:10,817
And his solution for this is actually a really interesting one because it is a technical solution. It is a solution that can be applied

66
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,838
independent of content. He thinks

67
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:19,374
The future of the novel is the epistolary novel.

68
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,036
So the epistolary style is where you write letters back and forth.

69
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,598
And he thinks this for really beautiful reasons.

70
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:29,080
He sits down and just tries to calculate

71
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,202
how you minimize the gaps between fiction and nonfiction.

72
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:35,444
He points out, with this letter writing style,

73
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:38,125
you just minimize the number of leaps of faith

74
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,746
you ask your consumer to make.

75
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:41,948
So you have to assume the following things.

76
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,510
One, you have to assume that people are slightly more verbose than usual.

77
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,512
And remember, this is a time when letters are actually delivered three to five times a day,

78
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,614
so it's more like email and less like snail mail.

79
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,197
Second, you have to assume that your letter writers have good memories,

80
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,659
so they include all the good bits in their letters.

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,223
And third, you have to assume that people have an unusual propensity to keep their letters,

82
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:03,585
because in theory, what the novel is is a collection of those letters.

83
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:09,169
And what I love about this is this is both a beautiful demonstration of design thinking.

84
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,391
This is good, good, good, clean, crisp design thinking.

85
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,073
And it's also just fundamentally wrong.

86
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:22,898
And it's in that sort of tension between really good design thinking and like anybody who's

87
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:26,741
ever actually read the book and thought, no, the epistolary side, I don't need that.

88
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:31,104
Like that tension, that's not only where user research lives.

89
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:32,925
That's actually where science lives.

90
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:36,228
Because what we have here is falsifiability.

91
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:41,192
And this is the one thing that every scientist will have in common,

92
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:42,794
no matter what their field is,

93
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:46,277
is a deep and profound belief in falsifiability.

94
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:49,379
And falsifiability is the idea that a scientific theory

95
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,064
must be capable of conflicting with possible or conceivable observations.

96
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,272
This is how science builds its identity.

97
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:05,916
In fact, when we talk about science, we will draw a line between science and not science

98
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,418
that is entirely based on falsifiability.

99
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:12,281
So for instance, Albert Einstein is not science.

100
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,183
In 1905, Albert Einstein has what is known as the Annus Meroblis, where he publishes

101
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:23,108
four papers, one on the photoelectric effect, one on Brownian motion, one on special relativity,

102
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,971
and one on that old chestnut, E equals mc squared.

103
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:31,897
Of all of these papers, he wins the Nobel Prize for the first one, the photoelectric

104
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:32,318
effect.

105
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:35,221
And the reason he gets the prize for that is because he's a physicist.

106
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:39,082
is not because his thinking was better in this paper than it was in anything else,

107
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:43,203
but because a man named Millikan could come along and test it,

108
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:48,165
and he could run an experiment, and he could set Einstein up to fail.

109
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:50,806
And you know what? Einstein didn't fail.

110
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:56,528
And because of that, we had evidence, we had scientific evidence that he was on the right track.

111
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,252
And it's important to recognize, too, that falsified is actually a relatively new idea.

112
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,793
So Popper, for instance, died in 1994.

113
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,175
This is all 20th century thinking for science.

114
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:10,578
But for games, I actually think this idea is core.

115
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,741
Because, as Lou Gehrig once observed,

116
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,164
I love to win, but I love to lose almost as much.

117
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:22,887
I love the thrill of victory, and I also love the challenge of defeat.

118
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,480
Game designers understand that a victory isn't a victory because it's a win.

119
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,382
It's a victory because it could have been a loss, right?

120
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:37,984
The value of the win is not in making a whole bunch of cheap wins.

121
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,426
It's often in really sort of riding that ragged edge of destruction, right?

122
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:47,028
Getting really close to failure and pulling up, because that's a real win.

123
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,469
You really earned that one.

124
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:54,530
So what I need from design is I need you to be Einstein.

125
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:58,087
I need you to build me that theory.

126
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,609
I'm going to talk through a sort of practical way to actually do this.

127
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:04,451
So the way that we do this at Microsoft is we have designers.

128
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:07,172
The first thing you'll do when you start onboarding with UR

129
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,373
is we won't run any studies.

130
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:10,774
Instead what we'll do is we'll sit down and talk about your design intent.

131
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,135
We talk about it in a very sort of systematic way.

132
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:17,877
We want to build out a theory that we can then test in a falsifiable manner.

133
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,199
And we do this in a couple of ways.

134
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,229
We try to build out game-specific experience goals.

135
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,621
What are the promises you as a game designer are trying to make to your player?

136
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:32,259
Second, we break this down into subcomponents, because generally speaking, the people that

137
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,460
we work with are very ambitious.

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,862
We need to make them into sort of more consumable units.

139
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:40,005
The next thing we do is we make sure that all of these units are measurable, and by

140
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,346
that I mean falsifiable.

141
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:46,209
And then finally, the sort of last and most important thing that we do is we write these

142
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:48,390
in a way that's feature independent.

143
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,231
Because here's the thing.

144
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:54,635
Games start off, they're scoped in a certain way, and then some features work and some

145
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:55,896
features don't, all right?

146
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,796
And it's okay.

147
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:01,378
for a feature to disappear as long as the experience ends up being there in the end.

148
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:05,319
So I'm going to give you just a real example of this.

149
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,340
I've neutered it a little bit to sort of hide privacy and things like that.

150
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,121
But here is a sort of basic way that we break down sort of open world.

151
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:14,822
Frictionless exploration.

152
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,483
That's the goal.

153
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:21,024
And what we mean by that is I'm motivated to explore and do so without limits or friction.

154
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,905
I then break this down into sort of more useful components.

155
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,285
All right, need pushes me out.

156
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:28,306
My base is not self-sufficient, but needs me to go out and explore.

157
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:30,447
Curiosity pulls me further.

158
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,248
I may head out with an initial goal, but the environment I see

159
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,969
and the people I meet tempt me, making me want to explore.

160
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:37,829
Exploring is frictionless.

161
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:38,729
Exploring is rewarding.

162
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,230
And as I read through these, these may seem very generic.

163
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,371
But they're not, and they're not in a very specific way.

164
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:47,672
So think about the word curiosity.

165
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:52,148
This probably aptly describes a game like Fallout 4,

166
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,528
where you start off, and you're walking out,

167
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:55,789
and there's an awesome silhouette,

168
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,989
and you wonder what the hell that is,

169
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,209
and you move in that direction,

170
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,670
and you're just, what's over there?

171
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,770
I should go look over there.

172
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:04,051
But I'm not sure that it accurately describes a game

173
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:07,312
like Don't Starve, where the reason to explore

174
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,233
might just be fear, right?

175
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,114
So this is specific to the games.

176
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,754
It's just not because of the features

177
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:15,795
that they're building in, it's because of the experience

178
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:16,955
they're trying to give a player.

179
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,683
So if you can build out a theory like this, I can then design research for you that's

180
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:27,305
specific to test this particular theory.

181
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:31,447
You as the designer have defined what success should look like, and I'm going to measure

182
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:31,967
against that.

183
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:36,870
And I'm going to walk through here a number of the sort of design pillars that establish

184
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,952
good UR practices, and these are things that independent of methods should be true.

185
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:44,622
So the first thing I want to talk through is power.

186
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:47,362
So power is basically the relative strength of a signal.

187
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:51,063
It's the loudness of the thing that I'm trying to measure.

188
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,723
So I'm going to give you an example.

189
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:53,964
This is a video.

190
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:56,184
There are actually five people here.

191
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,945
The fifth one's in the missing corner until they'll show up shortly.

192
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,246
And what I want you to do is I want you to watch these videos.

193
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,346
I want you to look at the eye tracking.

194
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:05,226
That's the little red dot.

195
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:08,827
And I want you to tell me, is there a pattern or isn't there?

196
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:13,544
Can I do this?

197
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,283
So when I look at this, I think those people are behaving in a very, very similar way.

198
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:43,586
And this tells me there's a lot of power to the signal in this data.

199
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,409
And this is an important concept because oftentimes the first question that somebody asks after

200
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:51,531
I run a study is, how big is your N?

201
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,573
And what they mean by this is, how many people did you run?

202
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:57,535
And this is oftentimes viewed as a way to judge the sort of goodness of a study.

203
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,838
And the answer people are looking for is, oh, it was terribly big.

204
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,800
I ran lots of people, right?

205
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,143
And non-researchers hear this, and they're just like,

206
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:10,164
this is awesome, this is a very expensive study,

207
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,784
I'm super excited about this, they're like, lots of people.

208
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,725
Here's the problem, I will ask this question,

209
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,126
but here's how I'm asking this.

210
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:22,446
When I ask this question, what I'm really saying is,

211
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,487
are you cheating?

212
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,187
Do you have a real thing there?

213
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:31,168
Or did you just run enough people that you could...

214
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:36,340
Overcome a very small power thing and discover it.

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,743
Because one of the things about things that are not very loud, things that don't have

216
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:43,827
a lot of power, is that you can test them if you just test a lot of people and they

217
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,871
show up and they are fancy things like statistically reliable, right?

218
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:51,945
And that's not actually a good reason to care about something.

219
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:56,390
You probably care about something if it actually is really truly meaningful.

220
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,075
And what's interesting about this is that the way that you calculate an appropriate

221
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:03,379
end does vary based on the method that you use, but this is actually just a bunch of

222
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:03,800
math.

223
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,162
And any of you are is going to know how to do this math, right?

224
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,442
Sometimes you can use a small n.

225
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,604
Sometimes if you're asking about emotional questions like,

226
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:11,844
is the game fun or something like that,

227
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,345
you are going to want to increase it.

228
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:15,966
But overall, when I say increase the n,

229
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:19,388
I'm talking about maybe running 30, 35 people at once

230
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:20,849
in a given condition.

231
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,210
And if you have somebody who's presenting you data,

232
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,351
and they're like, this is statistically reliable,

233
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:25,871
don't worry.

234
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,252
I've run 2,000 people.

235
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:31,454
The question you need to ask is not, how big is your n?

236
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,135
But what's your effect size?

237
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,018
This is a very basic math thing.

238
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,639
There's a standardized way to interpret this.

239
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,360
You can ask that instead of what's your N.

240
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:44,764
You can Google what the correct answer is, but it should be big if you want to care about

241
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:44,844
it.

242
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:50,248
What's great about this is that power is one thing, but what we really balance this against

243
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,809
is an assessment of risk.

244
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:54,886
And there are a number of ways to judge risk.

245
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:59,389
I think the most common way that people judge risk is in terms of just popularity, right?

246
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,730
How many people does this affect?

247
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:05,774
As an example of this, if you're ever captured by Hannibal Lecter and he gives you the option,

248
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:09,297
do you want to break your leg, but it'll heal, or I'm going to mess up your ankle, but you're

249
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:10,037
going to limp forever.

250
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,919
The option you want to pick is actually to have him break your leg.

251
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,522
And the reason is because this is a sharp, painful thing, but our stress systems are

252
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:17,943
very capable of dealing with this.

253
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:23,085
Conversely, if you have a very small thing that nags at you for the rest of your life,

254
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:23,885
this is awful.

255
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,585
It makes people terribly depressed.

256
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,525
It's really bad.

257
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,446
An example of this in gameplay is re-traversal.

258
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:34,427
If you mess up your checkpoints, you make people rerun that like half a second of like

259
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,308
information that they didn't want to see, that cut scene that they didn't want to watch

260
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:41,449
four or five times, this becomes stunningly grating, right?

261
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,530
And it's because of just the pure repetition that generates risk.

262
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:48,739
The problem is there's another way to generate risk.

263
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,382
So one of the things that we'll do oftentimes is we'll present people with graphs that look

264
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:52,823
like this.

265
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:56,306
And a common reaction from designers is this is awesome.

266
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:57,687
Most people love my game.

267
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:00,810
Those people at the bottom, I plan to ignore them.

268
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,213
They are outliers.

269
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,317
From a math perspective, you might have a point,

270
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,039
though there's actually, again, a mathy way

271
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,480
to actually calculate that correctly,

272
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,961
and they may not actually be outliers.

273
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,162
But from an experience perspective,

274
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,544
I will never throw those people out.

275
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,245
And the reason I won't throw those people out

276
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,427
is because those are the people I am most worried about.

277
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,508
Those are the people I need to pay the most attention to

278
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,950
because something has gone terribly,

279
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,331
terribly wrong for them.

280
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,052
And I need to know what that is

281
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:31,034
so I can make sure that never happens again.

282
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,194
Let me give you an example.

283
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,542
So this is an example from a game called Haunt.

284
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:36,203
It was a Kinect game, so the way that it worked

285
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,366
is you would fight various ghosties in a house,

286
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:41,628
and they would give you instructions on how to battle them.

287
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,629
So in this case, you were supposed to cover your eyes,

288
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,850
so you'd put your hands over your eyes,

289
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,751
and the Kinect would see this,

290
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:48,753
and you would essentially be shielding against an attack.

291
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,375
But here's another prompt that they used.

292
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,918
So there's cover your ears, and then there's this one.

293
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,924
And what is interesting about this is this is in some ways not a failure in any way,

294
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:03,644
shape, or form.

295
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,425
This player, in fact, beats the ghost.

296
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,265
He is a winner.

297
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:13,007
Because Kinect can't tell the difference between this gesture and this gesture when you do

298
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:13,967
them repetitively.

299
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:20,449
But I would argue that you need to see very few people make this type of error.

300
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,954
Before thinking, I should really fix that.

301
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:26,515
I should not use the word thrust here.

302
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,036
I should maybe use push or shove or something that implies

303
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,757
that I'm using my hands, right?

304
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,357
This is another kind of risk.

305
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,398
And one of the things that we will do

306
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,518
just in all of our reports is we will go through

307
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:39,959
and we will give a severity assessment

308
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,119
based on this kind of risk.

309
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,620
So every time we will write up a report,

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,840
some things are very important,

311
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,801
some things are less important,

312
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,921
and we'll just communicate them to people.

313
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,823
So another pillar that we want to talk about here is control.

314
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:56,846
And control is the idea that if you subtract information out of a situation,

315
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,447
you can in fact reveal.

316
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:00,709
So I'm gonna give you an example.

317
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,970
I'm gonna show you two videos from a usability session.

318
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,292
We are playing by standard usability rules here,

319
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,833
which means that none of the participants know anything about the game.

320
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:10,875
And I want you to just spot the differences.

321
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,386
So that's the first one, and here is the second.

322
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:48,851
What?

323
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:50,752
What are you doing?

324
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:55,155
You're supposed to be in the hot lava.

325
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:56,236
What is that?

326
00:17:57,637 --> 00:18:01,479
So this second reaction turns out to be, I would say, the closest I've ever seen to

327
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,041
universal in a sort of like you have an infinite number of things you could do and what do

328
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:05,302
you do?

329
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:06,923
You get under the lava.

330
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:12,947
If you are under five and have not played this game before and have never had the experience

331
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,108
with the idea of hot lava.

332
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,898
Everybody just climbs underneath it. There's in fact an achievement.

333
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:25,241
If you do this, which presumably only children receive, because it is so common, right?

334
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:31,124
And what we've done here is we've controlled out for the most common thing that I have to control out for, which is knowledge.

335
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,586
In this case, it wasn't actually the designer's knowledge. It was the parents' knowledge.

336
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:39,289
He looked at the game and he said, I know what this is. I know how to play. And they played that way.

337
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:44,752
And they had a wonderful time. It was delightful and fun. But this also was pretty amazing for people, right?

338
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,645
And controlling for knowledge in the lab is important,

339
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,631
but it's also actually important as you sort of expand outwards.

340
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,354
And the other big place that you need to consider control

341
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,436
is actually in your org chart.

342
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:56,578
So this is my org chart.

343
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:02,989
In it, game designers here represent, go up through Phil Spencer.

344
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,511
There is a layer cake of useless people in between.

345
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,494
And on the other side, there are user researchers.

346
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:10,196
And I report all the way up through somebody else.

347
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:15,921
This means that for a game designer to come into conflict with me and in some way limit

348
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,662
what I'm able to say in my analysis.

349
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:22,606
They have to go over Phil's head, and I'll be honest, nobody ever does that.

350
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:29,291
Conversely, this means that design is always also free to bet against me, right?

351
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:34,014
Because the thing is, what makes a good designer and what makes a good user researcher are very different things.

352
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:37,797
And what you want is somebody who knows something about research judging me,

353
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:41,300
and somebody who knows something about design judging a designer.

354
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:46,573
So the main thing that we control out of things is noise.

355
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:50,938
And I'm going to give you an example from Toy Soldiers Cold War.

356
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,583
So in this game, this is a screenshot from the released version, but I want you to notice

357
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:56,485
the little bar at the bottom that says barrage.

358
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:01,405
This is something where players would go through, they'd get in a gun, they'd start killing

359
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:05,369
things and if they killed enough things quickly enough, they would unlock basically this awesome

360
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,453
reward which is a little Rambo and you could run around and shoot things, it was amazing.

361
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:15,219
The problem is that when they first built this, that bar in the corner, it wasn't blue,

362
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,421
it was red.

363
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:20,765
And this meant everybody thought, oh, my gun's overheating.

364
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,649
So instead of going and actively pursuing this barrage,

365
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,710
they would get close to it and they'd be like,

366
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:29,611
whoa, I gotta stop.

367
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,053
And everybody started actively avoiding it.

368
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,934
And what was going on here is that players

369
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,575
just didn't understand the mechanic.

370
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,157
Now imagine for a moment if I put this game

371
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,238
where people actually understand what's going on

372
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,620
and the previous game into a play test

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,521
and I asked people to say which one was fun.

374
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:52,157
Odds are this one is going to be more fun, the released version, simply because people

375
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,559
actually understand how to use it.

376
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,381
Comprehension was a blocker for me.

377
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,502
It added a bunch of noise.

378
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:03,467
I couldn't ask about fun until I could be certain that people, I knew that people understood

379
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:04,148
the mechanics.

380
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,417
We talk about this a lot at Microsoft.

381
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:11,499
And we basically think there's sort of a consistent flow in terms of how you need to test things.

382
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,899
First off, you need your core mechanics.

383
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,101
These are like what you're doing in the game, walking around, shooting things, picking stuff up, that kind of thing.

384
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,602
But the next thing that we actually need are learning systems.

385
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:27,525
And the reason we need learning systems is because we need the game to successfully communicate to the player how they need to interact with the game.

386
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:31,044
And these don't have to be overt tutorials.

387
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:33,905
I've seen a number of lovely talks here this week already

388
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,105
about sort of subtle ways to do this kind of teaching.

389
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,486
But people do need to understand your game.

390
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,006
And they need to understand your game before I'm willing

391
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:41,787
to actually ask them what the experience is like.

392
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:42,487
Is it fun?

393
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,028
Because if I don't ensure that they know how

394
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:47,609
to understand it, they're going to judge you very,

395
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,229
very harshly in an unflattering way

396
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,950
and for really unfair reasons.

397
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,011
So with all of these principles, I can go through

398
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:56,751
and I can build a great.

399
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,932
sort of design for research.

400
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,973
And that I mean a process to run in a lab.

401
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:05,535
But the next stage is actually what I do once I get the data back.

402
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:09,416
And there's another question of just how do we ensure a sort of just interpretation

403
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:09,896
of data.

404
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:13,298
And I think that this is a really important one for us to talk about because I'll be honest,

405
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:18,300
I think most of the time game designers look at you and think you're a big, flamey sword

406
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,762
wielder and don't really understand how we maintain the sort of fairness of our interpretation.

407
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:24,743
And again, there are some basic principles.

408
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,165
The first one is a priori.

409
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:32,288
So this is Latin for what comes before.

410
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:35,190
And it's a basic rule that before I run any study,

411
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,892
I should know how I'm going to interpret the data.

412
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,915
So an example of this is at Microsoft,

413
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:44,577
we will go through and we will do things like fun scores.

414
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,098
We have a whole bunch of scores that we do.

415
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,899
And oftentimes the first question I get back

416
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,140
from a designer is, well, I mean, I got a 4.1.

417
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,681
What the hell does that mean?

418
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,249
And that's a fair question, right?

419
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:54,409
Is it good?

420
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:54,949
Is it bad?

421
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,690
I don't know.

422
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,633
And the reason I don't know is because it actually sort of whether or not 4.1 is good

423
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:02,853
depends on two things.

424
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:05,635
One, it depends on the quality of the thing that you're actually testing.

425
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,776
So it might be, it's going to be a reflection of that.

426
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:11,238
But the other thing it's going to be a reflection of is the willingness of participants to actually

427
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,238
pay you compliments.

428
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,320
And this, it turns out, varies based on the type of thing that you're asking them about.

429
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,822
So in this example, I've got three things graphed up here.

430
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:23,465
We have collected for years and years and years in the exact same way a whole series

431
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:26,426
of questions, and we test hundreds of games with them.

432
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,468
And this is our distribution for them.

433
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,150
And so this tells us sort of the average score that every game gets.

434
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,332
And what's interesting about these is that the distributions differ.

435
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:40,515
So if you look at them, HUD doesn't score very well ever.

436
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:41,729
Okay?

437
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,331
And this is because typically a good HUD is an invisible HUD.

438
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:51,013
And if you notice the HUD, so you could pay it a compliment, that's a little unusual,

439
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:51,434
right?

440
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:54,915
Most of the time when a HUD's working well, nobody has anything negative to say about

441
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:54,996
it.

442
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,957
Conversely, graphics.

443
00:23:58,297 --> 00:24:00,918
People will lavish praise on graphics.

444
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,599
Like, people know how to talk about it, they know how to judge it,

445
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:06,219
they feel really good about it, it is beautiful.

446
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,740
You get five out of five, right?

447
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,441
They're willing to do that, and fun falls somewhere in the middle.

448
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,181
So whether or not a 4.1 is good, it depends.

449
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:17,042
For HUD, it's probably friggin' amazing.

450
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:19,543
For graphics, no, that's embarrassing.

451
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:25,627
And what's interesting about this is that I know all of this before I run my first study.

452
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:30,790
If you sign with us and I go and I say, hey, I'm going to be a user researcher, I can tell

453
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,953
you three years in advance what I want to see before you actually ship.

454
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,774
I'll be like, these are the scores I want to see.

455
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:40,036
This is how you should be doing before I'm going to feel comfortable.

456
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,884
So the next thing the data needs to be is it needs to be actionable.

457
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,307
And what I mean by this is you need to actually be able to use it in some way.

458
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:51,710
If I go through and I tell you you're a terrible designer but I don't actually tell you how

459
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,414
to help that or fix that in any way, that's really, really problematic.

460
00:24:56,275 --> 00:25:00,759
And this actually means that I do testing not necessarily on games but on my own methods.

461
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,900
And I'm going to give you an example of this.

462
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,162
So I'm going to show you.

463
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:03,602
I'm going to show you.

464
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:05,823
Two trailers with some eye tracking.

465
00:25:06,183 --> 00:25:09,084
One of them was a prototype, and one of them was the release version.

466
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:11,945
And the question that I had when watching these was,

467
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:13,565
could I actually test the prototype?

468
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:16,986
And would I actually get data that was representative of what was going to happen in the release?

469
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:22,187
In other words, could I use the prototype to predict the trajectory of this trailer?

470
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:26,228
And so I could test it early enough so somebody could actually fix things and get ahead of it.

471
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:30,389
What's convenient about this clip is that because they edited things out of the prototype,

472
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:31,850
the prototype and the release are...

473
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,531
out of sync, so you'll be able to look at one and then look at the other.

474
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:37,172
So...

475
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:38,633
Oop!

476
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:39,754
That didn't work.

477
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:42,895
Where is my mouse?

478
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:49,258
Oh, hey!

479
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,340
Welcome to Spectacular Sunset City!

480
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,482
Okay, here's the situation.

481
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,403
A contaminated energy drink...

482
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,318
So if you're watching this clip,

483
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:03,439
one of the things you should notice

484
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,761
is there's a really close relationship

485
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,042
between the prototype and the release.

486
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:09,444
And what was fascinating about this

487
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,345
is that there would be a close relationship

488
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:15,789
even when the monsters weren't yet in the early prototype.

489
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,871
Because of the way that they were moving the camera

490
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,072
and the lighting and the positioning

491
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:20,012
and the sort of scene,

492
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:23,816
they could get an entire cluster of people

493
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,697
to all focus in the right spot

494
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:26,858
before they put the enemy in.

495
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,982
And what this tells me when I see this kind of pattern is that if I see problems in the

496
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:35,625
prototype they're probably going to show up in the release version.

497
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:41,930
And this is just a test that I do for me and I have done this on every single method I've

498
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,410
ever run.

499
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:47,675
So if you have questions about whether or not a method is actually predictive, any UR

500
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,596
should be able to give you a reason for why they think it is.

501
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:53,209
The other piece of this is that when you talk about things being actionable,

502
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,133
it's not just a mix of the right question to ask, it's actually also when to ask.

503
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:01,836
So one of the things we did in Halo 2 is we actually had a little survey that popped up during the game.

504
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:06,440
And we knew what we wanted to ask, this was the question that we asked people,

505
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,943
but we didn't know how frequently to ask it.

506
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:11,365
Because this actually is a problem for design, right?

507
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:13,587
This depends on the level design.

508
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,628
If we ask it every hour, maybe that's useful for some person.

509
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:22,391
But in our case, it turns out that the cadence that we need to ask this was every three minutes.

510
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,233
And this was because that was the cadence that the game moved on.

511
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:30,615
And again, this is an example of if you for some reason are not in contact with your UR,

512
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,417
you probably need to be, because this is the kind of information we really need from designers

513
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:37,479
in order to design the right kind of study to make sure you can actually use the data.

514
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,081
The next thing that we need from data is that we need it to be consumable.

515
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm going to give you an example out of science.

516
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:48,785
This was the first visualization that was made using scientific data.

517
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:50,805
It was a gentleman named Von Humboldt.

518
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:51,706
He goes to South America.

519
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:53,126
He does a lot of measurements on mountains.

520
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:56,647
What's neat about this is he drew them out and he saw that there were all these layers

521
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:57,147
in the mountains.

522
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:01,568
He went back to Germany and he handed this out and people looked at it and they looked

523
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:06,229
at the mountains outside their window and thought, hey, I think there's a pattern here.

524
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,790
And this is actually what visualization should provide to you.

525
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,731
They should provide that kind of high level pattern.

526
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,251
So here's an example from game design.

527
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:17,272
This is how we visualize all of our difficulty questions.

528
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:19,373
So you have four different missions.

529
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:22,693
We ask after each of these missions, how difficult was the mission?

530
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,374
And you get four different responses.

531
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:28,295
It should be, I hope, relatively clear if you study the slides for

532
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:32,295
a couple of seconds, that the one that you want is the one with the tallest green

533
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:33,496
bar, right?

534
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:36,656
Cuz this is the one that has the right balance for the most people.

535
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:41,661
And conversely, if you compare the bottom two visualizations,

536
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,623
if you get that feedback on two different missions,

537
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,225
you should respond in very, very different ways.

538
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:48,728
Because one of them is broken because it's too easy,

539
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,550
and one of them is broken because it's too hard, right?

540
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,431
And the way that you handle that

541
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:53,592
is just fundamentally different.

542
00:28:55,598 --> 00:29:01,021
Finally, the last thing that data should be when you're presented with a report is diagnostic.

543
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:05,003
So I talked a lot about falsifiability to begin with, but there's actually another way

544
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:09,185
that science sort of generates hypothesis, and this is known as inductive reasoning.

545
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:13,687
And before Popper, this is sort of what a lot of scientists did.

546
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:17,409
Essentially, they went out in the world and they observed things and they looked for patterns

547
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:18,989
and they generated hypotheses.

548
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,613
And so when Newton went and gave his sort of theory of light,

549
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,615
one of his methods that he had to actually

550
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:29,541
demonstrate so that other people could replicate it was how to build a prism so that you could actually go and break apart light

551
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,403
correctly so other people could see it, right?

552
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:35,647
Here's an example from game. This is a terrible graph. I made it.

553
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:40,032
The reason it's terrible is that it was actually based on telemetry.

554
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,074
So it was a bunch of currency that we were earning in a game.

555
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,628
And what I found from it was that there were these huge spikes.

556
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,690
Like people were starting off with a certain amount of currency

557
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,771
and they were getting these four times increases from certain encounters.

558
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:54,292
And when I presented this to the game designers, their response was,

559
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:55,173
that's impossible.

560
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,634
That your telemetry is bugged.

561
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,860
I don't believe you.

562
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:00,902
That is not okay.

563
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,564
And it turns out the telemetry wasn't bugged.

564
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:04,745
This actually was an error.

565
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,668
But we just couldn't tell why this error was happening from this graph.

566
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:12,010
Instead we needed to actually go through and visualize the behavior in a different way.

567
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,493
So this is Rise, and the way that you earned currency.

568
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:20,557
was typically through building up your combo and as your combo got higher and higher, you

569
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:22,317
got an exponentially larger reward.

570
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,598
And when we went and we looked at sort of the low breaks in terms of combos and the

571
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,459
high breaks, there was something really distinct about the high breaks, which is that they

572
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,560
all tended to occur during these instances where you weren't strictly speaking in combat,

573
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,881
you were instead in these kind of moments where you would be put in a ballista.

574
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:45,467
And you could kill a bajillion things all at once, which meant it was very easy for people to get combos of

575
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,812
300 rather than 12, right? And this actually was what was throwing things off,

576
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:53,956
and why the designers needed to sort of fix that.

577
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:59,842
The other fallback that we have here is actually to just look at behavior.

578
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:06,505
This is one of the most common ways that we will use telemetry, which is that we'll build

579
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:10,067
a map, we'll mark out things that we think are interesting, and then we'll just link

580
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:10,848
it to videos.

581
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:16,331
So if you are the guy who's in charge of cars and you just want to watch 500 videos of cars,

582
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:17,191
great.

583
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:21,714
I will make it easy for you to do that so you can figure out what's working and what's

584
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:22,034
not.

585
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:27,678
So I think a fair question to ask at this point is...

586
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,449
Wasn't this whole talk about methods?

587
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,872
And to a degree it was, but a very, very sort of high level.

588
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:38,435
And the reason I'm keeping it at this high level is because if you want to know what

589
00:31:38,455 --> 00:31:40,936
a good method is, this is really the test.

590
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:44,239
You need to make sure that it follows this complete cycle, right?

591
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,461
You should be able to generate a design theory.

592
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,522
You should do some falsification testing.

593
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:51,024
You should reject whatever doesn't actually work.

594
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:53,166
You should diagnose what's wrong.

595
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:57,209
And then you should be able to generate new design theories so you can go off and make

596
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,810
new, better versions of it.

597
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:02,355
So let me give you an example of how to evaluate two methods.

598
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,196
Say you have the following question.

599
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,616
Where are players getting lost?

600
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,177
You don't want anybody to get lost.

601
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,817
You want them to walk forward, shoot the right things,

602
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:11,978
and never get lost in your level.

603
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:12,318
Fine.

604
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:14,918
There are two possible methods here.

605
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:16,639
One, telemetry.

606
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:17,919
Everybody loves telemetry.

607
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,640
It's the greatest, the newest, the wunderkind at the moment.

608
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,021
I'm gonna compare that against a really old school method

609
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,561
called asking people.

610
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:35,535
Did you get lost? Yes? Where? So this, I did this on the same level, so these are

611
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:40,878
examples from Quantum. That, by the way, is a great example of what getting lost

612
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:43,520
looks like for telemetry. What the hell is that blue dot? These are all

613
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,221
heartbeats of players. What the hell is that blue dot out there? It's somebody

614
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:49,703
who has escaped the level. They've jumped a fence, run out of it, and they just

615
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:52,085
keep going until at some point they fall off a cliff and die.

616
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:57,354
Figuring out where they got lost from this data, however, is very difficult.

617
00:32:57,554 --> 00:33:01,956
And in comparison, I'm going to give you the other side of the slide, which is that actually

618
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:05,437
when we asked people, 95% of people said that they got lost, which I don't think is clear

619
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:06,197
from the telemetry.

620
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:10,779
And we asked people where they got lost, they gave us these beautiful explanations, right?

621
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,360
And you looked at it and you thought, oh, I know what I did wrong.

622
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,280
I've got to fix this one, right?

623
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,162
It was much, much clearer to figure out where you needed to intervene.

624
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:26,127
But the other important thing about this circle is that I own the boxes in gray, right?

625
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:29,988
As a user researcher, I do falsification testing and I help diagnose problems.

626
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:34,449
But design owns the horizontal, okay?

627
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,451
And if design doesn't keep up their half of it, this whole system fails.

628
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:42,412
And to show you how that works, I'm going to go back to Richardson.

629
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:45,948
Remember, I think he is a very, very, very good designer.

630
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,789
I do feel the need to say that at the moment.

631
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:54,373
But as it turns out, the epistolary style is not the reason his books were very, very popular.

632
00:33:54,914 --> 00:34:00,317
Instead, what he had done is written a couple of books where basically there's a young woman

633
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:05,140
and then there's this darkly romantic hero who does all sorts of really fundamentally inappropriate things.

634
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,062
He kidnaps her, he like sorts her letters, he does all sorts of weird things.

635
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:11,244
And this is considered very sexy and romantic.

636
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:16,769
It wasn't that he had figured out the next great technological breakthrough.

637
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,011
It's that he had essentially written the twilight of his day and age.

638
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,014
And it turns out, he figured this out at some point.

639
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:26,215
He was like, this is not working the way I thought it was going on.

640
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,117
And what was interesting is he had the option.

641
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:32,040
Was he going to reject his design hypothesis, which in his case was that

642
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,922
people think about fiction just exactly the same way they think about non-fiction.

643
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:41,666
To do that, he would have to say, hey, maybe people hold fictional characters to a different standard.

644
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,541
Or he wouldn't reject his hypothesis, and he would have to believe that people think

645
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:52,563
that the behaviors described in books like this are appropriate and okay to do in the

646
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:53,163
real world.

647
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:55,864
And that's the interpretation he went with.

648
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:57,545
And he did try to solve this.

649
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:02,806
His solution was to issue another copy of these books with footnotes in explaining the

650
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:06,368
moral degeneracy of his sort of romantic hero.

651
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:10,249
I have no idea if this was—I don't think this was effective.

652
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:17,193
I do want to compare and contrast this with another designer, a designer who did in fact reject, in my opinion,

653
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:19,634
Richardson's sort of core hypothesis.

654
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:26,698
Because when she writes, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune

655
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:34,163
must be in want of a wife. This is the sort of statement that can only be made as fiction. This is not true, right?

656
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:39,078
And what's interesting about this is that you can debate the quality of a designer,

657
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:41,900
and you can debate the quality of their art, which of course is a separate thing.

658
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,102
But I'm willing to bet that there are more people in this room who know the name of this author

659
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,404
and can tell me where this quote is from,

660
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:51,446
than can tell me the names of both books that Richardson wrote,

661
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,447
and I told you that at the beginning of the hour.

662
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:56,389
It's Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice.

663
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,991
And it's interesting, when you think about these two designers, it's very easy at our

664
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:06,414
300 years distance, right, in our vast knowledge of how the novel actually works, to think,

665
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,615
I am definitely Austin, right?

666
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:09,875
I got this.

667
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:11,456
But here's the problem.

668
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:15,798
If you were to time lock the beginning of the novel and the beginning of video games,

669
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:22,241
it turns out that we're a lot closer to Richardson than we are to Austin, okay?

670
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:24,602
And maybe...

671
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,564
You actually are just vastly smarter than this designer who was the inventor of the

672
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:32,244
modern novel.

673
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,227
But when I look at this, I think, well, crap.

674
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:42,112
I have got to find a way to get a lot smarter than I am a lot faster.

675
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:50,639
And for me, that solution is to embrace the following idea, that daring ideas are like

676
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,460
chessmen moved forward.

677
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:53,721
They may be beaten.

678
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,259
But they may start a winning game.

679
00:36:59,043 --> 00:36:59,644
Thank you very much.

680
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:19,326
I was curious, in research usually you can find results that either confirm or refute

681
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:23,809
a hypothesis from the game design team, but I'm curious what happens when you get maybe

682
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:28,572
a highly controversial hypothesis that in fact you find a null result, no relationship

683
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:31,453
or that something doesn't affect what you thought it did.

684
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:37,455
So typically, it's actually harder to find null results in game design testing than it

685
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:38,415
is in science.

686
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:43,017
Because typically, the hypothesis is, I made this better.

687
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:44,237
Did I make this better?

688
00:37:45,618 --> 00:37:49,059
It doesn't necessarily mean that you haven't, in fact, added an improvement if you don't

689
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:50,099
see that kind of jump.

690
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,301
Because it turns out that you oftentimes, there's an idea in psychology known as the

691
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,942
just noticeable difference, where you actually need to make a sort of a large jump before

692
00:37:57,982 --> 00:37:59,683
people are willing to pay you compliments on it.

693
00:37:59,743 --> 00:37:59,983
And so.

694
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:04,287
Unless you're actually adding a feature that's generating problems, typically we're like,

695
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:05,709
yeah, that's probably a good idea.

696
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,871
Or at least it's not bad, let's keep moving, right?

697
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:11,635
Because we're on a production schedule, people, we gotta keep working on this.

698
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,379
So that tends to be how we handle the kind of null hypotheses.

699
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,240
Hi, I'm Bim from Poki.

700
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:25,525
In one of your slides, I think it's the slide about the benchmarks,

701
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,268
you're showing fun as a metric.

702
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,891
I was wondering, how do you measure fun as a metric?

703
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,314
We ask people how fun was this game.

704
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:39,297
In that particular case, we have used, Microsoft uses a benchmarking process when we're actually

705
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:43,579
establishing these kinds of things where we have asked these, the same set of questions

706
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:48,902
in the exact same way across a multitude of games to sort of control out any of the variants

707
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:50,903
in terms of just how people interpret this.

708
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:54,825
Obviously, fun is not the only thing that you can use as your high level metric.

709
00:38:54,866 --> 00:39:00,168
It just happens to be a very common one because it is, generally speaking, a good high level

710
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:01,229
KPI, right?

711
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:02,129
All right, thank you.

712
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,570
Mm-hmm.

713
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,346
Hi, so when on the PM team you're trying to test quickly and not really engaging with

714
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:23,232
UR, how can you build this into like A-B testing that you would show in the game?

715
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:33,961
Like, for example, if you're building a new Fatui and then you put it in the game and hash it to a specific percent of people who can see it,

716
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:39,884
if the Fatui doesn't work or doesn't test well, then a PM might look at that and say,

717
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,625
like, oh, okay, we shouldn't have a Fatui.

718
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:46,307
But then another question could be just, like, was that the right Fatui to show players?

719
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,968
Is it that they don't want a Fatui or should you just continue to iterate on it?

720
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:53,925
So I think in that case, my answer is going to be you probably shouldn't have production

721
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:58,850
running your tests because that doesn't sound like a test that actually tested the question

722
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:03,054
that you were interested in, which was, hey, should we have a Fatui, right?

723
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:07,058
If you're just sort of throwing things out there and hoping data is going to tell you

724
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:10,122
the right answer, you're kind of not doing it right.

725
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,645
There are a few really catastrophic errors that designers can make.

726
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:18,269
When consuming data and ceding design to players is one of them.

727
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,631
You are always a designer.

728
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:23,073
It is on you to find the solutions, right?

729
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,696
Players are going to tell you what they want sometimes, but that's not necessarily what

730
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:27,197
they need.

731
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:29,058
And it is on you to get that.

732
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:32,081
And that's part of why we really strongly recommend pairing with a researcher so you

733
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:35,864
can actually design things to actually get the data back that you need that can be actionable

734
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:36,224
for you.

735
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:37,766
Okay, thanks.

736
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:39,585
Hi, thank you for the talk.

737
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:43,250
So do you have any thoughts about psychological framing

738
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,971
with your questions?

739
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,016
The notion that if someone asks their lover,

740
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,820
do you love me versus don't you love me,

741
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,202
that you might not get the same answer.

742
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:54,445
Do you have any thoughts about the framing of the questions?

743
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:58,441
I don't just have thoughts about the framing of the questions, I have thoughts about how

744
00:40:58,481 --> 00:40:59,822
you see people in the lab.

745
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,084
I care about that topic immensely.

746
00:41:02,384 --> 00:41:07,328
There's lots and lots and lots of research showing that basically you can convince people

747
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:11,251
that something is true or get them to say something that they know is untrue if you

748
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,273
put them in the wrong sort of social group.

749
00:41:13,293 --> 00:41:17,536
So the classic example of this is there was a group where they basically imagined if everybody

750
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:21,920
in the front row was a participant except for that guy, and the row was actually full,

751
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,041
and we went through and we asked everybody, hey,

752
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:25,163
Here are three lines.

753
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,145
Tell me which one is longest.

754
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,890
And every single person in the front row picked the wrong one.

755
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,834
By the time we got to him, he probably picked the wrong one too.

756
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:37,317
And this is just a demonstrated effect.

757
00:41:37,357 --> 00:41:40,801
And one of the things that we do is actually when we test people in large groups, we put

758
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:41,662
blinders on them.

759
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,285
Essentially, we put them in little cubicles so they can't see people.

760
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:48,127
And so there's no indication of whether or not you're progressing, for instance,

761
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:51,790
slowly through things, or whether, because you should be going at your own rate and

762
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,710
all of that kind of stuff.

763
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,632
So we definitely worry about that an enormous amount.

764
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:59,274
It's also why one of the most common things that if you are, for some reason,

765
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:01,115
running your own research and you are a designer,

766
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:03,937
the number one recommendation is stop talking to people.

767
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,059
And while you are running things, right?

768
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:10,501
And I jabber constantly during usabilities, but that's because I've been

769
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,563
trained in the right way to sort of ask questions and things like that.

770
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:14,243
Thank you.

771
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,060
Mm-hm.

772
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,547
I think I'm out of questions.

773
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:19,770
Oh, you're going to get another one.

774
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,371
Okay, so when you're looking at data that you're getting from an experiment you're running,

775
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:31,533
sometimes you might, or typically you would expect the data to follow a certain story.

776
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:39,217
So like you're increasing engagement and retention and then thus your average revenue per daily user goes up.

777
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:43,439
But oftentimes with experiments we see like maybe average revenue went up,

778
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,721
but then there might be like a 0.3% reduction in your retention.

779
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:51,065
Or revenue went up but engagement is down.

780
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:56,733
How can you kind of filter through your data or then design more tests to get to

781
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,478
what the heart of is really happening through this test and

782
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:02,101
what their real reaction is to it?

783
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:06,833
So it's fine to use those kind of high level metrics to sort of keep track of sort of your

784
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:10,194
progression on something, like I'm moving up or there's a red flag here.

785
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,775
But in the same way that like the graph that I had around currency tracking, if you're

786
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:16,855
too high level, it's just not actionable, right?

787
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:18,456
You have to get more context there.

788
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:21,476
And frequently do it just through qualitative questions.

789
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:23,277
You made a choice.

790
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:24,497
Why did you make that choice?

791
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:25,337
Okay, great.

792
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,457
Explain it to me and then I'll go through and understand it that way.

793
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:39,711
I guess if we have data on a quantitative level, it can be representative, but then how do you know that the user you would be talking to on a qualitative level would be representative?

794
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,605
of all your users?

795
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:45,647
Well, because you sample correctly, is I guess the answer.

796
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:50,131
It's the sort of thing where you have to, sometimes people think that the best way to

797
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:52,593
run studies is to basically run them like the census.

798
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,714
That's not true.

799
00:43:54,194 --> 00:43:59,199
You don't need to get every single person in your database to answer a question to know

800
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,139
whether it's representative.

801
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,822
Instead, you correctly sample and find the right people.

802
00:44:10,055 --> 00:44:13,117
You're talking a lot about formative testing.

803
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:19,181
Do you have a process for looking at analytics post-launch?

804
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,183
And what is that process like?

805
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:25,206
We pull the data and we look at it.

806
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:31,070
Typically, what we do is, so you can't just hook everything in telemetry.

807
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,812
You have to actually go through this entire process to begin with.

808
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:37,675
If you want to have effective telemetry, you need to start off with a design question that

809
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:38,495
you're trying to answer.

810
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:41,656
You need to figure out how you're going to answer that with data.

811
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:45,277
You typically need to prototype this a couple of times to make sure that it actually works.

812
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:46,517
Then you need to get it hooked.

813
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:49,558
You need to then check your pipelines to make sure that they're hooked correctly.

814
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,639
And then things will come back and be informative.

815
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,140
I'll be honest, I am mostly in the business of trying to prevent problems before they

816
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,700
are released.

817
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,821
But we do definitely do ongoing engagement stuff, and we certainly use telemetry.

818
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,622
I'm more likely to use it in the lab than I am just post-release, though.

819
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:04,422
Thank you.

820
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:04,882
Mm-hmm.

821
00:45:07,696 --> 00:45:08,640
All right, this time for reals.

822
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,966
Thank you very much everybody.
