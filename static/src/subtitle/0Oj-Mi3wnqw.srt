1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,450
All right, let's do this.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,111
So I want to thank everyone for coming out today.

3
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:12,132
One big thanks to GDC.

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,853
It's been a career goal of mine to talk here for a while.

5
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,053
And it's a privilege to be here today.

6
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:19,594
So my name is Zach Lowery.

7
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:22,295
I was the project animation director on Saints Row 4.

8
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,436
And I've been in the industry for about nine years

9
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,297
this past February.

10
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:27,897
And there we go.

11
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:33,907
So over the course of those nine years, I've had the luxury of working on the Saints Row franchise.

12
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,870
Every iteration, every box title, every extended content.

13
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:43,860
And for those who don't know, Saints Row is an open world, third person, action driving

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,843
combat game with a fully customizable protagonist.

15
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,365
Saints Row can potentially be an animator's dream come true.

16
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:54,669
Over the course of the franchise, it's gotten more over the top than almost anything goes.

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,590
So it's really fun.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,414
Just to kind of set the tone for some of those over the top experiences that you might have

19
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:05,698
in a Saints Row game, we've had cyberspace, Tron inspired levels.

20
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:13,437
Paramilitary luchadors, skydiving gun battles, nine foot tall brute clones, furry mascots

21
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,819
who want to beat you within an inch of your life, driving a car through traffic while

22
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:21,102
a tiger mauls you from the back seat, missions on Mars, and a gun that shoots a frickin'

23
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:21,302
shark.

24
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,830
Now, this is only the over-the-top stuff that happened in Saints Row 3.

25
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:31,658
So when Saints Row 4 was being concepted, the entire team was tasked with one-upping

26
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,621
the over-the-topness of Saints Row 3.

27
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,605
So of course our only response was, holy shit.

28
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,686
So the internet often jokes, where can they take Saints Row next?

29
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:46,890
Saints Row 1 started and you were an up-and-comer on a street gang and you joined that gang.

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,032
Saints Row 2, you went on to run that gang.

31
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:53,256
Saints Row 3, you had taken that gang to pop culture icon status

32
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,940
and everyone in the city loved you no matter if you were murdering or driving over pedestrians.

33
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,142
So where does it go from there?

34
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,565
It went to the only logical place that it could go.

35
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,867
And that's that you became president of the United States,

36
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,670
aliens kidnapped you because you were the only thing

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,632
standing in their way from world domination,

38
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:12,355
and then you were trapped in a Matrix-inspired simulation

39
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,836
where you were given superpowers.

40
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:16,859
So this talk is going to focus on the unique challenges

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,863
that the Volition Animation team encountered in Saints Row IV

42
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,664
when trying to build our superjumping system.

43
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,427
There were a lot of superpowers in the game.

44
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:28,369
There was telekinesis, super sprinting, freeze blasts,

45
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:29,109
all kinds of stuff.

46
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,931
But we're going to focus on super jumping here,

47
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,432
because it's something that A, proposed the most problems

48
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,673
for the entire animation team across the project,

49
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:38,574
and B, when all is said and done,

50
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,735
we had overcome our challenges.

51
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,075
Something that we're all really proud of.

52
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:45,900
So a couple of takeaways, and none of these are going to be mind-blowing by any means,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,345
but hopefully you guys can see how all this kind of worked together to get to the end

54
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:50,605
goal.

55
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:52,607
So start with what you know.

56
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,171
I'm going to touch on that here in a moment.

57
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,755
Kind of an unconventional source or use of reference footage, kind of a reverse engineering.

58
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,398
Creation of pillars for a feature.

59
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:08,254
And then the biggest one is failure when learned from,

60
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:10,715
which is the important part, can be an invaluable resource

61
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:13,195
for understanding and executing your final product.

62
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,795
So the talk's going to go through a couple of steps.

63
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,936
We're going to cover the animation direction overview.

64
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:21,897
We're going to go through the challenges that we faced, talk

65
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,437
about the initial approaches that we took.

66
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,357
Spoiler, those did not work.

67
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,218
We're going to go back to the drawing board and kind of

68
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,038
rethink our inks.

69
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,578
And then we're going to show what we applied.

70
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,537
and show off some final results.

71
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:37,260
So animation direction overview.

72
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,981
What was the animation direction overview?

73
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,425
Due to an extreme time crunch between Saints Row 3 and 4

74
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,007
and THQ's need to kind of push out another product,

75
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:48,849
it didn't change from Saints Row 3 to 4,

76
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,072
which is kind of good because it allowed for some consistency.

77
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,614
Between Saints Row 2 and 3, everything had changed

78
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,895
and there wasn't any consistency.

79
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:58,037
So this was something that, at first,

80
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:00,298
we were kind of bummed out because we wanted to change some things,

81
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:01,600
but we knew that it was for the best.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,802
So Saints Row 3's animation direction overview was built around two very simple words.

83
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:10,545
And that was comfortable, which meant that our player character,

84
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,366
nothing was new or surprising for the player character.

85
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,247
He had done everything multiple times,

86
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,529
and he had gotten better and better through experience.

87
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:19,610
And the second word was confident.

88
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:24,837
Our player leaped before he looked. He knew that he was the best in any situation, no

89
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:28,859
matter if he had never really been in that situation before. He was more blue collar

90
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,260
and more street experience, and he wasn't tactical and trained. Hence the pose right

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,981
there with the guy just slinging an M60 down by his leg.

92
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:42,211
Will Smith's character, Mike Lowry, who is in no relation to me, was the epitome of our inspiration.

93
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:46,036
So much so that the entire animation team began using the mantra of

94
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:52,424
what would Mike Lowry do when we were looking for animation inspiration and character performance.

95
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,755
So we faced two major challenges right off the bat.

96
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:01,078
The first was blending superpowers with the previously established conflicting animation

97
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:01,518
direction.

98
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:06,301
It was going to be really hard to be comfortable when you were just given superpowers, and

99
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:11,304
this is actually the first time in the franchise where we were actually telling the person

100
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,465
holding the controller that you have never done this before.

101
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,368
It was always kind of assumed that you had shot someone or drove over people in the streets

102
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:18,708
before.

103
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,891
And then confident. Now confident and superhero, there's a very thin line between those two.

104
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,713
And that may not seem like it's important right off the bat, but it actually is.

105
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:31,515
Because we weren't making a Saints... excuse me, we weren't making a superhero game.

106
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,597
We were making a Saints Row game where you were given superpowers.

107
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:35,677
And there's a big difference there.

108
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:40,339
So superhero posing speaks to who that superhero is.

109
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,640
If you look at Spider-Man, the way that he bends his fingers,

110
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,420
the way that he flares his arms out,

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,241
even how he gracefully flies through the air,

112
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,722
he embodies those god-awful demon spawns known as arachnids.

113
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:52,362
Superman.

114
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,283
In the comic books, he's always drawn with a smile on his face,

115
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,784
broad chest, arms flared out.

116
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,424
He's a manly man and he's very confident.

117
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,263
Or the character Nightwing. The way that Nightwing fights or flips through

118
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:07,807
environments and moves around speaks specifically to the acrobatic family

119
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:11,731
known as the Flying Graysons. We weren't making this. We had a fully

120
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,614
customizable protagonist, so we had to speak to the breadth of superpowers.

121
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,276
We couldn't pigeonhole you down this route and say you're going to move

122
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:21,559
like Spider-Man or this or that. People wanted to create the superhero that

123
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:22,020
they wanted.

124
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,883
And the second biggest challenge is knowing where to begin.

125
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,692
And when it came to superpowers, or super jumping,

126
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:31,794
we were a very inexperienced team.

127
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,857
There were no one on the animation team that was like,

128
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,499
oh, we worked at this studio over here,

129
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,121
and we kind of made something similar to that.

130
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,026
So we were all just trying to figure out where to even begin.

131
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,549
This goes back to my first key takeaway.

132
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,022
And that's starting with what you know.

133
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,843
So it was a relatively simple problem to overcome.

134
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,565
We knew that we had a simple Saints Row 3 jumping system.

135
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:59,567
And it was specifically animation driven because we wanted to get away from the physics-driven

136
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:03,228
jumping system of Saints Row 1 and 2, and animators wanted full control over what that

137
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:03,829
jump looked like.

138
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,190
Saints Row 3 wasn't about jumping, so we just wanted it to look good.

139
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,132
So we had a simple takeoff animation that would take you back to the ground, and if

140
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,172
you didn't contact the ground.

141
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,083
You would go into a fall animation, and then based on your velocity,

142
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:18,666
we played several different lands.

143
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,390
Like I said, Saints Row 3 wasn't about jumping,

144
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,794
but Saints Row 4 was definitely going to be about jumping.

145
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:26,237
So we took what we knew...

146
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,235
And we did a quick and dirty hack for the design team,

147
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,816
so that they could prototype this out.

148
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,317
We basically took that jump system,

149
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,478
scaled up the animations, and allowed

150
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:36,838
you to go higher in the air to give you

151
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,098
a quick sense of super jumping.

152
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,099
That's clearly not where we ended up,

153
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,960
but we didn't want to be a bottleneck for design.

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,140
We wanted to just give them something

155
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,601
that they could get in, move forward

156
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:47,842
with the proof of concept, while we had a little buffer

157
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,122
to figure out what we were going to do.

158
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:55,287
So while Design was busy with their hack-jumping system,

159
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,610
we went on what was called the Great Reference Footage Hunt.

160
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,813
We were trying to gather super-jumping reference

161
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,414
from any medium that we could find.

162
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:05,858
We were looking at comic books and YouTube and watching movies.

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,861
And this quickly became known as the Not-So-Great Reference

164
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:09,321
Footage Hunt.

165
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:15,709
One thing that was quickly brought to our attention was that the Matrix was a huge inspiration for the entire game,

166
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,390
so maybe we should start there.

167
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,852
And we all remember sitting in the theater watching Morpheus fly through the air, or jump through the air,

168
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,993
and Neo do the same thing, and it was all really cool.

169
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,374
So we thought this might be a great starting point.

170
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,895
But what we quickly found out is that none of us

171
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,096
had actually really watched The Matrix in several years.

172
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,478
As you can see here, Morpheus pretty much holds a single pose

173
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,619
and is pulled through wires through the air.

174
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,480
There's a green screen involved, and really, what he's doing doesn't really matter.

175
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,162
The most motion that you see here is from the cloth simulation on his cape.

176
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,203
So this wasn't going to be our silver bullet,

177
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:50,825
so we decided to go back and start looking at some other things.

178
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,866
And we found out that there actually isn't—

179
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:55,086
excuse me.

180
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:59,383
It actually isn't a whole lot of super jumping reference out there.

181
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:04,506
We watched a lot of clips on YouTube and things were mostly flying more than jumping.

182
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:08,548
Footage wasn't long enough, it wasn't clear enough, or there was just strange results.

183
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:14,691
These are actually two results that come up when you YouTube super jumping, and we definitely

184
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:15,491
didn't want to do either.

185
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:20,433
And it wasn't, you know, super jumping is something that we actually couldn't go out

186
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,694
and videotape ourselves doing.

187
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,632
Or could we? Yes, this is actually me laying on the ground while an animator stands on a chair

188
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:33,635
and tries to videotape me jumping. Now this proved one thing, and that I was pretty foolish.

189
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:38,057
But we did try and learn something from everything that had failed. And one thing

190
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,780
that we learned here was that, you know, my center of mass or my root never really moves.

191
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:48,424
So this kind of could embody the fact that this is just being composited onto the screen. So

192
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:51,285
it's something we wanted to keep in mind that maybe we need to play around with moving that on.

193
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:56,656
So we went back to the drawing board, and what we wanted to do at this point was, we're

194
00:09:56,676 --> 00:10:01,157
kind of sitting at a fork in the road where we needed to look at the technical investigation

195
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,437
because the programmers wanted to know how we were going to break all this stuff down.

196
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,478
And we still had to figure out the art investigation, which is what I'm talking about right now.

197
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:13,919
So we wanted to approach this from a different angle and kind of focus on that tech investigation

198
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,180
because we knew that the art would eventually come once we understood what we had to figure

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,300
out.

200
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,047
So we switched mediums. We wanted to look at video games that had done jumping systems in the past

201
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,211
and kind of approach it from a different angle.

202
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:31,320
So the three games that we settled on looking at were Crackdown, Infamous, and Prototype.

203
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:39,259
So we started with Crackdown, and the things that we noticed immediately with Crackdown

204
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:44,764
was that it was simple and clean. It was basically three animations, almost similar to the hack

205
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:48,548
system that we had given earlier. They had a takeoff, they had a state in the air that

206
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:52,492
no matter how fast, or how long you're falling, his arms might flail a little faster and then

207
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,876
it eventually loops back to going slow. And then they had various lands.

208
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,869
But the things that we didn't want to take away from this was that we felt the motions

209
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,069
never evolved over time.

210
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:03,930
You were always seeing the same thing over and over.

211
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,751
And going back to me laying on the ground like a fool, this character's root stays in

212
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:10,472
the dead center of the screen the entire time.

213
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,452
But there's a big caveat with this.

214
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:18,555
Crackdown's a great game and I love it dearly, but Crackdown came out in 2007 and we were

215
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,375
coming out almost seven years after that.

216
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,496
So gamers were going to expect more than this.

217
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,556
They wanted bigger and better.

218
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,977
And while this worked for them, it wasn't going to work for us.

219
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:31,669
We wanted to take our findings and build a prototype of this in our Saints Row engine.

220
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,451
And this is a super quick and dirty prototype, by the way.

221
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,213
And it actually confirmed everything that we felt.

222
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:39,655
It was slow and basic. It wasn't going to be competitive.

223
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,877
The motions weren't evolving enough over time.

224
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:44,079
And this was not going to be fun for hours upon hours.

225
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,947
So a little bit later in the video,

226
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:49,388
you can see that we started to play around with FOV

227
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,748
and a sense of gravity.

228
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,509
And that was something that we also learned in here,

229
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,070
that, again, moving the character around the screen

230
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,231
allows you to feel like they're actually

231
00:11:57,271 --> 00:12:00,092
part of that environment instead of superimposed on top of it.

232
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,594
So from there, we went to look at Infamous.

233
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,575
And we quickly learned that Infamous does not

234
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,675
have a super jumping system.

235
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,433
But what they had was really good.

236
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,395
And we wanted to keep watching it and learn from this.

237
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:19,618
We love the fact that no matter where the jump was done,

238
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,681
whether it was over a car, off of a post, from the top of a

239
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,802
building, it was the same jump.

240
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:24,423
It was simple.

241
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,025
There were no weird middle heights in there that didn't

242
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:27,525
blend well.

243
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:29,527
And this is something that we wanted to jot down and take

244
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,188
into our system.

245
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,431
And from there we looked at prototype.

246
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,792
And it's immediately noticeable that in prototype,

247
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,072
everything is very primal.

248
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,073
It fits the character and the supernatural backstory that

249
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,033
goes with prototype.

250
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,133
We love the sense of speed that you had on

251
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:47,914
ascent and deceleration.

252
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,215
And then we also pointed out that this is very superhero,

253
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:53,555
something that I touched on earlier.

254
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:54,675
And we couldn't do this.

255
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,996
It embodied their character, but our character was kind of

256
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:58,636
whoever you wanted it to be.

257
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,774
But we took these findings and we built another prototype.

258
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,376
And we wanted to test out that superhero premise

259
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,377
to see just how superhero we could be.

260
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,418
And it quickly proved not very much.

261
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:12,180
Our character's moving around very similar to Spider-Man

262
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,460
in here.

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,622
So it proved that point pretty quickly.

264
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:17,703
One thing that this also shows is

265
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,404
that we understood the technical side of how

266
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,585
to break down the animations.

267
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,046
While the visuals aren't what we wanted,

268
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,167
the text side of how the animations were broken up

269
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,609
is pretty much exactly what we ended up shipping with.

270
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,514
So after these tests, we decided that we should try and incorporate everything that we had

271
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:39,241
learned and go into the concept of, slide not working, creation of pillars.

272
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:43,785
Now pillars is something that, whoops, too soon, creation of pillars is something that

273
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,269
is normally done at a project level and we really wanted to bring that down to a feature

274
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:47,489
level.

275
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,382
So we created four pillars.

276
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,804
Motions must be grounded in reality.

277
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,145
We started to realize that the reason we couldn't find good

278
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,346
reference footage was because we were looking for something

279
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,528
that wasn't grounded in reality, but our game was.

280
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,310
So looking for super jumping was always going to result in

281
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,211
superhero stuff.

282
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,213
Our motions had to evolve over time.

283
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:09,954
If people were going to be doing this for hours upon

284
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,835
hours, we wanted to kind of mask the fact that you were

285
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,096
seeing the same thing over and over.

286
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:15,878
The motions must look good and feel good at

287
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:16,758
all heights and speeds.

288
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:20,256
And the motions must fit the overall theme and animation direction.

289
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,118
Now that last one's kind of beating a dead horse of this entire presentation.

290
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,881
So we took what we learned and we wanted to go back and look at stuff that was grounded in reality.

291
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,283
And I'm going to fast forward a little bit and just jump to where we actually ended up.

292
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,285
And that was with Olympic long jumping.

293
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:40,639
We found out immediately after looking at a lot of Olympic long jumping reference that

294
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:44,060
it fulfilled pillars one, the motions were grounded in reality.

295
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,080
Pillar two, the motions changed drastically over time.

296
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,881
His body's probably going through three or four motion changes as he reaches his apex

297
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:52,762
and then comes back down.

298
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:55,682
And pillar four, this could fit our art direction.

299
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,563
It was grounded in reality, but we could push it to become a little bit more heroic and

300
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:01,283
we could show a little bit of his confidence in there.

301
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,154
So from here, we were failing pillar three, which was that it didn't look good at all heights.

302
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:12,818
Because what we took was our art direction that we merged with our tech investigation,

303
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,841
and we built a fully charged jump.

304
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,683
Now, in Saints Row 4, if you've played it, you know that you can hold down the button,

305
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,525
and as long as you hold it, that determines how high you go.

306
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,588
So we decided to start with building the highest jump that you could possibly do.

307
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,212
These are some snapshots here, kind of squashed to fit on the screen.

308
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:36,035
But this failed pillar 3, because when you tap the button and you only jumped like, you

309
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:39,577
know, two meters off the ground or whatever, it looked like he was exerting himself way

310
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,017
too much.

311
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,076
So we didn't want to brute force this, but because we were also running out of time and the project needed to move forward,

312
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,979
we actually did exactly that. We brute forced it.

313
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,984
So we built the exact same motion path, just at a lower height,

314
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:58,989
and changed up some of the posing so it didn't feel like you were exerting too much energy.

315
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:03,033
So it was nothing amazing, and it was just part of game development.

316
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:07,147
And then we took these two various height jumps that we had built

317
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,630
and we kind of merged them together in our animation network.

318
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,894
And depending on the heights in between, the minimum and the max,

319
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,276
we would merge those two together.

320
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,183
And this is kind of what the simple version of the superjumping system looks like.

321
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:24,025
The motions are grounded in reality.

322
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:30,224
They're evolving over time, and they look and feel good at all heights and speeds.

323
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,806
The motions also fit the overall theme and animation direction.

324
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:38,208
You can kind of squint your eyes, picture any customizable character in there, feeling

325
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:41,349
satisfied by the amount of freedom that we've given you here.

326
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,158
So I want to touch on a brief bit of the tech side, just to

327
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,360
show why we started what we knew and how

328
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,161
we kept it simple.

329
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,743
Now what I just showed you was a very basic form of the

330
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:52,464
jumping system.

331
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,667
So this is kind of a sample of our motion graph.

332
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:59,205
So we had a jump state down at the bottom left there.

333
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,467
And this was control by controller input.

334
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:04,850
Based on your input, this determined whether you were

335
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,412
trying to do a standing jump, a moving jump, moving high

336
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:08,393
jump, double jump.

337
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,176
And then from there, once we understood that, we'd fire off

338
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,237
a takeoff animation.

339
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,759
And there were a few different takeoff animations, but they

340
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,460
were basically just canned transitions.

341
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:20,283
And then depending on the amount of charge or the

342
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:21,864
velocity that you had when you were moving.

343
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,480
We would go into a falling or jumping state, as we called it.

344
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,101
This was all velocity driven.

345
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:31,766
It was multiple transition animations that were dependent on your velocity or the jump

346
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:32,567
that was executed.

347
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:37,592
And we would ramp into different parts of this or even scale the timing within there

348
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:38,993
based on those inputs.

349
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:44,399
And then similar to the Saints Row 3 system that we started with, based on your velocity,

350
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,141
we played a different land animation.

351
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:50,555
So in a nutshell, this was the super most basic version of

352
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:51,576
super jumping that we had.

353
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,996
And it was good that we started with the simple

354
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,437
version, because as we all know, something that starts

355
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,477
off simple always ends up most complicated

356
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,758
system known to man.

357
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,199
Because quickly, after this amount of freedom was put into

358
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,879
the game, designer A comes into the room and he says, you

359
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,980
know, it's great that I can jump around through the city,

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,181
but I can't quite land where I want to land, so it would be

361
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,621
great if I could dash through the air.

362
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:16,850
So then dash was added.

363
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,392
And then designer A comes back the next day.

364
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:23,076
He's like, you've given me dash, but now I kind of

365
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:23,857
need something else.

366
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,800
And I know scope-wise we said we weren't going to do flying.

367
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,361
So I'm not going to ask you for flying.

368
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:31,385
But if I could kind of throw my arms out in the air

369
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,166
and glide for a little bit, that would be great.

370
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:34,408
So then we give him gliding.

371
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,632
And then combat designer comes in the room and he's like, you know, all our combat takes place on the ground,

372
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:45,878
but you're jumping all over the place and I can't, you know, throw an ice blast at anyone or use telekinesis.

373
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,801
So, you think we could do that in the air? So, of course, that gets added.

374
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:55,807
And then your designer A comes back and he's like, I'm dashing and I'm gliding and I'm jumping.

375
00:18:56,467 --> 00:19:00,531
I keep hitting walls and I can't jump on the walls. So, you think we could add wall jumping?

376
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:01,772
So, wall jumping gets added.

377
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:08,001
And then he comes back the next day, and this one's going to make every animator in the room throw up, and he says,

378
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:15,047
you know, our takeoff animations have about four frames of anticipation, and I know that's been a battle.

379
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:20,451
What I really want to do is hold the charge button down while I'm in the air

380
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:26,916
so when I land on the ground, if I let go of it, I have no anticipation and I rocket back up into the air.

381
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:30,720
So maybe we could do something with zero frames of anticipation.

382
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,101
So we ended up going with that.

383
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:37,521
And a lot of double jumping. And then Combat Designer comes back and he says,

384
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:41,505
all this is great, but I really want to be able to hold a button down,

385
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,208
pause everything that's happening in this network,

386
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:48,833
hold my fist in the air, be able to aim 360 degrees,

387
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,376
and then fire myself off like a rocket. So, death from above was added.

388
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,062
So as you can see, something that started out so simple

389
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:59,264
became the most complex network outside of our player locomotion

390
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,585
that existed in the project.

391
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,626
And this would have been a terrible thing

392
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,528
to try and noodle between if we had blown it out

393
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,228
from the get-go.

394
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,191
Each line here is a transition between multiple state nodes

395
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:14,974
that contain blend trees, other complex state

396
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:15,834
machines inside them.

397
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,177
And the parameters, such as velocity, character heading,

398
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,438
desired direction, are all controlling

399
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:22,679
the shift between these states.

400
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:25,568
This is kind of what it all looks like when it comes together.

401
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,653
That network also didn't include wall running, which is seen here, which was handled in a

402
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:37,716
different method and came online about two months before we shipped.

403
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:41,573
But I single-handedly believe that if we didn't add wall running,

404
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,394
all the comments such as,

405
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:44,994
you know, the most

406
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:48,876
enjoyable part of Saints Row IV is just moving through the world, those probably

407
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:49,556
wouldn't have been said.

408
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:53,478
So it was something that the animation team actually proposed to the designers

409
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:56,959
and they really didn't want to do it, but we did it anyway, and then they were

410
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,059
very thankful that we did it.

411
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,980
So in summary,

412
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,081
the challenges that we faced

413
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:04,822
were blending superpowers

414
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,883
but previously established animation direction that was conflicting.

415
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,728
Finding reference footage for motions that were not humanly possible.

416
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:14,369
Inexperienced with this type of system.

417
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,911
And some of the solutions were to start with what we knew, develop a set of pillars for

418
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:24,392
the feature, explore reference from all mediums and different approaches to how we use that

419
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:24,813
reference.

420
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:30,414
And then the biggest takeaway, again, is that failure when learned from can be an invaluable

421
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,975
resource for understanding and executing your final product.

422
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:39,626
I want to give a big shout out to the entire Abolition team and Deep Silver, Koch Media.

423
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,528
Without Saints Row I wouldn't be here today, and I want to thank everyone again for coming

424
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:43,768
out.

425
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:46,109
That's all I got.

426
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,771
There's about four minutes for questions if we have any.

427
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:16,058
Hi, did you guys do any explorations with physically based or procedural animation?

428
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:17,600
No, we didn't.

429
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,264
Like I was saying, we were kind of in a big time crunch trying to get Saints Row 4.

430
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:27,128
It originally started off as like an expansion product and then THQ wanted us to turn it

431
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,009
into a full product.

432
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:32,761
Scrapped a whole lot of what we had and we're rebuilding it in a very short amount of time.

433
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,183
Superpowers are something that everyone wanted to keep.

434
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:40,208
So there was really no time and we actually didn't have the tech up and running to do something like that.

435
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:51,880
Can you talk briefly about the way you blended between animations and engine?

436
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:59,122
Yes, so we have a proprietary tool set for building our state machines and stuff like

437
00:22:59,142 --> 00:22:59,322
that.

438
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,723
It's something that we built internally.

439
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:03,805
I kind of touched on it briefly.

440
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:10,010
Design's big request that they wanted was that controller input determine how high that

441
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:10,391
you went.

442
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,413
And we tried it a few different ways to where it was like...

443
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,019
I

444
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:15,819
wasn't anything magical.

445
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,940
It was really just like a linear blend between the two.

446
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:47,799
Anybody else?

447
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:51,562
No?

448
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:58,027
All right, well, my time is about up, so if anybody wants to ask any more questions

449
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,649
that they didn't think of right now, my Twitter's on there.

450
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,732
Love to talk about it, and thanks again for everybody coming out.

451
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:04,413
Appreciate it.

452
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,254
And have a good GDC.

453
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:08,616
Big thanks to all the CAs and GDC again.

454
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:09,036
Thank you.
