00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,594
Hello and welcome to my talk, Google Maps Not Gray Boxes,

2
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:11,116
Digital Location Scouting for Untitled Goose Game.

3
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,098
Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge

4
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:16,541
the traditional owners of the land that I'm recording on,

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,202
the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation.

6
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:20,764
And I'd like to pay my respects to their elders, past

7
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,166
and present.

8
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,868
Sovereignty was never ceded, and this always was and always

9
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:25,969
will be Aboriginal land.

10
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,572
My name's Jake Strasser, and I'm a member of House House.

11
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:33,195
We're a small video game company from Melbourne, Australia.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,392
In September of 2019, we released an untitled game about a goose,

13
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:41,476
which I couldn't have done without the help and hard work of these people.

14
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,858
M. Halberstadt did the sound design.

15
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:47,402
Kalonica helped us refine the game's look very early on,

16
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:48,863
then came back to fill the village with plants.

17
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,165
Dan Golding made the music,

18
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,670
and Cherie Davidson implemented a bunch of accessibility features.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,471
The game was published by Panic,

20
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,673
with production help from Felix Kramer and Nick Suttner.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,982
We were funded in part by Film Victoria and 22nd Century Toys

22
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,864
helped port the game to consoles.

23
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:10,087
They're all wonderful people to work with and I wouldn't be here

24
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,649
giving this talk without their help.

25
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,510
House House is myself,

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,751
Nico DÃ¼sseldorf,

27
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:16,712
Stuart Gillespie-Cook

28
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:17,993
and Michael McMaster.

29
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:21,375
Before we started making our first game, Push Me Pull You,

30
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,696
seven years ago,

31
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,138
none of us had any experience making video games.

32
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:27,780
I was fresh out of film school.

33
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:32,750
Michael and Stuart studied fine art, and Nico spent the previous year teaching himself to

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,414
program by making psychedelic math toys.

35
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:40,877
We're all self-taught, multidisciplinary game developers.

36
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:45,801
We work by consensus, and make design decisions together by talking and arguing until we find

37
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,902
that consensus.

38
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:51,754
It's a slow, messy, inefficient way to work, but it's very fulfilling,

39
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:56,336
both because it's lots of fun to have lots of conversations with your friends all the time,

40
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:59,959
and because it produces work that we can be collectively proud of,

41
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,301
because we all agreed on it every step of the way.

42
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:05,642
My level design practice in The Goose Game

43
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:09,224
emerged from this collaborative, reactive, iterative setting.

44
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:13,427
In September of 2017, this is what The Goose Game looked like.

45
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,847
We've been working on it part-time for a year or so,

46
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,610
working in that collaborative, reactive, iterative way

47
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,192
to build it from the bottom up,

48
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,253
starting with the goose

49
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,775
and just kind of snowballing out from there.

50
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,798
So we made the goose, we made a person,

51
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,761
we made some stuff that that person cared about

52
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:34,205
and explored the kinds of systems and environments

53
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,267
that made it fun to steal that stuff

54
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,588
and build things up step-by-step.

55
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:43,716
From a level design standpoint, I'd been working in a pretty instinctive way up to that point,

56
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:47,959
drawing on the BBC kid shows that we grew up on, and basing a lot of the garden on my

57
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,101
grandparents' backyard, where I spent a lot of time helping out as a kid.

58
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:54,644
My priority up to that point had just been to kind of jam as many different playful dynamics

59
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:55,944
into the level as I could.

60
00:02:55,944 --> 00:03:01,488
Goose was the first 3D game any of us had made, so I was learning how to use Blender

61
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:05,871
and Unity at the time, and was exploring what I could do with the tools that I had.

62
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,571
For example, each garden bed does something different,

63
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,132
so it ended up feeling a bit like a playground.

64
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,552
There's the high planters you can hide behind,

65
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,333
the potato plant you can hide inside of,

66
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,553
the pile of dirt lets you get up high,

67
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,593
and a bunch of different plants and vegetables

68
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:23,094
that you can interact with in different ways.

69
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,234
We were just exploring all the different things

70
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,115
we could do with this game,

71
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:30,835
so questions about stuff like setting and context

72
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,875
were kind of secondary at this point.

73
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,276
That was about to change, though.

74
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,973
In October of 2017, we released the first public video of the game,

75
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:43,295
showing off this level, and people got very excited about it.

76
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:52,480
Up until that point, we thought we were working on a bit of an in-joke with very niche appeal.

77
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,524
We were honestly preparing to package it up, package up this one level and put it on itch.io for free,

78
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:01,025
before moving on to some other more serious project.

79
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,947
But the response made us realise that maybe we were onto something.

80
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:10,288
And so soon after that we got funding from our state government,

81
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,049
thank you Film Victoria,

82
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,710
and cable from Panic sent us an email.

83
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,971
And before we knew it we had a publisher, a budget,

84
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,192
and the opportunity to work full-time on The Goose Game.

85
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,434
And so now we had to start thinking seriously about the game

86
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,934
as a larger Finnish thing.

87
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:24,416
I had this vague pastoral British setting

88
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,557
that had come together in a kind of automatic way.

89
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,538
But it seemed apparent that working off of TV shows

90
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:31,039
and memories of Australian suburbia

91
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,380
wasn't really going to cut it for the kind of game world

92
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,201
that we wanted to end up with.

93
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,471
Don't get me wrong, shows like Brum, Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Wallace and Gromit

94
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:42,791
were incredibly valuable starting points.

95
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,532
They influenced all sorts of things like characters,

96
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:46,692
settings,

97
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:49,792
the materiality of stuff,

98
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:50,693
even the comedy.

99
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:55,393
The Goose Game is a response to these shows in a lot of ways,

100
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,294
but they were just a starting point.

101
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:59,474
And if we're going to make a game set in the UK,

102
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,795
I want it to be very careful about the way that I represented it.

103
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,262
I felt a real responsibility to ground our chosen setting in the real world

104
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:10,763
and do it with a sense of specificity, authenticity and nuance.

105
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:15,045
But there was one kinder major problem standing between me

106
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:21,106
and the authentically captured British village video game level of my dreams.

107
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,447
I don't live in the UK.

108
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,688
I've never lived in the UK.

109
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,028
And I've never even been to the UK.

110
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:35,476
So I had to find some other way to try and absorb, process, and then authentically represent

111
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:41,938
the, I don't know what, Britishness, the geographical, spatial, material, historical

112
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:45,060
ticks of a place I'd never experienced firsthand.

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,801
We showed the other level to some friends from the UK and asked for feedback on whether

114
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,742
it felt authentic or not.

115
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:55,423
And one of the things they flagged was this chain link fence.

116
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:01,130
Now I know that chain link fence is a thing that exists in the UK, I've seen photos of

117
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,895
it, there are UK businesses with .co.uk web addresses that sell it, and I'm sure there

118
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:11,239
must be a garden like this somewhere in the UK that has a chain link fence just like this

119
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:11,299
one.

120
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,562
But our friend said it was just wrong.

121
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,162
It felt wrong.

122
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,845
You wouldn't see a fence like that in a garden like that.

123
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,468
This was the kind of thing I felt I had to be very careful of.

124
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:25,007
And if I could get something as seemingly obvious as a chain-link fence wrong,

125
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:29,751
I wondered how I was going to go authentically capturing stuff that's even harder to put your finger on.

126
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:36,037
What are the accumulative set of details and nuance that make a village feel British?

127
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:39,120
I didn't really know, and I certainly couldn't put it into words now,

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,963
but I wanted to get as close as I could to capturing whatever it was in our game.

129
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,741
So back in late 2017, we were piecing together an outline

130
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,482
of what a finished version of the Goose game might look like.

131
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:54,442
On top of the garden level we'd already made,

132
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,863
we envisioned three more self-contained levels.

133
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,784
A shops level with a very protective shopkeep

134
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:00,804
and a wimpy kid.

135
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:03,525
A set of backyards with two neighbors

136
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:04,586
you could play off each other.

137
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:07,206
A level in a pub that felt a bit like a fortress

138
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,767
that you had to infiltrate.

139
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:12,108
And some kind of finale to give the game a resolution,

140
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,148
although we weren't quite sure what that would be yet.

141
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:20,605
We also knew that we wanted to have all these areas fit together in contiguous space.

142
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:24,607
Even though the challenges in each area would initially be self-contained,

143
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:28,949
we wanted to eventually allow free travel between them as the player progressed,

144
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,930
through what we like to call Dark Souls doors.

145
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,492
A gate, locked from one side, that when opened allows travel between two areas

146
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:42,114
that had at first seemed geographically isolated from one another.

147
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,275
Thank you.

148
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,015
So I had this nested task ahead of me.

149
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:49,496
designing these levels that had their own discrete gameplay dynamics, logic and setting,

150
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:54,040
while knowing I eventually had to situate all these things in a hole.

151
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,604
And I wanted it all to feel authentically British, whatever that meant.

152
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:03,970
So when it came to actually start building the levels, in order to imbue them with some

153
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,875
kind of spatial authenticity from the very start, instead of beginning my levels with a grey box

154
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,276
layout,

155
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:13,757
I did what felt natural as a filmmaker and went location scouting

156
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:17,119
for real-world locations that fit the need of our design goals.

157
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:22,143
When you're making a film and need a location, unless you have heaps of money

158
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,824
to design and build a set, you go out location scouting and find a

159
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,946
place in the real world that fits the requirements of the script.

160
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:31,909
And since I couldn't just pop over to the UK to go location scouting, I did the

161
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,011
next best thing and jumped onto Google Maps and Streetview

162
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,131
and started looking around.

163
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:42,755
I started out just by first trawling around different villages from all around the UK,

164
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,136
looking at how things fit together.

165
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:49,759
How waterways, parks, churches, shops and houses interacted with one another.

166
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,782
How different landscapes, available building materials or economic histories helped shape

167
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:55,882
them.

168
00:08:55,882 --> 00:09:00,705
I was particularly interested in looking at how the stuff I already had, a body of water,

169
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:06,128
a green and a semi-public garden, probably owned by a church or council, fit into real

170
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,608
villages.

171
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:12,416
I took a pretty scattershot approach to my research and just kind of drifted around the

172
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:17,160
internet, slowly building a list of villages that I could imagine the Goose Game being

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,260
set.

174
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,624
I was hoping to build up a kind of spatial literacy for villages and also find specific

175
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:25,866
locations to act as a source for my levels.

176
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,669
And I did this because I didn't really trust myself to design with grey boxes.

177
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:33,256
I thought if I was working in that totally abstracted way,

178
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,477
where the spatial application of game design

179
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,019
overrides everything else,

180
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,641
it would be even harder to tell if I was doing things wrong.

181
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:43,544
Like designing the spatial equivalent of a chain link fence.

182
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:44,444
I thought if I chose a source location

183
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,425
I could return to whenever I needed

184
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,747
that matched the level I wanted to design

185
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:51,450
as closely as possible,

186
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,172
I'd have this external thing

187
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,913
that I could check my work against,

188
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:57,894
and that it might keep me more honest

189
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,115
as I built out the level.

190
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:08,973
As I see it, my level design practice on the Goose game was all about maintaining that

191
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,595
dialogue between a source location and the level as it developed.

192
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:16,619
It's about maintaining a constant back and forth between the disciplines of research,

193
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:21,462
game design and environment art, allowing the affordances and requirements of the source

194
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:26,565
locations, gameplay and aesthetic restrictions to feed back and inform one another in all

195
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,107
directions as the level comes together.

196
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:34,407
Let me illustrate this with the story of how we're designing and building the shops level.

197
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,167
Broadly, from a research perspective,

198
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,949
I knew I wanted some shops in a village setting

199
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:44,851
that meant location scouting for a small, privately run general store in a more commercial part of the village.

200
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,472
Our art style was starting to feel broadly pretty established,

201
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:54,014
but moving from a more green, pastoral setting into something more urban presented new challenges.

202
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,768
We still weren't really sure what buildings should look like in our game,

203
00:10:57,768 --> 00:11:01,691
or whether a big expanse of grey concrete would look any good.

204
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:05,274
And a restriction in our game is that everything has to happen outside,

205
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:08,096
or at least be visible from outside,

206
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,717
so all the sharp stuff needed to be out on the street.

207
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:13,259
We're also interested in having the level be this kind of interplay

208
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,402
between a very dense, restricted area where all the stuff is,

209
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,663
and then quite open, empty space around it.

210
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:22,226
So as you play through the level, the dynamic would be sort of this...

211
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:25,267
I don't know, ducking in and out of this danger zone of the shop.

212
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:30,810
I started out by letting our design goals for the game,

213
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,851
for game design, direct my research

214
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,792
and went location scouting for commercial areas

215
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,434
that had a Goose Game Levels worth of space around them.

216
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:42,836
Finching Field in Essex was an early favourite in my village shortlist.

217
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:47,298
I'd come across it through image searching Village Green with Pond

218
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:48,579
and it was beautiful,

219
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,300
but it didn't have any shops that I could see working as a Goose Game Level.

220
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:59,471
These ones sit on quite a busy road and didn't have any room out the front for stuff to go

221
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:03,454
and for the goose to run around without feeling like you might get hit by a car.

222
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:08,818
So on a whim I went looking around some neighbouring villages and found, just a few miles away,

223
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:10,519
Thackstead.

224
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,662
It was historically more of a commercial hub in the region and has this lovely wide old

225
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,865
market square in the middle of town with a medieval guildhall overlooking it all.

226
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:24,590
Importantly, and unlike a lot of villages I've looked at, it had this very deep footpath laid

227
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,072
down when they ran a modern street through the old square. That created this very deep,

228
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:35,173
open space between the road and shopfronts and allowed traders to put stuff out on the footpath.

229
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:39,554
I thought this location might serve my purposes for the level,

230
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:42,655
so I put together this sketch based on the shops in Backstead.

231
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:48,160
I realised pretty quickly early on that I needed to put this curve into the line of

232
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,722
buildings to try and keep the play area focused around the central shops.

233
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:58,344
And as I kept working on the level, I drew in a bunch of dressing from Thackstead.

234
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:04,667
In Street View, in the same spot, I could cycle between different capture dates and

235
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:11,610
find heaps of different ideas for props and dressing and level geometry.

236
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,691
So here's 2009, and 2014, and 2015, and 2016.

237
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:21,961
There's such a wealth of information in just this one spot, and a lot of stuff from Thackstead

238
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,764
wound up in the finished game.

239
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:29,167
From 2009 I got this fruit and veg stand, and these shelves.

240
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:34,612
From 2014 these hand trucks and plants, and from 2016 these tubs and toilet paper stacks.

241
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:39,456
And just next to those shops, this little scene offered the post box, pump, rubbish

242
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,357
bin and bench.

243
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:47,287
As I worked on the level, when I needed some kind of level geometry or dressing, I'd go

244
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:51,690
back to the location and look for features that would suit my purpose, and could do it

245
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,072
with confidence knowing that they were all coming from the same place, so they'd all

246
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:55,172
fit.

247
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:58,574
After about a month working on the shops, this is what they looked like.

248
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:04,197
We'd set ourselves a time limit of a month to do a first pass on each new level, and

249
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:09,420
so with the shops looking like this, we moved on to the backyards, and after another month

250
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,941
on them, the pub.

251
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:17,403
We were trying to quickly feel out the full scope of the game and get a clear picture

252
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:20,125
on the amount of work it would take to actually finish it.

253
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,630
And so once we had roughly playable versions of each level, I laid them out as an interconnected

254
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,295
village for the first time, to start to get a feel for the game as one big level, and

255
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:35,579
just start processing in the back of my mind what the village on the whole might look and

256
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:36,200
feel like.

257
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:41,831
And now that I was thinking more holistically, when we looped back to the shops for a second

258
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:46,075
pass, it started to become clear that maybe Thackstead wasn't the right location for

259
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,276
the shops or for the village overall.

260
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:53,901
The deep footpath, which had seemed like such a great discovery early on, combined with

261
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,704
the density of the buildings, suggested a much larger urban town that I wanted to portray.

262
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:03,348
Plus, Thackstead's pastel-painted houses looked weird and kind of immaterial in our

263
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:03,848
art style.

264
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:09,503
The footpath also failed to fulfill some of our game design requirements.

265
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:13,904
The level needed to be enclosed by walls of some kind at the peripheries, which the location

266
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,264
at Thackstead just didn't support.

267
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:19,806
I tried curving the line of the buildings to focus play in the middle, but the play

268
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:23,827
area felt too long and skinny, and it wasn't clear where the edges of the level were.

269
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:28,688
So I went looking for other locations that could offer a solution to my level layout

270
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:32,530
problem, and offer a more holistic direction for the village.

271
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:37,591
I looked at pedestrianised options like this one in Helmsley.

272
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:42,135
And I loved the tiny village feel of Mortahoe and its general store, coming right down to

273
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:42,555
the road.

274
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:48,639
They were both very pretty villages, but neither really solved my layout requirements of depth

275
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,702
and enclosure, which I realised was my main issue with Thaxton.

276
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,565
They both felt very open at the peripheries, and long and skinny, like streets tend to

277
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:56,625
be.

278
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:03,027
So what I was looking for was something that felt like a street, but wasn't really long

279
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:06,148
and skinny, and was enclosed by natural feeling boundaries.

280
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,629
A street that wasn't really a street.

281
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,730
And while I was mulling this over, I was also just working day to day on the dressing of

282
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,510
the shop itself.

283
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,571
In my folder of collected reference photos, I had this one, of the Orford General Store.

284
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,733
At some point I visited the village in Street View, I think to get a better look at that

285
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,934
awning, and eventually realised it presented a solution to my layout problem.

286
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:36,497
So this is Pump Street in Orford, with the general store right in the middle.

287
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:40,758
The space formed by a diagonal road and the right angle of these two buildings gave me

288
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:44,299
enough enclosed space to keep the level contained while still feeling like a street.

289
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:51,365
It feels intimate in a small village way, and I liked that the pump and the space left

290
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:54,506
around it suggests a kind of historical function of the space that has since changed.

291
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:59,708
I started spending more and more time looking around Erlford, researching its history and

292
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,950
getting better acquainted with the village, and it started to feel like it would make

293
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,610
a good source location for the game overall.

294
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,832
It was a medieval port with a 12th century castle at the edge of town.

295
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:14,234
I liked the modest Georgian architecture and the red brick that everything was built from.

296
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,122
It's beautiful in an understated, functional way that feels recognizably British.

297
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:25,124
So I reconfigured the shop's layout based on Pump Street,

298
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:28,006
and it was immediately a big improvement over the Thackstead layout.

299
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,887
As a level designer, I thought the flow through the level felt much better.

300
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:36,269
The opening areas around the shop felt more contained,

301
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:42,411
and they funneled the player more in and out of the shop, which is what we wanted the level to do.

302
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:48,800
As a researcher, the layout felt quite unconventional as a streetscape, which I think helped make

303
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,365
it feel more specific and hopefully more authentic as a result.

304
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:56,551
It stopped feeling like any old footpath with the long string of shops and houses, and started

305
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,295
feeling more like a unique place with its own quirks and history.

306
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:05,241
And as an environment artist, I was happy to be working on a level that didn't feel so long and flat.

307
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:10,727
And being able to draw from a source location that felt more coherent and pleasing when rendered in our art style

308
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:16,513
helped me move out of a sketchy, non-committal art and into resolved final assets much quicker than I expected.

309
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,748
As I was working on the level and looking at Pump Street,

310
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:24,609
I wasn't interested in faithfully recreating the location one-to-one.

311
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,791
My priority was to make a good goose game level that was fun to play.

312
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:32,253
So in the places where the Pump Street location didn't work for whatever reason,

313
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,354
I go looking around the rest of Orford for a solution.

314
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:41,177
For example, these real buildings on the left side wall didn't work for the game.

315
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:45,018
We needed an unbroken edge to the level, and I needed a spot for a phone booth.

316
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,382
And just 50 meters away in real life is this hall, with the phone booth there on the left.

317
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:55,363
And putting it in the level made it feel more like the center of the village, rather than

318
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:55,903
a back street.

319
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:59,484
It's functionally just a big wall, so it felt like a good opportunity to dress it up with

320
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:02,825
an interesting facade that helped contextualize the street.

321
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:08,126
And when I went to fit the two shops into the space, I really liked the long terrace

322
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:11,027
building that was already there, but needed two distinct shopfronts.

323
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:17,619
And just next to that hall, very close by, in Orford, are these two shops,

324
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:20,941
which first went into the level with their original black and white,

325
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:25,183
but I repainted it at some point.

326
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,245
I built this garage into the level early on,

327
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,286
just because it was there in the location,

328
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,367
and I liked that it gave it a bit of visual variation.

329
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,949
It was just kind of a nondescript wall collider, really,

330
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:36,029
and I didn't put much thought into it.

331
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:40,392
But then much later, we were working on what we called the gating puzzles.

332
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,896
They're one last task the goose has to do in each level to open a gate and proceed to the next one.

333
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:49,419
We were trying to work out what the shop skating puzzle could be.

334
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,365
And I was thinking about how, since the shopkeep spends all her time chasing you out of the shops,

335
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:57,368
it'd be nicely ironic if you could get her to chase you into a trap.

336
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:59,851
And the garage was already there, ready to go.

337
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,333
It was the perfect place to trap her.

338
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,481
And it was the first gating puzzle we came up with,

339
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,622
and was by far the easiest to implement,

340
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:08,742
and the least contrived,

341
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,743
because it was already built into the location.

342
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,504
This was probably the clearest example

343
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,805
of a source location directly informing

344
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,146
or even directing our game design.

345
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:23,348
The shop's level ended up being a kind of collage

346
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,868
of these bits of Orphid,

347
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,809
with some of the specific dressing

348
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,970
sprinkled in from Thackstead.

349
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,518
And the most important thing I got from putting the shops level together this way was a sense

350
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:37,919
of direction for the village and an overall sense of direction for the village in the

351
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,359
game.

352
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:43,860
By committing to this one location for the shops level, it felt like things started to

353
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,621
fall into place for all the other levels as we moved back through and refined them.

354
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:53,522
The backyards were originally based on these houses in Thackstead, and the level started

355
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:54,603
looking out like this.

356
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:58,123
And looked like this by the end of our first pass.

357
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:03,458
They were the most tightly designed and contrived spaces by far, and since they were private

358
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,583
spaces I felt I had more artistic license with the specifics, and worked more from reference

359
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,944
than any specific location.

360
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:14,249
But when it came time to situate them in the rest of the village, I drew on Orford's

361
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:18,934
terraced housing, laneways, and a bunch of different fencing from around town, and ended

362
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:19,374
up with this.

363
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:31,106
And the pub was originally based on The Fox in Purton.

364
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,669
And looked like this at the end of our first pass.

365
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,295
This version left a lot to be desired, and I wanted to completely redesign the level,

366
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:43,900
so I spent a lot of time looking around at different beer gardens and pubs all over the

367
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,181
place.

368
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,644
But do you know what was waiting for me in Orford?

369
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,306
The Crowning Castle.

370
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,000
We had a bunch of different design requirements that I needed to work into the space, like

371
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,302
the decking, the staff-only area, and the guided entrance, but the location helped inform

372
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:03,545
the overall logic of the space, and especially the ways that it interfaced with the street

373
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:04,625
and surrounding level.

374
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:09,947
Once I committed to using it as a source location, what had been a real design struggle came

375
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:11,268
together surprisingly easily.

376
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,856
In hindsight, it's kind of outrageous how well it worked.

377
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,677
It gave me a layout and character,

378
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:18,878
and once I'd figured out how to work

379
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,580
our level design requirements into the existing space,

380
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,582
I was able to build out and dress the level

381
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:26,284
incredibly quickly because I had such a clear

382
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:28,425
source material to work from.

383
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:33,710
And there was one last major offering from Orphid.

384
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,911
We were working on the end of the game.

385
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,613
There's a final level where the goose breaks

386
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,635
into the model village, which is a miniaturized version

387
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:41,916
of the village you just played through.

388
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:44,709
So you retrace your steps as a Godzilla,

389
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,670
and when we first sketched it out,

390
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,051
ended up at a miniature church,

391
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,472
which had a golden bell in its miniature belfry.

392
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,053
The goose had to steal it naturally,

393
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,614
so you tear down the tower and make off with the bell.

394
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:58,335
That was all well and good until we decided

395
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,276
that maybe it was just a little bit on the nose

396
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,457
to have the goose destroy your church,

397
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:04,297
even if it was a miniature one,

398
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:06,078
during the climax of the game.

399
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,559
So we needed an alternative fun tower to pull down,

400
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,160
and started to think about castles.

401
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,226
And do you know what's right next to the pub in Orford?

402
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,607
And right next to the pub in the Goose Game?

403
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:21,049
It's the perfect Goose Game castle.

404
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,730
Like the pub, it feels too good to be true

405
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,071
that this one village would offer up all these locations

406
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,432
that fit our needs so well.

407
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:30,793
In this way, the world of the Goose Game

408
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,874
is a collage of real world places.

409
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,735
By maintaining this dialogue

410
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:36,836
between the level and source locations,

411
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,077
I was able to create highly designed levels

412
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:41,118
that supported the goal of our game design.

413
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:46,132
while keeping them rooted in a real-world location that I hope brings a sense of place,

414
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,393
history, and specificity to the work.

415
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:56,035
I'd like to finish off now by talking briefly about why it was important to me to take this

416
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,636
approach and reiterate some of the valuable things that came out of it.

417
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:06,718
So how come? Why does a silly comedy game about a goose need a research-focused approach to level

418
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:09,518
design? My first were social concerns.

419
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:15,068
In the same way that stereotypical representations of people can be dehumanising, I think the

420
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:18,130
same applies to representing the real world places that people live.

421
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,673
It was my hope that the people who played our game and saw themselves or their lives

422
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:26,196
implicitly represented in it would feel comfortable with what they saw.

423
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:32,220
We're also conscious and wary that idealised portrayals of rural village life can be pretty

424
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,163
politically fraught and can dovetail with a conservative narrative about the world.

425
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:41,388
I thought that by being as specific as possible in my representation, it might help a little

426
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:45,072
to ground the game more in reality, rather than some idealised version of it.

427
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:45,873
Secondly, were creative concerns.

428
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:52,220
I think the grounded world of the Goose Game plays an important role in the humour of it.

429
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,146
In the Goose Game, the people in the world act as a foil to the Goose's comedy.

430
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:03,421
We could more easily give the player control over comedic timing and bring them in on the joke

431
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:07,784
because the world they're presented with is grounded in a kind of mundane familiarity.

432
00:25:07,784 --> 00:25:14,228
This extends to the kind of objects and spaces in the game too. Familiar stuff, socks, radio,

433
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:18,771
gardening tools and familiar places have all this inbuilt baggage in players' heads.

434
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:24,270
Like if I hang a pair of socks on a clothesline, I don't have to do any extra work to signal

435
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,991
that it would be naughty if you stole them and threw them in the pond.

436
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,992
I don't have to explain that the socks are this person's favourite, or that she specifically

437
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,752
hates it when a goose throws her stuff in a pond.

438
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,892
Players just get it.

439
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:41,274
So by keeping the world grounded in mundane familiarity, I think it helps players quickly

440
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:45,815
engage with the game in a more confident, playful way, which was especially important

441
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:49,515
with the Goose Game, because we needed players to feel confident enough to try and be funny.

442
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:57,441
I also believe that just like players are able to instinctively intuit whether representations

443
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:03,525
of a face or movement seem right or not, they also process levels and spaces in the same

444
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:03,605
way.

445
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:10,191
The Hotel in the Shining by Stanley Kubrick is infamously full of impossible architecture.

446
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:11,792
Rooms don't probably fit together.

447
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:14,734
It's full of doors and windows that shouldn't exist or lead nowhere.

448
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:19,831
Kubrick wasn't the kind of guy to do anything like this by mistake, so the film nerds think

449
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:23,692
he must have intentionally made the architecture of the hotel itself feel uncanny.

450
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:27,334
Now I don't think an audience consciously knows why things feel a bit off, but I reckon their

451
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:34,697
subconscious recognises something's wrong, and I feel like it's easier for games to unintentionally

452
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:36,598
end up with this spatial uncanniness.

453
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:42,794
When levels get built in a void, in isolation from one another,

454
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:46,937
I think aesthetic continuity can falsely supplant spatial continuity,

455
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:50,980
and the kind of concrete geographical consistency

456
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,783
that makes game worlds feel real on a subconscious level can get lost.

457
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:59,266
And I think that players, whether they could consciously recognize it or not,

458
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,687
pick up on that loss,

459
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:04,390
and game worlds start to feel a bit like the Overlook Hotel, just a bit off.

460
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:12,332
So it was important to me to take great care to ground my levels in a real place,

461
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:18,920
making sure spaces are contiguous and maintaining a geographical logic and consistency to the world.

462
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,185
And I hope that this would let the world of Untitled Goose Game feel richly concrete to players

463
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,949
in the small mundane ways that real world spaces do.

464
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:33,821
The relative positions of spaces and the way they fit together

465
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:36,042
become quietly remarkable and help

466
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:39,045
create valuable moments of discovery and recognition

467
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:40,646
for players as they traverse the space.

468
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:44,809
I think that basing my level designs on real locations

469
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,991
rather than gray boxes helped me keep them grounded

470
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,652
in the real world as they came along.

471
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,013
I found it to be a flexible workflow where

472
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:55,557
I could be more or less faithful to the location depending

473
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,818
on the needs of our game design.

474
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:02,541
I'd use the location to inform the general layout or logic to a space,

475
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:05,343
and then I could then fill it with the required gameplay elements.

476
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:09,527
And then I'd fill in any blanks by going back to the location to look for details

477
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:12,109
or features, confident that they would be

478
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,412
appropriate to the space. This was also quite an economical

479
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:19,235
workflow. Although it took more time up front to get the right location,

480
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:23,019
once I did I could work really quickly since the right location is so rich with

481
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:23,980
valuable information.

482
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:28,326
The pub level went from being rough as guts to near finished in no time,

483
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,487
once I'd settled on that location in Norford.

484
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:37,232
Right through development, I found it really rewarding to just wander around in Street View,

485
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:41,695
letting my subconscious absorb a whole heap of information. I think building up my literacy in

486
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:46,538
this way made me a more confident designer and better able to intuit whether my work was going

487
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:51,721
in the right direction or not. This unfocused aspect, or kind of broad offering that a

488
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:54,563
source location gives you, is really important I think.

489
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:59,447
Although I might have chosen a location for one reason, like the layout of Palm Street in Orford,

490
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:03,272
a location brings with it all sorts of other hyper-specific information,

491
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:05,915
but has the opportunity to surprise you.

492
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:12,101
I put the garage into the shops level because it was in a location that was the perfect feeler for an unused wall,

493
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:15,425
and it ended up offering us a solution to a central game design problem.

494
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,351
I found this approach immensely rewarding.

495
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:22,932
There's an aspect of giving yourself over to a location

496
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:23,732
when you work in this way,

497
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:26,914
and trusting in it to offer up the things you need

498
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:27,874
to put a level together.

499
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:30,515
As a level designer and environment artist,

500
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:34,297
I found that working in dialogue with a location like this

501
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:37,119
meant that I could better focus on what the game needed

502
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,859
and let the location offer up the rest.

503
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm really proud of my work on The Goose Game,

504
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,822
and I hope this talk has offered a bit of insight

505
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:44,702
into how it all came together.

506
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:49,978
and I hope I'll get to visit Orford in person at some point soon.

507
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,379
Thanks for listening. Bye.
