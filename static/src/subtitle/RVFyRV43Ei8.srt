1
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:11,820
I am Chris Remo, I am a game designer and composer on the former Campo Santo team, which

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,266
about a year ago was peacefully absorbed by Valve.

3
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,776
We shipped Firewatch in February 2016

4
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:24,918
and just a couple months ago on Nintendo Switch.

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,279
On that game, I served as a game designer

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,321
and narrative designer, as well as composer

7
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,361
and audio director.

8
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,803
I've worked in a number of different roles

9
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,824
over the years on a various variety of games.

10
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,226
Worked as a writer, game designer, composer,

11
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,928
and producer at different times on games

12
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,489
including Bioshock Infinite, The Cave.

13
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,432
30 Flights of Loving, SpacebaseDF9,

14
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:50,133
and most recently, the Rogue One X-Wing VR mission.

15
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,874
Currently, though, I am working on

16
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,575
In the Valley of Gods at Valve.

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,277
But today, I will mainly be talking about Firewatch.

18
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:03,739
On Firewatch, we set out to tell a compelling human story

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,360
in a believable and beautiful world,

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,902
and to make that story central to the gameplay experience,

21
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,243
really to be the gameplay experience.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,701
We wanted no challenge-based mechanics of any kind,

23
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:17,701
which means no failure state,

24
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,802
but we also wanted a player-centric game

25
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:22,523
where interactivity still mattered.

26
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:25,404
These goals were often difficult to reconcile.

27
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:28,545
Many design decisions led us to the final result

28
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,385
of what we shipped, and I'm going to divide them

29
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:33,386
into three principles that can hopefully help

30
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,867
re-center your own design decisions

31
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,048
around tackling deep interactive narrative.

32
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:41,709
Believability, reactivity.

33
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:43,567
and flexibility.

34
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:48,732
I'm going to discuss high-level considerations involved in organizing your game and team,

35
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:54,737
specific game design practices and decisions, and tools we developed to facilitate those

36
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:55,318
practices.

37
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:59,734
We definitely did not do everything right on Firewatch,

38
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,194
and I'll touch on some of that as well.

39
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,695
But I really believe that these principles

40
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,735
and the practices we arrived at to adhere to them

41
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:10,116
are of tangible use beyond Firewatch in particular,

42
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:12,717
both for developers who are also interested

43
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:15,658
in tackling their own combat-free,

44
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,339
puzzle-free interactive experiences,

45
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,940
as well as for developers working in more traditional genres

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,860
who have an interest in deeply integrated

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
interactive narrative.

48
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,744
In attempting to tell a convincing and detailed story

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,905
about human characters,

50
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,127
believability particularly matters.

51
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,169
Not in the sense of literally representing reality,

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,112
but in the sense of suspending the player's disbelief

53
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,913
so they're receptive to your story.

54
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:45,156
The structure and limitations of your game,

55
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,619
they must believably integrate as much as possible

56
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,541
with your narrative goals, not impede them.

57
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,645
Our own starting point with Firewatch was pretty minimal.

58
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:59,436
It was to be set in rural Wyoming near where our writer,

59
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:00,497
Sean Vanaman, grew up.

60
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,619
The player would be a summer fire lookout.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,681
Something sinister would happen,

62
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,943
and the tone would transition from peaceful

63
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,784
to suspenseful and eerie.

64
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,487
Art director, Ali Moss, created an evocative piece

65
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,389
of key art that guided our visual target.

66
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,752
And finally, we knew interactive dialogue would be key.

67
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:22,014
Campo Santo co-founders, Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman,

68
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,436
had just come off Telltale's The Walking Dead,

69
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,238
which leaned heavily on interactive dialogue.

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,832
Past that basic premise, we had to start making

71
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:34,715
specific decisions about mechanical and structural elements

72
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,998
that have a big impact on how the player engages with

73
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,320
and is immersed into the game story.

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,642
We settled on the following properties.

75
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,224
A constant first-person perspective,

76
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,745
a single interconnected world,

77
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,848
a story told largely in the present tense,

78
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,649
not just uncovered from the past,

79
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,451
and a lack of challenge-based mechanics

80
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:57,053
or failure state of any kind.

81
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:04,157
As an aside, the first two of these, the perspective and world structure, are particular to the needs of Firewatch.

82
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:16,281
I'll explain why we chose them given our situation, but they're not intrinsically necessary, obviously, for other games that are looking to deliver on these other things, a present-tense story without failure state.

83
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:20,866
That lack of a failure state is one of the things most likely

84
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,929
to get a game characterized as not a game.

85
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,631
But something really interesting happens

86
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,414
when you set the constraint of eliminating the player's

87
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,555
ability to fail.

88
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,459
It forces you to find new ways to allow the player

89
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,701
to progress through an active story.

90
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,463
And it gives you opportunities to more deeply immerse

91
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:39,924
the player.

92
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:46,788
into the story itself by reinforcing that everything the player does is part of a single

93
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:51,651
series of events that starts when the player first loads the game and doesn't end until

94
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,854
the entire thing is over, without ever needing to reload and try again.

95
00:04:56,594 --> 00:05:00,156
all of the player action is canonically part of the narrative.

96
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,717
Nothing the player tries is invalid.

97
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:06,998
Instead, as a game designer, there's simply a spectrum of how well you've supported

98
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,279
whatever possibility space you've presented to the player.

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,161
This is a principle I call reactivity, which I'll explore more later.

100
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,212
To consistently suspend disbelief,

101
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,752
it's important to get your creative goals

102
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,354
and your practical necessities aligned as closely as possible.

103
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:27,535
The more those work in concert, the more

104
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,635
your unavoidable limitations will

105
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,296
feel organic and intrinsic to the story you're telling,

106
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:35,477
rather than feeling imposed on it by petty reality.

107
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:42,877
For instance, in our game in particular, the first-person perspective was a reflection of the story's intimacy.

108
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:49,763
You're playing a specific, defined character, Henry, but you're also totally physically alone in this world.

109
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:54,328
The only other character you come in regular contact with, you can't even see.

110
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:59,473
Maintaining that integrity of Henry's perspective reinforces that sense of solitude.

111
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:02,632
And frankly, it was a budgetary advantage as well.

112
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,574
We wanted to hit a high level of visual fidelity,

113
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,876
and having to constantly render a human character up close

114
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,757
at that level of detail would have been pretty tough

115
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,417
with our budget.

116
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:13,759
This ended up playing to a strength,

117
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,680
highlighting Jane Ng and Olly Moss's

118
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,920
beautiful environment art,

119
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,142
which was as much a character in our story

120
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:20,783
as Henry and Delilah are.

121
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,325
It's an overwhelming and all-encompassing presence

122
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,526
around you, which suits a story about a man

123
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,987
who's desperate to lose himself in a new environment,

124
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:29,948
away from his real life.

125
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:36,479
Next, the desire for the story to be told largely in the present tense, not the past

126
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:41,520
tense was important if we wanted to really believably immerse the player inside of the

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,300
story itself.

128
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,421
A lot of heavily story-based games, the sort of category that a lot of people refer to

129
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,262
as walking simulators, tell stories that have largely happened before the player has arrived

130
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:53,843
on the scene.

131
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:57,843
And then through environmental storytelling devices like journals and audio logs.

132
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:00,846
the player pieces together what happened in that story.

133
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,769
There's definitely an element of that in Firewatch,

134
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,994
but it was really critical to us that there be an equally important track of the story

135
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:13,460
that is directly happening to and as a result of Henry's presence in the world.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,684
The idea is that the player is a participant, not an archaeologist.

137
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,707
And I should note that I have absolutely nothing against

138
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:23,169
uncovering stories in walking simulators.

139
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,711
In fact, I've contributed to a couple of them myself,

140
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,674
including Gone Home, totally pro-walking simulator.

141
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,511
different than what we were specifically

142
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,452
attempting to achieve.

143
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:38,475
So having one contiguous world was an effective way

144
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,737
to communicate the big, meandering,

145
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:43,239
and ecologically diverse reality of the wilderness.

146
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,041
By blending nearly all of the game's locations

147
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,202
into one complex and beautiful space,

148
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,564
we could drive home how Henry would feel

149
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,326
in his own little corner

150
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,588
of an ostensibly even huger environment.

151
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:56,929
And the player can, just like Henry,

152
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,732
learn all of the roots and contours of this world

153
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,973
deeply by the end of the game.

154
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:04,730
It might not suit a story of wider ranging scope

155
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,111
told on a grander scale,

156
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,453
but it's a structure that was utterly believable

157
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,034
given our particular story.

158
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,737
Unfortunately, it also presented

159
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,578
some significant narrative challenges.

160
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,421
It's a lot easier to tell a tight story

161
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,723
across a linear series of discrete levels.

162
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:22,545
You have a lot of control over the flow of the story

163
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,647
that you give up when you let the player

164
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,389
traipse all over the place all the time.

165
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,692
So how would we maintain the kind of tension and pacing

166
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:36,222
that's necessary for a paranoia-involving story like ours in this situation.

167
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:41,188
The narrative spine of true open-world games often suffers when the sense of momentum is

168
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:46,313
undercut by the player having so much freedom that the illusion of time and urgency is broken.

169
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:51,249
And in a tightly plotted game, you often have to either

170
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,011
arbitrarily change the world state as needed for your story

171
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,514
or constantly invent plausible reasons why the player

172
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,355
needs to go to such and such location next

173
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,377
or prevent the story from breaking if the player stumbles

174
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:06,859
on a key location or item before they're supposed to.

175
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,861
We found our solution to this problem in two influences.

176
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:15,624
In 2012, Brendan Chung released 30 Flights of Loving,

177
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,625
a video game short story companion.

178
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,335
to his earlier story game Gravity Bone.

179
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:22,536
These games are really great examples

180
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:25,077
of telling surprisingly effective stories

181
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,958
inside extremely short video games.

182
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,199
30 Flights takes about 10 minutes

183
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,961
and tells a story across non-linear fractured vignettes

184
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,001
which are slammed together with sudden cuts.

185
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,879
We love the idea of using hard cuts ourselves.

186
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,461
It's a common technique in film, obviously,

187
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,963
but given how often games are described as cinematic,

188
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,165
it's kind of surprising how many cinematic techniques

189
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:52,148
remain really underexplored in actual real-time gameplay,

190
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:55,671
despite often being used in non-interactive cut scenes.

191
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,831
When we were attempting to solve this pacing problem,

192
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,013
I happened to see the film Dallas Buyers Club,

193
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,256
in which Matthew McConaughey's character is diagnosed with AIDS

194
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:07,197
and told he has only about a month to live.

195
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:11,781
The movie then hard cuts to a title card reading, day one.

196
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,804
And we realize suddenly we're going

197
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:18,387
to be counting the days until the character's likely death,

198
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,689
which really drives home the urgency

199
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,091
and terror of the diagnosis.

200
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,021
So we had hard cuts on the brain already,

201
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:26,683
and then this felt like the missing piece.

202
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,286
We could bridge the gap between a linear story

203
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,588
and an open world by splitting our game up temporarily

204
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:34,091
into days, and then skipping the days

205
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,293
in which nothing narratively interesting is happening,

206
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,597
and placing the cuts at points of closure or tension.

207
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:44,903
We could go from day one, to day two, to day three.

208
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,072
But then, all the way to day nine, and then everything in between the cuts would be in

209
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:49,973
the player's control.

210
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:55,262
It may not be believable in the sense of operating like the real world, which unfortunately has

211
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:57,766
no boredom-diffusing or pacing-enhancing cuts.

212
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,497
But it's entirely believable and intuitive relative to our understanding of how stories work.

213
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:10,280
And it's a reminder that practical game design decisions can be stolen from just about any source, game or otherwise.

214
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,523
If you want to tell a good story in a game, expose yourself to as many types of stories as possible, as often as possible.

215
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:25,797
Unfortunately, there was a big design drawback to the day system, which is that players didn't

216
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,218
know when a cut was coming.

217
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,381
This was intentional, but it also meant some players ended up being softly discouraged

218
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:37,544
from treating the world as a fully explorable space, since the story might theoretically

219
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:42,827
interrupt their exploration at any time, obscuring the explorable side content we built.

220
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,873
Every game design decision in that sense

221
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,674
reflects a set of trade-offs.

222
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,496
You can only negotiate those trade-offs consistently

223
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,137
over the course of development if you

224
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,779
have a clear set of priorities.

225
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,701
In our case, the narrative integrity of the game

226
00:11:57,741 --> 00:12:00,363
was ultimately a priority over certain expressions

227
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,244
of player agency.

228
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,694
I really do think if we made Firewatch again, we would navigate this particular trade-off

229
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:11,937
a bit better, but knowing our priorities did at least keep us honest enough to make some

230
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,700
clear decisions and move forward with functional, if imperfect, solutions.

231
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,842
I also think the contiguous world had a more subtle benefit.

232
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:25,706
In a game without a lot of mechanical complexity, having a map that's accessible at all times

233
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:30,690
and having Henry progressively fill out the map as he encounters locations throughout

234
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,894
the course of the game lets players actively plan and learn routes throughout this world

235
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,637
and feel a sense of tangible gameplay progression.

236
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:44,261
It kind of offers some more traditional gameplay to chew on behind the softer narrative content.

237
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:50,936
And it's arguably one of the last remnants of a much more mechanically dense set of ideas we tossed around early on.

238
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:58,379
We explored incorporating mechanics such as actual fire finding using the fire finding apparatus in Henry's Tower, which we prototyped out.

239
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:06,841
And we had a number of more complex map implementations in mind, including filling out the map by way of triangulation inspired by the game Miasmata.

240
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,987
But ultimately, these didn't fit.

241
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,749
They were distractions that spoke more

242
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,071
to the literal job Henry, the character,

243
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,872
was doing in the fiction, rather than

244
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,774
to the narrative and emotional experience we were

245
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,115
hoping to deliver to the player.

246
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,758
They might have created a more believable depiction

247
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,299
of a fire lookout if that's actually

248
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,441
what we were attempting to create, but it wasn't.

249
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,934
The importance of scoping and cutting was really driven home

250
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,976
working on this game, particularly

251
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:35,758
with limited resources, which is every project,

252
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,559
relatively speaking.

253
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,782
It's important to put your focus on the elements of the game

254
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,784
that are going to speak directly to your priorities.

255
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,866
You only need the mechanics that believably

256
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,347
support the game's goals.

257
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,270
Everything else is extraneous at best

258
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,412
and potentially works against your narrative goals.

259
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:59,204
To that end, if story comprises most of your game experience,

260
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,648
the way the player directly interacts with the story

261
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:03,989
must be believable.

262
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,772
It must help suspend disbelief.

263
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,155
Think deeply about how immersive, intuitive,

264
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:13,438
and interactive your story mechanics themselves are,

265
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,500
not just the content.

266
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,204
By way of comparison, in an action first game,

267
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:21,467
if the player is to engage deeply with your combat

268
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:22,709
or traversal mechanics,

269
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,531
then those mechanics should be fluid, responsive,

270
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:26,733
and dominant in your game.

271
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:28,534
That makes the action believable

272
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:29,816
whether or not it's realistic

273
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,377
because the player is sucked into it.

274
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:33,059
Their disbelief is suspended.

275
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,753
And if your players are going to constantly be engaging

276
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:39,234
with story mechanics for the duration of your game,

277
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,354
remove as much friction as you can

278
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:42,795
from the act of doing so.

279
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,736
We iterated a lot on our dialogue selection mechanics

280
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:48,977
on both PC and console to ensure that they had input models

281
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:51,118
that didn't interfere with world traversal,

282
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,258
which is almost nonstop in our game.

283
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,588
So this decision to discard many non-narrative

284
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,010
mechanical elements ended up putting a really massive

285
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,772
burden on the player-facing systems we did have,

286
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,973
most significantly the interactive dialogue,

287
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,555
which had to support propelling both the narrative

288
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:12,057
as well as providing most of the moment-to-moment

289
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,978
entertainment value.

290
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:15,820
How would we turn just talking about stuff

291
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,021
into consistently compelling gameplay?

292
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:21,803
How do we make the overall game experience itself

293
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:23,485
feel interactive?

294
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:29,789
A lot of mechanical interactivity in character-based games has to do with the player's ability

295
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:34,372
to change the state of the world or other characters and entities in the world.

296
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:39,255
Combat is a rich vein to mine here because doing damage to an enemy is a very intuitive

297
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:43,177
and clear way to change the state of the world and remove obstacles.

298
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:48,501
Plus there's a direct causal and generally predictable relationship between the player's

299
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,042
actions and the outcome.

300
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,615
But on Firewatch and our next game in the Valley of Gods,

301
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:56,438
I think a lot about what I call reactivity,

302
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,461
my term for a softer version of interactivity.

303
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:04,606
By reactivity, I mean the game's constant active observation

304
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,628
of the player's behavior in order

305
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:08,750
to validate and encourage the player's

306
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,713
explicit and implicit decisions.

307
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:17,301
With reactivity, the game world directly reacts to the player,

308
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,004
whether or not the player even was consciously

309
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,426
attempting to influence the state of the world.

310
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,269
Rather than the game world being a static environment

311
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,472
through which the player moves to discover a story,

312
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:31,035
the game is trying to say yes to the player as much as possible.

313
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,570
This is achieved largely by keeping track

314
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,031
of the player's choices, big and small,

315
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,872
in order to pay off those choices

316
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,693
and make the world feel alive.

317
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,775
It's critical in achieving that believable sense

318
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:48,096
of the story happening in the present tense, not the past,

319
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:51,038
because it puts the player in direct conversation

320
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,359
with other characters and the world itself.

321
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,180
To support this, we landed on three important qualities

322
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,361
for our interactive dialogue.

323
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,410
One, dialogue choices are mutually exclusive.

324
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,871
Once you choose an option, the other options

325
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,252
are usually gone forever.

326
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,893
You can't work through all the available content.

327
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:11,714
As you have conversations, you're implicitly

328
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:15,196
walking a path you can't undo, ensuring dialogue is always

329
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:16,537
effectively a choice.

330
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,198
With one or two exceptions, it's impossible

331
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,639
to hear the same voice line more than once in Firewatch.

332
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:24,467
we wanted to imitate as closely as possible

333
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,908
the feeling and flow of human conversation,

334
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:30,150
in which at some fundamental quantum level,

335
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,872
nothing can ever really be unsaid or literally repeated.

336
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:38,415
Next, in most cases, dialogue responses are timed.

337
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,137
You can't sit around forever choosing a response.

338
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,238
Not answering is an answer.

339
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,119
Much like mutual exclusivity,

340
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,461
this approximates real dynamics of conversation

341
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:50,483
and also adds yet another axis of choice.

342
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,130
And finally, every dialogue choice can be tracked.

343
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,752
Conversations aren't discrete information delivery devices,

344
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,613
although that's obviously one function they serve.

345
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,075
Rather, conversations are all small parts

346
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,336
of a larger continuity of conversation

347
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,377
that stretches across the entire game.

348
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:11,458
When dialogue choices can always have consequences,

349
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:14,840
it effectively turns them into player-centric gameplay.

350
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,462
Here you can see how the name of a location on the game map

351
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,263
is drawn directly from an earlier conversation option

352
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:22,103
chosen by the player.

353
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,877
So interactive dialogue was our starting point

354
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
for this principle of reactivity.

355
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,322
At any time, we were able to arbitrarily set

356
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,585
a Boolean or integer value, a fact,

357
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,206
based on any dialogue line.

358
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:38,389
This means every dialogue choice the player makes

359
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,252
offers the opportunity to influence a line later.

360
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,233
Here you can see how the dialogue choices

361
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:45,375
about that steep shale slide Henry encounters

362
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,878
set facts that will be checked by the map

363
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,139
to name that area.

364
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:56,767
This practice became really as much of a philosophical guiding principle as much as a technical capability.

365
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,312
Sid Meier is said to have defined a good game

366
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,973
as a series of interesting decisions.

367
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,875
Some research suggests this might have initially

368
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:10,076
been a misquote, but it seems like Meier himself

369
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:11,897
has adopted the phrase anyway,

370
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,078
and it's been widely spread,

371
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:15,259
and clearly has a lot of value and resonance.

372
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,161
I would like to propose an inverse definition

373
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,462
for a different kind of game,

374
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,863
a type of design centered primarily

375
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:23,804
on intimate narrative interaction.

376
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,766
Rather than a series of interesting choices,

377
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:32,871
a good narratively driven game can be a series of interesting outcomes.

378
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:40,500
In this framework, less emphasis is placed on the making of the decisions themselves,

379
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,703
which entails analysis of risk and reward, cost and benefit, and shifts the emphasis

380
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:51,786
onto the results of those decisions, some of which the player may not even be aware

381
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:52,987
that they're making at all.

382
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:57,070
I think this more closely models human interaction in life.

383
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,750
All of our human interactions are made up of small decisions constantly.

384
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,291
These decisions have consequences, even if often minor ones.

385
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:10,832
Narratives are constructed out of these outcomes and we're generally limited in our ability

386
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:13,893
to intentionally plan and control them ahead of time.

387
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:19,914
Much of our understanding of our own stories is in our interpretation of them in retrospect.

388
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:24,875
Of course, we try and plan our narratives intentionally in real time.

389
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:29,297
And in a narrative game, there should be opportunities for the player to do this when appropriate.

390
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:32,979
A lot of dialogue choices in Firewatch offer clear alternatives.

391
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,423
Times to be honest or dishonest, forthcoming or withholding, cooperative or aggressive.

392
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,866
And these are important if you want the player to have some sense of narrative, some sense of agency inside of your narrative.

393
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,805
On day two of Firewatch, Henry investigates a disabled communications line,

394
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:53,146
which leads him to other clues that start fleshing out the game's plot.

395
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:56,548
This takes the player across wide swaths of the game world,

396
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:59,869
meaning in between key quest points, there's a lot of travel time.

397
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,810
We populated some of this time with a series of substantial conversations

398
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,191
designed to build the relationship between Henry and Delilah.

399
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,173
Because the world of Firewatch is contiguous and interconnected,

400
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:14,874
there are usually several equally plausible ways to get from point A to point B.

401
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,028
So each possible conversation has many possible start points,

402
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:21,970
which are mainly initiated by Delilah, not Henry,

403
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,151
as the player navigates.

404
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:26,453
These conversations allow the player

405
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:28,575
to share details of Henry's past life.

406
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,177
And in turn, Delilah shares elements of hers.

407
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,478
What you choose to share influences

408
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:35,860
what she shares in the current conversation,

409
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,222
the following conversations, and throughout the rest

410
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:38,602
of the game.

411
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,664
For example, here's a game logic event

412
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:44,407
that starts a particular version of a conversation

413
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,950
that applies when Delilah already knows

414
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,493
Henry has a partner, but does not know about his breakup

415
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:52,215
or current relationship status,

416
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:55,298
as an example of how the game is sorting

417
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:56,319
these different conversations

418
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,342
according to the game state the player has created.

419
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:06,179
It's possible to play the game in different ways that result in the characters having very different levels of knowledge about each other's histories,

420
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,842
including Henry keeping almost all of his past life under wraps.

421
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:15,267
And while our intention was that the player experience some version of these conversations,

422
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,211
by design, the game is open enough that you can skip much of it depending on how you play.

423
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,121
So we soon realized that our seemingly linear story

424
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:26,263
was generating an overwhelmingly complex possibility space

425
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:28,744
that we could not maintain in our heads.

426
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,746
So we created a repository we referred to

427
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:35,349
as the Delilah Brain, essentially a list of states

428
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,390
that tracks what Delilah has learned from Henry

429
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,511
and what she has told him.

430
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,593
If someone was working on a scene that needed to retrieve

431
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,974
or set information from earlier in the game,

432
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:46,576
they'd first search through the Delilah Brain

433
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,177
to see if someone else had already

434
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:49,678
explicitly started tracking.

435
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,499
that particular piece of information.

436
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,081
So it allows Delilah to maintain a believable

437
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,542
and continuous awareness of what she and Henry

438
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:58,903
have shared with each other,

439
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,544
including whether she knows about Henry's wife,

440
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:05,327
his dog, his DUI, and what Henry knows about her life.

441
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:08,728
This was really as much a best practices solution

442
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:09,809
as a tools solution.

443
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:11,750
Without that central clearinghouse

444
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,152
and habit of checking for existing information,

445
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:16,213
it was all too easy for two team members

446
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:19,515
to create one fact called Delilah Knows About Julia

447
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:23,348
and one called Henry told Delilah about Julia,

448
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,491
which ostensibly track the same information

449
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,674
but could cause a false negative hours into a playthrough

450
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:32,636
if different conversations are checking different facts

451
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,999
to see if Delilah knows about Julia.

452
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:38,277
In a game with many thousands of lines,

453
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:40,578
any of which could be setting multiple pieces

454
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,678
of complex game state,

455
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:45,019
this can become a spaghetti nightmare of logic and wiring.

456
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,761
We had a lot of mind-numbing gameplay debugging

457
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,081
before we started developing safer ways of working.

458
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,762
So if you're making a game

459
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:53,583
with complex interactive narrative,

460
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:55,924
examine your content creation workflow

461
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,845
and consider the ways in which different team members

462
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,146
might inadvertently create redundant

463
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:02,726
or subtly conflicting data.

464
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:07,670
which can really dampen your enthusiasm for relying on these kinds of complex state combinations.

465
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:16,658
The day two conversations, these laid the foundation, I hope, for a game-long relationship between Henry and Delilah that

466
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:23,183
tried, at least, to respect both the player's own sense of agency and investment in Henry's story,

467
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:28,868
as well as the fact that these are still two defined characters with established histories and personalities.

468
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:35,708
Much of the creative side of developing Firewatch's interactive narrative was that balancing act

469
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:40,053
between honoring player choices and telling a story about these middle-aged people who

470
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:43,556
come to every situation with a lifetime of preconceptions and history.

471
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:48,941
They aren't ciphers who can be entirely molded like some RPG characters might be, for instance.

472
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,294
Throughout the game, we were on the lookout for places

473
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,576
where we could interpret dialogue choices to call back

474
00:24:56,616 --> 00:25:00,039
to even throwaway lines in ways that deepen the relationship

475
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,781
or raise tensions between Henry and Delilah

476
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:05,243
or cast light on the story's central mystery.

477
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,886
But reactivity becomes a more powerful principle

478
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,368
when it's applied across all of the systems of a game.

479
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:16,692
There's an entire additional realm of decision making that is implicit.

480
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,936
The result of something going on at more of a gut level in the player.

481
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:24,281
These are the ways the player naturally interacts with whatever systems they're given.

482
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:28,165
Some of which often aren't even typically thought of as expressive systems.

483
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:33,572
Like simple object interaction and basic camera and character movement.

484
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:38,022
Early in development, we did some visual prototyping

485
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,263
of how players might make these choices.

486
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:43,944
As an example, we used a scene in which Delilah directs Henry

487
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:45,205
to restock his rations.

488
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:47,786
She requests he not take more food than he needs,

489
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,646
because the supplies are to be distributed

490
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:50,627
to several lookouts.

491
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:52,547
It's a clear A-B choice.

492
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,909
Do you take just enough food for yourself, or do you take more?

493
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,670
Our original design reflected this binary

494
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,111
by depicting each option as a defined choice.

495
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,833
But such a system was entirely superfluous.

496
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,716
The game already included the ability to pick up physics objects.

497
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:14,401
So why not let the player express their choice implicitly rather than explicitly

498
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,563
through the set of mechanics already in use throughout the game?

499
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:22,327
When you play this scene, there's no indication that you're making a choice, per se.

500
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:25,450
The food is there and you just do whatever you want to it.

501
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:29,581
The reactivity comes in very quickly afterwards.

502
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,762
If you take more than your share,

503
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:34,484
you experience an entire short additional day

504
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,045
in which Delilah calls to chew you out

505
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:38,546
for disregarding her request.

506
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:52,914
Hey, you didn't take all of the supply drop food, did you?

507
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:55,115
Because, remember, it was for a lot of people, like five.

508
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:56,773
I'm hungry.

509
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:00,516
So you did.

510
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,297
I gotta go.

511
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,300
It's played more for a joke than anything else,

512
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,941
but it was an important moment for us

513
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,803
in terms of reframing how we even thought about what it

514
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,045
means to make a choice in this video game,

515
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:15,767
both from a designer standpoint and the player's standpoint.

516
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,646
That extra day was pretty cheap to make.

517
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,547
It was just our existing basic systems,

518
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:23,309
a few lines of dialogue, a pre-existing location.

519
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,490
But for the players who experienced it,

520
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,752
it was a really funny and character-deepening

521
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,954
acknowledgment of a choice they may not even

522
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,735
have realized that they were making at the time.

523
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:36,498
Over the long-term construction of a story,

524
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,801
this kind of reactivity can build and maintain

525
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:42,683
credibility in the characters and the world, which

526
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,404
aids suspension of disbelief.

527
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:49,327
Players get the causal link in retrospect regardless of whether it was a calculated

528
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,108
decision or not.

529
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:56,474
This is how a lot of life works and in my opinion it's just as valid a way to model

530
00:27:56,534 --> 00:28:01,578
interaction as is a more traditionally information or rules driven game play model.

531
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,763
A more complex example of using more than just dialogue to produce reactive outcomes

532
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:08,123
occurs.

533
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:12,276
when Henry must track down whoever's been illegally setting off fireworks in the forest.

534
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,378
It turns out to be a pair of teens skinny dipping in a lake.

535
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,941
They notice Henry when he approaches and immediately start berating him for being, in their estimation,

536
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,663
a boring old lonely guy in the woods.

537
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:26,885
From there, the player has a lot of options, although none of them are required.

538
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:31,788
You can yell at the teens in an attempt to placate them, you can insult them back, or

539
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:35,271
you can say nothing at all, in which case they'll accuse you of being a creepy skeever.

540
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:37,532
If you grab their whiskey on the way over,

541
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,894
you can use that to needle them.

542
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:41,936
You can pick up their boombox, which is blasting music,

543
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,318
and when they complain, you can put it back

544
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:46,360
or throw it on the ground or throw it into the lake

545
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,541
or you can just take it with you.

546
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:50,523
Many of these choices have discrete reactions,

547
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:53,386
some of which overlap and influence each other.

548
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:56,048
You can even rush past the entire encounter

549
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,391
and never directly encounter the teams at all.

550
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:02,193
Because after all, what stops the player

551
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,554
from just leaving immediately?

552
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:08,877
In a game with puzzles to solve, or enemies to defeat, or physical traversal challenges to overcome,

553
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:15,139
it's easy to imagine putting an explicit obstacle in the player's way to ensure they fulfill a mechanical goal

554
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,620
or at least stay in the same place for a certain amount of time.

555
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:22,545
Maybe with a higher budget, we could have had you directly interact with clothed teens

556
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,426
instead of shouting at naked ones in a lake.

557
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:30,167
And they could have a pile of their own stuff that blocks your way until the encounter's

558
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:30,747
over or something.

559
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:34,488
But it turns out we didn't really have that at our disposal.

560
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:40,029
And I'm actually glad we didn't, because it encouraged a more reactive approach to scenes

561
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:40,389
like this.

562
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:44,030
As best we could, we simply tried to support player behavior.

563
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,423
Eventually Delilah will check in to see how everything went,

564
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:50,104
and it's up to you what you tell her.

565
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,465
Your response doesn't have to bear anything in common

566
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:53,585
with what actually happened.

567
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,526
Delilah has no way to know.

568
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,968
The game knows, though, at a very granular level of detail

569
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,108
what you did and what you said you did,

570
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,849
and any of that information can be used.

571
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,290
In fact, if you were dishonest with Delilah

572
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,651
about bungling the situation,

573
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:08,892
she eventually calls you on it.

574
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:12,723
Here's another example of what we call content wiring.

575
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:17,164
There's a dialogue event named On Exit Lakeside for Canyon,

576
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:19,665
which is called when Henry leaves the teen zone

577
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:20,965
going in a particular direction.

578
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:23,706
There's several events with this identical name.

579
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,726
This particular version of the event,

580
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,406
which has the teens yell at Henry

581
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,787
about leaving with their boombox,

582
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,487
only plays if all of its requirements are met.

583
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,308
Boombox held in hand is true.

584
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:36,928
Teens have seen Henry is true.

585
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,191
Teens saw Henry exit is false,

586
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:44,656
teens fled is false, and property destroyed is false.

587
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:48,039
These states are all set based on player action.

588
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,722
Some of them, like boom boxes held in hand,

589
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:51,863
are very specific.

590
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,826
Whereas some, like property destroyed,

591
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:58,070
could be set through a variety of different player actions.

592
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:02,026
If any of these five conditions are not met,

593
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,827
the game will choose a version of the on-exit

594
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:07,268
Lakeside for Canyon event whose requirements

595
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,530
can be satisfied, meaning it's more appropriate

596
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,811
to the situation the player has created.

597
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:18,006
These same narrative techniques could be applied in dramatically different ways.

598
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:23,330
We in our particular game tried not to draw attention to the many ways player behavior

599
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,814
influences outcomes, but there's absolutely no reason that that has to be the case.

600
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:32,018
These same principles and systems could be applied in ways that call attention to, rather

601
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,880
than downplay, the reactivity.

602
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,710
Firewatch came in at one end of the spectrum,

603
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,891
extreme subtlety if that makes any sense,

604
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,872
but you could go in the other direction

605
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:43,774
with explicit UI elements that track your choices

606
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:46,475
or somewhere in between with dialogue lines

607
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,116
that more directly allude to the choices

608
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:50,457
that you've been making in the game.

609
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,919
I think of design at the most fundamental level

610
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:57,600
as the art of putting yourself into someone else's brain.

611
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,630
essentially empathy.

612
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:02,713
No matter how brilliant your idea or system,

613
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,735
it has to survive contact with players

614
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:07,979
who are going to encounter it with lifetimes of experiences

615
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,560
and assumptions that differ to yours.

616
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,762
That doesn't mean you have to design

617
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:13,724
for the outcome players most want.

618
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,446
Exhibit A being the ending of Firewatch.

619
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,088
We were under no illusions that would be a crowd pleaser,

620
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,310
but the better you can anticipate

621
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,333
what someone else might think or try or conclude

622
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:26,754
based on what you've put in front of them,

623
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,636
then the better equipped you are as a designer.

624
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,319
We often spent hours talking through scenarios

625
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:36,561
to avoid simply putting up invisible walls

626
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:39,783
or hard gating player progress through similarly stark means

627
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:41,104
although frustratingly,

628
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,082
frustratingly, we were not successful in every single case.

629
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:47,444
I did at least one full playthrough of the game,

630
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:48,685
as an example of this,

631
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:51,148
never proactively talking to Delilah,

632
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,850
never using the walkie-talkie to contact her myself,

633
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,612
and then any time I was able to let a dialogue choice

634
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:57,453
simply time out.

635
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:58,713
I would just do that.

636
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,914
I wanted to make sure that no quests flat out broke,

637
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:04,375
but also that all of the critical path story

638
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:05,555
still actually made sense,

639
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,436
that Delilah didn't inadvertently reference knowledge

640
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:10,376
that she couldn't have and things like that.

641
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:13,017
It's definitely not the version of the game we targeted,

642
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:15,298
but it's a totally valid way to play the game

643
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,278
that we actually made.

644
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:19,619
So that style of play had to work

645
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,520
and react appropriately to the player.

646
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:28,876
In another case, along similar lines, the player is told to go get a new handheld radio

647
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:32,777
because Henry and Delilah fear that Henry's current radio has been bugged.

648
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:37,618
As in the team's example, we can't physically force the player to complete this quest.

649
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:42,239
If the player ignores Delilah's order and continues on to the next objective, either

650
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,560
because they already know where to go or because they're just a proactive explorer, Delilah

651
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,741
gets increasingly frantic that Henry turn back and go get the radio.

652
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:53,902
Their communication is very different in tone and content when playing this path.

653
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:59,485
path. And those who did play this way had a believable and reactive experience. Maybe

654
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,948
they knew they were sequence breaking and got a thrill out of it. Maybe they had no

655
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:06,710
idea whatsoever and it's just how they ended up stumbling through the world. But either

656
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:14,215
way, the game supported them and reacted appropriately. I know there's a fundamental difference between

657
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:18,158
these webs of discreetly authored pieces of content that I'm describing and...

658
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:20,553
more traditionally rules-based systems

659
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,054
that often underpin game mechanics.

660
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:24,515
And I'm under no illusion that we're creating

661
00:34:24,615 --> 00:34:26,497
procedural narrative or anything like that.

662
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:29,078
But I do think games like this can benefit

663
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:32,000
from their designers thinking about their authored content

664
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,061
as though it is a living system.

665
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:37,323
In pursuit of reactivity, you want to pay off

666
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:39,825
as many player behaviors as you can

667
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:41,966
inside the context of the verbs

668
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,547
your players have been given.

669
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,532
And although it's the designer's role to foresee those behaviors,

670
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:50,054
you're never going to imagine all of them yourself,

671
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:51,955
hence playtesting.

672
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:56,938
Firewatch was developed in a small office originally built

673
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,279
as a two-bedroom apartment.

674
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,921
We subleased one bedroom to our friends at Asymmetric,

675
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,183
makers of Kingdom of Loathing and West of Loathing.

676
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,084
So we really worked out of a one-bedroom apartment.

677
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:10,487
And that remaining bedroom was our conference room

678
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:11,527
and recording studio.

679
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:14,409
So effectively, we worked out of a small living room.

680
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:17,997
The conference room doubled as our playtest space.

681
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:20,199
We would set the playtester down on our couch,

682
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,941
and anyone from the studio who wanted to watch

683
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:25,742
could follow along on an internal live stream

684
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:26,523
that looked like this.

685
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:30,205
It was really valuable for uncovering bugs and pain points,

686
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,407
but it was also really valuable for observing

687
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:36,329
how players attempted to interact with narrative content.

688
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,955
For instance, it was a play tester who first attempted to throw the boombox into the lake in the teen scene.

689
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:47,020
We then supported that choice by shorting out the boombox and adding a reaction from the teens,

690
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:51,465
and then that experience prompted us to start thinking about even more boombox behavior.

691
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:55,169
So if you take the boombox with you, blasting music the whole time,

692
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,432
Delilah comments on how loud the music is when she checks in.

693
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:04,355
Taking these seemingly throwaway narrative interactions seriously became a really big

694
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:08,821
priority for us and it significantly influenced how we thought about and made this game.

695
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:14,268
And for Critical Path Story Beats, playtests reminded us that content should be given room

696
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:14,829
to breathe.

697
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,943
I remember sitting down with a stopwatch to speedrun quest objectives and make sure that

698
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,627
even for players who are rushing through the game, the accompanying conversations wouldn't

699
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,708
overrun the necessary travel time.

700
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:31,611
So if a day's first quest starts with Henry getting from his tower to the nearest supply

701
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:36,855
box and a player can achieve that in 54 seconds, we would keep the critical path portions of

702
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:37,636
the conversation.

703
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:42,478
to under 54 seconds to cut down on overlap or undo standing around.

704
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:47,279
We would often rewrite conversations or remove content entirely to achieve this,

705
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:51,261
but writing is very often improved by being edited down anyway.

706
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:56,863
As a former professional editor, I think that's true even for the very best writers in games as much as anywhere else.

707
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,774
In populating your game with reactivity,

708
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:04,636
seek to surprise and delight the player whenever you can.

709
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:08,397
At one point, Henry can find this gross trowel,

710
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:11,259
and Delilah dryly informs him that most likely

711
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,839
its purpose was to shovel poop.

712
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,981
If the player has not yet dropped the trowel,

713
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:18,022
by the time Henry receives this information,

714
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:20,963
he replies, and I'm still holding it.

715
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:23,545
And if the player still doesn't drop it,

716
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:27,386
Henry continues remarking on his inexplicable behavior.

717
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:33,183
Moments like these, which combine multiple kinds of player input in order to trigger

718
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:38,825
small reactive outcomes, seek to engage in almost an improvisational relationship with

719
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:39,265
the player.

720
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:44,727
If you can make story content in a time and budget efficient way, after all, writing and

721
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:48,648
recording a few lines of dialogue on top of what you're already writing and recording

722
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:54,270
is a relatively small marginal cost, then it becomes practical to include bits of fun

723
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,611
and surprising content on a frequent basis.

724
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,083
Individually, they might all be throwaways, but in aggregate, it becomes meaningful.

725
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:09,408
Allowing and encouraging the player to constantly interrogate your game world in different ways,

726
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:15,051
and rewarding the player with acknowledgement and validation of that interrogation, both creates

727
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:20,834
the sense that this is a believable place and encourages investment in your character relationships

728
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:21,375
and story.

729
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:27,164
Players can also be given content reactively beyond dialogue.

730
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,846
Some of Firewatch's music, for instance,

731
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,228
is scored directly to specific moments in the game,

732
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,329
like a traditional score,

733
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,171
but some is implemented in a more reactive way.

734
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:38,813
This is true of much of the music on day two,

735
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:42,256
the part of the game that pairs long personal conversations

736
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:44,018
with the player traipsing all over the world.

737
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,480
Knowing that the player may end up going

738
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,102
reasonably long periods of time,

739
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:52,144
being lost between quest points and big conversations,

740
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:54,455
There's a music manager that's evaluating

741
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:56,377
what conversations the player has had,

742
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:57,998
how long it's been since they've had one,

743
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,640
where they are relative to their objectives, and so on.

744
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,742
When the system identifies a potential

745
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:04,962
sort of interaction valley,

746
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:08,025
meaning the player hasn't experienced important content

747
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,927
in a little while, isn't likely to hit any soon

748
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:12,027
based on their current state,

749
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:13,748
then it plays a little bit of music

750
00:39:13,788 --> 00:39:16,170
to kind of inject some emotion and weight into the moment.

751
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,772
Players' brains will do a lot of work

752
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:21,113
in terms of applying specific emotional meaning

753
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,074
to creative content.

754
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:25,085
if you've sufficiently suspended their disbelief

755
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:28,497
and given them enough existing meaning and content to chew on.

756
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:38,276
I'm sure that no one technique I've shared here is new to games, obviously, but applying

757
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:44,641
this reactive player-centric approach to narrative consistently without fail states is actually

758
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:46,103
surprisingly unusual.

759
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:51,207
Treating it as the primary element of the game rather than just as flavor or Easter

760
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:53,670
eggs is what really opened up our horizons.

761
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,252
I will freely admit we did not always succeed at this,

762
00:39:57,332 --> 00:40:00,273
or didn't take full advantage of the possibilities.

763
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:04,015
And we didn't always patch all the logic and behavior

764
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,757
holes in the most graceful way, as Reddit and Twitter

765
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:07,917
will attest frequently.

766
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,999
But solving interactive narrative problems

767
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,020
while attempting to preserve player intention,

768
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,561
while it may be difficult, is a really satisfying and

769
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,022
challenging design ambition.

770
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:22,869
We also unintentionally front-loaded our playtesting.

771
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,194
So the closer we got to ship, the more we were scrambling to just get the thing built

772
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:32,079
on our fairly small budget and time frame with fewer opportunities to playtest,

773
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:36,223
and as a result, a lower density of really reactive content.

774
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:44,826
On top of that, making a game like this the first time through, it kind of felt like we were feeling out our philosophy and practices as we went along.

775
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:48,468
But hopefully we'll continue to build on this in our next game.

776
00:40:49,008 --> 00:41:00,011
But my bigger hope than that is that other teams will take this thought process and set of ideas to further and better places than we have so far.

777
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,871
So in order to design for believability and reactivity,

778
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:07,133
you have to build your game and structure your team

779
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,634
with certain kinds of flexibility in mind.

780
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,616
In your game systems, you have to be willing

781
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:15,637
to change or expand the capabilities of those systems

782
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,099
in order to support types of reactivity

783
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:20,520
you may not even realize would be valuable

784
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,581
when you start development.

785
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:23,622
And then in authoring and implementation,

786
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,503
it means your tools must allow for revising content

787
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:28,525
without that work being so onerous

788
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:29,865
that it discourages iteration.

789
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:35,378
And on your team, it means treating writing as an integral facet of game design, such

790
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:40,960
that your writers are able to both react to the design needs of the game, as well as let

791
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,661
the needs of the story influence the design in turn.

792
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:50,084
Going back to the classic teens example, before Henry actually encounters the culprits, he

793
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:51,625
comes across evidence of their presence.

794
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:55,616
Empty beer cans, discarded backpacks and clothing, unused fireworks.

795
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:59,357
Henry can pick these things up, he can throw them, simply look at them.

796
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,578
After picking up a beer can, the player can stow it in Henry's backpack or

797
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:04,539
drop it on the ground.

798
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:08,180
He can report the cans to Delilah with various reactions.

799
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,421
And then any of these things, in theory, can set facts for later use.

800
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:16,042
So tossing a can prompts Henry to remark, I'm not the maid.

801
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:16,322
And then

802
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:18,778
In this scene as well as the following day,

803
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,620
when Henry's attempting to track down the teen's campsite,

804
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,783
the game tracks how many beer cans the player sees

805
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:27,244
and collects and then uses that information

806
00:42:27,324 --> 00:42:28,986
to trigger lines appropriately.

807
00:42:29,886 --> 00:42:31,668
The teens drink a lot of beer, it turns out,

808
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,389
and we leaned on beer cans pretty heavily

809
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,711
as trail breadcrumbs for the player to follow.

810
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:41,253
The result of this, though, all of this, is that within the bounds of Henry's defined personality,

811
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:45,894
the player is enacting their own sense of Henry's purpose and attitude.

812
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:52,577
And at its best, the game interprets these tiny, discrete choices the player is making,

813
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:56,518
and then infers and reflects back that intention to the player.

814
00:42:57,332 --> 00:43:03,220
Reactivity is often particularly effective when the reaction is in sync with the player's intent.

815
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:08,127
A lot of our design effort was in trying to create complex sets of conditions

816
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:12,152
to reflect that intention back to the player through as many different inputs as possible.

817
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,781
This necessitated more and more player-facing systems

818
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:19,202
tying into the designer-facing tools.

819
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,543
Our first iteration of tools mainly allowed

820
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:23,664
for setting facts through interactive dialogue,

821
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,245
but we expanded the scope of what player inputs

822
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:28,766
could be observed and used to set state over time,

823
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:31,747
including many different types of object interaction.

824
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,749
For another game, there might be an entirely different set

825
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:38,130
of inputs and interactions that end up being useful

826
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,350
to support reactivity.

827
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,111
It was important to us that just about all

828
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,077
be implementable by writers and designers

829
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:48,778
without needing to constantly bug programmers

830
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:51,339
to support implementing some particular piece of gameplay.

831
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:53,359
So except in extreme cases,

832
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,940
when we needed a particular kind of player action

833
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,020
to be tracked or observed,

834
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,601
an engineer would integrate that ability

835
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:01,182
into the design tool set

836
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,443
rather than special casing it in code.

837
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:07,484
This flexibility allows writers and designers

838
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,965
to iterate on their own work directly in engine.

839
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,543
And as a consequence, it has this other important result,

840
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,944
which is that it feeds back into expanding

841
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:19,385
the possibility space of what kind of creative content

842
00:44:19,465 --> 00:44:21,766
and writing can and should be made.

843
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,747
Once you know that the game is able to, for instance,

844
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:27,868
react to what object the player's holding at a given moment

845
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:30,569
and that reaction can branch depending on

846
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,690
any number of other states based on past player actions,

847
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,911
then your awareness of that possibility

848
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,651
will always be present when you're coming up

849
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:39,552
with new ideas for creative content.

850
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:44,199
Rather than the writing being a separate track to the player-facing mechanics,

851
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:50,062
treating game systems and tools flexibly allows those two domains to be mutually influential.

852
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:56,826
It encourages habitually thinking about hand-authored narrative as a reactive system.

853
00:44:58,026 --> 00:45:02,889
Which isn't to say that every new interaction idea should immediately be implemented as a repeatable system.

854
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:08,449
You should sit down as a design team in conversation with the engineering team to ensure that there's

855
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,792
a legitimate case that expanding the systems and tools in a given way will actually be

856
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:16,995
useful enough times to justify whatever technical cost it will incur.

857
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:22,178
You may come up with enough use cases that it's a no-brainer or it might be such a specific

858
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,041
case that there's an alternative route to a similar outcome or you might put the idea

859
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:29,143
on ice until you determine there's an ongoing need which may never happen.

860
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:32,766
In order to achieve that kind of flexibility,

861
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:34,986
it's crucial that writing is an integral part

862
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,307
of the development process.

863
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:39,187
Having worked as both a game designer and a writer

864
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:43,008
and in full-time and contracting roles in those disciplines,

865
00:45:43,548 --> 00:45:46,249
I can confidently say that the more your writers

866
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,709
are integrated into design and development

867
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:49,790
at a fundamental level,

868
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,230
the better the writing itself will be integrated.

869
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,331
Regardless of how your team is physically organized,

870
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:57,371
whether it's distributed a single office

871
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:58,471
or a combination of those,

872
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:01,073
Writing and design must be in conversation.

873
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:05,476
Writers can't simply throw material over the fence and then expect it to be implemented

874
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:09,519
in a way that takes full advantage of the possibilities your design offers.

875
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:16,344
I think of writing as a world building tool just like models, textures, animations, music,

876
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:16,964
and audio.

877
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:20,707
It's easy to come up with cool story ideas that are appealing in a vacuum.

878
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,285
in practice can't be directly integrated into the game design, or would only be appropriate

879
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:26,926
in a cutscene.

880
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:32,411
When writing and design are in close, ongoing partnership, you start to develop an intuitive

881
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:37,075
sense about which story ideas will cleanly fit into your game design, which ones are

882
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:40,278
likely untenable, and which could be appropriate with some massaging.

883
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:44,394
To that end, consider a television-style writer's room

884
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,775
approach, in which a small group of team members

885
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,617
meets as needed to solve overarching plot issues,

886
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:52,499
as well as micro-level issues of narrative and design,

887
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:55,241
before the writer goes off to write the actual words.

888
00:46:56,604 --> 00:46:58,125
How can we motivate the player, say,

889
00:46:58,185 --> 00:46:59,666
to get from point A to point B?

890
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:02,207
What could justify changing the world state

891
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:03,728
at a particular point in the story

892
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:06,370
to set the stage for the next big plot development?

893
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,151
What physical evidence could the player find

894
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:11,513
and directly interact with in order to outfit them

895
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,214
with an important piece of information?

896
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:17,656
And importantly, what specific versions of these solutions

897
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:19,858
will be appropriate and implementable

898
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:21,839
in the context of our game systems?

899
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:26,381
These problems are at the intersection of writing and design, and you'll need a flexible

900
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:29,408
approach to your team roles to solve them on an ongoing basis.

901
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:35,730
It's beyond the time constraints of this talk to delve further into the workings of the Firewatch writing and design toolset,

902
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,992
but there are two GDC talks that go into more technical detail.

903
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:44,955
The tool's underlying principles were based on a 2012 talk by then Valve programmer Elon Ruskin entitled

904
00:47:45,435 --> 00:47:48,357
AI-Driven Dynamic Dialogue Through Fuzzy Pattern Matching.

905
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:54,400
It explains how Valve implemented dialogue in Left 4 Dead and other games by matching possible lines in other gameplay events

906
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,261
against hundreds of facts based on player and AI state.

907
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:01,850
And we applied that approach in Firewatch, as explained in 2017

908
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,472
by Campo Santo programmers Will Armstrong and Patrick Ewing

909
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:07,634
in their talk, Do You Copy?

910
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,715
Dialogue System and Tools in Firewatch.

911
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:12,697
Both of these talks are available on the GDC Vault

912
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,118
and are very useful if you're interested in tackling some

913
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,900
of these techniques and systems in your own games.

914
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,791
And our experience across Firewatch and into the development of In the Valley of Gods taught

915
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:28,113
us that the specific form these tools take is highly informed by the needs of your particular

916
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:32,075
game systems, which is another reason I didn't go further into our specific implementation.

917
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:37,437
The Firewatch editor was in many ways very raw and required some amount of finesse, but

918
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:41,038
it was accordingly extremely open-ended and extremely flexible as well.

919
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,499
On In the Valley of Gods, the requirements

920
00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:46,000
of narrative content for a physically present companion

921
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,880
character with her own set of performance needs

922
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,001
meant we ended up spending a lot more time on the editor

923
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,882
to get it a bit more visually refined

924
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:55,303
to avoid being overwhelmed by all the systems

925
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:56,243
it had to tap into.

926
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:58,804
This brought with it some sanding down

927
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:01,284
of the pure flexibility of the Firewatch system,

928
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,585
but that was necessary given the needs of In the Valley of Gods.

929
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:06,826
And having made one of these games already,

930
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:08,546
we had some better instincts about which

931
00:49:08,586 --> 00:49:10,927
of those edges would be a little safer to sand down.

932
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,186
the second time around.

933
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,499
Firewatch was also extremely engineering constrained,

934
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,759
so it's something of a miracle that our few programmers

935
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:20,820
developed that tool set to the extent they did.

936
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,140
As with everything in game development,

937
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,340
it's all a set of trade-offs.

938
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,021
In development of your tools,

939
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:28,801
do your best to consider who will be using them,

940
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:31,262
how they will be used, and for what.

941
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:33,702
Polish and usability of tools

942
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:35,022
that the players will never see

943
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,322
may feel like an indulgence,

944
00:49:36,363 --> 00:49:38,703
but it may end up saving a huge amount of time

945
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,063
that can ultimately be put back

946
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,323
into making the game better.

947
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:46,346
Part of my motivation in giving this talk

948
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,548
was to make the case that narrative

949
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,109
can support an entire game's worth

950
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:53,410
of player-centric interaction.

951
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:56,332
I've had a number of conversations with game designers

952
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:59,773
I really respect who see games like Firewatch

953
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:02,375
as essentially not quite being games,

954
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:04,356
even if they don't necessarily mean it

955
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:06,537
in the inflammatory way that you often see online.

956
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,241
I do understand what they mean in some sense.

957
00:50:10,401 --> 00:50:17,428
I myself have a deep love for heavily systemic games like Spelunky, SimCity, Stalker, Civilization,

958
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:19,971
XCOM and many more games in that vein.

959
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:26,557
But the systems those games model, and model very beautifully, are not equipped to consistently

960
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:31,703
model certain kinds of intimate narrative interactions as the primary focus.

961
00:50:32,928 --> 00:50:35,649
To tell a story in a reactive way in a game,

962
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:39,831
and to have that reactive story be the single most important

963
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,572
and dominant element in the game,

964
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,973
requires acknowledging that the way humans interact

965
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:47,955
and the way life works can't be modeled in the way

966
00:50:48,035 --> 00:50:49,676
that many game systems operate.

967
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:52,877
But importantly, we can still take

968
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:55,738
the kind of habitually systemic thinking

969
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:58,900
that we as designers apply to games of all genres

970
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,441
and use that to deeply influence and inform.

971
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:06,471
carefully hand-authored narrative in order to make something new.

972
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:13,413
Those who know me well know of my deep love and appreciation

973
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:16,834
for the systemic integrity of Far Cry 2,

974
00:51:17,395 --> 00:51:19,555
led by Clint Hawking and released in 2008.

975
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:23,317
It's a game that uses unforgiving but very player-centric

976
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:25,638
game systems in ways that not only reward

977
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:28,659
and punish experimentation and provide consistently

978
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,461
surprising outcomes, but also speaks deeply

979
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,361
to the themes and goals of the game.

980
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:39,899
In many respects, it couldn't be a more different experience to Firewatch, but its holistic

981
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,245
and player-centric approach was a huge influence on me, and I hope that we brought some of

982
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:45,306
that to our own game.

983
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:50,913
Given that hope, I was extremely gratified when a recent positive video review made a

984
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:53,616
particularly resonant comparison mere seconds in.

985
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:58,114
So I finally played Firewatch.

986
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:02,097
I hope Firewatch's best elements spread like the blazes you're ordered to spot.

987
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:07,781
Because in spite of the genre, its handful of mechanics reminded me of Far Cry 2, of all things.

988
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:09,202
In the past I've criticized-

989
00:52:16,326 --> 00:52:17,707
So yeah, that was a good day.

990
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:21,410
And that's all I have for you today.

991
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:22,430
Thank you for attending.

992
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,992
I really hope that these principles and lessons

993
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:27,814
can encourage other teams to take some of the work

994
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,455
I've described even further.

995
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:31,196
Thank you very much.

996
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:38,341
Thank you very much.

997
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:44,024
And I've been told by multiple people to please fill out your session, remind you to fill

998
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,967
out your session forms that I think are emailed to you.

999
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:48,709
I think that's how it works in my experience.

1000
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:57,077
If you want to ask any questions, I'm happy to answer them to the best of my ability based

1001
00:52:57,117 --> 00:52:59,140
on this or anything else, I guess, probably mainly this stuff.

1002
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:05,724
Thanks for your presentation.

1003
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,764
You mentioned in your presentation that the length

1004
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:10,925
that you guys went to emulate real life,

1005
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:13,185
especially the way that the dialogue formed.

1006
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:16,066
And one question that I had was that in real life,

1007
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:18,566
certain choices that you make are not weighted,

1008
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:21,367
they're not as significant as another choice.

1009
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:25,708
And so in particular, when players are just starting off

1010
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:28,088
and they might not realize that their implicit choices

1011
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:30,829
have impact on consequences, how did you guys

1012
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:32,729
approach weighting of the different choices?

1013
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:38,961
That's a good question. I would say in Firewatch, we didn't worry too much about weighting choices equally.

1014
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,722
That wasn't a concern for us.

1015
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:45,325
So, I mean, this isn't a dialogue choice, but just as a way of example,

1016
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:47,907
the scene I talked about with the choosing food,

1017
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:50,969
like, there's a reactive outcome if you take too much food,

1018
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:53,471
and there isn't one if you take the normal amount.

1019
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,593
Like, we weren't trying to always do a 50-50 wait.

1020
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:58,214
The way I would think about it would be,

1021
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,015
you wouldn't want to wait the game such that

1022
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:03,797
if you're always kind of an asshole,

1023
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:05,158
or if you're always nice,

1024
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:06,919
then that's how to get all the stuff.

1025
00:54:07,419 --> 00:54:09,561
Like, there should be reactive outcomes happening

1026
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:12,342
regardless of how the player plays,

1027
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:14,243
but they don't all need to be equally waited

1028
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:15,524
for every single interaction.

1029
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:21,689
You know, we weren't making a game with sort of a stat-based tree that the player's trying

1030
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:22,310
to min-max.

1031
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,071
In fact, we were trying to do quite the opposite.

1032
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:30,437
We were hoping that players would simply choose whatever response or implicit action they

1033
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:33,219
felt was most appropriate to the situation without making...

1034
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:36,896
without trying to weight their decisions ahead of time.

1035
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:38,858
So in the case of our particular game,

1036
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:40,599
we didn't put a huge amount of focus on that.

1037
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:42,661
But like I said in the talk, I think

1038
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:44,382
you could make a game that uses

1039
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,163
literally these exact same systems,

1040
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:48,505
but does put a lot of emphasis on that

1041
00:54:48,946 --> 00:54:50,567
and is constantly drawing attention to it.

1042
00:54:50,947 --> 00:54:52,708
It just wasn't necessarily appropriate

1043
00:54:52,729 --> 00:54:54,390
for the particular story we were telling.

1044
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:55,411
Great, thanks.

1045
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,011
You're welcome.

1046
00:54:58,353 --> 00:55:00,254
So you talked about player testing

1047
00:55:00,294 --> 00:55:02,936
and how that affected interactivity.

1048
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:09,826
Did player testing actually change narrative or how tight or how close was the dev team

1049
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:11,027
to the narrative and the story?

1050
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:14,590
And how much did player testing affect the actual outcome?

1051
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:20,644
The narrative itself, I would say, usually was not that influenced.

1052
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,586
The sort of broader story, the narrative spine of the game, the linear story that was the

1053
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:30,069
backbone of the game, underneath all this other sort of player reactivity, we didn't

1054
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:37,312
change that very much due to playtesting, which I would say was in part because we had

1055
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:38,132
a particular way of...

1056
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,508
putting the story together that was,

1057
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:42,670
you know, had particular goals

1058
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,731
that we just wanted to achieve.

1059
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,113
But also because realistically, you know,

1060
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,795
the game was made on a pretty tight schedule.

1061
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,317
We made it in just about two years,

1062
00:55:50,377 --> 00:55:51,378
just a shade over two years.

1063
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:55,261
And we didn't, going back and constantly changing the story

1064
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:56,382
in response to playtesting,

1065
00:55:56,742 --> 00:55:57,783
I think would have been challenging.

1066
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,846
We did rewrite basically the last third of the game

1067
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:03,829
a few months before ship, which was pretty intense.

1068
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,170
That was less because of like,

1069
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:10,006
sort of a playtester said it was bad and more because I think we all sort of suddenly realized it was bad.

1070
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:15,448
So, which included people playing the game, but also included just it being obvious.

1071
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:21,650
So the playtesting I think was a lot more about the kind of micro level and systemic issues.

1072
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,051
But to the to the point I was saying about writer's room like...

1073
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:28,213
Even though I wasn't the writer on this game, I was still,

1074
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:31,795
there were several of us who were kind of the writer's room

1075
00:56:32,236 --> 00:56:35,798
who spanned disciplines including design

1076
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,379
and were constantly iterating on the story

1077
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:41,681
on a creative level as well as on the kind of reactive level.

1078
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,903
So I do think it's, as I said, it's really important

1079
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,525
that the actual writing and story and plot

1080
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:50,147
be super integrated into the rest of development for sure.

1081
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:59,749
Hi, I've got a question about the way that you were constructing facts and how that affected the design.

1082
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,652
It looked like your strings were like you added a fact as you needed it in the story

1083
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:10,133
rather than having some sort of grammar or something that was more fully systemic.

1084
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:15,035
Was that deliberate and did that have an effect on how you thought about the story

1085
00:57:15,856 --> 00:57:17,997
or was it just that it was simpler to do it that way?

1086
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,811
That, I mean, probably for more concrete detail

1087
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,091
on the technical underpinnings of that,

1088
00:57:24,451 --> 00:57:26,252
you should watch the talk by Will Armstrong

1089
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:30,655
and Patrick Ewing, who are our programmers on that system.

1090
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:34,577
I would say, from my end, the flexibility

1091
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:37,098
that that offered was useful in terms

1092
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:38,759
of being extremely non-prescriptive.

1093
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,901
Being able to arbitrarily add any fact about any,

1094
00:57:44,782 --> 00:57:46,964
sort of topic of any kind ever.

1095
00:57:47,144 --> 00:57:49,266
It sort of, facts can be added based on like

1096
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:52,229
a particular object that might sort of suggest

1097
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,811
some grammar that I think you're getting at

1098
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:55,692
in terms of like, did something to this object

1099
00:57:55,832 --> 00:57:58,155
or did something to this line of dialogue or whatever

1100
00:57:59,115 --> 00:58:00,277
in a more deterministic way, but.

1101
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:05,836
I think this sort of encouraged us to take a really wide ranging and sort of open-ended

1102
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:10,298
approach to tracking any kind of information we could pretty much ever think of as long

1103
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:13,960
as there was some way to read it from the game inputs that we had.

1104
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:21,191
Yeah, I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I think is valuable to say about that.

1105
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:24,532
You mentioned Delilah's brain and how people understood where things were.

1106
00:58:24,552 --> 00:58:29,574
So if Delilah knew something, another character potentially could know it as well,

1107
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:32,235
and therefore you'd have to duplicate it and all those things.

1108
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:35,557
Yeah, but if Delilah knows something and a different character knows it,

1109
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:38,378
those are fundamentally different world states.

1110
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:40,779
Those shouldn't be the same fact, right?

1111
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:46,641
Delilah knowing something and something being known in some other means,

1112
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:46,942
those are...

1113
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:51,480
totally separate and one could be true and the other might not be or they might both

1114
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,563
be true or both not be true so you wouldn't want those to be the same.

1115
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:56,264
Sure.

1116
00:58:56,544 --> 00:58:59,507
It was just that, you know, were there any facts I guess you didn't use?

1117
00:59:00,107 --> 00:59:01,108
Oh yeah, probably.

1118
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:05,933
There were, I mean, like God, probably hundreds of facts we didn't use.

1119
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:09,796
Will Armstrong, who I mentioned, is over there nodding vigorously at me.

1120
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,359
Yeah, we didn't worry too much about that.

1121
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:13,420
There wasn't really any harm.

1122
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:16,644
in setting a fact that you might have used

1123
00:59:16,664 --> 00:59:19,146
and then deleted the line that checked it later,

1124
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,167
it doesn't really do any harm to have that fact

1125
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:23,069
just being true, it might end up being useful still.

1126
00:59:25,908 --> 00:59:30,751
Hey, in terms of team comp, obviously you had like five or six...

1127
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:31,612
In terms of what, I'm sorry?

1128
00:59:31,632 --> 00:59:35,554
Like team composition when it came to working on the game, obviously you had like five or

1129
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:36,135
six roles.

1130
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:41,678
Was there ever any difficulty in balancing that and sort of how...

1131
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:47,882
And others on the team as well, and sort of did that ever cause any reason for like a

1132
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:50,924
pause or sort of a reevaluation of how y'all were doing things?

1133
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:55,558
Yeah, I mean, so we had about, I would say about 10 people,

1134
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:59,119
like basically over the course of development.

1135
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:00,399
It started out a little smaller than that

1136
01:00:00,439 --> 01:00:01,739
and ended up maybe a shade larger.

1137
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,161
We didn't have, there was more duplication of,

1138
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:10,481
it's the case that there were multiple people on the team

1139
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:11,362
with several roles.

1140
01:00:11,422 --> 01:00:14,142
So like I was on the story team and a game designer,

1141
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:16,603
but also the composer and the audio designer.

1142
01:00:17,992 --> 01:00:21,354
So that kind of was the opposite of causing conflicts,

1143
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:26,538
because like I was the only person on music, for instance,

1144
01:00:26,558 --> 01:00:28,719
so like there wasn't anyone else to butt up against.

1145
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,502
I would say that people were relatively self-sorting

1146
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:34,683
in terms of how much they cared about the story.

1147
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:37,125
So like Jane, our environment artist, for instance,

1148
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:38,406
who's like, I mean,

1149
01:00:38,446 --> 01:00:40,988
an absolutely incredible environment artist, she...

1150
01:00:41,908 --> 01:00:45,289
was like, I'm gonna find out what the ending is

1151
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:46,070
when I play the game.

1152
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,411
She was not deeply interested in being part

1153
01:00:50,431 --> 01:00:52,151
of those conversations on an ongoing basis.

1154
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:55,392
And the people who were more interested in that

1155
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:58,913
ended up sort of self-selecting into those roles.

1156
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:01,174
So I don't think it caused a huge amount of conflict.

1157
01:01:01,254 --> 01:01:05,135
It looks like I'm getting a signal here to stop talking.

1158
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:07,495
So, thanks for your question.

1159
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:07,935
Thanks.

1160
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,511
Apparently there's a wrap-up space on the other side of this floor, so I'll head over

1161
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:21,977
there and if people want to ask me other things, come over and do that.
