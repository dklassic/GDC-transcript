00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:12,812
Hi there, my name is Joshua Yersley, and today I'm going to present on Root a usability post-mortem.

2
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:22,635
So Root is a board game that was released in 2018, and it's a highly asymmetric strategy

3
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:22,916
game.

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,337
So in the core game, you can play on one of four sides.

5
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:30,118
You can play the cats, the birds...

6
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:36,511
The Woodland Alliance, which is a kind of ragtag band of mice and foxes

7
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:41,294
and other small woodland creatures who are rising up against tyranny.

8
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,877
And then there's the Vagabond, which is this wily raccoon adventure

9
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:48,778
that traipses through the forest.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,442
And so I'm going to be talking about our experience

11
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:58,524
doing usability and user experience work on Root.

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:05,360
And in case you're not familiar with those terms, basically usability is making sure

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,402
that people have an easy time learning the game, and then playing the game, using the

14
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:16,683
game's components, and just generally making sure that they have a good experience from

15
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,224
opening up the box to closing it up again.

16
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:26,916
And so I'm going to go over some usability and user experience positives.

17
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:33,341
But most of this talk is going to be about the failures and specifically the lessons

18
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:37,564
that we learn from those failures and what you can take away into your own work.

19
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:43,748
And so I'm going to start out by talking about icon testing.

20
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,210
And so, you know, and.

21
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:53,339
most games you have a lot of iconography, a lot of illustrations, just a lot of stuff that helps

22
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,305
orient people in different parts of the game. And so when you have all of these icons, you want to

23
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:05,352
make sure that the icons are doing their job, you know, that they're recognizable, that people

24
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:08,715
understand what they mean, and that they get the job done.

25
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:15,922
And so this icon is an icon that used to be in root,

26
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,503
but is no longer.

27
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:22,504
And the reason why we got rid of this icon

28
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:25,624
was because when we did icon testing on it,

29
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,945
you know, when we brought this up to people,

30
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,826
either by itself or in a group with our other icons,

31
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,466
and we asked people what they thought it was,

32
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,407
they would give back all sorts of

33
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:41,949
weird answers like, oh, it's a teapot, or it's a ghost, or it's a monkey.

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,193
And these are all, of course, perfectly valid perceptions. You know, people can only see what

35
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:54,916
they see, but it's not the perception that we had hoped for because this is meant to be a mouse.

36
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:03,980
And so because of the user testing that we did on this icon, we knew that we had to change it

37
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,982
because when you refer to, say,

38
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:11,973
you know, a mouse card or a mouse suit in the rules,

39
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:14,515
people need to be able to look at the table

40
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,596
and recognize that mouse icon as being a mouse.

41
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:23,280
And so here are four suits.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,322
We have our foxes, our bunnies, our mice, and our birds.

43
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,263
And here's the new mouse.

44
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,905
So after we did that icon testing,

45
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:36,006
we came up with a new concept for a mouse icon.

46
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,121
And the problem with that, the first problem is that Kyle Farrin, our wonderful, wonderful

47
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:45,661
artist, hated this idea.

48
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,862
You know, he said, I don't want to draw a Mickey Mouse mouse.

49
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:58,084
And to the point where now this idea of the monkey mouse icon has become somewhat of a

50
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:04,045
touchstone for places where Kyle thinks that something is a bad idea, basically.

51
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:09,043
But we put this new mouse icon in front of people,

52
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:13,166
and invariably people would say, oh, it's a mouse.

53
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:15,547
People understood what this new icon was.

54
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,889
So it's a good change, right?

55
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:25,532
Well, this is a presentation mostly about failures,

56
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,573
so no, this wasn't a good idea.

57
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,135
And I'm going to talk about why.

58
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:33,897
Or I should say, I'm not going to talk about why.

59
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:34,917
I'm just going to show you.

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,811
And I think you're going to get it here pretty soon.

61
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,373
So here's our bunny icon and our mouse icon next to each other.

62
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:48,896
And we're just going to start making this smaller, a little bit smaller, you know, keep

63
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:49,496
going.

64
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:53,458
And I think that you might be getting the idea.

65
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
It's that the icon doesn't scale well.

66
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:04,444
So at smaller scales, the rabbit and the mouse just start looking a lot like each other.

67
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:13,525
So even though the new mouse icon was recognizable as a mouse compared to the old icon, it was

68
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:17,308
doing its job there, it was not distinguishable from the bunny.

69
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:26,035
And although, like, although there are lots of elements of this icon that could distinguish

70
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:30,899
it, the most important element, in my opinion, are these whiskers right here.

71
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:37,595
And the problem is that these whiskers also happen to be the smallest element of the icon.

72
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:44,377
So even though it's fine if you just have a card in front of you, you know, relatively

73
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:54,620
close by, the whiskers just do not show up in other contexts, especially on our game

74
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,142
board when the icon is scaled down and it has this darker background.

75
00:05:59,162 --> 00:05:59,982
Because

76
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:04,567
Whiskers just kind of just kind of get reduced into oblivion

77
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:08,709
And so there's almost nothing distinguishing it

78
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,972
Readily from that bunny icon unless you look really close at it. So

79
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,493
This was a big mistake

80
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:23,997
Unfortunately, we can't really go back and change it because we need to support expansion products that use the same iconography

81
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:31,272
And so you can still visit our friends, the monkey mouse,

82
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:36,416
who's on our on our logo without the tail, of course.

83
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,657
And so sorry about that, Kyle.

84
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,258
It's kind of a rookie mistake.

85
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,682
But, you know, we'll we'll we know we know better for next time.

86
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:53,426
So the next thing I'd like to talk about is storytelling and feedback.

87
00:06:55,203 --> 00:07:01,707
And the reason I want to talk about this is because Root as a game, you know, it's a war game, but it's

88
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,009
fundamentally interested in telling stories about

89
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,731
politics, how power moves around through society,

90
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:11,772
and

91
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:13,373
basically,

92
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:18,456
you know, how people operate within conflict.

93
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:27,831
And so I'll tell you a little story about how we use a few mechanics to tell great stories

94
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:31,594
And then I'm gonna tell a story about how we fail at that

95
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:38,500
So this is called a sympathy token

96
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:47,768
It's a piece of the Woodland Alliance, which is that ragtag band of creatures trying to you know rise up against tyranny

97
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:53,917
And an interesting property of this piece is that whenever you remove it,

98
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,898
whenever you remove it from the map, whenever you go in and you suppress that sympathy,

99
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,080
you have to actually give a card from your hand to the Woodland Alliance player.

100
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,642
And so you might be, you might walk into a fox clearing, take out the sympathy,

101
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:13,683
and you might have this tax collector sitting in your hand.

102
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:15,523
And

103
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,871
the tax collector is like, whoa, I didn't sign up for this,

104
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:25,496
and basically goes and defects to the Woodland Alliance.

105
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:30,040
And so using this pretty simple combination of mechanics,

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,083
we can tell a nicely detailed story

107
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,304
about what's going on here.

108
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,968
However, a place where this falls down

109
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,990
is in another system called crafting.

110
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:51,574
Basically, what you need to know about crafting is that it lets you get the text on the bottom

111
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,095
of the card.

112
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:57,637
So, all of that stuff on the paper on the bottom, you can basically, if you fulfill

113
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:00,298
certain conditions, you can get that stuff on the bottom.

114
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,340
So basically, the way that you get it is you just need a particular piece in a clearing

115
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,261
of a suit that matches its requirement.

116
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:07,821
So, that's basically it.

117
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,101
So, that's it.

118
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,201
I hope you enjoyed this video.

119
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,822
If you did, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel.

120
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,282
I'll see you next time.

121
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:11,382
Ciao!

122
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:15,718
If you look to the left of that box, you'll see a little bunny icon.

123
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:21,600
And basically what that's just saying is that as long as you have your crafting piece,

124
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,923
like your workshop, in a clearing on the map of that suit, you can get what's at the bottom.

125
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:33,005
So in this case, we have a bunny workshop, we have a bunny requirement, and we can just

126
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:37,566
craft that travel gear. You know, you can walk into your workshop and craft that travel gear.

127
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:40,988
But the problem is...

128
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,746
is that there are a lot of parts of the story,

129
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:50,188
and only some of them actually interface with the components.

130
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:55,150
When you craft this card, you end up discarding it,

131
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,911
you end up getting this boot, but you don't actually

132
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:59,551
do anything with that workshop.

133
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,672
And what we saw all the time was people

134
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,133
would just look at that workshop,

135
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:07,934
and then they would just say something like,

136
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:10,575
but what do I do with it?

137
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,069
And this is a circumstance where I think

138
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:22,651
We're missing an opportunity to provide feedback throughout this entire crafting process

139
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:27,912
Because the idea of crafting, you know, you're at the anvil, you know

140
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:33,153
Or at the spinning wheel or something and you're doing something very physical. It sort of evokes this physical

141
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:35,773
this physical action

142
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,574
And you're not getting that feedback from the game itself

143
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,840
And so I think all of these questions that we got about,

144
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,301
what do I do have to do with feedback?

145
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,602
And so what I mean about feedback, one example is,

146
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:55,143
if you flip over this workshop to show that you've used it,

147
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,504
to demonstrate that this is actually part

148
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,905
of that chain of actions that constitute crafting.

149
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,523
We found that when we instructed people to track

150
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,766
the workshops that they used by turning the piece

151
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,269
a little bit or somehow physically denoting it,

152
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,932
people tended to understand the process much better.

153
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,498
Unfortunately, by the time we went to print,

154
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,700
we had kind of waffled back and forth

155
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,642
on whether we wanted to include any.

156
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:32,778
feedback mechanisms on these components, because the downside is that including this on the

157
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,181
flip side means a pretty serious reduction in design space.

158
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:42,107
It means that you can't actually have these kinds of pieces with different backsides.

159
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,350
The backsides can only be used for this particular purpose.

160
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:53,117
And factions that we released later in expansions actually did make use of the backsides in

161
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:53,637
other ways.

162
00:11:54,882 --> 00:12:00,305
in one regard it's good that we didn't include this flip side because we wouldn't have been

163
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:06,828
able to make those factions the way that we did but this was a trade-off. I really do think that

164
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:14,012
this sort of feedback is really important for learning and so it's important to be conscious of

165
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:20,556
what are all of the parts of this action chain that I'm trying to teach and how am I demonstrating

166
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:24,598
that actually physically manipulating pieces of the game.

167
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,712
And this is a great example of affordances.

168
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,715
And in case you don't know what affordances are, I'm just going to give you an example.

169
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,017
So we have this trash can here.

170
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,578
We have these three trash cans.

171
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:47,482
This trash can in the middle has a smaller hole to put things in, this circular cutout.

172
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:52,184
And basically what it's doing is it's just, it's very strongly suggesting that you should

173
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:53,685
put things that fit in there.

174
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:58,504
into that trash can, so bottles and cans rather than, you know,

175
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,506
crumpled up paper bags and things like that.

176
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,570
The reason it does that is it's just harder to put the wrong stuff in there.

177
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,374
And so this is an example of a restrictive affordance where the it's

178
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,395
actually restricting you from doing the wrong thing.

179
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:17,293
And this kind of affordance is used in board games.

180
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:20,534
This is an example from the game Scythe,

181
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,616
where the player boards actually use these cutouts.

182
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:31,578
There are these double layer player boards with cutouts that force you to put the correct components into

183
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:33,739
the right places on the player board.

184
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,081
And so it's using those physical restrictions to point you in the right direction.

185
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:47,400
Now for root, we don't actually use those kinds of physical affordances for reasons that I won't get into in this talk.

186
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:51,422
But what we do use are these things called affordance prompts.

187
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,023
This is kind of a made up phrase.

188
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:59,205
There's probably a more technical word out there that I'm not aware of, but this is the term that I'll use.

189
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:07,149
And so what I mean by affordance prompts are places where on the interface at the point of use.

190
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,496
manipulating a component, pulling off something,

191
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:16,338
is at that exact focal point where

192
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:18,719
you're pulling the piece off, the interface

193
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:20,119
instructs you to do something.

194
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,621
So in this situation, we have these workshops on this track.

195
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:28,703
And as you pull this one off, it's prompting you, hey,

196
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:30,324
score two victory points.

197
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,226
And this is generally a much more effective method

198
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:37,267
for prompting than, say, writing beneath.

199
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:44,001
the workshops track, hey, every time you remove a workshop from this track, score two points.

200
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:52,427
And the reason for that is that generally when people are focusing on something, their

201
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,368
focal range is actually very limited.

202
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:57,050
When a person is focusing on a particular point...

203
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,722
the amount, the angle, the number of degrees at which they actually can focus on something

204
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:07,343
is very, very limited.

205
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:12,205
You almost lose sight of almost everything else around a very small focal point.

206
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:16,866
And so if you really want to get something across, you need to put it at the point of

207
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:17,187
use.

208
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:21,708
But there is a problem here.

209
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:25,089
And the problem is false props.

210
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,270
So...

211
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:33,731
when you're pulling these workshops off the track, you're being prompted to score two victory points.

212
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:42,398
And so that leads to the follow-up question of, okay, well, when I put the workshops back on the

213
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:51,985
track, does that mean that I lose two points? And there's actually nothing in there's no intuitive

214
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,407
signpost for why that wouldn't happen.

215
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:01,651
And so a decent number of people, when they come and learn the game,

216
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:07,496
actually do assume that you lose points when you put these pieces back on those tracks

217
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,397
with the prompts to score.

218
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,482
Even though we don't explicitly say that you lose points anywhere,

219
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:20,326
and even though it would basically be impossible for you to ever win the game if it were true.

220
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:27,783
but it's still on us to make sure that people aren't getting the wrong ideas from these prompts.

221
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:37,366
So, you know, a lot of people thought that you did actually lose points, and so in later

222
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:42,888
printings we made explicit reference to the fact that these prompts don't work in the other

223
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:48,029
direction, because we did find upon release that a lot of people were thinking that they did work

224
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,030
in both directions. So these prompts are very powerful.

225
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,196
but they can also be pretty dangerous.

226
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:59,259
So I'm going to give you a little bit more,

227
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,740
another example of false prompts.

228
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,302
This is a situation where we did actually figure out

229
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:09,383
that these false prompts were happening before release, so that's good.

230
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:15,606
So this faction is the Corvid Conspiracy.

231
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:20,048
It's a faction that we released in the Underworld expansion

232
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,628
a year and change ago.

233
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:28,914
They're this band of bomb-throwing crows and ravens and things like that.

234
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:35,439
And the point on their faction board that I want to point you to is this crafted items

235
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,841
box in the top right corner.

236
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:47,149
And so one thing that happened during development was it was kind of running low on space.

237
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:54,355
And so, you know, I did the thing that any developer under the gun does, which is just

238
00:17:54,415 --> 00:18:01,099
to squish things down so you can fit everything, thinking that it just wouldn't be a problem.

239
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,224
But what we found in usability testing, the first day of usability testing, somebody came

240
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:13,187
in and, you know, they put some items in this crafted items box.

241
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:20,892
And they looked at it and they noticed that it was like pretty much exactly the perfect size to fit three items.

242
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:26,315
And they asked, so it only holds three items, right?

243
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,417
This box is smaller than the others.

244
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:30,938
So that must mean something, right?

245
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:41,445
And you know, when something like this happens, this is kind of my expression that I try to suppress as much as possible, but it's my internal expression, at least.

246
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:46,387
because this is completely unexpected.

247
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,990
And it's actually the reason why usability testing is

248
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,592
so important is because developers

249
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,693
make changes all the time.

250
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:59,578
And there are very subtle implications of things

251
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:03,782
that players are very apt to pick up on in cases

252
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:04,823
where developers aren't.

253
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:10,147
And you can miss these wacky things.

254
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:11,969
And this

255
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,424
you know, persisted on the next day.

256
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,386
One person having a problem can sometimes be a fluke,

257
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,328
but multiple people having the same problem becomes a pattern.

258
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,970
And so the next day, sure enough, people came in

259
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,251
and everyone was asking.

260
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:31,692
So it only holds three, right?

261
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,912
You know, the box is smaller.

262
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:38,414
And so I want to really drive home this point that subtle differences

263
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,936
create. The question.

264
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:43,542
Well, it's different.

265
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,423
How is it different?

266
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,783
What are the implications of it being different?

267
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:51,384
There's almost no innocent difference out there.

268
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:53,805
And so you have to watch out for these.

269
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:56,145
So this is another false prompt.

270
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,526
The crafted items box is indeed smaller,

271
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,327
and it is indeed sized for these items in such a way.

272
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,668
And even though we didn't say anywhere

273
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,728
that there was an item restriction,

274
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,989
the physicality of this part of the interface suggested it.

275
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:12,729
And so you really need to watch out for this.

276
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,250
And so all of this has a lot to do with thinking about context.

277
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,910
And so I want to talk a little bit more about context.

278
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,571
So this is a famous optical illusion.

279
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,172
It's the duck-rabbit illusion.

280
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,992
So, you know, depending upon where you're at,

281
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,152
you might see a duck, you might see a rabbit.

282
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:40,033
And this is an example of what's called concept unsteadiness.

283
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,803
you know, basically where the same thing can have multiple meanings depending upon your perception.

284
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:54,828
And so an optical illusion is one example of concept unsteadiness, but this applies broadly

285
00:20:54,868 --> 00:21:00,772
throughout many different fields. You know, it can apply to just concepts, to just ideas.

286
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,294
It doesn't require a specific, you know, sense.

287
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:10,934
And a very fun thing about this optical illusion

288
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,575
that I only learned about a few years ago

289
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:20,996
was just how context dependent this illusion was.

290
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,617
So context matters in this illusion

291
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:28,518
to the point where researchers compared

292
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:32,119
how often people thought this was a rabbit

293
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,199
versus a duck at different times of year.

294
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:41,627
And what they found was near Easter, people thought it was a rabbit more than at other times of year.

295
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:49,532
Now, the effect is not extremely strong. It wasn't like 100% of people were saying that this was a rabbit.

296
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:58,597
But there was a small noticeable effect. And so it being near Easter is just a piece of context

297
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:04,020
that was informing the way that people were seeing this image. Rabbits were on the mind.

298
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,026
so people are a little bit more likely to see a rabbit.

299
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:16,033
And so I would like to talk about how context applies

300
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,455
to reading our player boards.

301
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,559
So here I'm showing a very early version of the player

302
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,740
board for one of our factions.

303
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:31,044
And I'd like to point out a specific part of the player

304
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,486
board, which is the scoring victory points pane.

305
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:37,988
So the idea behind this in development

306
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:43,992
was that we wanted to basically give a reminder to people.

307
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:47,634
If they ever forgot, like, oh, how do I score victory points

308
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:48,495
as this faction?

309
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:52,277
We wanted a little reference to be available to them

310
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,398
in a convenient place.

311
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,642
But one thing that we noticed during usability testing

312
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:00,342
was that.

313
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:08,481
People would look at this and wonder, well, is this a reminder or is it a prompt?

314
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:16,724
And what I mean by is it a prompt is, does this victory point gain stack with other places

315
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:18,605
where it's telling me to score victory points?

316
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:25,768
So if I have a card that says, okay, I craft an item and I get a victory point, do I also

317
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:28,529
apply this victory point from this pane?

318
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:30,369
So do I score two victory points?

319
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,570
Do I score one victory point?

320
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:39,403
And so, very problematically, a lot of people actually thought that this was a prompt.

321
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:47,270
And this sometimes pretty wildly changed the number of victory points that people were

322
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:50,233
scoring, which is very dangerous.

323
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:54,137
It means that people are really not playing the game as intended.

324
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,236
So this was a dangerous misconception that people thought that this stacked

325
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:03,258
with other places where we were prompting people to score victory points.

326
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,660
And there's a pretty simple explanation for why

327
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,301
people thought that this was a prompt rather than a reminder.

328
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:18,404
And that's because everything else on the board was a prompt.

329
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,605
You know, there was basically no other information

330
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,146
that served the purpose that this.

331
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:30,839
this this reminder did and so people took all of that context and they very

332
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,084
rightly applied it to this part of the board as well and so what we did was we

333
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:42,769
got rid of that information on the player board and we put it on a card we

334
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:48,574
put it on a card called an overview card and you know these cards just basically

335
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:52,537
contain a short overview of that faction

336
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:58,339
And so we didn't change anything about the fact that we were presenting this information,

337
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,600
but we put it in a completely different context.

338
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:07,022
And all of this context screams, this is a reminder.

339
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:11,104
There's nothing here that should be interpreted as stacking with other stuff.

340
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:14,545
This is just giving you a broad overview of this faction.

341
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:17,906
You're getting this card, other people are getting this card.

342
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,547
Everything about it is screaming, this is a reminder.

343
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,108
And once we did this...

344
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,520
Nobody thought that it stacked anymore.

345
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,163
So this is an example of a place where context really, really matters in people interpreting your information.

346
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:33,825
It is not enough to use the right words.

347
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:37,807
You have to also put those words in the right context for them to be useful.

348
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:44,689
And so the next part of this context discussion

349
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,669
I would like to talk about,

350
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,612
I'd like to focus on the broader context

351
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:54,314
of product design, bringing together audiences,

352
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,596
and things of that nature.

353
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:04,816
So we designed Root to bring in audiences from different parts of the board gaming landscape.

354
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:10,141
You know, we wanted a game that would appeal to people who are very experienced in war games and

355
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:16,226
direct conflict games, and we wanted to bring in wider audiences who were curious about the genre

356
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:21,890
or just didn't really know much of anything at all and were attracted to these cute little creatures.

357
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:31,617
And so whenever you're bringing together many different audiences, you need to make sure that you include materials that are appropriate for them.

358
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,521
And so we did this. We basically included three things in our first printing.

359
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:42,924
We included the Law of Root, which is a rules reference document.

360
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:48,867
The Learning to Play Guide, which is a smaller, more friendly,

361
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,689
example-laden rulebook.

362
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:56,197
And then we have a two-term walkthrough sheet

363
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:59,619
that basically lets people jump into the game

364
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,399
without reading too many of the rules.

365
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,921
And so the first thing that I want to talk about

366
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:07,602
is the Law of Root, this rules reference document.

367
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:12,245
And the reason for that is because it's very polarizing,

368
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,986
or at least was very polarizing upon release.

369
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,688
And the reason for this was,

370
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,209
it is, as I mentioned, written...

371
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,129
in the style of wargaming rulebooks.

372
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,489
It is a very literal

373
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:27,889
rulebook.

374
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,190
It has very few pictures

375
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,571
and it is very highly structured in a way that is not the same as many traditional

376
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,051
board game rulebooks.

377
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:44,212
And the law of root actually

378
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:48,893
caused quite a few flame wars and

379
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,609
really angry discussions on BoardGameGeek,

380
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,751
a popular board game discussion site,

381
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,673
to the point where I had to shut down

382
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,074
some of these conversations

383
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,415
because they were just getting too heated.

384
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:06,257
Because basically what happened was

385
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:09,739
people kind of sorted themselves into two camps.

386
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,923
We have one camp that thought that this rule book was great,

387
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,104
that it read well,

388
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:24,863
the rules were clear. And then you had another group that thought the opposite,

389
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:35,769
that just really, really did not like it. And I want to point specifically to the top

390
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:40,131
comment here, which says, there are a number of problems with the law of root,

391
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:43,133
not least of which is the need to read it completely literally.

392
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:49,928
So I think that this really gets at the crux of the problem,

393
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:53,690
which is we have these different audiences coming in

394
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:59,954
and one of them basically understands this tradition

395
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:02,335
of rule book writing and that is very literal

396
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:06,338
and one of them is not familiar with it.

397
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,360
And that is absolutely not a problem with that audience.

398
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,421
It is a problem with how the rule book is written

399
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,242
and how we present it to the audience.

400
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:20,179
to the middle statement here, you know, also gets at the crux of it.

401
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,381
This is a conflict simulation or war game rule book, not a board game one.

402
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,421
That's the problem.

403
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:29,542
Not to judge, I think I understand.

404
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:36,264
So that's that's kind of the core of a lot of of the critiques of this rulebook

405
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:42,686
is that it is not written in a style that is useful for much of the audience.

406
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:47,254
And so these flame wars, these heated discussions,

407
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,534
came from two audiences coming together

408
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,995
from different perspectives

409
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,656
and not really being able to get out of their own fishbowl.

410
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:01,177
You know, the famous David Foster Wallace speech

411
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:04,377
about two fish swimming along,

412
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,818
and the third fish swims by and says,

413
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,098
hey, how's it going?

414
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:09,698
How's the water today?

415
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,519
And then the first two fish say, what water?

416
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,684
So, you know, this is an example of two very different,

417
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,846
very different groups of people

418
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:20,127
coming from different traditions.

419
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,891
And so one way that I like to think about this

420
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:27,014
is in the framework of decoupling norms

421
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,496
and contextualizing norms.

422
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:32,220
You know, I referenced these critiques

423
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,042
that talked about literalness before.

424
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,393
and how some audiences are very used to pure literalness and some aren't.

425
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:50,560
And so these decoupling norms are kind of reading the letter of the law as the letter of the law without bringing in too many outside experiences.

426
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,703
Whereas another group is bringing in contextualizing norms.

427
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:58,585
They're taking in ideas from other board games they've played

428
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:01,847
and they're applying it to this game.

429
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,348
And as I said before,

430
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:06,090
neither of these styles of reading are wrong,

431
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,893
but what we failed to do is to properly introduce people

432
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:13,255
who are more familiar with contextualizing norms

433
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,156
to the very literal way

434
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,097
that the rules reference is written in.

435
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:26,402
Because wargame rulebooks are written in a very particular style that we that we duplicated

436
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:32,628
This is an example of one from a game called Cuba Libre. It's a very popular modern war game

437
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:38,112
And you can see it's very dry almost car manual like few pictures

438
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:43,997
itemized numbered rules the only picture on this page actually is just this

439
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:49,707
joke about airstrikes and reprisals in Brutal Warfare.

440
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:53,429
So, you know, this is the kind of tradition that we're working in

441
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,310
in terms of how dry the rulebook is.

442
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:04,494
And so what we do in later printings is we actually we write it up front.

443
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:10,436
We talk about how to read this document.

444
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:14,598
You know, we don't leave it to chance.

445
00:32:16,004 --> 00:32:20,769
by just hoping that people understand the traditions of a document like this.

446
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,475
And we actually tell people, for example, to follow the literal word.

447
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:32,240
It's important to enculturate people into how the document is written.

448
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:39,187
And so this was a failure of ours that we hope to solve in later printings.

449
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:45,082
When you bring in different audiences and you use, you draw from different traditions,

450
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:49,165
you need to make sure that you are telling people that you're doing that.

451
00:32:50,105 --> 00:32:54,088
So that's an important aspect of making games that bring in different audiences.

452
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:02,974
The other thing that I would like to touch on is the walkthrough. So we included this two-page,

453
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:06,896
this double-sided walkthrough sheet in the first printing of the game.

454
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:10,407
which basically just kind of it walked you through your turns.

455
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:13,990
You know, it said, OK, do this, do this, do this.

456
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,113
And it basically just showed you how your faction worked.

457
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:24,217
And similar to the law of root, a lot of people really like this.

458
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,460
But there was another group of people who just really did not like it.

459
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,623
And again, we fell prey to the context problem.

460
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:37,660
because almost universally the people who said that they didn't like it said,

461
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,262
OK, I get what I'm doing, but I don't understand why I'm doing it.

462
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:47,785
And so there's a large audience of people who really needed a lot more,

463
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:53,868
a lot more effort on our foot put into context for why you're doing things.

464
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,270
Strategic reasoning, how these things hook into other systems.

465
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:06,707
And so in later printings, we actually expanded this walkthrough into a little chat book called Walking Through Roots.

466
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:14,951
And so in this, we still do this step by step, you know, walking through, OK, you do this, you do this, you do this.

467
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:26,378
But in between a lot of these steps, we describe how all of these things hook together, why you're doing this, what implications it has.

468
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:33,138
And so we give a lot more context into why people are doing this, and people just really love this.

469
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:42,660
And so I really cannot stress enough how context, in all of its forms, is just really, really important in writing rules effectively.

470
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,382
And one publisher that I think that does this really well in the video game space now is Paradox.

471
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:57,919
the creators of Crusader Kings and Europe Year of Assalus and games like this.

472
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,469
I must admit that when I got into one of the earlier Crusader Kings games,

473
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:06,712
I just felt way and way over my head.

474
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:13,059
Got really confused, but the latest release, Crusader Kings 3, was just so much better

475
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:15,320
at doing this than the previous releases.

476
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,962
And it's because they're doing this wonderful job of creating wikis, YouTube videos, how-to

477
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,803
plays, Discord chats.

478
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:32,006
They're just really creating this thickly interwoven, context-heavy mesh of learning

479
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,606
materials.

480
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:37,769
I think Root does a better job of emulating now.

481
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:41,832
And I think that we can really, really...

482
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:46,635
We can increase the intricateness of the games that we're creating

483
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:50,297
and introducing to wider audiences by creating these thick,

484
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,261
variable, context-rich learning materials.

485
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:03,538
And so the last thing that I want to talk about a little bit is cognitive load.

486
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:10,841
So Root is a pretty intricate game, and it requires a lot of thinking.

487
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:13,462
The cognitive load to learn this game is pretty high.

488
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:17,064
All of the factions work in pretty different ways.

489
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:25,068
They share some common basic actions, but they're all remixed in tons of different ways.

490
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:27,629
The F-actions score points in different ways.

491
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,823
So learning your own faction and learning other factions can be somewhat taxing.

492
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:37,465
And so we needed to figure out a way to onboard people

493
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:40,687
in a way that reduced the cognitive load as much as possible.

494
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:46,330
And so the first way that we tried this was using synchronous teaching.

495
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,272
So I talked before about these overview cards,

496
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,594
which are these, you know, basic descriptions of the factions in the game.

497
00:36:55,978 --> 00:37:01,622
And so the idea behind this teaching strategy was we would give these overview cards to

498
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:04,684
their respective factions, you know, we would give the cat card to the cat.

499
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:10,468
And we would basically instruct people to, you know, play around, you know, just kind

500
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:11,829
of get your bearings for a round.

501
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,793
And then at the end of that first round, you should basically look at your overview card,

502
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:21,756
and you should kind of introduce yourself to the other players.

503
00:37:22,697 --> 00:37:24,778
You know, you should say, Hey, I'm the cats.

504
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:27,159
you know, here's what I'm about.

505
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:29,821
And then the bird player can say, OK, I'm

506
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,022
like learning what you're about.

507
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,823
I don't like you.

508
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:35,584
Here's how I can fight you, things like that.

509
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,106
And that was the ideal, right?

510
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,508
But we quickly found out that this teaching strategy was just

511
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:47,571
not going to work because we went out to some bars.

512
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:52,154
And I would highly recommend, if you ever do usability work,

513
00:37:52,294 --> 00:37:54,115
to test your games in bars.

514
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,323
And the reason for that is it's often a pretty bad atmosphere to

515
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:07,729
Hear each other in to see each other in and just generally to learn games in it's it's almost like a stress test for your game

516
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,093
And so we would go to the the bar and try teaching using this style

517
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:19,256
and the first problem as you might imagine is that

518
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:23,840
It's hard for some people to hear this important information

519
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:30,346
you know, not everyone is ready to be the teacher in this

520
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:33,027
circumstance, and they might not speak loud enough, you know,

521
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,068
they might not be prepared for it. And so you know, they might

522
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:39,850
not talk loud enough or with enough projection, or they might

523
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,452
be confused and stumbling over the words that are on the card.

524
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,994
And so it just makes it difficult to learn when you're

525
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,174
kind of put on the spot like that.

526
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:54,010
But the other problem, and probably the more important problem,

527
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,952
is that a lot of the times players just weren't ready to learn.

528
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:02,674
You know, you could have somebody who's introducing their faction the best that they can,

529
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:08,357
but everyone else at the table might just still be busy internalizing their own faction.

530
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:11,659
I mentioned that Root is a very asymmetric game.

531
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,841
All of the factions work in different ways.

532
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,501
And so if somebody's not ready...

533
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,611
They're just going to gloss over it.

534
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:21,493
It's not actually going to do any good if somebody is describing their faction

535
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:22,953
because they are not prepared.

536
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:28,956
And so between these problems, you're losing out on most of the teaching.

537
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:32,357
It's practically useless, to be honest.

538
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:37,579
And so for Root, the strategy that we settled on

539
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,580
was an asynchronous teaching strategy.

540
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:46,044
where instead of one player getting their card for their own faction and teaching other people,

541
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:50,166
we basically decided to give the faction cards to everyone.

542
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:58,330
So, on their own time, whenever they feel comfortable with learning about other factions in more depth,

543
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,311
they can reference this card.

544
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:05,174
So, this accounts for the fact that people are learning at different rates,

545
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,075
and are learning in different ways.

546
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:11,833
and will be ready to learn about the other factions on different schedules.

547
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:15,315
So an asynchronous teaching strategy is much more,

548
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:21,476
it's much more able to teach people in different circumstances.

549
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:27,378
It's much more reliable and resilient to situations that aren't ideal for teaching,

550
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:30,039
and just to people who learn differently.

551
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,173
And that's pretty much where I'm going to end it.

552
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:40,498
I hope that this has given you a little bit of a look into usability and user experience

553
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:45,824
in board games, and I'm excited to answer your questions.

554
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,105
So thanks so much.
