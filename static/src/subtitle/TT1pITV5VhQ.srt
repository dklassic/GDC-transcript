00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:08,495
Hi, I'm Sho Iwamoto, audio programmer at Square Enix.

2
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:13,616
In my GDC lecture, Epic and Interactive Music in Final Fantasy XV,

3
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:18,357
I'd like to show our tools and techniques to make Final Fantasy music interactive.

4
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:24,218
Horizontal re-sequencing in boss battles, vertical remixing in chocobos, and so on.

5
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:29,699
Everything we challenge to make them interactive while remaining their epic melodies.

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,180
Wait for the music, or sink to the game?

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,715
You'll see our approach in this session.
