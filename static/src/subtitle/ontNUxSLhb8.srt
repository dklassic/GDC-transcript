00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:08,619
Welcome, my talk is called Storytelling with Verbs,

2
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,360
Integrating Gameplay and Narrative.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,602
I also like to refer to it as why narrative designers

4
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:15,323
and game designers should be best friends,

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:16,144
because we should be.

6
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,847
So before I get into what that actually is,

7
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:22,188
hello, I'm Caitlin Tremblay.

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,449
Some of you may know me.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,631
I'm a writer, which kind of looks like this.

10
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,239
I've worked on a variety of games in a bunch of different genres,

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,580
including mobile, ARGs, escape rooms, indie, and AAA.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,901
I was the lead writer on A Mortician's Tale,

13
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,702
and I was a team lead narrative designer at Ubisoft Toronto.

14
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,863
Currently, though, I'm a writer and narrative designer at Cappy Games.

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:49,566
So if you know me, you know I have one very specific windmill that I like to tilt at.

16
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:50,706
And it is that.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,111
It's that I fundamentally believe narrative design is game design.

18
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,372
In the same way that we have specialized subsets of game design,

19
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,213
like combat design, weapon design, or system design,

20
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,494
I approach narrative design like game design,

21
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:05,474
but focused on how we're telling story.

22
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,636
Narrative design is designing stories from the building blocks of gameplay.

23
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,857
That's because at its core, interactive storytelling

24
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,938
is a combination of actions or interactions and narrative.

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,831
For me, you can't begin to tell your interactive story

26
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,313
if you don't know what your player is going to be doing.

27
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:27,114
What the player does directly determines

28
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:28,495
how we can tell the story.

29
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,916
And what your player does is usually determined

30
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,997
by your base mechanics, actions, or verbs,

31
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,058
you know, the things that you're asking your player to do.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,421
So when starting to plan what a quest should be

33
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,943
or what kind of story to tell in a particular kind of game,

34
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,984
I always ask first, what is the player doing?

35
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,726
Is the player fighting?

36
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:56,028
How? With magic, with weapons. Are they defending? What are they defending? Are they running? What

37
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:02,272
are they running from? Or what are they running to? Are they hacking? Are they hacking individually

38
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:08,477
or collaboratively? Because, yeah, that changes things. Or are they just talking? Or, you know,

39
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:09,978
are they shooting things?

40
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:14,867
Each of these, while all in service of some kind of conflict, carry different meanings

41
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:15,407
for players.

42
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:19,471
Even more passive verbs, like talking, imply something about a story.

43
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:27,557
And that's because all gameplay actions imply how the character you're controlling behaves.

44
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,459
They also tell us the rules of the world.

45
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:33,622
A world where guns exist and where characters are more willing to use them

46
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,223
is a very different world where characters fight with sticks

47
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:37,984
or where monkeys fight with knives.

48
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:43,207
It has different rules, different stakes, and it's a very different world

49
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,988
and the way it shows how the characters respond to violence.

50
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:50,630
So like I said, all gameplay verbs imply how that character behaves in the world

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,531
because they dictate what that character does.

52
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:55,952
Gameplay isn't maybe always giving us strict plot,

53
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,573
but it is giving us these early building blocks of character,

54
00:02:58,653 --> 00:02:59,914
world logic, and story.

55
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,254
And gameplay can contribute to storytelling

56
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:06,154
because gameplay mechanics are story.

57
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,175
In the same way we plan major beats of a story through acts,

58
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,676
those beats are also composed of buckets of actions

59
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:13,036
we're asking the player to perform.

60
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:16,357
And what the player does, the character often does as well,

61
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:18,578
resulting in an inherent characterization

62
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:19,698
of the playable character.

63
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,479
So in practice, I find there are two helpful ways

64
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:25,199
of looking at this.

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,140
There's the literal story implied by the game mechanics.

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,480
And by this I mean it's the plot, the theme,

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,340
the characterizations, all that kind of stuff.

68
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,241
And then there's the emotional arc

69
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:37,501
generated by the game mechanics.

70
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:39,582
And so this is kind of like the arc of emotions,

71
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,002
the emotional journey, all that kind of player-centric stuff.

72
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,543
So the first one is easier to talk about, I find.

73
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,903
So for this, let's talk about Assassin's Creed.

74
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,364
Assassin's Creed is a game about stealthily assassinating

75
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,124
targets, and the story that is being told

76
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,185
is one of an assassin.

77
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,545
That makes a lot of sense.

78
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,165
So let's look at it this way.

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,460
Here are the actions.

80
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,642
You talk to a person who needs somebody killed.

81
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,124
You kill the target.

82
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,446
Then you will be rewarded for doing so with money.

83
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,248
This sets up an immediate story that we can understand.

84
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,430
You are an assassin.

85
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,652
Even if we never told you Cassandra was an assassin,

86
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,033
the gameplay tells you she is.

87
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,775
OK, so with this, we have the basic foundations

88
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,757
for a story that is supported by and echoed

89
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,637
in the gameplay mechanics.

90
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,120
How does the story change on what other actions we ask the player to do?

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,381
What if we ask the player to kill with a blade versus something like a gun

92
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,682
versus something like a gun that is also a blade?

93
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:41,123
What if this was this?

94
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:46,244
Asking your player to use a sword or a knife versus a gun

95
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:49,505
implies two potentially different world states

96
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:52,226
and how this character operates in both those versions of the world.

97
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,287
And I'm not even just talking about setting.

98
00:04:56,582 --> 00:05:00,646
Players will bring their own perspectives and thoughts on these weapons and what they mean about the world they're in.

99
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:06,611
A character who kills with a sword is already going to be set up differently in your player's mind than a character who kills with a gun,

100
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,954
even if we haven't even told them anything about story or setting yet.

101
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,157
So these are the bones of the story.

102
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:19,522
Once we know the implications we're bringing to our game, then we can write story and character on top of that.

103
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,602
So that's one way mechanics tell stories.

104
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:24,523
The second is still storytelling,

105
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,363
but it's not a traditionally designed story

106
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:27,104
in the same sense.

107
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,406
And I also want to preface that this next example isn't my own.

108
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,187
It's one that I heard from Emily Short, and she's wicked smart,

109
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,748
and so I wanted to share it with everybody here.

110
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:37,809
Think of Tetris.

111
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,790
As you're playing, you're rotating pieces,

112
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,271
setting up scenarios, and waiting for the right piece

113
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,151
to complete your lines.

114
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,472
As you're doing this, you're experiencing

115
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,994
an emotional range that is telling your player's story.

116
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,203
So you might start off pretty calm, and you still are kind of calm.

117
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,623
Then you get excited, and then you get a little anxious,

118
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,924
and then you get even more anxious as your blocks are growing

119
00:05:57,964 --> 00:06:00,125
and you haven't received the notorious straight piece yet.

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,326
And then you get frustrated when you fail to turn it properly in time.

121
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,748
And then finally, you get the straight piece, you slide it over, it drops,

122
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,349
everything disappears, you feel catharsis in that moment.

123
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:11,930
And then you can return to your previous calm state.

124
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,191
But now with an added layer of pride, relief, tension,

125
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,772
some kind of emotion layered on top.

126
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:18,152
That's a story.

127
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,569
It's emergent and it's player driven, but it's still a story.

128
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,289
So while you're basically only doing a set of actions,

129
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,810
rotate, drop, clear, there is a clear emotional arc

130
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,011
that feels like a story.

131
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,091
There's conflict.

132
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,071
There's victory.

133
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:33,192
There's defeat.

134
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,192
And there are mappable tropes over top of this,

135
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,953
such as an underdog win, or total domination,

136
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,013
or undefeated champ.

137
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,994
So for Tetris, let's look at it this way.

138
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,555
Anticipation leads to tension.

139
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,566
which leads to catharsis, which, guess what?

140
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:52,427
That's a story.

141
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,668
It's an emotional story.

142
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:53,728
OK.

143
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,094
But for now, I'm less concerned with the emotional storytelling

144
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,716
for this talk as I am with the literal storytelling associated

145
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,298
with game design, because that's one

146
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:06,780
we can kind of more concretely and traditionally design for

147
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,842
in a more traditional storytelling sense.

148
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:12,765
So let's go back to our initial question.

149
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,206
What is the player doing?

150
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,555
Let's look at defend purely as an example

151
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,997
because I think it contains some really neat story ideas.

152
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,520
Certain actions like defend carry a very different meaning

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,981
to players than verbs like attack.

154
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,745
Even if the player defending looks a lot like attacking,

155
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:32,226
they still mean something different.

156
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,928
That meaning is where we find the kernel of story.

157
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,970
Defend often invokes a sense of protection,

158
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,993
whereas attack can, but more often implies aggression.

159
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:48,267
Defending your home is a very different story than attacking somebody else's home even without getting into explicit character motivations

160
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:53,751
So on one dev team we wanted a mechanic that was essentially about defeating waves of enemies

161
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,953
We kept calling it defend even though that wasn't the name of the mechanic

162
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,314
It was called something else entirely and to be honest, I don't remember

163
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:01,275
It's a sign

164
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,131
And it's because us as developers, defeating ways of enemies inherently felt like we were

165
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:10,712
defending something, and we kept getting confused because whenever we said defend, the next

166
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,453
question was always, okay, so what are we defending?

167
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,273
And we just didn't have an answer sometimes.

168
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,534
So the beat more often than not felt awkward.

169
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:22,716
We reevaluated the mechanic in light of this base story we felt like it was telling to

170
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:26,136
make it more aligned and therefore clearer to us as developers and to our players.

171
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:31,174
So if you haven't played it, Loud on Planet X is a game I worked on

172
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,936
where you play as musicians defending your stage from attacking aliens.

173
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:36,779
It's about protecting yourself in a hostile place.

174
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,841
As the player, you didn't choose to go to this new planet.

175
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,963
You were forcibly taken there by the aliens.

176
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,846
So the musicians are defending themselves against the attacking aliens,

177
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:49,368
who in turn are just being dicks and attacking you because that's what they do.

178
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,973
So with defend, sure, you can be defending by attacking, like the musicians in Loud,

179
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,655
but your primary motivation is to survive, not kill.

180
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:02,719
Compare this to the aliens in Loud who are just attacking without any sort of defense motivation at all.

181
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,682
For dev teams, and for me in particular, it's important to figure out what emotional response

182
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:13,023
you want the player to have in that moment. Do you want the player to feel aggressive?

183
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:17,045
Or do you want them to feel like they need to protect something, be it themselves, a place, an idea?

184
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,707
Answering those questions will help determine what the mechanics should actually be,

185
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,868
especially if members of your team disagree.

186
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,662
So for me, we answered those questions in part by looking at what the emotional response we wanted to come out of the experience was,

187
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,424
and everything kind of fell into place after that.

188
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:35,585
So a quick disclaimer.

189
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:41,029
If I were to say something like, defend is more often about protection and attack is more often about aggression,

190
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,791
this doesn't mean this is the only thing those two words and verbs can ever mean.

191
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:47,980
But what I'm trying to get at is that they do mean something

192
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,660
to your players.

193
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,361
And it's important to try and recognize

194
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,523
what that something is in order to get

195
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:54,124
the best fit between the mechanics

196
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,144
and the story of your game.

197
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:58,046
And not even just in a ludonarrative dissonance sense,

198
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,188
but just to get the best possible fit between player

199
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,008
actions and story.

200
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,070
Essentially, players will bring their own understanding

201
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,631
of what certain words mean to the game.

202
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,472
And that, in turn, will influence

203
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,954
the base kind of story the players are already being told.

204
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:12,195
OK.

205
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,809
So what about when you let your players decide

206
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:15,809
which type of action to take?

207
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:18,269
Letting your player choose between two actions

208
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,150
changes character in really neat ways

209
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,190
that we can help guide as designers.

210
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,731
So let's look at Corvo from Dishonored.

211
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,091
So Corvo can either kill lots of people,

212
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,612
or kill no people, or kill some people,

213
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,252
you know, if Corvo's being kind of non-committal

214
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:32,832
about the whole thing.

215
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,492
Dishonored's chaos system creates

216
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,593
two entirely different stories of who Corvo is,

217
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,653
or just as importantly, who Corvo feels like to the player.

218
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,830
One could be a more shadowy human, more calculated, a bit slower to act.

219
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,511
The other is maybe more brazen, aggressive, perhaps more impatient.

220
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:53,352
Because not killing when given the chance implies something about characterization.

221
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:57,533
So when players choose their route, they're choosing a bit of who Corvo is as well.

222
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:03,014
Dishonor would be a very different game, and Corvo would be an entirely different character

223
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:06,615
if the choices were between, say, something like computer hacking and killing,

224
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,896
or befriending and killing.

225
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,094
Even if the plot was the literal exact same,

226
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:14,815
Corvo's characterization changes, either implicitly

227
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:17,076
or explicitly, if he kills or if he doesn't.

228
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,597
Because what Corvo is doing is determining

229
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:20,697
who he actually is.

230
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:25,399
So when setting up two different play styles for your player

231
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,000
to use, think about what the choices say about the character

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,221
and how the character is changed in both contexts.

233
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,402
The changing context can be really

234
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,743
powerful for characterization and emotional engagement,

235
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:37,063
and even shape the nature of the world your character is in.

236
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,991
A renegade femship positions authority, power, and heroics very differently

237
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,712
from a fully paragon femship

238
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,953
because how they enforce their power in the world.

239
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,894
It's these basic gameplay blocks that set the foundation

240
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,175
for us to tell the story and write characters and plot

241
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,316
that feels good to the player.

242
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:56,736
It feels good, and it makes sense.

243
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:00,438
And it's important to consider

244
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,579
because gameplay is going to be part of the storytelling experience,

245
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,839
whether we want it to or not.

246
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:05,620
It just is.

247
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,998
So now I want to talk a little bit more in depth

248
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:12,559
about some personal examples I've worked on

249
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,319
in order to kind of show how I put this thinking

250
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,419
into practice personally.

251
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,680
All right, so let's talk about talking.

252
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,981
I've written and designed a bunch of interactive fiction

253
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,482
and interactive fiction often relies on talking

254
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:25,382
as its main mechanic.

255
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,283
In most games, talking is more than just conversing

256
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:30,123
to gain information or to advance the plot.

257
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,284
The player then often has the potential

258
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:33,724
to act upon the information given.

259
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,025
So what are the kind of actions we can give here?

260
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,216
With that question in mind, for one game,

261
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,498
I designed an entire secret system

262
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,940
where players could receive secrets from other characters.

263
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,862
If the player then chose to share that secret,

264
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,623
then the relationship with that character would change.

265
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:50,744
Negatively, obviously.

266
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,067
This secret system added an extra dynamic

267
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,708
to building or destroying friendships

268
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:57,189
in a game about trying to fit in.

269
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:02,557
I focus on the fact that talking has reciprocal repercussions.

270
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,279
Basically, people are going to respond to what you say to them.

271
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,800
That's kind of what talking is.

272
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,585
So using talking as a way to create combat-like conflict

273
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,645
made a lot of sense to me.

274
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,567
So if I wanted to use conversation as conflict,

275
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,568
I figured there were three important facets of that.

276
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:21,930
Conversations are reciprocal.

277
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,411
There will be consequences.

278
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,233
Conversations can build or destroy friendships.

279
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,646
And conversations already have all this inherent drama

280
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:29,986
to them.

281
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,928
Considering these points as my ways

282
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:34,609
into building conversations as conflict

283
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,130
led me to the whole secret system.

284
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,492
Ultimately, I was curious about what kind of drama

285
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,014
already exists in the act of talking

286
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,975
and making the act of talking with somebody even more

287
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,156
dynamic and potentially full of conflict

288
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,238
that serves a purpose beyond just plot progression.

289
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:49,439
Because plot progression can be dramatic,

290
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,981
but nothing is more dramatic than pre-teen drama.

291
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:56,284
So then, what about listening?

292
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,475
Listening feels similar to talking in a lot of ways,

293
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,196
and that's a typical part of a conversation.

294
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,537
But for a Martician's Tale, we use listening a bit differently.

295
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,797
During the funeral portion of the game,

296
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,818
you can only listen to mourners versus navigating a conversation tree.

297
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,379
Listening forces the player to take a back seat.

298
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,700
Focusing in on listening instead of talking gave us the space

299
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,860
to more fully explore the dynamic range of grief

300
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,301
and how grief manifests in people.

301
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:22,921
The player isn't driving or guiding the conversation

302
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,202
as they would in a conversation tree.

303
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,082
They're listening to learn, essentially.

304
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,252
So if I wanted to present listening as learning,

305
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:33,553
I thought about emphasizing mourner's experience,

306
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,414
not having best answers in a dialogue tree,

307
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,915
all which ended up preventing

308
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,716
any sort of gaming the system.

309
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,357
Rather than trying to win a conversation

310
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:44,677
by finding the best answers,

311
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:47,138
we focused on making the player listen to the mourner

312
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:49,479
in an effort to more fully convey

313
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,160
disparate emotional reactions to death.

314
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,781
So for me, I focused in on this idea

315
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,801
of listening as learning,

316
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,762
and the natural follow-up of that thinking

317
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,343
shaped how I wrote those bits of dialogue.

318
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,350
Okay, so now instead of talking about games

319
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,230
about destroying friendships and listening to mourners,

320
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:06,691
let's talk about cults.

321
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,752
I've been lucky enough to also work on escape rooms

322
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:09,833
and ARGs in my career.

323
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,313
I'm the little one in this picture.

324
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,735
Both escape rooms and ARGs focus on collaborative

325
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,035
puzzle solving or deciphering.

326
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,736
Puzzle solving or deciphering as an action

327
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:22,157
tends to require an extensive and detailed knowledge

328
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:25,859
of a very specific thing, like codes, languages, numbers,

329
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,619
all that kind of stuff.

330
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:31,307
So I will say, I learned so much about code breaking, encryption,

331
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,988
and other really smart, fancy number things

332
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:36,290
while working on these kind of games that I've obviously all forgotten.

333
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,452
I've also never felt dumber in my entire life

334
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,553
because there's just so much stuff to know in the world.

335
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:42,294
There's just so much stuff.

336
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,497
But luckily for people like me, ARGs and escape rooms

337
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:49,299
often capitalize on multiple players possessing the knowledge.

338
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,421
And importantly, for gameplay purposes,

339
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,343
players like to share information with their team members or fellow players.

340
00:15:56,232 --> 00:16:00,374
ARGs and escape rooms are so often successful because they don't rely on one person knowing

341
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:04,016
everything, but rather because multiple people will know multiple things and then share that

342
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:04,496
knowledge.

343
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:08,178
Effectively, everyone gets to be part of the big brain that solves the puzzle and wins

344
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:08,538
the day.

345
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,319
So it's okay that I was dumb because other people were smart.

346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,582
So rather than assuming one single person can and will have all the very specific knowledge

347
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:22,844
needed to solve cipher puzzles, we often designed around the idea of sharing knowledge or puzzle

348
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:23,985
solving as collective power.

349
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:27,036
Designing for puzzle solving as collective power

350
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,796
gave us a few things that we could focus on.

351
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:34,619
Relying on knowledge sharing, letting skilled players

352
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,420
be ambassadors and support other players,

353
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,700
both which focused on encouraging

354
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:39,781
collaborative puzzle solving.

355
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:42,722
And because sharing knowledge disperses power out

356
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,563
to everyone who has it, these games

357
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,924
often became about working together

358
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,084
to stop some sort of evil.

359
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:49,565
Resisting oppressive governments and freeing a village

360
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,826
from a curse were stories that actually came out

361
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,307
of the mechanic of sharing knowledge

362
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,427
as empowering everybody.

363
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,595
So with all these above examples,

364
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,498
we didn't create a gameplay system in a vacuum.

365
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,242
Instead, we looked at the basic story behind the system

366
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,684
and built the two simultaneously.

367
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:07,387
We designed what the player does in direct support

368
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,510
with the story we wanted to tell and vice versa.

369
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,792
So from my experience of working with a bunch of different teams

370
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,033
on a bunch of different kind of games,

371
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:17,274
I have some tips that I generally

372
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,236
try to use to encourage this kind of thinking.

373
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,918
And I especially use this when maybe not everybody

374
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,440
is on board with the idea that narrative design is game

375
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,461
design and that narrative deserves to be part

376
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:27,422
of the pre-production process.

377
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:28,823
We do, and we can help.

378
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:33,326
So to kickstart this process, I run

379
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:35,048
through a similar set of questions every single time.

380
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:37,550
What is the player doing?

381
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:39,811
What does this action mean?

382
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,524
How would a character behave in a certain situation?

383
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,805
And if you have a character already,

384
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,907
how would that character behave in this situation?

385
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,969
Would they take the action you want your player to do?

386
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,132
If not, what type of person would take this sort of action?

387
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,214
And how would that character behave

388
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,716
if they were pushed to their breaking point?

389
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:00,977
Because the way people respond to things changes

390
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:02,338
based on the context around them.

391
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,398
So these are super basic, but they help set myself up

392
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,619
in the proper direction before I get too deep into things

393
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,601
like breaking stories, solidifying characters,

394
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,862
designing systems, et cetera.

395
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,184
This is all kind of first steps for me

396
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:16,365
that I try to do at the same time as these other things.

397
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,447
And I do this by working directly with the game designers

398
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,169
and making them talk to me and making them answer

399
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,230
all of my questions, because I have a lot.

400
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,953
Okay, so cool, right?

401
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,594
It is cool, but why?

402
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:31,376
Why does any of this even matter?

403
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,278
What do we gain from designing this way?

404
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,957
I mean, you're probably doing this already,

405
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,258
whether deliberately or not.

406
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:39,720
But intentionally including narrative design

407
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,942
alongside game design will help make development smoother.

408
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,363
I promise it will help.

409
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:45,365
It will also make our games better,

410
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,307
because it can support in so many ways.

411
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,070
It'll help with story coherence.

412
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:53,993
Allowing narrative to be on the ground level of game design

413
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,894
will give your game greater story coherence.

414
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,256
Ludonarrative dissonance has the reputation

415
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,237
it does for a reason.

416
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,559
Players buck when the story and gameplay don't match.

417
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:04,539
Or when they've been asked to do something they don't believe their character ever would.

418
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:10,481
Evaluating the narrative context of gameplay verbs and actions will help cut out this dissonance right from the very beginning.

419
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:16,962
But the reverse is true too. What the player does is understood largely through the story attached to it.

420
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:22,364
Asking your players to do something without providing context will often leave players feeling confused and unmotivated.

421
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,205
And that's because story provides motivation and context for gameplay mechanics.

422
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,025
Because yeah, context is narrative.

423
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,588
If you've asked your player to cut down 12 trees every week,

424
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,210
but never told them that you need to do this in order to get wood to start a fire

425
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,792
at your survivalist campsite, then the motivation for doing so can become lost.

426
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,994
Or maybe the player will be angry at doing a quest that feels too repetitive

427
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:45,216
if they don't understand why they're doing it is important.

428
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,177
Story attaches meaning and motivation to mechanics

429
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:50,579
that may otherwise be confusing or lack player motivation.

430
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,811
If gameplay and narrative are designed simultaneously,

431
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,052
then the player experience is less likely to be dissonant

432
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,653
or confusing, and the player is more likely to be motivated

433
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,074
to complete quests or even the game.

434
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,336
And all of this is becoming even more important

435
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,897
as the types of games we make change.

436
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,537
With multiplayer and live games,

437
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,658
we have less space to tell linear stories to players,

438
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:11,259
and we have even less space

439
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,960
to communicate the story to players.

440
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,041
Letting the gameplay verbs we employ

441
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,121
do some of the heavy lifting

442
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,802
gives us another storytelling tool

443
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,543
when we often don't have the full range

444
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,583
of traditional storytelling tools at our disposal.

445
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:27,549
So one example of this that I really like in a multiplayer live game is Dead by Daylight.

446
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,615
In Dead by Daylight, the survivors need to repair generators to power exits.

447
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,399
They must also avoid the killer who is trying to kill them.

448
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,324
And they can do this by using flashlights, using maps to find the exits, and healing

449
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:39,205
themselves and others.

450
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,707
But they can never attack.

451
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,462
Rather than relying on cutscenes or character dialogue that is likely to be skipped almost

452
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:49,946
entirely in multiplayer contexts, the game communicates that survivors are trapped, are

453
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:53,769
not powerful enough to defeat the killer, and must escape all through the gameplay mechanics

454
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:54,229
themselves.

455
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,873
We know the story through the actions the players make the characters do.

456
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:03,157
And just like dialogue in environmental storytelling, gameplay mechanics become one of our tools

457
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:03,878
for telling story.

458
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,201
So yeah, let's design together.

459
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,786
When you design with narrative on the ground level,

460
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,687
from a space of understanding that the actions you're

461
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:14,388
asking your player to do imply some sort of story,

462
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:16,509
then you can better capitalize on this relationship

463
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,130
to create a more cohesive experience.

464
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,491
It creates more fulfilling gameplay experiences

465
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:22,812
and more seamless stories with greater coherency

466
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:23,752
for player motivation.

467
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,693
It'll also help development because all stakeholders

468
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:28,414
are present to identify potential problems

469
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,895
and work on solutions together

470
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:32,216
before they actually become problems.

471
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,537
I mean, after all, we're all working on the same game,

472
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:36,878
so why would we not design together?

473
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:38,639
Thank you so much.
