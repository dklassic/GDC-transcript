1
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:07,689
So thank you again so much for coming.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,432
So I've done amazing projects.

3
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:17,414
I'm grateful for these jobs on which I composed, lots of mobile games.

4
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:22,396
My latest job was this music for an exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center.

5
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:28,099
And I also have worked as an arranger and orchestrator for some amazing projects, which

6
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,160
I loved and am very grateful.

7
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,702
So just a couple of brief reviews, mostly for developers.

8
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,145
Developers know that music provides the emotional depth of the gaming experience.

9
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:45,367
But the score of your game is also a powerful branding device for your game.

10
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:53,670
It defines the genre, aesthetics, the world, characters, factions, the story, time and location.

11
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,853
What's most powerful to me is how music makes us remember the entire gameplay experience.

12
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:05,734
Remember for a moment the iconic theme for Mario or Tetris or Halo.

13
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,195
As soon as I mentioned these titles, do you guys have like an instant picture,

14
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:11,235
memory picture of the music to these games?

15
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,576
For instance, I personally will never forget my experience of playing Modern Warfare 2,

16
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:18,797
which was really frustrating. I kept getting killed on one level.

17
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:24,078
And I always associate that gameplay with that droning music in D minor

18
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,719
that just went on throughout the whole level.

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,280
And that's my physical memory of just that awesome game that kept beating me.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,384
So, for a game composer, one of the most important tasks is to create a sonic world that fits

21
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:44,086
the vision and the aesthetics of the game like a glove, and to make the game a memorable

22
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,967
experience, because this is what we remember.

23
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:51,669
In today's market, there are thousands of games, there's an ocean of product.

24
00:01:52,690 --> 00:02:06,670
And maybe the goal of this talk is to actually make developers aware of the fact that you could use the score as a powerful branding device of your game, a very specific score, a very unique score that has a very specific sound.

25
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,783
and fits your game perfectly and sounds like nothing else,

26
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,485
or somewhat like something else, but is very unique.

27
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,227
And ultimately, the most important thing

28
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,068
is that good music will always elevate

29
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,711
the production and artistic value of your game.

30
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,533
So with this talk, which is kind of very practical,

31
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,454
I hope to give you practical tips

32
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,777
on the collaboration between developers and composers,

33
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,318
or developers and the audio team,

34
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:34,182
and how to find the style, the voice of your score.

35
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,518
So when you're ready, when the developer is ready

36
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,621
to commission the composer to write music,

37
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,726
regardless of how big or small that score is going to be,

38
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,630
come to us with a very clear vision of your game

39
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,073
because composers will always try to support

40
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,376
to the best of their ability the vision of that game.

41
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,161
Talk to us about the aesthetics. For instance, I'm a very visual person. I respond really well to

42
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:04,084
environment art, character art, costumes, weaponry, just all the visual components that make up the game.

43
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:08,926
I mean, I'm kind of an okay game player. I do play a lot of games,

44
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:13,068
but the aesthetics of your visual aesthetics are going to really inspire me.

45
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:18,643
Now, we also discuss in these collaborative conversations that happen first,

46
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,864
something I call tone lineage.

47
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:25,527
I could describe it like, how is your game going to be similar in tone?

48
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:27,087
And I'm talking about overall tone.

49
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,509
This is the overall gestalt of your game.

50
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,911
How is your game similar in tone to games that preceded it?

51
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:35,772
And then we talk about...

52
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,216
how is your game going to fit in that lineage of tradition and innovation?

53
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,358
These are two very powerful concepts for me.

54
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:47,001
I love and adore the tradition, I've studied the tradition.

55
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:50,103
So basically there's this whole spectrum between very traditional,

56
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,305
very conventional games and also very innovative,

57
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:55,187
fresh, completely unique games that sort of hit you

58
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:58,370
and come at you from left field and of course the whole entire spectrum.

59
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,813
In my own composing, I've composed a lot of traditional music

60
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,516
and I also have tried to push myself and be innovative on some projects.

61
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:10,900
So these are all questions that we discuss in these opening conceptual conversations,

62
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,083
which I love and adore. It's my favorite part of the collaborative process, these opening

63
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:20,888
lunches or Skype conversations when we talk about ideas. And ideas flow back and forth

64
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:26,852
between the creatives, between the developers and their composing team or composers.

65
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:32,506
One of the most important goals that I set upon myself

66
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:35,487
when I collaborate with anybody, game maker, filmmaker,

67
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,487
is to understand as much as I can about your taste,

68
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:39,387
musical taste.

69
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:43,748
We talk about your favorite soundtracks from similar games

70
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,829
or your favorite soundtracks from your childhood

71
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,189
because all of us are so much driven

72
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,570
and defined by our taste.

73
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,890
Our taste in music, our taste in art, our taste in games.

74
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:58,233
in cinema and as a collaborative composer

75
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:02,095
one of my biggest tasks is to learn as much as I can about your vision,

76
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,357
your ideas and your taste. And I just by asking questions, you know, tell me what you

77
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:06,557
like.

78
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:10,659
And I do it with game makers, I do it with filmmakers. It always helps me to

79
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,980
understand what kind of music

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,722
you're most likely to resonate with and respond really well.

81
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:24,039
Ultimately our job as composers is to find that signature style, signature sound

82
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,463
that's going to define your game as a sonic experience and that's going to

83
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:32,226
become that memorable experience. So that's again conversations and

84
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:38,192
prototyping and the goal is to have that signature style for your characters and

85
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:38,732
for your game.

86
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,670
So the kind of questions, so basically the process for me always has been from the bigger picture,

87
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:51,176
which I called Gestalt, kind of coming down and focusing in on more details. So, so far I talked

88
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:56,860
about the big picture, ideas, concepts, aesthetics, style, lineage. Now I'm going to start getting

89
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,265
more specific and these are the kind of questions I ask my collaborators. So what musical elements

90
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,326
will work for your score?

91
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,873
And actually, I've been very blessed to work with really articulate game developers,

92
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,817
and sometimes I have to kind of ask more questions to get more information.

93
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,622
And then the other question, which is just as valid, is what elements do you not want?

94
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,045
What elements will not work for your score?

95
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:19,407
And we kind of go and make a list.

96
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:24,350
So basically last year I worked on this amazing collaborative experience.

97
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,272
It's a game called Mayhem.

98
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,133
It's, okay, let me now get this straight.

99
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:34,396
It's a mobile, synchronous, multiplayer, like eSports, shooter.

100
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,098
It got awarded at South by Southwest.

101
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,119
I'm proudly wearing the shirt, the t-shirt today.

102
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,780
And so it's like a...

103
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:42,826
I'll show you a couple of visuals.

104
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,927
I wanted to speak about this game today

105
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,747
because it was a beautiful collaboration

106
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:49,168
and the developers were very articulate.

107
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,769
It was like one of these perfect, perfect situations

108
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,471
of beautiful back and forth and collaborative process.

109
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,812
So just a couple of visuals to kind of give you a sense

110
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:57,832
of the visual aesthetics.

111
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:02,754
So they were really good with their conceptual guidance

112
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:06,656
in their briefs and I called out literally from their brief,

113
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:07,956
this is, everything is a quote.

114
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,755
This is what they told me.

115
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,316
The game is a sci-fi adventure, not too distant future.

116
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:16,356
The costumes and weaponry blend the past and the present.

117
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,237
And so it's not too advanced, not too sci-fi,

118
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,477
not too far in the distant future.

119
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:24,798
This is one of the most amazing metaphors

120
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:26,758
I've ever been given by a collaborator.

121
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:27,698
I loved it so much.

122
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,319
This was in their brief.

123
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,099
More aliens, less Star Wars.

124
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,540
So for somebody like me who adores science fiction

125
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,660
and really lives and breathes the whole vernacular,

126
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,000
the whole.

127
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,342
you know, fantasy, science fiction, horror,

128
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:44,305
this quote meant more than like hours and hours

129
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,266
and hours of conversation.

130
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:48,528
So I would encourage your collaborators

131
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,769
to kind of give you these metaphors

132
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,831
because they're a powerful tool of collaboration

133
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,973
and they really save us a lot of prototyping and headache.

134
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,435
That was also part of their initial brief.

135
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,896
So the visual style is a blend of sci-fi and contemporary war game.

136
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,656
So this is what they wanted.

137
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:06,997
They wanted the music to be exactly that middle ground, not too sci-fi,

138
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:11,258
which would be too much electronica and synths, or not too much action,

139
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:12,138
which is like the big...

140
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,699
Because I'm known for doing a lot of action games like Gears of War,

141
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,460
or big strings and big horn melodies.

142
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,820
So exactly middle ground.

143
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,891
and not too sci-fi.

144
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,733
So a couple more visuals.

145
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,956
So then we started, so after talking about

146
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,337
these more specific details,

147
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,778
then we got even more specific.

148
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,213
global considerations for the score.

149
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:36,575
Music is a tertiary audio element.

150
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,817
The sound effects and the environment ambiences

151
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,179
always take precedence, because they're

152
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,201
part of the auditory experience.

153
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,902
Music is a tertiary audio element.

154
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:49,785
So then we start getting even more focused on the style.

155
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,027
So they wanted a hybrid style, which

156
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,449
is a little bit of orchestra and electronica.

157
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,810
They wanted pulsing synth textures,

158
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,031
because that's modern scoring.

159
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:01,474
They wanted ambient pads to suggest science fiction.

160
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,598
and sprinkle some sound effects here and there

161
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,501
to spell out that the game is a science fiction game.

162
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,825
So this is all, again, from the wonderful brief

163
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,406
I received from my collaborators.

164
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,949
So what they did not want, and this was, again,

165
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,471
just as useful as anything else,

166
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,573
is they did not want big, soaring melodies,

167
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,914
especially no brass melodies.

168
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,397
They did not want busy chord progressions.

169
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,218
And they did not want bombastic choir,

170
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,779
because choir is associated with more like epic fantasy,

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,840
and they did not want that.

172
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,621
So I'm going to go ahead and play you a little bit

173
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,421
of the gameplay just for fun, and then I'm

174
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,162
going to play the music.

175
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,862
So you have a chance to see the visual,

176
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,483
and then you have a chance to focus on the music.

177
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,024
So here's a little bit of gameplay from this shooter.

178
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:44,406
So for the composers in the audience, I also wanted to play just the music alone,

179
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:47,668
so you can isolate all the elements, you know, the groove, the pulses,

180
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:51,530
the very non-melodic material, but still kind of, you know,

181
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,771
still orchestral, except no soaring melodies.

182
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,152
So this is for, okay.

183
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:11,634
Okay.

184
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,876
So there were a couple of campaigns,

185
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,017
I wrote a couple of battle tracks,

186
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,859
and then there is obviously the menu music,

187
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,221
and this is again from the directions I received

188
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,161
from my collaborators.

189
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:25,043
Much less stressful, serious and foreboding,

190
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:26,885
subdued, not frenetic,

191
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,466
because the campaigns are very frenetic.

192
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,427
They did not want massive choirs,

193
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:32,488
they did not want drums,

194
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,870
and they did not want loud string melodies.

195
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,411
Again, I was just so lucky to have

196
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,233
this incredibly wonderful guidelines

197
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:40,854
given to me by my collaborators.

198
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:43,384
And this is what I did with these guidelines.

199
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,480
You

200
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,879
Okay, so this was that collaborative experience.

201
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,361
I wanted to now switch gears and talk

202
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,463
about another fantastic collaboration,

203
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,664
which is my most recent job.

204
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:29,424
It's not a game.

205
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:33,027
It's my music for a museum exhibition

206
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,569
at the Kennedy Space Center.

207
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,311
I got this job through a game connection,

208
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:42,255
and also the composing was 3D movies

209
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,978
and also interactive pods, so I figured it's interactive

210
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,139
and I could present it here.

211
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,916
It's called Heroes and Legends.

212
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,577
That's the name of the exhibition at the Kennedy Space Center,

213
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:56,078
and it hosts the American Astronaut Hall of Fame.

214
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:59,239
Here's just me standing in front of the exhibition.

215
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,319
I wanted to acknowledge one of my most cherished collaborators,

216
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,800
an extraordinary person and professional, John Rod,

217
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,541
the recording, mixing, and mastering engineer on this job

218
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,082
and all my jobs, all my projects.

219
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,342
John, would you please stand up and?

220
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:20,184
Thank you for a fantastic work and always just making everything sound so awesome.

221
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:27,546
So basically I'm going to play for you one musical piece which was accompanying a 3D

222
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:31,927
film that tells a story about the Gemini 8 mission.

223
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:36,148
The Gemini 8 mission was in 1966 and for the first time there was a manned capsule and

224
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:36,668
also an unmanned.

225
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,132
ship called the Agena that they had to undock and it was really complicated and that's one instance where

226
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:55,336
Things went wrong with something in the capsule. There was some mechanical malfunction and the mission had to be aborted

227
00:15:55,856 --> 00:16:01,940
So my music was supposed to be on and that's the that's the capsule. That's just the experience here in the theater

228
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,942
You're watching this amazing earth. Everything is 3d and

229
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,404
The capsule just flies right in front of you right above you

230
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:10,684
so

231
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:15,338
The music for this 3D film was supposed to capture,

232
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:19,179
it was modern action, and it was supposed to capture

233
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,779
first the joy of space, because the first thing we see

234
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,560
in a 3D movie is what we see from inside the cabin outside.

235
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,820
And then I had to have action music

236
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,441
for the malfunctioning system, and then there's

237
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:31,921
this increasing level of tension and peril.

238
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:36,002
Ever increasing tension, and the stakes get higher

239
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,782
and higher with each musical structure,

240
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,523
and I had to build this, and keep building,

241
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,123
and keep building.

242
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,629
And at the end, the mission is aborted,

243
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,754
so I had to capture the hero who's been defeated.

244
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,438
So the people's lives are saved, which is good.

245
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:51,022
They kind of failed the mission, but we saved their lives,

246
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,004
so it's still a success.

247
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,042
This is how the conversation went with the clients.

248
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:01,825
The first idea that they presented to me is they said,

249
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:04,227
we really liked the movie The Right Stuff.

250
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:05,448
It's a film from 1983.

251
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:08,111
Have you guys watched The Right Stuff?

252
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:08,631
Raise your hands.

253
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,314
So it's like one of these iconic movies about cosmonauts.

254
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,897
It's scored by Bill Conti with a very traditional score,

255
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,440
totally orchestral and beautiful, melodic,

256
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,582
almost like Bach, almost like classical music.

257
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:25,924
and they did not want choir. This was one of their requirements.

258
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:30,666
Now I thought to myself, well, that score is awesome, but it was composed in 1983.

259
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:38,708
So now how do I sort of turn their idea around and still make them feel as if they're giving me the idea,

260
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:41,149
but like kind of put my ideas like in their brain.

261
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:45,371
So what I suggest, that's a very important skill for composers to have, to kind of...

262
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:48,333
share ideas and be really open, be really respectful,

263
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,695
but also present ideas and make your collaborators

264
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,097
think that they came up with the idea.

265
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,879
So I said, how about we approach this entire score.

266
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,114
and make it modern and timeless.

267
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,136
So the timeless component is going to be the classical music,

268
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:05,359
classical big strings and horn tunes and melodies

269
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:08,781
and classical chord progressions, almost like Bach.

270
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:10,482
So we have that classical component,

271
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,003
which is our timeless component.

272
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,905
But as far as the modern sound is concerned,

273
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,967
I mean, all of us have grown basically listening

274
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:22,289
to these very modern, pulsing, electronic percussive scores.

275
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,770
So I felt compelled to.

276
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,193
have very strong percussion arrangement and synths.

277
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,916
So that's how I combined the traditional melodic themes

278
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,598
for the heroes and orchestra with very modern arrangement

279
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,819
with busy percussion and synths.

280
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,561
And it worked beautifully.

281
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:43,353
So that's how I sort of turned their idea around and added my own input.

282
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,375
And they totally went, I mean, they just really loved the music.

283
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,396
They went with the idea.

284
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,058
So I cannot show you the movie because it's part of this 3D thing.

285
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:52,341
So I'll just show you some screenshots from a very early

286
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:54,544
rendering of the movie that I was given.

287
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,166
It just shows you mostly the inside the astronauts.

288
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,808
And that's the capsule and the Agena undocking.

289
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:00,889
And they spin.

290
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,054
So, that's another visual.

291
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:11,601
So here, I'm going to play the music and there's like seven structures, beauty of the space,

292
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:15,325
and I'm going to point as the music progresses, you'll hear it very clearly.

293
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,468
It's really, the music tells a story very clearly.

294
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:23,094
So let me now play this music and you can imagine the story that the music tells.

295
00:19:56,381 --> 00:20:02,145
Have a great week.

296
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:13,969
Thank you for watching!

297
00:20:57,003 --> 00:21:01,727
Okay, here's the last image.

298
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,639
So I wanted to open now for questions.

299
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,360
I'm eager to answer your questions.

300
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,821
Please be sure to fill out the evaluation forms.

301
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:27,402
That's my email.

302
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:28,482
It's okay to contact me.

303
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,163
Check me out on Twitter and everything else.

304
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:32,344
I welcome your questions now.

305
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:34,685
Thanks.

306
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,404
Hello, Pankaj, thank you so much, that was fantastic.

307
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:45,487
I was just curious if you'd be willing to share any techniques that you like to really

308
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:51,952
give that lower end ear candy that is great in your mixes, if you have anything that you

309
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:55,855
particularly enjoy, because obviously just the orchestral samples probably can't produce

310
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,556
that low warmth.

311
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:00,479
Okay, so we recorded brass and strings live.

312
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,761
Sometimes I use a little bit more,

313
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,203
like one more cello or two more celli,

314
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:08,386
but then the real magic is John Raud sitting right there.

315
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:09,107
He's fantastic.

316
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:10,928
He's the one who really shapes that low end.

317
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,911
Because I've worked so much in horror and fantasy,

318
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:14,912
there is always that.

319
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,253
music competing with the sound effects.

320
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,953
And I had so many conversations with people in horror games

321
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,114
basically saying, that's your biggest goal,

322
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:25,194
how to shape, how to sculpt the low end

323
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:27,114
so we still hear the machine guns

324
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,234
and they don't sound like popcorn.

325
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,835
But so that the music really works,

326
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,996
see because all we hear, sound effects, folly, dialogue,

327
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:36,276
it all goes into the ears.

328
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,576
So the music has to be very carefully sculpted

329
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:40,317
around the other elements in the audio.

330
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,137
And me coming from a genre background,

331
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:44,157
having done a lot of horror films and a lot of my music.

332
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:50,467
having been cut and not used. I learned the hard way to be incredibly sensitive, but talk to John,

333
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:54,233
he's going to give you the magic, the actual technicality. I just write the music, the notes.

334
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,441
But it starts with you putting in the musical elements.

335
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,824
Do you have any particular nice combinations?

336
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:03,147
I have ways, I have a really specific way how I voice the brass.

337
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,910
I always use octaves, two octaves, sometimes three octaves.

338
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:11,056
I worked for many years for the orchestrator of Hans Zimmer,

339
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:12,717
called Bruce Fowler, and he taught me how

340
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,320
to add one extra lower octave in the tuba.

341
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:19,543
So I have a particular way how I voice the brass that's just really heavy, like really punchy,

342
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:22,466
and it really kind of shows in all my orchestrations for Steve Jablonski.

343
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:26,169
Same thing with the strings, just really beef up the low end in octaves,

344
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,591
but never like in anything less than an octave.

345
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,953
So in the composition, in the arrangement, that's what I do, just kind of beef it up.

346
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:33,074
Awesome, thank you.

347
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:33,615
Thank you.

348
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:39,980
Hi, so for the developer who may or may not be somewhat musically inclined,

349
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:46,269
Do you have a sense of that you prefer to have direction from them in non-musical terms

350
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:52,615
like timid, warm, you know, sensual, or that you would actually, to what degree are you

351
00:23:52,655 --> 00:23:55,618
open to very specific, like I want this to be an oboe?

352
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,683
Thank you, this is a perfect, awesome question.

353
00:23:58,723 --> 00:23:59,263
Thank you so much.

354
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,885
The best collaborative process is if the developers

355
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:05,486
speak with their composers in terms of ideas.

356
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,287
First, talk to us about ideas.

357
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,788
Talk to us about emotions, mechanics,

358
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:12,149
storytelling, tradition, innovation.

359
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:15,550
The large, big concepts, so that's the one aspect

360
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,650
of wonderful collaboration.

361
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:17,831
The other collaboration is music.

362
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,632
Just give us like five MP3s and say,

363
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:20,532
well, I really love this.

364
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,833
Follow, you know, I like this about this,

365
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,194
I don't like this about this other thing.

366
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:26,455
So when we have both the concepts.

367
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:32,117
and the music equally represented music in terms of style guide from previous games or movies.

368
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:35,459
This is just the best because we know your concepts and your vision,

369
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,222
but we also know the kind of music that speaks to you and you feel is going to represent your game.

370
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:45,666
So if you only talk to us in words, then words are slippery.

371
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,988
I mean, we could talk about music and I'd say one thing, you interpret.

372
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:50,789
So there could be this misunderstanding.

373
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,111
But when it's the sense of concepts and aesthetics and ideas,

374
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:58,396
Also reinforced by your favorite music that you feel is gonna fit with the game.

375
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:03,123
That company, the company that made Mayhem, they did give me two mp3s.

376
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,625
They said this is what we like.

377
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,929
Make it like this, but unique for our game.

378
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:13,940
So I would say the best collaborative approach is ideas and your favorite music combined together.

379
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,424
And then the composers, they have ways of filtering, they have intuition and just skills and experience to filter.

380
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:27,728
And also, all of us, I encourage all composers to just play as many games, watch as many movies, learn the genres, learn music,

381
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,590
because that kind of becomes part of your intelligence as a composer.

382
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:35,493
I just voraciously play games and watch games all the time, so that's what we do.

383
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:36,994
But I would say...

384
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,715
concepts and music.

385
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:39,936
Yes.

386
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:43,518
Hi. I was wondering for the Gemini 8 piece,

387
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:50,382
how, or do you have a process for going from the general timeline

388
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:55,345
of the presentation of the film and the,

389
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:59,647
to the specifics of like tempo, things like that,

390
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:03,710
like does the overall length of the piece help determine your tempo?

391
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,311
Do you set that independently?

392
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,591
motivically, the structure?

393
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:09,212
So that's a really good question.

394
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:12,315
So the entire 3D movie is with dialogue.

395
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,856
So all the music was under dialogue.

396
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:15,878
And all the three, because it's like a documentary,

397
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,840
essentially, except it's really elaborate

398
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,461
with special effects, which you didn't see here.

399
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,484
So that's one of my first assignments,

400
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:23,405
and it's very challenging.

401
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:24,906
People ask me what's the happiest

402
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,327
and most challenging part.

403
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,449
The happiest part is these conceptual conversations

404
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:29,490
I just spoke about.

405
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,291
They're the funnest.

406
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,273
research and concepts is awesome.

407
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:35,156
The hardest part is when I open the blank template

408
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:37,139
and the movie's there, it's lined up,

409
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,742
and my job is to pace the music,

410
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:41,283
really structure the music,

411
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,426
so I always begin globally, that's how I work.

412
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,548
Not everybody's like this, that's just my process.

413
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,211
I would kind of mark the movie,

414
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:49,913
remember that chart I had with the...

415
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,118
energy curve kind of going up, so I had to sort of...

416
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:55,159
And then you have to hit beats.

417
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,320
In any linear media, which cinematics in games are,

418
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,781
or film scoring, or this 3D entertainment,

419
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,842
it's linear media, so we have to hit

420
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:07,144
moments where the energy changes, or the story changes.

421
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:10,185
So that's the first thing I do, and it's challenging,

422
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:12,206
because I haven't set the tempos yet,

423
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,167
and sometimes I have to lock these markers,

424
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,828
so I lock the markers, and then I experiment

425
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,430
with different tempos until I find the right tempo.

426
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:20,703
Thank you.

427
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:21,323
Thank you.

428
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,565
Hi, I have a question about discussing budget

429
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,886
with developers, like, you know,

430
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:29,027
if you get even just one live musician,

431
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,808
it can help supplement the sample libraries.

432
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:31,908
And I was wondering if you have any tips

433
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,029
on how to kind of communicate with developers

434
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,510
about recording budgets or anything relating to that.

435
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:38,289
That's a really good question.

436
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,731
Most of my games are, I mean, this is purely samples.

437
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,453
But I always make a case, if there's like one musician,

438
00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:50,315
for instance, this is just a wild example, electric cello

439
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,857
that can add so much texture and variety.

440
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:55,938
And the cello seems to be such a magical instrument

441
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:57,119
for media scoring.

442
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,860
It's all conversations.

443
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,742
It's all trying to sell the idea that even a small, tiny budget

444
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,024
by adding one instrument can add so much artistic value.

445
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:11,927
And it's a conversation that you have to have.

446
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,169
But I would say, try to start small.

447
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:17,172
You can't really say, oh, we have a small mobile game.

448
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,533
I'm going to record orchestra.

449
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:19,634
Because they're not going to need that.

450
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,055
And they won't be able to afford.

451
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:24,356
but basically suggest how about we have one very versatile instrument,

452
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,017
maybe a wind instrument or a plucked,

453
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,197
plucked instruments also work really well,

454
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:29,357
or maybe electric cello,

455
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:30,958
and then work with one musician,

456
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:33,598
or maybe work with three musicians, or four.

457
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,439
This is something you can afford,

458
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:39,640
and it's a small part of the budget, but adds so much.

459
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,201
So the whole idea is that you're going to spend a little bit of money

460
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,961
and get so much more on your return of investment.

461
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,362
That's how I would approach it.

462
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,182
That's how I've always approached it for all these years.

463
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:51,244
that I worked, I still work with a lot of independent games

464
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:52,765
and mobile games and indie films,

465
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:54,446
and the pitch is always the same.

466
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,187
Let's just spend a little bit of money

467
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,629
and get fantastic live cello player.

468
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,230
I just did it on my horror film with a very low budget.

469
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,572
So the idea is you spend a little bit of money

470
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:05,973
to get huge result.

471
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:07,194
Thank you.

472
00:29:07,554 --> 00:29:08,115
You're welcome.

473
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:09,275
Any more questions?

474
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,336
I think we're out of time.

475
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:13,098
Okay guys, I'll be outside if you wanna talk to me.

476
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,099
Thanks again so much for coming.

477
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,920
Thank you.

478
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,240
Thank you.
