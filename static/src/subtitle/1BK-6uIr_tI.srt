1
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:07,670
Thanks everyone for coming out to my talk.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,492
It's called Lessons from Co-op, Surviving on the Fringes.

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,274
And just a little bit about me real quick.

4
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,696
I'm the co-founder and studio director of Co-op.

5
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,558
My background is in cultural analysis and media studies.

6
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:20,919
That's what I went to school for.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,542
And I worked as an organizer and administrator for a research lab in video games.

8
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:30,966
So I have a lot of experience with organizations and how to run them smoothly.

9
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:33,968
I was also a community organizer in Montreal.

10
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,427
where I helped organize the Mount Royal Game Society,

11
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:38,028
which was one of the biggest indie groups

12
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,290
before we shut it down just this past month.

13
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,392
And basically, I'm self-taught

14
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:45,853
and I'm just figuring things out like the rest of us.

15
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,914
So I don't have any formal education

16
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,475
or background making games

17
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,637
or running businesses or whatever.

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,139
So why this talk?

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,841
I think that there's not really a lot of advice

20
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,583
when it comes to how to structure a studio

21
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,544
and how to run a game development team.

22
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,448
There's a lot of advice on how to make video games,

23
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,749
but I think that luck plays such an important part

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,931
in making things that there's so many things that you can't

25
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:14,431
account for.

26
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,052
But one thing that you can account for

27
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:19,013
is your studio structure and how you run your projects.

28
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,775
And that's actually something you have a practical, hands-on

29
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:22,875
thing that you can change.

30
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,497
And so this is for people who are interested specifically

31
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,579
in starting a company and starting a studio

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,660
to make games commercially and sustainably.

33
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,755
And while I think unionization is an incredibly important goal,

34
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,357
there are other things that can augment that goal

35
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:41,617
and help us reach that point.

36
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:45,019
And one of them is in learning about co-ops and starting co-ops.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,401
Also, there are other forms of making games and other structures

38
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,403
that are more loose and fluid that some of these things

39
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,144
that I'm talking about might not be super relevant for.

40
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:56,865
So just keep that in mind.

41
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,074
So a couple caveats. One of them is survivorship bias.

42
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,377
Something to keep in mind whenever you're hearing a talk by anybody

43
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:04,539
and anyone's giving you advice,

44
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,463
is that they're giving you a talk from a perspective of surviving and success, maybe,

45
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:11,866
and that that might not be, like, it might not be the whole story.

46
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:15,210
Also, there's a whole lot of luck, privilege, and money

47
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,553
that goes into starting any sort of venture like this, like having a studio.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,362
And we were really lucky, we had a lot of privilege,

49
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,743
and we also had money saved up from previous jobs,

50
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:26,665
or we were able to borrow money from friends and family

51
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:27,325
and things like that.

52
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,746
And I think that that goes a really, really long way

53
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,048
to becoming sustainable, and it's not really

54
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:32,828
talked about a lot.

55
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:34,769
And also experience level.

56
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,951
Like I mentioned, a lot of, like myself personally,

57
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,252
and a lot of people at Co-op didn't make games

58
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,333
before we started the studio,

59
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:44,195
which means that the kind of advice I'm talking about,

60
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,615
the sort of strategies that we've learned,

61
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,136
are coming from that perspective.

62
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:48,517
So if you have a more formal.

63
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,389
training or experience or background, your mileage may vary.

64
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:59,272
So Co-op is a company that we founded in 2012, and just a little bit about it.

65
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:00,852
We've made a couple games.

66
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,234
We most recently released Nog on PlayStation and iOS.

67
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:06,435
That's what it looks like.

68
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:11,617
We also worked with Square Enix Montreal on an expansion for Lara Croft Go called The

69
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:15,279
Mirror of Spirits where we made an all-new chapter for that game.

70
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,385
We had full creative freedom, did all new art, music, and design,

71
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:20,745
and it was a really fun project.

72
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:25,246
And this is a lesser known game of ours called Please Don't Space Dog,

73
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:29,327
where you pilot a space truck with your dog.

74
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:33,368
And it was made for the original Oculus developer kit.

75
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,949
And this game actually helped us travel around the world

76
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,769
on the festival circuit and get us in front of a lot of people

77
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,930
and opened up a lot of opportunities for us

78
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,470
that we wouldn't have otherwise had.

79
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,751
And that was just about being in the right place and at the right time.

80
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,179
But also we have a bunch of cancelled projects

81
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,800
that I think were really important in terms of building our visibility

82
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,621
when we were working on them and helped sort of open doors

83
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,242
and teach us a lot about making games.

84
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:02,203
So projects like Skipping Stones, Red Rover, and Fledge.

85
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,005
We also do contract work, like I mentioned, with Square Enix.

86
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,406
We've worked with Cartoon Network and other companies.

87
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:11,727
And we also do something called CoLab.

88
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:15,430
which is a fund that we started where we give people

89
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,671
a couple thousand dollars, like whatever we can afford

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,532
at any given time, to work on a one to two month project

91
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,993
out of our office where we give them resources,

92
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:26,875
help, support, and what I think is really interesting

93
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,996
about Colab is we don't take any ownership over the project

94
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,177
so if the person we're doing a Colab with

95
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,858
decides to release their game for free, that's fine.

96
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:37,479
If they want to charge money for it, that's fine.

97
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,820
The money's theirs, it's not ours.

98
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:44,774
It's basically a thing that I wish existed for us when we were getting started as experimental game makers,

99
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,575
and it's something that I think is really important.

100
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:50,819
And I'm going to talk a little bit more about why you should give away your money if you have it.

101
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:58,186
This is the first one that we did. It's called Gardenarium by Paloma Dawkins, Kyler, and Yilang Yilang.

102
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:02,450
And this is Orchids to Dusk by Paul Klara-Sue and Ramzi Khadrubi.

103
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,005
And finally, at Co-op, we've done a lot of workshops,

104
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:09,306
and we've been involved in the Montreal community

105
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:09,966
where we're based.

106
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:11,587
And I think that that's been something

107
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:12,967
that's been really important for us as well.

108
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,129
So, what is Co-op?

109
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,270
I get a lot of questions if it's like an art collective,

110
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,691
is it a company, is it a workers' Co-op?

111
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,872
And I think this is due to the fact that

112
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,192
when we originally started,

113
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,393
we were really inspired by indie record labels,

114
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,614
like music record labels.

115
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,975
We wanted to start a studio that

116
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:37,023
kind of envisioned a way of making games where everyone's working on their own projects individually

117
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:42,766
and they're supported by this umbrella name or this umbrella group called co-op. We found out that

118
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:47,748
because of not knowing what we were doing that that wasn't really sustainable and we kind of

119
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:51,589
segued into being a more traditional studio structure where we're working together on

120
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,231
smaller projects instead of everybody working on their own and that was just a thing where we

121
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,933
realized we just didn't know what we were doing and everyone on their own was a recipe for disaster

122
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:01,233
for us.

123
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:05,345
So it is a company. It's a federally registered company in Canada,

124
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,906
which gives us access to funding.

125
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,787
It's a for-profit corporation, essentially.

126
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,489
And we're all salaried employees with benefits,

127
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,371
and our goal is to make artsy and experimental games commercially sustainably.

128
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:21,854
So, most importantly, we're structured as a workers' cooperative.

129
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,675
So we're not actually legally registered as a workers' co-op.

130
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,737
And that's because when we were getting started,

131
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,738
we didn't actually even know about the co-op structure.

132
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,247
The name ended up being a happy coincidence.

133
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:36,769
And we also wanted to be a corporation

134
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,250
because that gave us access to specific funding in Canada

135
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,611
that's really, really helpful,

136
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,332
that can give you hundreds of thousands of dollars,

137
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:44,773
potentially, if you can get it.

138
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,294
But one thing that we did after our first year

139
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,975
is decide to restructure the studio

140
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,535
as a workers' co-op internally.

141
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,257
So we changed our bylaws and what that means.

142
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,298
So does anyone here know what a workers' co-op is?

143
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay, a couple of hands.

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,343
So a workers' co-op is essentially a company that's owned by all the employees.

145
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:10,365
So everyone who's a full-time employee owns the company at an equal level,

146
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,426
and that's regardless of their financial investment.

147
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:16,428
So if I put something like $50,000 into the start of the company

148
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:19,730
and someone put in $100, we still own the same amount of shares.

149
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:25,173
And what's interesting is a lot of game studios and startups

150
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:28,075
are actually very similar to co-ops when they just get started.

151
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,457
Because you're just a couple of people, you're all working, you're wearing many hats, you're

152
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:33,517
sharing responsibility.

153
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:37,439
But what happens and where they diverge is when it comes to growth.

154
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,941
And I think when growth becomes your goal, you're essentially optimizing for money.

155
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:43,701
And that's it.

156
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:47,483
And when you're optimizing for money, it forces a lot of compromises.

157
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,484
And it creates exploitation, even against best interests.

158
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,825
That's just kind of how capitalism works.

159
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:57,247
So as soon as you start doing things where you have to grow, you're also increasing your

160
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:57,507
overhead.

161
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:57,807
And that's it.

162
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:03,538
significantly. And that means you have to make games that will be able to cover those costs,

163
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:07,899
and you start to make decisions that I think are exploitative because it's inevitable. You

164
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,941
need to keep the lights on, so you do things that will harm somebody at the end of the day.

165
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:20,262
So we handle growth by capping it. So we have a rule where we can't grow beyond eight people.

166
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:26,023
And I think capping growth is one of the best things that you can do in this business because

167
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,066
At the end of the day, it's a numbers game.

168
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,988
And the less people you are, the easier

169
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,030
it is to find a sustainable model for yourself.

170
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,073
And it also means that when you're adding new people,

171
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,135
they are going to become an equal owner.

172
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,118
And that becomes really, I don't know how to manage that

173
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:42,958
at a certain size.

174
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,280
So staying small and staying sustainable

175
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,803
is really, I think, key to being part of a co-op

176
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:49,544
in making games.

177
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,055
So what does that actually mean? What does it change?

178
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:57,536
Like, if everyone in your studio is an owner at an equal level,

179
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,678
regardless of who they are, it changes, I think, number one, responsibility.

180
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:06,780
People who are owners suddenly have this deeper responsibility

181
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,243
in terms of the long-term investment of the studio, the project, your well-being,

182
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:16,404
and that impacts their decision-making because they're making decisions in a new way now.

183
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,190
what they want out of making games,

184
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,771
but also what the people around them

185
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,412
that they're sharing in this responsibility need and want.

186
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,333
And it changes money,

187
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,674
because it changes how you decide to split money

188
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,794
and what to do with money.

189
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,216
And that all has an ethical reaction.

190
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,657
And I think those ethical reactions

191
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,817
impact things like crunch,

192
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,659
which I think there's a lot of discussion

193
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:42,699
about crunch in AAA,

194
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,600
but there's not really a lot of talk about.

195
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:49,921
things like what smaller businesses do because I think small businesses

196
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,703
are as guilty as big companies in terms of

197
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:56,827
terrible labor practices. You just don't hear about it because there's no one

198
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,909
reporting on it, right? And you don't hear about it as

199
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:04,733
often because it flies under the radar. So since no one's reporting on that

200
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,556
stuff, it happens in a completely unregulated, without any

201
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:12,379
accountability sort of way. But when you have a co-op and you're

202
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,494
and you have things like crunch, you are actually making that decision as a team.

203
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:19,976
And even if it's the bad decision, at the end of the day,

204
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:23,817
you are the one who's profiting from that work, not somebody else.

205
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:28,780
You're not crunching because you have to, and then someone makes money and they can either fire you

206
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,262
or keep you, it doesn't matter. They get to retain whatever the result of your crunch is,

207
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:38,184
and you just hurt yourself in a really significant way for someone else.

208
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,565
And I think that that's really messed up.

209
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,679
And then profits, you can decide what to do with that as a team.

210
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,961
And in terms of health, I think being in a co-op

211
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:51,043
is a more emotionally healthy way to make games, because I think making games

212
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:55,005
actually really sucks and is not a very enjoyable process in a

213
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:58,627
lot of ways. At least it isn't for me. And so I think

214
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,449
that when you're sharing that responsibility with people on an equal

215
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,490
level, you're able to emotionally be more

216
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,312
cognizant of what's going on.

217
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:13,210
And something that people ask about is like, well, if everyone's making the decisions together,

218
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,093
how do you handle disagreements? And I think what people need to understand is that just

219
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:23,436
because you're all owners doesn't mean that you all have to agree on everything that you're

220
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:27,518
working on. You can have different disciplines and people are trusted to do different things.

221
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:34,942
But overall, because you're all in it together, you tend to find decision making is geared towards

222
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,299
the best, like what's best for everybody.

223
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,760
And I think everyone kind of agrees on what's best.

224
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,061
So we haven't actually had to deal

225
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,061
with a lot of disagreements.

226
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,403
And also, how do you handle people leaving?

227
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,624
To be honest, I don't know the answer to that

228
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:49,265
because in the six years that we've started our studio,

229
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,405
no one's left yet.

230
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,286
And I think that that's actually a testament

231
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,568
to the co-op model, that people have this deeper

232
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,889
emotional stake in the company

233
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,369
and in making the games together,

234
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,310
that so far no one's left.

235
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:07,566
So I want to talk about some survival strategies in relation to being a co-op.

236
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,387
And the first one is the team makeup.

237
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,648
So just like kind of what I was talking about how no one's left yet,

238
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,729
part of that is our personalities and our skill sets.

239
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,430
But I think a really important thing is the aspirations.

240
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:23,612
And when you're choosing like who to work with and who to start something like this with,

241
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,953
your aspirations are where you see the vision for the team in the studio.

242
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,994
And when you come together on that,

243
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:32,955
I think it's more important than any sort of like experience that you might have.

244
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:37,269
I actually think experience is probably the least important thing in making games, because

245
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:41,073
like I said, making games kind of sucks, so you want to do it with people who are on the

246
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:41,894
same page as you.

247
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:47,379
And when you're going into business with them and you're sharing the ownership responsibility,

248
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,422
being on the same vision is the most important thing.

249
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:56,628
Being involved in the local community actually really enriches and influences the people

250
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:57,048
around you.

251
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:57,809
Like just being...

252
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:02,497
One of few co-ops in Montreal, I think we have a lot of discussions in the local community

253
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:06,179
about that model and about that structure and why it works for us and that can influence

254
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,759
a new generation of game makers.

255
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,981
I think that there's a lot of intangible benefits that come from being involved in the community

256
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:16,022
that I can't point to any specific thing and be like, we did this so this made us more

257
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,503
successful or more survivable.

258
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:20,644
But I think those intangibles are actually really important to our survival.

259
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:26,906
Something about our team is that we have an art-first approach,

260
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,630
and I think if it all boiled down to one thing, that's the co-op DNA.

261
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,352
Our team is essentially made...

262
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,014
The ownership is a bunch of artists,

263
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:37,296
and they're in charge of every decision in the studio.

264
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,519
And we make that decision with an eye for surviving and sustainability,

265
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,301
but it is an art-first approach.

266
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:48,386
And I think that also impacts things like what kind of values we have.

267
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,503
One of the values that we have is valuing production and having a production model.

268
00:13:54,663 --> 00:14:00,627
So for me, as one of the key owners in the studio, I am a full-time producer, essentially.

269
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,389
I don't actually work on the day-to-day making of the games.

270
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,771
I am the producer on all our projects, and I handle the business side of things.

271
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:13,355
I'm an owner, but I'm doing that makes me really invested in these projects that I'm not

272
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:18,279
like actually working on in a day-to-day basis. And the fact that my team thinks that I'm important

273
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,982
enough as an outsider almost to the creative process to be involved really means that they

274
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:28,366
value having someone like me around. And I think that that goes towards creating a really healthy

275
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:33,009
model of learning how to actually make games and having someone handle all the things that

276
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,592
you don't want to handle when you're worrying about design challenges or whatever.

277
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,659
And one of the things that I think gets tricky when you have a co-op is,

278
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,941
how do you shield a team from bad news or something that's difficult?

279
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,343
Or how do you shoulder responsibility when you're all owners and you're all sharing in that?

280
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,045
And I think I kind of mentioned this a little bit before, but

281
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,667
I think you actually want to silo a little bit.

282
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:58,669
Like, you kind of just trust people to take care of things that are their domains

283
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,271
and that you don't have to micromanage everything.

284
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,452
So people trust me when it comes to the money.

285
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:07,615
Everyone has access to our bank account and they can check how much money we have if they want to.

286
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:09,733
But they just don't, they just ask me,

287
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:12,474
and they trust me to bring up any issues if they come up.

288
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:14,454
And I'm not gonna keep anything from anyone

289
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:17,415
because we're all in it together on an equal level.

290
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,656
So if I think they need to know about something,

291
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:20,216
I'll tell them.

292
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,857
And if I don't think they need to know about something,

293
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:24,037
they trust me to just keep that to myself.

294
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,718
And people talk about siloing in a really negative way

295
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,459
because it means it's a breakdown of communication.

296
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,380
But I actually think sharing everything

297
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,760
can sometimes be an unnecessary burden

298
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,701
when people are trying to focus on things

299
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,462
that they need to focus on.

300
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,375
And a practical management tool that I learned from my friend Tanya Short at Kitfox,

301
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,959
and I think that this is a very common tool that I just didn't know because I didn't know what I was doing,

302
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,763
is having bi-weekly check-ins with the team that are one-on-ones.

303
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,626
And I think what's really interesting with that, it's like you just sit down and you talk,

304
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,489
and you're like, how are you doing? How do you feel emotionally right now?

305
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,571
Like, how do you feel about work? What's going on in your life?

306
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:08,664
Is everything good? Are you happy? Is there something that's making you unhappy?

307
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:13,627
And can I help with that? And I think what's interesting when we're having that conversation as equals

308
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:16,789
instead of an employer and employee relationship,

309
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,752
they don't tell me what they think they want me to hear, right?

310
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,754
They tell me the honest truth.

311
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:27,637
And we can have that kind of discussion as equals, and I think that that really levels the playing field.

312
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,438
And I understand where...

313
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:32,951
everyone is at and they understand where I'm at on an emotional level.

314
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,153
And I think that that goes such a long way.

315
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,475
Like if I could boil down this whole talk, it's kind of like

316
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,357
be on equal levels and keep in touch on your emotions,

317
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,939
and that's making video games, honestly.

318
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,443
And something that I think is bad advice

319
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:49,066
that I heard a lot when we were getting started was

320
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,147
just focus on your game.

321
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,068
Don't worry about building a company.

322
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:52,729
And...

323
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:55,615
This might be good advice for some people,

324
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:56,915
but I actually think it's terrible

325
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,656
because it doesn't really prepare you

326
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,316
for a post-ship reality.

327
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:03,977
And we treat our game development

328
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:06,818
as if every game that we're going to make

329
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:08,298
is going to bring in zero revenue.

330
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:09,979
And that's how I think,

331
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,419
that's one of our most important survival strategies

332
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,140
is like, if we make stuff

333
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,060
and we think it's going to do zero sales,

334
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,661
what do we need to do to stay in business?

335
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,862
And one of those,

336
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,242
and then even if you do think

337
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:23,202
your game's going to be successful.

338
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,015
depending on the kind of funding you have,

339
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,257
you might not actually see any money anyways

340
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:29,919
because someone else is recouping from your sales.

341
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,440
So you need to figure something out.

342
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,542
And one of the things that we do is contract work.

343
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,245
And contracts are integral to keeping co-op alive.

344
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,046
But they can also be a trap.

345
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,728
It can be an emotional trap

346
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,549
because sometimes bad contracts happen

347
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:45,190
and you're stuck working on something

348
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,731
that you really despise or hate,

349
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,052
and that can be really difficult.

350
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:49,333
But even when it's good,

351
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,195
you can end up in a trap where

352
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:56,676
You basically do a contract, it pays you fine,

353
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,817
and then you're at the end of it, and you're like,

354
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:01,659
well, now I need money again, so I need to do another contract,

355
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,100
and you can't break out of that cycle.

356
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,001
And that's something that I've seen happen a lot.

357
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:10,745
So what we do is we split the studio to do both contracting and original work,

358
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:11,605
if possible.

359
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:15,488
And I think that this ties into being a co-op, actually,

360
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:19,070
and our ownership, because we're not, like,

361
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,092
contracting out a B team to work on contract work.

362
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:27,385
We're taking the people that we've been working with since the start and are putting them on contracts.

363
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,286
And I think that we trust them to do that.

364
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:35,628
And we know that that work is feeding into this collective pot that's keeping us all alive.

365
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,049
And what we try to do is when contracts wrap up,

366
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:43,511
is we switch the team that was working on one contract to then be working on original work,

367
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:47,652
while the other team that was working on original to take on a contract and sharing that responsibility.

368
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,113
And I think we can only do that.

369
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,928
because we're all on the same level and that we all trust each other.

370
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,591
And it also means that we're getting contract work that's based on

371
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,513
our specific reputation and our specific experience and work,

372
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,795
which is really, really important in terms of getting good contracts.

373
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,239
And finally, I think I want to talk a little bit about money and

374
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,580
how to give it away.

375
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,636
So I think one of the things that we do is we have this approach where we take whatever money we have and we put it into benefits like healthcare.

376
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:28,921
We do internship and mentorship programs, and we do things like funding for co-op, for colab, sorry.

377
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,704
And honestly, at the end of the day, fuck money.

378
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:41,751
Because I think, you know, regardless of how much someone invests, it doesn't really matter because money and capitalism change our expectation of how to work with people.

379
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:44,533
And I think that that change of expectation...

380
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,163
really changes how you, it causes exploitation to happen

381
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,644
because it creates a class system essentially

382
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,445
of who has money and who doesn't.

383
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,807
And I think that when you reconsider

384
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:57,947
your relationship with money,

385
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:01,289
you start to reconsider how to have a more ethical

386
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,690
and kinder, sustainable way to think about work

387
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,951
and relationships with people.

388
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,132
And I think that that's a more survivable model

389
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:11,254
that's more emotionally sustainable in the future.

390
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,816
And so at the end of the day, I say fuck money.

391
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:15,802
And that's my talk.

392
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:39,327
I have a big question on how you actually do make the company decisions.

393
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:44,671
Is it a vote based or it seems like you guys all have roles so maybe there's a specific

394
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,212
role for making the final decision?

395
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:51,756
Yeah, so the question is like how we actually make decisions on a day to day basis in a

396
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:53,177
more practical sense, right?

397
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:56,539
And I think yeah, it is a voting based thing where whenever we have

398
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,133
like whenever we have small decisions that are in my domain or in someone else's domain,

399
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:03,855
we'll just make the decision and trust. But whenever there's a bigger thing,

400
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:10,200
we call a team meeting, usually once a week on a Friday or something, and we get some drinks and

401
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,424
have a big meeting for one to two hours and just fill in everyone on what's been going on,

402
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:20,509
and then put things to a vote. And we do majority vote. And so far, in my experience,

403
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,571
there's almost never been a situation where

404
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:24,962
We've never had a split decision.

405
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,803
And when there are things that are a bit more contentious,

406
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:31,084
I'll first have one-on-ones with everybody to talk about things

407
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:33,985
and then come together and have a team meeting and then just vote.

408
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:35,306
Thank you.

409
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,727
This was a really great talk. Thank you very much.

410
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,228
I've been actually sort of considering something like this.

411
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,830
I'm in Baltimore and I'm sort of thinking about putting something like this together.

412
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,411
But one question that keeps coming up is how intellectual property works

413
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,812
in a system like this, in a structure like this.

414
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,333
And keeping in mind the sort of the fuck money ethos,

415
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:52,653
like...

416
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,298
How do people who all own the company deal with,

417
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:57,959
if one person does eventually leave,

418
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,021
their ownership of that intellectual property once they go?

419
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,762
Yeah, so the question is,

420
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,683
how do you handle intellectual property

421
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,164
when you have this sort of structure

422
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,965
where everyone's sharing responsibility and ownership

423
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,145
and what happens if someone leaves?

424
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:11,486
I think that's a really great question

425
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:12,927
and that's something that we've thought about.

426
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,968
And at first we were really attached to the idea

427
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,289
that IP stays with the individual

428
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:19,590
and is licensed to the company.

429
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,451
And we shifted to a model that,

430
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:25,395
is different because certain funding actually requires the company to own the IP

431
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,376
to cover some Canadian funding.

432
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:33,278
So what we've done is, honestly, I think it's kind of an agreement right now that

433
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:37,800
because of the way our company works, every artist sometimes leads a project.

434
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,221
And it's their baby.

435
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:43,782
And we all get really invested in that, and we all take on that ownership.

436
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:47,044
But we know that there's a creative lead for every project.

437
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:51,025
And at the end of the day, it's their decision what to do whenever there's issues.

438
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:55,818
And if they were to leave, I don't imagine us ever working on that project,

439
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,538
because it wouldn't feel like it's our own.

440
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:02,761
And I wouldn't want to make a game on something that I don't feel like I actually own.

441
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,901
Do you know what I mean?

442
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:04,161
Yeah.

443
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:04,981
Does that make sense?

444
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,302
Yeah, absolutely. Yep. Thank you.

445
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:06,642
Thank you.

446
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:09,463
Hi, thanks for your talk.

447
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:14,964
So I feel like I might be the only one who thinks this is kind of like an anarchistic model,

448
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:19,706
but I really, really love it. I was just curious how you kind of

449
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:23,487
prevent the anarchy, other ways apart from just voting,

450
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:32,830
from like co-op and anarchy seem to be antithetical to each other. So what are some more examples? And also how

451
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,371
do you make up all those spokes? Like do you have a different type of

452
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:42,215
Gaming company model wise, if you could break down the roles as well.

453
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:43,476
Two questions, sorry.

454
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:48,460
Okay, so I think in terms of how things don't fall apart into lacking structure,

455
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,082
is that I think having a production model is really important.

456
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,724
Being a producer and being like, this is how we structure our days

457
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:56,966
and this is what we're going to focus on on any given days.

458
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,107
But I think people just kind of...

459
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,209
When I talked about the team fit,

460
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,471
I think we're all kind of people who gel really well together

461
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:05,812
politically and ideologically.

462
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,197
And so we're all working, we always feel like we're moving together in the same direction.

463
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,418
So I don't know if that really answers that part.

464
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:14,959
Did you all start out together?

465
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,041
Four of us did. We're now seven people.

466
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:22,223
And so we started four and we hired over the six years three more people.

467
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,944
Okay, so your hiring process maybe?

468
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:28,806
Yeah, so for our hiring process it's not like you just get hired and suddenly you're an owner.

469
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:32,408
There's like a six to twelve month probationary period where...

470
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:37,334
We often will work with someone, and you hire on their own project, like a small game that's

471
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:40,714
like a one to two months and just feel out if this makes sense for us.

472
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:44,395
But also if this makes sense for them, if they want to continue with this sort of model.

473
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:49,896
And then, depending on how things go, it kind of ramps up in terms of ownership to equal

474
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:50,176
level.

475
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:50,856
Okay.

476
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:51,756
Like vested type?

477
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:52,896
Yeah, exactly.

478
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,416
Thank you so much.

479
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:53,997
You're welcome.

480
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:57,617
Hey there.

481
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:58,137
Hello.

482
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:58,637
I'm Dan.

483
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,317
I'm a student for you.

484
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,938
I'm a student for you.

485
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:14,817
You say fuck money and well that's an admirable goal. At some point you have to have seven people be able to pay their rent and have their kids go to school. How do you reconcile that?

486
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:23,483
So the question is how to reconcile a fuck money approach when you need money to survive.

487
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:30,008
And I think what my point would be is that I think money is important. I just think fuck money.

488
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:30,769
Like, it's...

489
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,109
Like, money is really important.

490
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,350
You need money and you need to make decisions that bring in money so that you can survive.

491
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,671
But once you have an excess of that money, what you do with it, I think, is really important.

492
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:47,572
And instead of just sitting on it and, like, making our runway longer, we'd prefer to spend

493
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,833
it on things and give it away, if possible.

494
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:50,553
Cool.

495
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:50,853
Thank you.

496
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:52,833
Hi.

497
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:53,814
Hi again.

498
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:54,474
Lewis here.

499
00:25:56,062 --> 00:26:00,583
In the beginning of your talk, you mentioned briefly on your initial goal of going with

500
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:05,505
a label-like, music label-like structure.

501
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:09,286
I thought that was really interesting, but you said it kind of fell apart, but you didn't

502
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:10,166
go into detail.

503
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:15,068
Do you mind going into detail on what actually was the downfall or the pitfall of it?

504
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:19,809
Yeah, so the question is that I talked a little bit about being inspired by indie record labels,

505
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,070
but how that didn't work out for us, and why didn't it work out for us.

506
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:27,055
So some of the projects that I mentioned were cancelled projects, those were all in our

507
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:30,397
one year of being an indie record label in terms of our structure.

508
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:35,378
And I think it was just a matter of like, I think it's inexperience at the end of the

509
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:38,179
day that kind of killed us in our first year with that model.

510
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,001
And I think it was a really important model because that inspiration collected a group

511
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:45,522
of people who were like-minded and were inspired by that.

512
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:50,638
At the end of the day, we didn't really know what we were doing, and we didn't realize how overly scoped our projects were,

513
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:54,819
and I didn't know how to be a producer for five different projects at the same time,

514
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,619
including my own that I was working on.

515
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,141
So, if you were to go back in time, would you say the model is still viable,

516
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:05,622
but you guys weren't experienced on how to handle a model like that, or is it just a bad model?

517
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,263
No, I think that that model is really, really powerful and really...

518
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:14,170
exciting and something I'd love to explore more. But instead of individuals working on projects,

519
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,813
I think it would be very small teams of two to three people and many small teams like that if possible.

520
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:22,196
Thank you. This is the last question.

521
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,099
You said that you handle different financial investments the same.

522
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,463
I was wondering if you've had to handle different time investments the same, people that have 20 hours a week versus 60.

523
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,492
Yeah, so the question is how we handle time investments

524
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:37,413
across people.

525
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:39,694
So originally, everyone was working.

526
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:41,676
We still kind of work all on our own schedules,

527
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:44,058
but we have an office together, and people

528
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:47,660
have to come into the office at least three days a week.

529
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:52,083
And what we do, essentially, is everyone kind of puts

530
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:54,125
in 30 to 40 hours a week.

531
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,586
And then after that, it's just kind of like, yo, fuck it,

532
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:57,027
go home.

533
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:57,627
It doesn't matter.

534
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:59,068
Because I think it doesn't matter

535
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:01,270
if you're doing 30 hours or 60 hours at the end of the day.

536
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,271
It doesn't really change much.

537
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:03,692
So everyone just.

538
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,166
is kind of trusted to meet their responsibilities

539
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,090
in whatever way they see fit at the end of the day.

540
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,616
Great, thank you everyone.
