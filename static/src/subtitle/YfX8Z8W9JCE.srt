1
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:08,928
Thank you all for getting up early this morning,

2
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:12,129
or alternatively, not having gone to bed yet.

3
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:17,070
Feel free to keep your cell phones on ring

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,091
so that when they go off, it'll wake people up.

5
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:26,773
This is a talk a bit different to my usual talks.

6
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:32,415
However, I do tell you things that I've never,

7
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,036
I haven't actually told anybody else before.

8
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:38,486
about the origins of mud.

9
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:41,787
So you're getting some historical data here.

10
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:45,208
And 50 years from now, interviewers

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:49,690
looking to rake up dirt on the origins of these virtual worlds

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,531
will come to you and say, what did he say at that conference?

13
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:57,432
And you'll say, I don't know.

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:57,852
I was asleep.

15
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:57,992
Right.

16
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,714
So the reason that I've been asked to talk here

17
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,354
is because I co-wrote.

18
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,149
the very first virtual world, MUD.

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:14,496
Almost all today's massively multiplayer online role-playing games

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,461
descend directly from MUD, but that isn't actually relevant.

21
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:29,388
What's relevant is that we hadn't ever played one before.

22
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:32,551
So, it wasn't that...

23
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:38,325
We were first that was important, it was just the fact that when we wrote it we were unaware of any others.

24
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:43,867
We weren't the only people in this position, these things, we were always going to get them,

25
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:48,108
they'd been invented many times, about six or seven times independently,

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,050
and we would have got them anyway, whether Roy or I had done it, somebody else would,

27
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,170
and perhaps other people did do it.

28
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,452
But the important thing from the point of view of this talk is that when we did it,

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,653
we didn't have anything else to base it on.

30
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:10,137
which means we had to establish some principles, some guidelines.

31
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:18,884
We had to form some views on what it was we were making and why we were making it.

32
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:23,607
Because it wasn't just a simple case of, well, let's take that one there and make it better.

33
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:27,570
Because there was nothing to take to make better.

34
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,191
And that's why...

35
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:37,724
talking about here may be of interest because you get to find out why some of the things

36
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,284
that are in MMOs are in MMOs.

37
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,706
I hope you've all picked up your future antiques.

38
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:50,971
These are 25 years old, so older than some of the people in the audience.

39
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:56,474
Yeah, they've all got to go, so if you need them for, I don't know, jimmying open Yale

40
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,475
locks or something, just take as many as you want.

41
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:05,218
Now, this isn't meant to be a history lesson.

42
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:10,061
I'm not going to be just standing up here and telling you this happened and this happened

43
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,363
and this happened as historical chronological facts because that's not interesting.

44
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:15,084
You want to know why it happened.

45
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:22,309
There are some other things which typically when you're talking about historical things,

46
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:26,872
areas I could go into, but I'm not going to go into them.

47
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,393
Like why doesn't my zapper work?

48
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,507
So I won't be talking about how large our computers were.

49
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:35,408
You know, they would fit in this room.

50
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,648
Wong would fit in this room.

51
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,829
But that's not really relevant, you know,

52
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,789
the weakness of the computers.

53
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,770
It'll get mentioned once a bit later, but that's about it.

54
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,451
I won't be telling you how great text is over graphics,

55
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:54,312
because that's an argument that I've won many times

56
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:54,872
and still lost.

57
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:56,292
Thank you.

58
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:02,905
I won't be telling you how great permadeath is.

59
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:05,626
But hey, because God uses it, it can't be bad.

60
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:13,287
I won't be telling you how great it is when you've got customer

61
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,928
service of 10 customers per one customer service person.

62
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,469
That's really good to have.

63
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,809
You can really keep your players in line.

64
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:24,550
Except nowadays, you've got to pay these people.

65
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:26,947
So it's a bit more expensive, a bit harder.

66
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:28,848
So I won't be going into any kind of detail

67
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:32,650
about how we used to manage the games back then.

68
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,792
And I won't be trying to tell you how we extracted money

69
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:41,434
from them and what legal systems we used or rather didn't care

70
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:41,794
about.

71
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:47,057
So none of this, which might be of historical use to some people

72
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:48,797
to you to find out how do things work in the old days,

73
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,478
because of intellectual curiosity.

74
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,979
I'm not going to be talking about that so much.

75
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,980
Instead, what I'm going to be.

76
00:04:55,583 --> 00:05:02,008
aiming at is discussing if I am to create a world, which is what Roy Chubshaw and I

77
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:10,454
wanted to do, how shall it be, what's the world going to be like, and why? That's the

78
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:17,238
question that I'm going to be answering. Oh, this is a picture of a snowman standing in

79
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:24,463
a furnace in World of Warcraft. Right.

80
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:30,388
When Roy Chupchell started to work on Mudd,

81
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:35,009
his main, the main thing that interested him

82
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,570
was the kind of the machinery.

83
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,710
It was like building one of those,

84
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,331
what do you call them out here?

85
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,352
Those machines where you turn the crank

86
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,852
and all these different things happen,

87
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,513
Rube something or other.

88
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,753
Rube Goldberg, okay, yeah,

89
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:49,714
we don't call him that in Britain.

90
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:53,635
We call him after our particular same guy.

91
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,722
who are equivalent, but I don't remember his name either.

92
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,423
So Roy was kind of like, I want to build this intricate machine

93
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:04,865
and then set it going and, whoa, look, it works.

94
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:10,988
But also, he was interested in making

95
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:17,371
a world that was separate from and hopefully superior

96
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,172
to reality.

97
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,713
You see, when you're 17, 18, 19, you

98
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,034
don't figure that it's going to take.

99
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,341
50 years to make one of those.

100
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:28,842
You just think, well, I can see how to do that.

101
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,644
Yeah, yeah, I'll start.

102
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:35,966
From my point of view, I was more interested

103
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,388
in the world creation side.

104
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:39,168
I wanted to build.

105
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:43,651
It was the world making that was my interesting thing.

106
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:50,175
However, I also had a fascination with systems.

107
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:57,894
Roy was mainly, he wanted to make a machine that worked so he could get this world working.

108
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:01,897
I wanted this world working, but I kind of liked making the machinery that would work

109
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:01,977
it.

110
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:03,418
So we sort of balanced quite well.

111
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:09,803
Roy could have done the other stuff, but it was just that's where his interests mainly

112
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,886
lie and I could have done the other stuff, but that's where my interests mainly lie,

113
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,848
but we both did both things.

114
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:19,650
So from both these points of view.

115
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:26,934
the point of view of wanting a machine which was operating a world so that you, when you

116
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,535
entered the world, you felt you were in it.

117
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,236
And from the point of view of creating a world that was separate from the real world, so

118
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:40,818
it didn't feel like the real world, it felt like a different world, it was important for

119
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:47,139
both of us that the players would feel that they were part of that world, that when they

120
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,100
visited it, they were in it.

121
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:54,149
the underlying systems were all wrong, then they wouldn't feel like they were in the world,

122
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,491
and then that wouldn't validate it. But if they felt it was right and it was natural

123
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:01,353
and it was working how it should be, then that would validate it.

124
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:06,376
Likewise, if we wanted people to visit a world that was not the real world, it should actually

125
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:09,497
be persuasive enough that they would think, yeah, this is kind of good,

126
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:13,560
this is a real world in its own terms, you know, just like

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,322
when you read a book and you're immersed in a book and you're transported off to

128
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,422
Middle Earth.

129
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:21,848
It was like that sort of idea.

130
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,910
So, nowadays it's called immersion.

131
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,732
We just wanted, we didn't have a word for it back then,

132
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:33,736
we just wanted you to believe you were a part of the world.

133
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,897
Because then, once you've got that,

134
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:38,599
then it shows that your programming is working.

135
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,081
If you want to see, if I put the marble here,

136
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,942
all the dominoes and everything collapses

137
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:45,103
and it all goes out in this wonderful spread,

138
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:48,125
and it works, well that kind of makes you feel good about your programming.

139
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:56,391
but it also meant that we could give people what the thing was about, which was pretty well liberty.

140
00:08:56,391 --> 00:09:00,874
We wanted people to be able to escape the confines of the real world,

141
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,298
to try on new identities, to be new, not so much new people,

142
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:10,742
but to try and find out the people they really were.

143
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:15,986
I've explained this before in the past, where we had...

144
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:23,214
Computing department, 1978, England, not a lot of girls around.

145
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:28,636
Actually, yeah, I was going to say, after 30 years and it went in different.

146
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:35,959
I managed to marry one of the two girls, two years below me.

147
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,281
So there's not a lot of girls around, not a lot of social graces, everybody sort of

148
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,922
tries not to interact with the rest of the student body, because if you speak to a girl . . . . . . . . . . . . .

149
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:49,055
and you're

150
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,697
basically a nerd or a geek or whatever, I'm geek son of nerd

151
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:56,840
and it doesn't really matter what you look like, how charming you are

152
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:03,324
they're going to say, alright, you see this, this is your heart.

153
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,821
So it's not really, you know, they wouldn't ever go because they're completely outgunned.

154
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:12,144
But if you've got a virtual world, then people can go in there and they can practice their social graces,

155
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,507
not like girls, but just actually practice being social to people,

156
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:19,149
helping each other, talking, chatting,

157
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,332
which you wouldn't really want to do normally because,

158
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:27,674
well, you know, people might talk.

159
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:27,795
So.

160
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:34,214
the worlds were created, and that was kind of the thing, we wanted to make a world which was separate from the real world.

161
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:46,558
Now when Roy first started working on MUD, the first thing he wanted to do was to make sure the technology worked, that he could actually have the mechanism that underpinned it all.

162
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:52,200
And that took him about an hour, programming in machine code, macro ten assembler.

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,681
Yeah, I can send messages from one player to another player.

164
00:10:57,222 --> 00:11:02,486
via a mechanism which I could also use for storing a shared world. Okay, there you go.

165
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:08,992
Roy's a really fast programmer. The next thing he decided to do was to implement the physics

166
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:13,916
of the world. He didn't know what the world was going to look like at this point. He was

167
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:19,741
just building the physics, building the mechanisms that underpinned what the world would do.

168
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:26,766
That took him about a month before he started hitting walls and he couldn't do things on

169
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:31,076
Maybe I shouldn't break it down to molecule level of chemistry.

170
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,956
Maybe I should just have like liquid.

171
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:40,400
Now, supposing today somebody came along and said, hi, look.

172
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,960
I've just won the lottery.

173
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,441
Here's $30 million.

174
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,942
You can go off and make your own MMO.

175
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:47,623
I don't care if it sucks.

176
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,703
I don't care if anybody plays it.

177
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,224
Just go make one and have fun.

178
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,745
Well, you might think, well, what shall I make it?

179
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,626
Shall I make it like a, hey, I've got an idea.

180
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,647
I could make it like a fantasy world.

181
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,955
You might think of what genre it was going to be.

182
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,216
You might think, oh, OK, right, it's going to be this guy.

183
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:04,516
All right.

184
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,278
And you sit down and maybe you draw a map just so that, oh,

185
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,159
yeah, I can have the good guys over here and the bad guys

186
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,141
over here and this big block in the middle for my future

187
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:16,722
expansions.

188
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:21,324
But you wouldn't think what's the physics going to be like.

189
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,864
But this is actually premature.

190
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:26,066
That's essentially a marketing point.

191
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,322
what kind of game would I like to play?

192
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,904
But you're not making a game that you're...

193
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:32,666
If you're a game developer,

194
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,587
you don't make games that you want to play.

195
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,691
You make games that you want to develop.

196
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,472
Because if you want to play them, you're a player.

197
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:43,295
Developer, you're a developer.

198
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,356
And I get prospective students come to me,

199
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,137
and I interview them.

200
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,839
One of the questions I ask them is,

201
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,781
why do you want to study computer game design?

202
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:54,244
And they say, well, ever since I was a small child...

203
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,344
I've always been fascinated with computer games.

204
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,945
I love playing computer games.

205
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,566
Okay, so, do you like beer?

206
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:05,430
Or, why aren't you doing a degree in brewing?

207
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,752
Because...

208
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:11,214
Brewing is nothing to do with drinking beer.

209
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,955
It's to do with making beer.

210
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,958
Developing computer games isn't to do with playing games.

211
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,239
It's to do with developing the game.

212
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,060
Um...

213
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,240
So...

214
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,491
If you start thinking like this, you're thinking like, what are my players doing?

215
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,572
You're kind of defining the people who are going to play it.

216
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:33,533
But that's kind of premature because you're already falling into a mindset of

217
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:38,115
what kind of people are going to play, not what are the tools in my toolbox that I could enable.

218
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:45,736
Sometimes when you see a tool, it can help you think of some other group that you haven't thought of.

219
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:48,917
So if you start by developing the...

220
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,521
thinking about the world, then you're already making assumptions about what it's possible

221
00:13:55,521 --> 00:14:04,143
to implement. If you start by working on the physics, what can we implement, then that

222
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:10,824
could go beyond what you supposed to be possible. So if you start writing your game and you're

223
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:14,865
basing it on the previous game that you liked really, but except that 10% that was no good

224
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,445
that sucked and you want to...

225
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,934
write your new one that's the same except with 10% better that doesn't suck.

226
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:23,657
Well, that's a nice evolutionary approach, but

227
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:28,741
you might be missing some things that you think aren't possible to implement

228
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:31,383
because the previous person didn't implement them.

229
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:35,326
But maybe they didn't implement them because the previous person to them didn't implement them.

230
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:40,530
And maybe they're perfectly possible to implement, you just haven't really thought of it.

231
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,991
You're just following a paradigm.

232
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,893
But if you don't have a paradigm, like Roy and I didn't...

233
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,905
you have to think about these things from scratch.

234
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:51,827
So Roy was thinking, what can I implement?

235
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:54,488
And then knowing what I can implement,

236
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:59,970
what can I use it to implement?

237
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,432
Roy and I figured that there was another good reason

238
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:11,154
for trying to put physics and other basic science

239
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:14,275
into virtual worlds.

240
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:23,202
This is news to many people in this part of the world, but there's this wacky theory called

241
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:33,547
evolution where humans have, so the story goes, developed over millennia.

242
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:40,011
The way they are is pretty much because if they hadn't been like that 40,000 years ago,

243
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:43,973
they would have been eaten by bears.

244
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:50,097
One of the things that the human brain has got through evolution

245
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:55,321
is an ability to understand the world and process it in an instant.

246
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,584
I can look out here and I can see people

247
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:03,968
because my brain is taking all your images and converting them into people in my head.

248
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:07,391
I can't stop it, I just see it because it's being done automatically for me.

249
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:09,292
But if I was to look out here and I think,

250
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:14,196
what the hell, that's a Dalek, that's not a person, that's actually quite bad.

251
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:21,386
that would be something I would notice because it's different to what my brain is doing automatically for me the whole time.

252
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:25,469
If I look down here I can see that I'm above the ground.

253
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:29,993
But I don't have to think about it, I just see it because I've got stereoscopic vision

254
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:33,235
and all these millions of processes are going around in the back of my head and saying,

255
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:36,597
you know, that's kind of a bit further away than that.

256
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,420
So the brain will do all these things for you.

257
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,802
But when there's a dissonance, when there's something different between...

258
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:47,673
what you see and what happens, then the brain notices,

259
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,314
and, well, that's not all right.

260
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:54,175
And that's the point at which either immersion is broken

261
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:57,396
or you require an explanation.

262
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:04,198
So what we wanted, when we were designing MUD,

263
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:09,199
we wanted people to believe that they were in the world.

264
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,820
Therefore, we should put as few barriers.

265
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:18,389
to them to persuade them that they weren't in the world as possible.

266
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:23,532
If you're playing and things keep happening that don't make sense, you will notice it

267
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:27,694
and it will interrupt and too much of that and you will think, well, I'm not actually

268
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:37,039
in a world, I'm just looking at this series of inputs which are not in any way natural,

269
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,760
they're all different.

270
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:46,800
Because of that, we tried to make the world appear to be as realistic as we could.

271
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,423
So things should happen like you'd expect them to happen.

272
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:57,327
And when they didn't, that's where people should think that there was a reason for it.

273
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:03,051
So if you go into a world and I close a door and a window opens.

274
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:06,033
Well, hold on, I tried to close a door and a window opened.

275
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,434
Now, either that's a bug.

276
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:09,815
Oh, did I type door?

277
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:10,796
Oops, that should have been.

278
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:13,343
window back in the code, I'll just change that. Or, you say,

279
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,024
oh, there must be some kind of connection between the door and

280
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,065
the window. Maybe if I shut the door and the window opens, that

281
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,866
means I can get out of the window and then people try to

282
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,088
get in. They would get in and the window would shut and they

283
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,849
wouldn't know where I'd gone. Ah, yeah. But, so you can have

284
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:29,710
reasons for things, but you've always got to have an

285
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,853
explanation for them. If there's no explanation, then either

286
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:37,954
it's a bug or they shouldn't notice it at all.

287
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,627
So, one of the, the rule that we sort of had was,

288
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:46,589
if you haven't got a reason not to conform to reality,

289
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,630
conform to reality.

290
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,312
So if there's no reason not to do something,

291
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:56,094
not to do something the same way that real life does it,

292
00:18:56,094 --> 00:19:00,277
well, do it the same way real life does it.

293
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:05,040
Because that way, people aren't constantly being

294
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,642
challenged to suspend their disbelief in this world.

295
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:12,753
if their brain is saying, yeah, that's how it should happen,

296
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:15,074
that's how it should happen, that's how it should happen,

297
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:17,456
it's much easier to become immersed.

298
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,456
And this was a theory.

299
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:22,659
Roy and I actually discussed this, and that's why we did it.

300
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,942
Well, that's why we made it more simulationary

301
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:30,504
than you might do today.

302
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:37,309
Conform, when I say here, it's not actually in great detail.

303
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,091
So for us, it's things like.

304
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:45,350
If you're carrying an icicle, well, it's kind of going to melt after a while.

305
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,233
Maybe if you stay in a cold area, it won't melt.

306
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,995
But if you go into a desert, well, it's going to melt, isn't it?

307
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:52,615
Because it's ice.

308
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,337
Why would anybody carry ice around and it not melt?

309
00:19:55,337 --> 00:20:05,125
However, we wouldn't go to the level of Q equals HA T2 minus T1.

310
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,587
That's only just part of the equation.

311
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:08,708
You've actually got to...

312
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:13,628
figure out the reduced surface area due to the melting ice and then you've got to integrate

313
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:19,570
it over time. It's kind of tricky, but most people don't do that sort of thing in their

314
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,852
head. To a player, if you are playing a game and you've got an icicle and it doesn't melt,

315
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:30,374
well that doesn't make sense. Why didn't it melt? Is it like a magic icicle? Well in that

316
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:36,937
case, can I do things with it? Zap! And yet, in World of Warcraft, I've got a, my warlock

317
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,717
is carrying around the...

318
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:48,324
same glass of milk in her backpack that she's had for four years.

319
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:52,745
That should be some kind of living cheese by now.

320
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:58,168
Plays don't count as dirty nudges, but it should make sense.

321
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:00,188
Why hasn't it gone horrible?

322
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:05,050
And there are actually, you know, game play opportunities you can do with things like

323
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,491
if you've got ice melting.

324
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:16,335
So, when I talk about physics, it's not down at the collision detection, billiard ball

325
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:18,877
level, it's this kind of thing.

326
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,299
Light cannot pass through a closed wooden door.

327
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:30,105
If I'm in a room and there's no light in the room, there's light outside, I shut the door,

328
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:30,525
I can't see.

329
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,747
That's the kind of thing.

330
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:36,630
Of course, most MMOs don't have doors these days.

331
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,781
You walk into an inn in Goldshire and, hey, no doors.

332
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,802
But who stole all the doors?

333
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:49,307
Is there like a stack of doors somewhere?

334
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:53,849
Um, what happens when you pour four noggins of water

335
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,151
into a glass that holds three noggins?

336
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:58,352
You could do this in mud.

337
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:00,333
Got a glass here that holds three pints.

338
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,234
Jug here holds four pints.

339
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,115
Pour it into there.

340
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,456
You end up with a glass of three pints and a jug of one pint.

341
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:06,516
Yeah.

342
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:10,113
How many MMOs can do that today? Why can't they do it?

343
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:13,916
Plate armour doesn't float.

344
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,197
Yeah. I know that

345
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:20,981
these special carbon fibres where they incorporate

346
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:28,166
bubbles into the plate armour. Barbarossa was

347
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,248
like a middle European

348
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:34,150
leader who, on the Crusades...

349
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:40,727
got really hot and decided to go for a swim in a stream.

350
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:44,268
He was so desperate that he didn't take his armor off.

351
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:45,849
And he never came out.

352
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:52,012
So when I talk about physics or anything like this,

353
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:53,992
what I'm basically saying is that it's

354
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:58,494
what an uninformed player would regard

355
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:03,296
should happen without evidence otherwise.

356
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:03,817
Be fine.

357
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,513
hit you with a sword, what should happen is your head should fall off.

358
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:15,535
What would happen is that you would get a nasty nick and then I would be eating that sword.

359
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,977
But that's... it's just what should happen.

360
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:25,000
And if things happen as they should happen, that means you don't have to concentrate on believing the world.

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
It's just flowing there.

362
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,342
And the more it seems to be real because everything's behaving how it should do,

363
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,144
then the more inclined you are to believe that it really is real.

364
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,025
Now, this was really useful.

365
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:45,107
I mean, in a text world, there's not a lot of pictures to persuade you that this is what's

366
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:52,632
going on, and people really did get very immersed in just this simple world.

367
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:59,256
However, although the principle of mimicking reality was carried forward, the reason for

368
00:23:59,256 --> 00:23:59,576
it wasn't.

369
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:04,860
You know, if people played MUD, thought, well, that's kind of cool, but I could do better.

370
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:09,029
and so they went off on their own and some of them were better and some of them, or I

371
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,010
should say most of them were drivel, but, you know, that's the way it works, evolution,

372
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,351
some of them work, some of them don't.

373
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:22,192
But if you don't know why something's there, then that means that you're more inclined

374
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:29,994
for operational reasons or for the design reasons of your own to ignore it.

375
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:35,535
If you do know why it's there, then you're making a more informed decision.

376
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:38,555
And over time, people have kind of left this

377
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:42,056
simulationary aspect behind, to the extent where

378
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,336
it's not so much they're simulating reality,

379
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:47,657
they're simulating the previous MMO that they played.

380
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:52,498
These are some of the things which are natural

381
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:54,679
in today's MMOs, which would have...

382
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,619
they would have been mocked by the players of the 1980s.

383
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,720
I mean, they would have actually pointed at us,

384
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,920
what do you expect to play for me with this in it?

385
00:25:05,076 --> 00:25:10,158
If the goblin was carrying a sword, why was it hitting me with a stick?

386
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,719
It's got a sword. You kill it, it's got a sword.

387
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,820
What kind of dumb goblin? I wonder if people kill them.

388
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,121
They carry swords and they think they're for lighting cigars.

389
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:27,223
This is one of my favorites from Lord of the Rings Online.

390
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:28,783
I can dye armor.

391
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:29,904
Okay, just a moment.

392
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,265
Okay, so I've got plate mail and I can dye it.

393
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:39,452
I'm like, dye doesn't, doesn't that kind of maybe need some absorptive quality on the part of what you're dyeing?

394
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:42,113
But hey, okay. But I can't paint it.

395
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:49,496
So, you know, I've got this paint, I've just made this paint, worked at my crafting, I can make the paint,

396
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:51,197
but I can't paint my armour. I can only dye it.

397
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:55,318
Even this plate armour, it's like metal, you should be able to paint metal, surely.

398
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:57,579
Ah, but you can paint the walls of your house.

399
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:02,681
That's what it's for. You go into your house and you can paint the walls and think, oh my God.

400
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,230
they made it pink.

401
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,792
That's because they want me to level up my

402
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:10,574
paint making so that I can get some decent colour

403
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:12,815
instead of a pink wall.

404
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:14,957
But I can't paint any other walls.

405
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:15,897
It's like wall paint.

406
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:22,942
It's special paint that only works on the walls of my house.

407
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:23,002
Wow.

408
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:26,104
So, it just doesn't make sense.

409
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:28,625
And yet people are saying, oh, yeah, this is...

410
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:35,844
I think I kind of carried through by the visual aspect, but that's only really, can only really

411
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:41,328
take you so far. I can build a snowman in a fire and neither is affected. Yeah. You

412
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:46,092
try that in real life. You build a snowman in a fire and see whether the snowman or the

413
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:51,856
fire is, one of them is going to lose. But in World of Warcraft, no, it's just a kind

414
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:55,779
of, oh, look at the light it throws on the fire. It's magic fire and magic snow and magic

415
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,340
men.

416
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,741
I should do another one.

417
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:05,425
How come here I am, killing something, and if I step two yards that way, they'll notice,

418
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:11,690
but here, ha, I can see them, and I'm slashing away and I'm fireballs, boom, boom, boom.

419
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,115
But so long as those fireballs don't actually warm the people that are in the distance,

420
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:17,716
I can do it.

421
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,078
Aren't I stupid?

422
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:26,143
Well, yeah, really, I mean, you walk into a dungeon, armor clattering.

423
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:28,844
then there's gonna be traps set up.

424
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:30,805
There's gonna be all sorts of things happening.

425
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:33,387
And you aren't gonna be attacked by one guy

426
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:34,909
while the other one's saying,

427
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,810
okay, well I'll just see how this is going.

428
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,111
Oh God, they killed him.

429
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,633
Well, I guess I'll step up to the plate.

430
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:44,356
You guys stay back there.

431
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:44,537
Hmm.

432
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,858
This would just not make sense in a text.

433
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,361
I mean, we'd get things like,

434
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:51,362
okay, so you're being attacked by a goat

435
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:54,945
and in the same room there's this, like, thief guy

436
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:55,926
and, well.

437
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:00,044
maybe he would attack you if the goat was doing really well,

438
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,946
he might join in on the goat side,

439
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:06,951
but on the other hand, if the goat was looking like it was going to be defeated by you,

440
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,514
he might leave because he doesn't want to be the next in line.

441
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:15,699
I mean, that's the kind of little, you know, tiny little decisions that they would make,

442
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,480
but you don't get that these days, any of it.

443
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,145
It's not that these are challenging, they just haven't been considered.

444
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:25,783
I'll give you an example.

445
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:29,524
This is something from MUD2 rather than MUD1.

446
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,564
So this would be about 8T7, something like that.

447
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:32,984
We have these two things, a baton and a bow.

448
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,905
OK, they're basically just these pointers.

449
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:39,826
And if the bow's over there and I wave the baton,

450
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,926
it teleports me to the bow, drops the baton to the floor.

451
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:43,746
If I pick up the bow and I wave the bow,

452
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:47,087
it teleports me to the baton, and the bow drops to the floor.

453
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:49,888
So just a little teleport thing so people

454
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:51,428
can get around quicker.

455
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:53,834
the bow, say, into a well.

456
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,914
It would fall down the well.

457
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:58,996
Anybody who happened to be in the well could see it going past

458
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:00,736
and might be able to grab it.

459
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:02,557
It landed in the bottom where there's a river.

460
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:05,058
And it was picked up by the river, carried away

461
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:08,099
through an underground crevice that you couldn't really get through

462
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,561
for humans. There's only things like small than people could get through.

463
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:15,022
And then it would get to this grate where it would lodge.

464
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,463
And there there was a secret room.

465
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:23,232
So if you drop the bow in there and it would fall down, float down the river, get caught in it,

466
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:26,234
you could wave the bat and it would teleport you to where the bow was.

467
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,576
You pick up the bow, you're in this room that no one else can get to.

468
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:32,079
You can store all your stuff there, you can do whatever you like there.

469
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,685
You can be nasty to people and you're fleeing from a fight and then teleport there and they can't catch you.

470
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:39,426
So it was really kind of cool.

471
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:42,248
So one player did all this, realised he was safe from attack

472
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,410
because there was no other way into the room.

473
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,132
And he was right, there was no other way into the room.

474
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,278
MUD2 also had a keg of gunpowder.

475
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,500
Because we had this wall and there was this cannon facing it

476
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,221
and there was all this little puzzly thing where you had to go and get the gunpowder from a really hard place

477
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,082
and stick it in the keg, and you had to go and get this cannonball and stick it in

478
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:07,404
and then you had to set fire to it with something that wasn't too hot

479
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:11,785
because that would set the gunpowder off, but just something hot enough to set it off

480
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,666
and it would bang and you'd go in and get a bunch of points.

481
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:22,957
So he had this gunpowder. That's what it was for, but because it was gunpowder, any fire next to it, it would go boom.

482
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:33,062
So another player took the gunpowder, put it in a coracle, one of those little hide things that Iron Age people used to go on rivers.

483
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:37,504
Put the gunpowder in the coracle, set fire to the coracle, dropped it down the well.

484
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:45,388
The coracle goes down, lands in the water, doesn't get put out yet because the coracle is still burning.

485
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:51,356
floats down, catches to the end where it's stuck on the grate.

486
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:52,836
This guy's asleep in his safe room.

487
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,617
At that point, the fire spreads to the gunpowder.

488
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,838
Boom, guy is killed.

489
00:30:58,838 --> 00:30:59,518
Ha ha ha.

490
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:02,079
Serves you right for thinking you were safe.

491
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,739
Now, OK, that's a bit of emergent behavior.

492
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:08,300
But that would work on a machine which

493
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,700
had 50 players on 33 megahertz.

494
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,442
In other words, that would probably work on this.

495
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:23,922
my remote control. So, it's not sophisticated. This isn't hard to implement. Why don't we

496
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:31,747
see any of it? One thing is saying, well, this is just too hard for the players to understand.

497
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:36,670
No, no, what's hard is if you're explaining why, when you drop something in a well, it

498
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,253
doesn't actually fall down the well. That's hard.

499
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:44,685
The default is it should fall down the well, and the rivers should flow.

500
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:50,709
And that when you get into a river and you've got a backpack full of biscuits,

501
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,770
when you get to the other side you've got a backpack full of biscuit mush.

502
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,971
And that makes sense.

503
00:31:54,971 --> 00:32:03,395
But it doesn't make sense for it not to have any of these effects.

504
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:08,838
Another argument against it is it leaves the door wide open to exploits.

505
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:09,839
And it can happen.

506
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:15,746
But it only happens when you don't have a consistent physics

507
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:18,608
to do it, when you don't handle things consistently.

508
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:22,631
If it's always the case that the gunpowder will explode

509
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:27,175
when it gets too hot, then you don't get the kind of exploits

510
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,116
that you would do if it only explodes

511
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,538
under certain very specific conditions,

512
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:36,822
like it will only explode if it's in a cannon

513
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,104
or in a fire spread.

514
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:43,720
It's hard to explain without going into details,

515
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,942
but essentially, if you arrange your objects

516
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:50,523
in a class hierarchy with multiple parents,

517
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:53,805
which is probably another talk, then you

518
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,787
get a lot of this functionality for free.

519
00:32:57,787 --> 00:33:01,689
So you only have to account for exploits at a high level,

520
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,590
like explosive objects.

521
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,172
And then it's accounted for everything

522
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,333
which could possibly explode.

523
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,673
So you can cover.

524
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:15,058
this kind of thing, but it's when you've got, this all works for the gunpowder, but it doesn't

525
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,401
work for the sticks of dynamite. That's when you get the exploit. There are, however, more

526
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:28,065
legitimate reasons not to put this kind of thing in. One of them is it can annoy players.

527
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:33,227
So my World of Warcraft character has, well, one of them has 10,000 gold pieces. Well,

528
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:36,008
how much is a gold piece weigh?

529
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:41,438
British sovereign weighs about just under 8 grams.

530
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,039
So if I've got 10,000, that's 80 kilograms,

531
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,520
or in American, 176 pounds, or in English, 12 stone,

532
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,362
which is like what I weighed about 20 years ago.

533
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:58,122
So here's my life, some mage walking around

534
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:04,344
carrying a fully grown man on her back.

535
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,805
Now, yeah, you can see how that might be, okay.

536
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:10,655
Maybe we shouldn't simulate that area because that would really annoy the players.

537
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:15,058
But on the other hand, it could actually add some gameplay reasons.

538
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:23,924
The deeper the physics, the more you're able to write more subtle puzzles.

539
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:29,608
So, all that thing I was saying, you simulate reality in the absence of a reason not to.

540
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:34,771
Well, exasperating the players is a reason not to.

541
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,572
This is why in the movies...

542
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:40,034
whenever you see somebody going to the lavatory,

543
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,815
you know something bad's gonna happen.

544
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,856
Because no one would ever show you going to the lavatory

545
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:48,478
in a, you know, what's the American word for lavatory?

546
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:48,779
Restroom.

547
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:52,421
No one would show you going to the restroom in a movie

548
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:53,941
because we don't really want to know

549
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:56,723
about the personal habits of movie star characters,

550
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,924
but if they are going there, you think,

551
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:03,407
oh wow, that dinosaur's gonna so stomp on that outhouse.

552
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:06,180
So, it's like that in MMO.

553
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:12,104
In real life, everybody has to visit the bathroom every once in a while,

554
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:17,987
unless they're British royalty, when they get somebody to remove it using a hose.

555
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:20,009
The story of Princess Diana, correct?

556
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:23,931
Or if you're in Star Trek, where you get it beamed out of you.

557
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,612
So there's...

558
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:29,595
But it's not really anything to do with the game.

559
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,576
You're simulating for no purpose.

560
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,898
So you can just abstract that out.

561
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,020
Doesn't really serve a purpose, I'll keep it out.

562
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,341
People aren't going to notice so much,

563
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:39,942
but occasionally they might.

564
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:43,305
Ah, there's a fire, I've got to put the fire out.

565
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,627
Whoa, I don't have anything to put the fire out with.

566
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:50,510
Although, hold on, I do remember drinking a bottle of water about half an hour ago.

567
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,352
I'm carrying enough water inside me to put the fire out.

568
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:58,376
Therefore, I should put the fire out using natural means.

569
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,694
You could do that in mud.

570
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:03,955
You could actually piss on the fire and it would put it out.

571
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:08,137
Unless you were a female character.

572
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:08,557
We did take...

573
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:12,519
There were more than cosmetic differences between male and female characters

574
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,520
for some things.

575
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,201
The frog wouldn't turn into a prince if a male kissed him.

576
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:20,242
The line being,

577
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:21,943
he's a prince, not a queen.

578
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:25,885
Which was put in there because the gay players asked me to,

579
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:27,485
believe it or not.

580
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:35,662
So yeah, taking things out because it annoys the player is one thing, but it can squander

581
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:41,087
game play opportunities, you can get things out of the way.

582
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:49,115
Today, the modern virtual worlds, I'm assured by Google, translate that rectum universitas

583
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:53,940
is virtual world, I don't speak Latin and I don't see why anybody else should.

584
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:57,741
It's really quite superficial today as well.

585
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:00,042
Why are they so superficial?

586
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:04,985
You can do it a lot more detail and get more out of it.

587
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:13,650
This lack of understanding of immersion has now extended beyond the physics.

588
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,593
There are some things that people do just for a laugh, which break immersion.

589
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:22,304
So you go into the bank in Stormwind and the characters, this is...

590
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,706
they've got the names Olivia, Newton and John.

591
00:37:25,706 --> 00:37:28,207
Hey, that's like Olivia, Newton, John out of Greece.

592
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:32,089
Yeah, yeah, well what's that got to do with World of Warcraft?

593
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:36,591
You just spoiled my view of...

594
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:38,171
that I'm in a fantasy world.

595
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:45,335
Just because you couldn't actually think of any decent names.

596
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:45,375
So...

597
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,515
Is it really?

598
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:50,204
actually all that bad, you know, just a few jokes, you know,

599
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:53,687
tells people it's a safe space to go and this is where you can be,

600
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:57,731
hang out rather than play the game. Well, there are arguments for that,

601
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:59,813
but the point is, you have to think about it first.

602
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:05,458
If you didn't think, should I stick with names which are comical,

603
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:10,382
or should I go with names which are more immersion-making?

604
00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:13,925
If you didn't think it, then, well, you've made a mistake.

605
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:18,937
I'm not saying you shouldn't have people with these kind of names if you want to,

606
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:22,278
but you should know the consequences of it and decide,

607
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:28,539
OK, on the whole, making Stormwind feel safe and breezy and a place where you can hang out with your friends,

608
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:34,580
because it's kind of a real world interface for WoW, yeah, that would be a reason to do it.

609
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,301
But if you don't think about it beforehand, and you just do it because,

610
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:43,202
well, people seem to like a joke, well, you're missing something.

611
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:44,662
It's just a superficial level.

612
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:51,101
This is also something that people from the text mundane would be horrified with.

613
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:54,423
Lotterings online. I typed salute. What does it say?

614
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,764
It doesn't say your character salutes. No.

615
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:59,846
It says you salute smartly.

616
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:03,287
No, I didn't. My salute was like this.

617
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:09,390
It wasn't smart at all. It was sarcastic or offensive or Hitler.

618
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:10,957
But it says I salute smartly.

619
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,838
But I didn't say I wanted to salute smartly.

620
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,339
You're saying I saluted smartly.

621
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,740
I didn't salute smartly at all.

622
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,903
I saluted pathetically or ironically

623
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:20,484
or over-enthusiastically.

624
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:24,107
I could have done all these things, but no, no.

625
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,708
It just says I do it smartly.

626
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,489
Why add that stupid extra adverb?

627
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:31,573
Do you want your players to be immersed or not?

628
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:34,495
If you don't want them to be immersed,

629
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:35,195
that's fair enough.

630
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:36,717
You don't have to.

631
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:39,819
If you do want them to be immersed...

632
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:44,125
then you should do some of the more simulationary stuff.

633
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,948
But the thing is, you should actually ask yourself,

634
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,690
do you want them to be immersed?

635
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,413
And then on the basis of that, make your decisions.

636
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:55,334
Oh, here we go.

637
00:39:55,334 --> 00:40:00,818
This is Dagna the Dwarf out of Dragon Age Origins.

638
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:06,682
She's this little perky, preppy, very enthusiastic, eager-to-please character.

639
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:07,063
Why is she in...

640
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:07,523
Ah, irritating!

641
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:08,043
Um...

642
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:08,744
Okay, so...

643
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,891
Once Roy had done all the physics, it came to me to do the world.

644
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,191
We call it content now.

645
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,212
What setting was I going to give it?

646
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:20,553
There was no paradigm before and I could have chosen anything.

647
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:22,694
And I did look at multiple settings.

648
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:27,896
I wanted something that was of Earth because I wanted people...

649
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:31,877
I didn't want it to be so crazy that people couldn't understand what was going on.

650
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:33,978
I wanted it to be immersive.

651
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:37,539
So it had to be of Earth but not Earth.

652
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:45,941
So it had to be in some ways familiar so people felt they knew what it was like, but unfamiliar in its familiarity.

653
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:55,224
So everybody kind of knows what the Wild West is like, but if you go to the Wild West you don't know if it's the kind of Wild West where all the skoom arms are armed,

654
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:59,706
or if it's the kind of Wild West where all the cattle are vampiric, or what.

655
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:03,808
But you do know some things about the Wild West.

656
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,789
I decided to root it in English folklore.

657
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:11,240
These days, this is kind of called fantasy.

658
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,361
It wasn't back then.

659
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:14,702
There were very few fantasy things around.

660
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:18,384
As far as I was concerned, it was English folklore I was

661
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:22,105
using, dragons and things like that.

662
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,427
I experimented with this in a board game that I'd made about

663
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:26,648
five years earlier.

664
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:29,109
So I did know the basic settings.

665
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:31,950
I'd made some changes to the board game.

666
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,182
putting some Dungeons and Dragons kind of characters,

667
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,423
and that hadn't worked out.

668
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:41,243
It didn't really feel as if it was as arcane

669
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:44,064
as I wanted it to, so I'd take me out.

670
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,764
So, it was the same here.

671
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:48,125
I wanted the kind of the more pure form.

672
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:54,326
I wanted to make people think they knew enough

673
00:41:54,326 --> 00:41:57,787
about the world that they felt that they could survive in it,

674
00:41:57,787 --> 00:42:00,948
but disquieted enough that, well, you know,

675
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:02,008
I've read these stories.

676
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,161
Actually a lot of it was Germanic folklore.

677
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:07,982
But I've read these stories where the goats are going to come out and attack me.

678
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,703
I don't know if this is a friendly goat or not.

679
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:12,783
It wasn't friendly. It was mad.

680
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:16,444
So I didn't use any of the other things.

681
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:17,624
I'd read Tolkien.

682
00:42:17,624 --> 00:42:25,306
What Tolkien gave was a notion that you can create a self-consistent world,

683
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:26,767
but I didn't put any orcs in the mud.

684
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:29,647
I'd read Robert E. Howard, because I was a boy.

685
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,208
I didn't put any orcs in the mud.

686
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,322
I'd played Dungeons and Dragons, but I didn't use any of those things.

687
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:43,644
I just went for English folklore.

688
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,245
But that wasn't the only thing I could have used.

689
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:48,306
I thought of several things I could have used.

690
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:53,048
Here are some of the other things that were on my short list of what I could have done.

691
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:56,569
The Three Musketeers, Era France.

692
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:01,371
I played a game called En Garde, and Three Musketeers, Era France, is really fun.

693
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,732
if you're a male. It's not so much fun if you're a female, because there weren't actually all that many female musketeers.

694
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:18,617
And on the basis that we thought female characters should, female players should at least maybe have the option of playing a female character,

695
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:24,180
and they don't want to just be playing like mistresses. So we rejected that.

696
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,382
But it was on the shortlist. Scheherazade's 1001 Nights. That is an excellent area.

697
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,954
Of course it wasn't so excellent in 2000 or whenever it was when the Twin Towers were hit,

698
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:36,677
but prior to that it was certainly excellent and it will be excellent again.

699
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:43,662
Because that is such a rich culture, everybody across the world knows about the Arabian Nights

700
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:49,726
and it's got that kind of magical otherworldliness about it that I really wanted.

701
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:52,108
That would have really worked well.

702
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:56,671
Another idea I had was an escape from a prisoner of war camp thing

703
00:43:56,671 --> 00:43:57,672
where you're trapped in a...

704
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:00,518
in like Kovitz castle and you're trying to escape.

705
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:03,880
That was kind of a bit depressing though.

706
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,183
It wasn't when you escaped but then you couldn't play anymore because you'd escaped.

707
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:14,825
And this would be a surprise, the Camelot of Arthurian legend.

708
00:44:14,825 --> 00:44:19,948
That was also on my list of things because I quite like the symbolism in that.

709
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:25,290
But eventually I went for the English mythology.

710
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:28,226
And the reason I did that was because it's a continuum.

711
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:31,948
The mythology, it just goes back and back and back and back

712
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:32,809
and back in time.

713
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:33,929
It's not a fixed point.

714
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:35,671
The others are all fixed points in time.

715
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,612
But with a continuum, you can go back.

716
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:43,356
And what that allowed me to do was to, I could use time as a

717
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:44,597
metaphor for menace.

718
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:49,060
See, when you come across something in today's MMOs,

719
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,302
it's like, oh wow, this is a zone rated 31 to 35.

720
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:52,582
I'm rated 28.

721
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:53,843
It's going to be a bit tough.

722
00:44:54,702 --> 00:44:59,005
But back then, we did have what would be equivalent of zones,

723
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:04,810
but the way to flag it was, that I chose, was using time.

724
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,311
So if it came from like the 1930s,

725
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:08,653
which was about as late as we got,

726
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,934
then it was gonna be pretty well safe.

727
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:13,757
You know, a bit different, but you kind of understand,

728
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,978
you know, it's got gramophones and everything.

729
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,019
But if it comes from the 1800s,

730
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:21,582
a broken down tin mine, well, that's a bit more dangerous.

731
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:24,525
And if it comes from Neolithic times, you know,

732
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:30,580
stone circles, then you are going to die.

733
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,764
And I use it as a metaphor for many.

734
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:45,072
Now, how many designers today have the luxury of using metaphor?

735
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:50,396
Well, you all do, you just don't.

736
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:53,279
Why not? Why are you designing games?

737
00:45:54,912 --> 00:46:01,017
Um, okay, so I'm not going to gloat at your misfortune for not having my genre choice.

738
00:46:01,017 --> 00:46:03,979
Um, I'm trying to point out you still have the choice.

739
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:08,582
You can still do what these things that I'm telling you about.

740
00:46:08,582 --> 00:46:12,725
You just don't have to just take it as a day job.

741
00:46:12,725 --> 00:46:15,467
Why are you creating MMOs?

742
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:21,352
If you want to make, do it for making money, well, why aren't you working in a bank?

743
00:46:21,352 --> 00:46:23,533
My wife works for a bank. She gets three times as much money as me.

744
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:33,529
If you're doing it because you like playing the games, well, that's back to the brewing

745
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,491
argument there, you know, playing isn't the same as developing.

746
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:42,195
Besides, you won't be developing the games, you'll be developing the tools that somebody

747
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:45,937
else will be using to code the back end of a horse.

748
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:50,881
You actually developing the game, only a few people get to do that.

749
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:54,623
If you want to do it because you want to bring joy and spread and help the world, well...

750
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,287
go work on a charity.

751
00:46:56,287 --> 00:47:00,088
You know, they pay more as well, even though they're charities,

752
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:02,728
especially the animal charities.

753
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:05,889
So why are you doing it? Well, you're doing it because

754
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,009
somehow you want to express something.

755
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:09,610
And yet, people don't express things,

756
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,431
even though they've got the tools right there before them.

757
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,311
I chose fantasy because of what it

758
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:19,092
delivered in terms of resonance,

759
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:21,252
very similar to the real world, and dissonance.

760
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,632
Whoa, this bit isn't the same.

761
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,753
This is important. This is something I have to think about.

762
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,432
That's why I chose what you'd now call fantasy.

763
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:31,474
But today people don't choose fantasy for that at all.

764
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,817
They choose it because it's a well understood trope

765
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,119
and it delivers solid, knowledgeable things.

766
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,601
You just know what's going to happen.

767
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:42,303
And in today's world, if you're being progressive,

768
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:47,467
that means that your dwarves aren't drunkards

769
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:50,970
who speak with a Scottish accent.

770
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,312
So in Dragon Age, Dagner, she's...

771
00:47:54,648 --> 00:47:57,230
this little perky speech with an American accent.

772
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,090
It's great in Dragon Age.

773
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,632
All the dwarfs speak with American accents,

774
00:48:00,632 --> 00:48:05,376
and all the humans speak with English accents, which

775
00:48:05,376 --> 00:48:09,960
makes them sound like Hollywood villains,

776
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,921
but not to an English player.

777
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:12,942
Yeah, it's great.

778
00:48:12,942 --> 00:48:16,204
And you notice that in Dragon Age.

779
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:20,528
Wow, these are dwarfs, but they're not stereotypical Cossack

780
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:22,269
dancing drunkards.

781
00:48:23,243 --> 00:48:25,845
And the elves don't hug a tree after breakfast.

782
00:48:25,845 --> 00:48:28,666
They're actually rounded individuals.

783
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,027
It's been thought through.

784
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:30,887
I love Dragon Age.

785
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:35,789
Played it all the way through, and then played it all the way through again.

786
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:37,090
Because I have no life.

787
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,832
LAUGHTER

788
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:42,833
We didn't have dwarves in mud.

789
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,673
We had dwarfs.

790
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:46,994
As in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

791
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:48,395
Not Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

792
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:50,956
Many players today don't even know that the word dwarf,

793
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:52,897
when pluralized, means the same thing.

794
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:58,093
It's an S on the end, not a V-E-S, because Tolkien couldn't spell.

795
00:48:58,093 --> 00:49:08,918
If you're inventive in today's MMOs, then it's saying, well, look, we've got these new character races.

796
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:13,220
Races, that actually sounds pretty bad.

797
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,481
Isn't that kind of racist?

798
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,863
Or we've got this new class hybrid.

799
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:22,865
This is what we're calling our paladin, except we don't want you to know it's a paladin,

800
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:23,225
so it's like...

801
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:28,924
two-thirds fighter and one-third healer, maybe, or maybe this one's 40% fighter and 60% healer.

802
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:34,607
Oh, yeah. But, and we're calling it a, I don't know, lawgiver or something. It doesn't really

803
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:40,949
matter. We, in text mods, there were mods that, they had 100 classes, 100. And, and,

804
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:48,132
character races, you know, they would advertise it on the basis that they got 30 different

805
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:51,714
character races. Well, that's good. When I start off, I'm really going to know what to

806
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:52,054
choose here.

807
00:49:52,455 --> 00:50:03,119
Which selection of vowels with no consonants or consonants with no vowels am I going to be?

808
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,480
Do you even need classes?

809
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:15,543
Oh, yeah, this is a picture of a dead ox from South Africa.

810
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:22,345
Right, now, some of what Roy and I envisaged because we were, I was 18, he was 19, was overambitious.

811
00:50:22,996 --> 00:50:28,218
We hoped that the world we were going to create was going to be rich and meaningful.

812
00:50:28,218 --> 00:50:30,879
Oh man, when's this talk supposed to finish?

813
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:33,801
Like five minutes?

814
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:35,981
Ah, you say that, but you haven't got the tasers.

815
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:43,225
Roy was hoping that the game would be sufficiently richly featured to be self-sustaining,

816
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:47,787
so that what you did in the game would be enough to give you goals for things to do.

817
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,412
So he didn't put a game mechanic in it.

818
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:55,253
He set it up as a game, but with only a partial rule

819
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,174
set implied by the physics.

820
00:50:56,174 --> 00:50:59,296
So he didn't actually build in points and experience

821
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:02,378
and things like that.

822
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:04,519
But it was more EVE Online than Second Life.

823
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,802
You couldn't add random stupid content,

824
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:11,584
but you could act within the context.

825
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:15,967
However, the DEC System 10 wasn't up to this.

826
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:16,147
So.

827
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:21,606
we discussed it and we decided eventually we're going to have to gamify it, which meant

828
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:28,368
we're going to have to put, as part of the physics of the world, some game aspects. So,

829
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:33,469
things like experience points, for example. In real life, you don't have experience points

830
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:38,871
because the physics of the real life don't support it, but in a game world where we put

831
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:45,653
it in, so, yeah, that was the, it was a major change in our philosophy. I recognized that

832
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:49,028
you didn't have an obvious sense of purpose from it.

833
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:53,771
You went there and it's kind of an Alice in Wonderland, wow,

834
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:56,173
fantastic, what a wonderful world.

835
00:51:56,173 --> 00:52:00,075
But there was nothing really to do there except for

836
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,137
curiouser and curiouser.

837
00:52:02,137 --> 00:52:05,339
So I decided to put in what these days we call an

838
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,360
achievement system.

839
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,081
And I went through a number of options for an achievement

840
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,042
system, including equipment.

841
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:13,685
So the more equipment you had, the better the equipment, the

842
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:14,585
higher you were.

843
00:52:15,405 --> 00:52:18,587
That we ruled out because we didn't have the disk space to store it.

844
00:52:18,587 --> 00:52:25,952
Skills. If you were good at fighting, good at this, then your skills would increase and then you'd be better.

845
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:31,836
Levels. So you do things, you get experience points, every so often you trip a thing and you go up to the next level.

846
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:41,382
Experience points without levels. You just do things, you get experience points, and ha, whoopee, I've hit 20,000 or whatever your own goal was.

847
00:52:41,382 --> 00:52:44,664
Linked quests. You do things ultimately to try and get there.

848
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,551
achieve some objective, which would be quite hard, and the more you did it, then you'd

849
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:57,653
get harder and harder ones, kind of like a choose your own adventure.

850
00:52:57,653 --> 00:53:03,334
That we went against because it was too, too structured for what we wanted.

851
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:08,995
I did have some other ideas which I looked at, but they were a bit wacky, like democracy.

852
00:53:08,995 --> 00:53:15,156
You go up a level when everybody votes you go up a level.

853
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,464
to go with the levels, which, because I'd seen it from Dungeons and Dragons,

854
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:21,805
and I knew that you could use it as a,

855
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:24,826
for a variety of tasks rather than just one task.

856
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:29,467
Why should my sword play ability go up for having bartered with

857
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:33,729
the level thing, you just go up generally.

858
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:37,070
They're easy to understand,

859
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,991
and they gave players, because it was a level, it gave you

860
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:45,352
a sense of your current place in the social order.

861
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:45,412
Now.

862
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:50,396
This is where I'm going into an area that I've not really explored before.

863
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:51,436
I've explained about levels.

864
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,439
I mean, they've got a bunch of really good things there.

865
00:53:56,439 --> 00:54:01,482
They give you intermediate goals, and they give you a sense of having achieved things.

866
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,584
And that is why I chose levels.

867
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:08,106
The thing is that some of the other things on that list would have done that.

868
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:10,027
Equipment would have done that.

869
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,589
Skills would have done that.

870
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:18,497
So, although that is what, I mean, if levels, that is the main reason I chose levels,

871
00:54:18,497 --> 00:54:24,279
but I had also to choose between some of the other things I could have had.

872
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:30,243
It's not that levels are the only thing you can do for that.

873
00:54:30,243 --> 00:54:37,026
And what tipped the balance in favour of levels was that word, current social order.

874
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:42,009
See, Roy Trubshaw and I, are there any British people here?

875
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:42,969
Yeah, okay, right.

876
00:54:43,606 --> 00:54:48,968
you kind of, you maybe understand some of what I'm saying a bit more.

877
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:51,628
We raged against the British class system.

878
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:53,929
My accent, to you, the Americans,

879
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:56,410
sounds as though I'm

880
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,691
intelligent and erudite

881
00:54:58,691 --> 00:55:02,072
and a Hollywood villain.

882
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:06,333
But in Britain, it sounds as like I work on a farm.

883
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:09,634
Yeah? Because I've got a northern accent.

884
00:55:09,634 --> 00:55:11,235
Roy Chubshaw, he's from Wolverhampton.

885
00:55:12,082 --> 00:55:13,862
He speaks with a Wilbur Hampton accent.

886
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:15,563
What do you think you're doing?

887
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,223
Oh, I'm not doing that.

888
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,305
I'm doing this, you'll go, what do you think you're doing here?

889
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:20,805
That's the sort of Wilbur Hampton accent.

890
00:55:20,805 --> 00:55:22,026
And he sounds like he works in a factory.

891
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:26,908
And when you've got accents like that, either you adopt them,

892
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:30,790
you change them to something else, or you're stuffed.

893
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,611
I didn't see why I should change mine.

894
00:55:33,611 --> 00:55:35,032
Roy didn't see why he should change his.

895
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,552
We should change the world instead.

896
00:55:36,552 --> 00:55:40,354
We made our own world where accents didn't matter.

897
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:41,615
Do I hate voice over IP?

898
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:41,995
Yes, I do.

899
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:47,614
So this was our response.

900
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:51,456
We put in a level system because that led you out of the class system.

901
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:56,160
We only had 10 levels, you can do that kind of thing when you've got permadeath.

902
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,801
Each level had its own personality.

903
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:01,143
So you saw somebody at level 3, it was a swordsman.

904
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:04,285
You knew what being a swordsman was.

905
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:05,226
It's a level 3 thing.

906
00:56:05,226 --> 00:56:07,608
It doesn't really matter.

907
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:12,792
You get a sense of what the level was and when you rise up you get a better level.

908
00:56:13,974 --> 00:56:20,116
For example, the level just before you got to the top, level 9, was legend.

909
00:56:20,116 --> 00:56:35,962
Crucially, all that stopped you rising a level was your own expertise,

910
00:56:35,962 --> 00:56:38,063
your own skill, your own desire to go up.

911
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:43,545
There was nothing stopping you from going up a level because you were a girl.

912
00:56:44,252 --> 00:56:48,693
or because you were slightly socially inept,

913
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:51,933
or because you were from the north of England,

914
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:54,774
or because you were a Scot who didn't drink.

915
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:59,675
There was nothing to stop it. It was all down to you.

916
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:01,916
It was like meritocracy.

917
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:06,757
And it was a kind of meritocracy that everybody could succeed.

918
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:10,638
All they had to overcome was their own sense that they shouldn't succeed.

919
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:13,558
And this is why we put in levels.

920
00:57:14,728 --> 00:57:18,010
So all these people who are playing games now with levels in it,

921
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,451
you don't know it, but you're actually raging against the British class system.

922
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:24,133
It was a political statement.

923
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:28,735
I've not told that to anybody else, well, my wife,

924
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:31,817
and Roy Chubshaw, obviously, but other than that,

925
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:36,359
this is the first time I've told that.

926
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:40,722
This award I got here, no way would I get that in England.

927
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:43,003
No way at all, not a chance,

928
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:44,223
because I'm not like...

929
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,750
the right kind of person in England. Here, I'm a foreigner so you'll accept my strange

930
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:53,213
and wacky ways, but in England it's a, oh yes, what's a nut. You've done well, Piers

931
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:59,237
Howard, haven't you? Other English people would either be nodding their heads or thinking,

932
00:57:59,237 --> 00:58:05,961
well, I don't... Er... I can't help it... I was born in London!

933
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:09,723
Now, the people who wrote... I'm sorry I'm over...

934
00:58:09,723 --> 00:58:12,926
If you want to leave because it's supposed to finish,

935
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:14,707
then, you know, feel free. I won't zap you with my laser.

936
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:18,049
People who wrote MUDs who followed,

937
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:19,771
and the MMOs that followed that,

938
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:21,332
they didn't know any of this.

939
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,653
So, they just took it and added other things in,

940
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:27,476
and they didn't understand the soul behind it.

941
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:29,338
Why it was there, why it worked,

942
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:31,659
what it was saying.

943
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:35,702
So they liberally added many more levels.

944
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:36,083
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:42,101
Yeah, we've got a hundred, we've got two hundred levels, we've got so many levels that are coming out of our ears.

946
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:46,223
We don't even measure our experience points in integers.

947
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,963
We use floating points.

948
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:50,924
You laugh, they do!

949
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:53,385
They have no understanding of what they're doing.

950
00:58:53,385 --> 00:58:53,985
The point...

951
00:58:57,977 --> 00:59:01,538
You have to understand what you're doing. I don't mind people having a million points to go up a level

952
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,979
if they know why they're doing it. And that reason isn't merely,

953
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:10,322
well, let's just follow the curve around this level, you need a million.

954
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:12,082
Why do you need a million? Why? Why?

955
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:17,505
Well, because in the past it's been put... No, no, no, no, no, never mind in the past.

956
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,686
Why are you doing it?

957
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:20,526
At the moment...

958
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:26,074
Equipment, you know, gear is the preferred achievement system of the level cap.

959
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:29,916
Once you get to the top, you know, you can't get more than level X.

960
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:32,858
18 World of Warcraft for the next few months.

961
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:37,560
So, how do you advance? Well, gear. That's what you do.

962
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,682
Now, why are they doing that?

963
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:45,285
Well, because that's obviously the next thing to, you know, just, it's a way to do it.

964
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:48,607
But hold on, what's it saying?

965
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,247
It's actually.

966
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:53,249
kind of consumerist. What it's saying is

967
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:58,071
the more stuff you have, the more important you are.

968
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:01,373
Now, that's a consumerist argument.

969
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:05,234
I'm not gonna make any judgments about consumerist

970
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,776
arguments, because if you give me stuff, I'm gonna be just as happy as anybody else.

971
01:00:08,776 --> 01:00:14,618
But, if that's what you're wanting to say, if you're trying to make a

972
01:00:14,618 --> 01:00:18,320
point about doing a consumerist game, then

973
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,640
why not do a consumerist game?

974
01:00:20,293 --> 01:00:23,736
Why bother with the leveling system at all?

975
01:00:23,736 --> 01:00:25,778
Why not have the end game as the game?

976
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:29,582
Start off with everybody's the same level,

977
01:00:29,582 --> 01:00:31,323
and the more stuff you get, the more stuff you get,

978
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:31,844
and the better it is.

979
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:35,167
And you don't have to level your characters

980
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:38,350
through 80 levels of what you've done before.

981
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:42,554
See, if you know why you're doing things,

982
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:44,195
what point you're trying to make.

983
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:48,048
then you can remove the distractions

984
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:50,069
and press on with what you're really trying to say.

985
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:52,270
If you say, OK, I'm selling this game in the West,

986
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,531
West's mainly consumerist, therefore,

987
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:57,412
let's give people what they want,

988
01:00:57,412 --> 01:00:59,132
give them all the consumer goods they want,

989
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:01,433
well, why bother with a levelling game?

990
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:05,275
That's not anything to do with that, that's British class system.

991
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:07,096
What are you doing that for?

992
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,156
If you don't know that, then

993
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:10,597
you're just going to end up with these hybrid games.

994
01:01:10,597 --> 01:01:11,877
And some people tootling around

995
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:12,658
in Elwynn Forest

996
01:01:12,658 --> 01:01:14,418
because they like to tootle around in Elwynn Forest.

997
01:01:14,793 --> 01:01:19,776
shooting bears and running from Hogger, and other people who love getting up at four o'clock

998
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:24,379
in the morning to blast other people out the sky in EVE Online.

999
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:29,663
This is a man in a shop.

1000
01:01:29,663 --> 01:01:36,047
Finally, I'm sorry I'm really going over here, I'm going to turn to combat.

1001
01:01:36,047 --> 01:01:42,171
Roy thought that combat would be handled by the underlying system of the game, so the

1002
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,453
physics of the world would handle combat.

1003
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:51,823
The very first thing I personally implemented in MUD was an ox, and if you hit it with an

1004
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:52,724
axe it died.

1005
01:01:52,724 --> 01:01:57,887
And in true simulistic fashion, that was just how it would work in real life.

1006
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,729
You hit an ox with an axe, it's going to die.

1007
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:01,110
One blow.

1008
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,232
But that wasn't a lot of fun.

1009
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:10,996
Well, it was kind of fun, but not as much fun, not the kind of fun where you think the

1010
01:02:10,996 --> 01:02:11,937
ox might actually hurt you.

1011
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,659
It was the kind of fun where, ooh, a toddler!

1012
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:19,857
So, easy fun as Lazzaro called it.

1013
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:23,699
There are two ways to implement combat.

1014
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:26,900
Manually, hit ox with axe, and the ox is simultaneously typing,

1015
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,341
gore player with horns, ahhh.

1016
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:32,883
Or as a stream, where one of you starts the fight,

1017
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:35,604
and then this exchange of blows coming along.

1018
01:02:35,604 --> 01:02:38,065
Those are kind of the two ways to do fighting.

1019
01:02:38,065 --> 01:02:41,906
Roy implemented the second one, because it was getting close,

1020
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:44,107
he had to finish his degree, and that was it.

1021
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:45,068
He really just had to do it.

1022
01:02:45,488 --> 01:02:48,651
implement something, that's what he did.

1023
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:53,274
I took his code and interspersed the other kind.

1024
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:55,916
So what happens, you've got a stream of interactions,

1025
01:02:55,916 --> 01:03:00,480
but there are individual things you can do to adjust the stream.

1026
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,183
So you might try to set fire to their clothes

1027
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:06,444
while you're fighting.

1028
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:08,666
Well, then they have to try and put the fire out.

1029
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,727
But at that point, you might decide to try and steal

1030
01:03:10,727 --> 01:03:13,109
their potions or something.

1031
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:16,434
So there's all these things you could do during the fight.

1032
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:21,136
So this is pretty much how things remain today.

1033
01:03:21,136 --> 01:03:23,977
You've got a stream of, you activate the fight,

1034
01:03:23,977 --> 01:03:26,018
things happen, boom, boom, boom, it tries to hit,

1035
01:03:26,018 --> 01:03:26,439
you try to hit.

1036
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:30,921
And then there are things you can do to intersperse it.

1037
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:33,622
I'm going to shoot off this fireball.

1038
01:03:33,622 --> 01:03:34,962
That isn't part of the fight.

1039
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,063
The fight's just me hitting them with my sword,

1040
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,324
but I'm going to shoot a fireball off.

1041
01:03:39,324 --> 01:03:42,646
That's an interspersal into the stream.

1042
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:47,587
The range of things you've got is wider, but the choice is narrower.

1043
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:56,171
We had different weapons affecting different monsters in different ways.

1044
01:03:56,171 --> 01:04:00,093
If you come across something that's a fire elemental, then you don't want to shoot fire at it,

1045
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:06,857
because, you know, that's kind of good for it. You want to shoot water, this sort of stuff.

1046
01:04:06,857 --> 01:04:12,180
But we didn't have formal character classes, so we didn't have somebody being a mage.

1047
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:15,940
because they signed up to be a mage. They were a mage because they used magic more than

1048
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:22,443
something else. We didn't have races either. We think that's a bad thing. I still think

1049
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:28,006
that's a bad thing. It's like saying, you're an elf, where are all the half-elves? Where

1050
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:32,708
are all the quarter-elves? Where are the elf stroke dwarfs? There aren't any. You're essentially

1051
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:36,910
saying that when you're born into a race, you have to stay into that race. I think that's

1052
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:41,772
racist. But people don't think that in the play of the game anyway.

1053
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:49,716
So, a lot of the character cost stuff that was taken out in the Deku Mud days and just

1054
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:54,219
from D&D for no reason other than it was in D&D.

1055
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:56,641
And it changed an emphasis in the game.

1056
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:04,267
The first 10, 15 years of MMOs were all to do with being yourself, but now it's more

1057
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:09,191
to a guided experience rather than finding your own fun.

1058
01:05:09,191 --> 01:05:10,392
I got a different rant there.

1059
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:17,937
about that. The thing about the tanks and the DPS and the healers, that came about purely

1060
01:05:17,937 --> 01:05:22,980
because of the way space was implemented in Deku MUDs. That's pretty well the only reason

1061
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,283
we have tanks. You don't have to have tanks. I think I'm now starting to run into the set-up

1062
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:34,847
time of the next talk. There is a next talk. Combat was one of the weakest areas of MUD.

1063
01:05:35,803 --> 01:05:38,604
I wasn't pleased with it at all.

1064
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:42,225
And yet, it's gone on pretty well unchanged.

1065
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:44,746
Why hasn't anybody experimented?

1066
01:05:44,746 --> 01:05:46,666
You get very few experiments.

1067
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,446
Aja Conan had a bit of hit location.

1068
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:52,507
I had hit location in 1980 in a space game I wrote.

1069
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:55,168
It was a graphical game as well.

1070
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:58,109
It had like up arrows for when your spaceship was going,

1071
01:05:58,109 --> 01:06:00,769
and left arrows and right arrows and a V,

1072
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:04,010
and asterisks for stars.

1073
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,490
It's as if.

1074
01:06:05,578 --> 01:06:07,120
you intend to man shop it.

1075
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,701
Woman shop is where you go to a shop

1076
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:11,522
to buy something for somebody, and you say something you like,

1077
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:14,164
and then you go to another shop, and another shop,

1078
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:15,425
and then three hours later, you choose

1079
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:17,887
the best thing you've seen.

1080
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:19,368
Man shop is where you go into a shop,

1081
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:25,712
and you see something that'll do, and you say, I'll have that.

1082
01:06:25,712 --> 01:06:27,593
And it's like that with designers.

1083
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:28,574
It's like, this will do.

1084
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:29,214
I'll just have it.

1085
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:32,116
I can't be bothered to carry it, to look at every single shoe

1086
01:06:32,116 --> 01:06:33,437
in every single shoe shop.

1087
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,369
I just want a pair of shoes, that's going to work, I'll have it.

1088
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:39,211
But don't they know they can do better?

1089
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:40,652
You can do better than that.

1090
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:43,614
It's as if they don't know that they can do better.

1091
01:06:43,614 --> 01:06:47,936
It's like it's part of the inventiveness of multi-user games has been lost.

1092
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:54,661
Roy and I had to think of the mud from our first principles.

1093
01:06:54,661 --> 01:06:59,124
We didn't have a paradigm to work to, we had to make all our decisions for particular reasons.

1094
01:07:00,258 --> 01:07:06,520
That's not just us. As I said at the beginning, we weren't the only people who invented these things.

1095
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:13,223
Mark Jacobs, Alan Kleitz, Bob Alberti, John Taylor, Kelton Flynn, Randy Farmer, Chip Morningstar.

1096
01:07:13,223 --> 01:07:17,245
I would mention the people who wrote Avatar if I could find out their names.

1097
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,582
they would have similar anecdotes.

1098
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:22,644
They will have a reason that they did these things,

1099
01:07:22,644 --> 01:07:25,747
not just because it just sprung from their minds.

1100
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:26,867
But, oh, that sounds kind of cool.

1101
01:07:26,867 --> 01:07:28,429
They will have had a reason for doing that.

1102
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:31,231
They would have been saying something.

1103
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:32,732
If you ask them, I'm pretty sure that they

1104
01:07:32,732 --> 01:07:35,934
will be able to tell you that.

1105
01:07:35,934 --> 01:07:38,777
My objective here today in this talk is to make two points.

1106
01:07:38,777 --> 01:07:45,122
Firstly, it behooves you all to understand what you're

1107
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:47,403
designing and why you are designing it.

1108
01:07:47,655 --> 01:07:53,218
The why is important. You need to know why you're doing it.

1109
01:07:53,218 --> 01:07:58,881
And the second point is that all these choices that Roy and I had are still available to you today.

1110
01:07:58,881 --> 01:08:01,702
You can still make those choices today.

1111
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,103
It's not like they've disappeared in the past.

1112
01:08:04,103 --> 01:08:07,645
I'm just telling you what we did so you know that you can still do it.

1113
01:08:07,645 --> 01:08:14,168
Oh, there was one other thing. Normally my slides look like this.

1114
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:14,288
So...

1115
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:20,060
Why don't I just give you 26 slides and a too long talk, speaking in steampunk?

1116
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,782
Well, on the face of it, obviously, it was because I'm giving you something that's old,

1117
01:08:24,782 --> 01:08:32,226
oldie-worldie, and I can tell you all these things about the past with a past flavor.

1118
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:38,129
But actually, I was criticizing today's game design principles, and this was a contrivance.

1119
01:08:38,129 --> 01:08:41,651
It was just something there which covered my...

1120
01:08:43,103 --> 01:08:45,405
that my real purpose behind things

1121
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:50,248
in the guise of the new history lesson and the thing is

1122
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:53,550
that's what mud was, a contrivance

1123
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:57,172
it was something was looking to be a game, looking to be fun

1124
01:08:57,172 --> 01:09:00,334
but actually it was Roy and I ripping into

1125
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:02,675
our awful situation in

1126
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:07,598
in the British class system. Roy and I were the first people in our families

1127
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:09,379
ever to go to university, ever.

1128
01:09:10,634 --> 01:09:13,815
We were very lucky. These days we wouldn't have been able to afford it.

1129
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:16,756
Neither of us came from wealthy backgrounds.

1130
01:09:16,756 --> 01:09:19,898
What we wanted to do was to say unpalatable things about the real world

1131
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:22,979
through the protected frame of a game.

1132
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:24,059
We were saying things like,

1133
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,600
this real world sucks, you assholes are doing this.

1134
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,242
It wasn't that we had chips on our shoulders,

1135
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:34,003
it was like blocks of, like, mountain.

1136
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,685
We just did not like what was going on

1137
01:09:37,685 --> 01:09:40,446
and we wanted a place where we could be rid of all that.

1138
01:09:42,247 --> 01:09:45,089
And we like programming as well.

1139
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:47,350
But you can do the same sort of thing.

1140
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,911
Why are you working in games?

1141
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:49,972
You must want to say something.

1142
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:52,053
You have to want to say something.

1143
01:09:52,053 --> 01:09:55,975
It doesn't matter whether you're working on a conveyor belt game

1144
01:09:55,975 --> 01:09:57,176
making things for Facebook.

1145
01:09:57,176 --> 01:09:59,998
At some point, you'll think, I really want to say something.

1146
01:09:59,998 --> 01:10:01,359
I'm going to say it.

1147
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:03,080
And say it.

1148
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,581
That's what I'm telling you.

1149
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:06,462
If you're a game designer, you have

1150
01:10:06,462 --> 01:10:09,383
to have some of your soul in the game design.

1151
01:10:09,962 --> 01:10:12,564
because otherwise it's just superficial.

1152
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:14,525
There's no vision to it, no substance to it.

1153
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:18,728
You have to have some of your soul in it.

1154
01:10:18,728 --> 01:10:21,691
And that's the biggest lesson that I'd like to give you from here.

1155
01:10:21,691 --> 01:10:23,812
I'm not saying throw away the paradigm.

1156
01:10:23,812 --> 01:10:24,953
What's worked in the past,

1157
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:28,716
if you understand why it was there,

1158
01:10:28,716 --> 01:10:30,937
then you can use it.

1159
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:35,200
But you must understand what's in the paradigm,

1160
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,581
then you can throw it away.

1161
01:10:36,581 --> 01:10:37,862
Okay, here we go.
