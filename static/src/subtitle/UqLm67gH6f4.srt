00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,813
Whoa, that's loud. Hi, everyone. Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis.

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:10,937
I am a contributing editor at godmonstranger.com. I'm the community manager for GDC. I am, uh,

3
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:17,722
unfortunately invisible, as always, uh, hanging out, whispering into your ears, uh, whispering

4
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:24,227
into this, uh, fine gentleman's ears. Um, uh, we're here today playing a game called Creature

5
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:27,990
in the Well. Um, I'm gonna try and tweak something while we're playing here.

6
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:33,807
Um, Creature in the Whale is a hack and slash, pinball meets Zelda kind of game.

7
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,294
Uh, yeah, you guys are gonna see that, aren't you?

8
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,499
Alright, let's try and move that over there. There we go.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,443
Okay, um, it is, uh, as you can see here, as my little, my little robot is trying to navigate this desert,

10
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:47,285
um, it's sort of a top-down game.

11
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:52,128
Uh, what's gonna get really interesting and unique about it is, A, the look, which you can sort of see about right now,

12
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:57,352
and B, um, this very, it's got, even though it's got a dungeon-crawling kind of top-down design,

13
00:00:57,412 --> 00:01:03,376
the mechanics, you aren't fighting monsters, instead you're, uh, not using one of two tools to knock...

14
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,176
to power up this factory.

15
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,597
And also, here's the thing that made me want to check out this game.

16
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,137
Here is the 20-foot-tall skeleton

17
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:13,998
that is creeping around in the background.

18
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:17,159
For folks at home who are new to the GDC channel,

19
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,540
this is a channel where we talk to developers

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,080
about interesting games they're working on

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,860
to share knowledge with you about making them.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,801
So if you have questions for our guest,

23
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,901
you can ask them in Twitch chat,

24
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,702
and I will grab them for our guest.

25
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:30,242
Speaking of which, I should finally introduce him.

26
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,783
Our guest is Adam Volker.

27
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:33,783
Adam, how are you doing?

28
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:35,863
I'm doing well, thank you.

29
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,165
And you work for Flight School Studio, right?

30
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:40,725
I do, I sure do.

31
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:47,287
I was this close to saying Night School, and I remember that's the studio here in LA, and I was like, wait, no.

32
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:48,808
And I was like, Flight School...

33
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:49,428
Those guys suck.

34
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:51,629
No, no, they're great.

35
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,930
No, I know, they're friends, and their game is really cool looking, and they're lovely people.

36
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,931
Yeah, oh my god, and then Oxenfree was really good.

37
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,328
Yeah, great.

38
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:01,408
Love Doxanfree.

39
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:06,030
Anyway, but we're not here to talk about Doxanfree, we're here to talk about Creature in the Well.

40
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,311
Adam, I just told them what Creature in the Well is.

41
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,292
What do you think Creature in the Well is?

42
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:11,553
And what do you do on Creature in the Well?

43
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:12,753
That's a good question too.

44
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:19,596
Yeah, I mean, man, Creature in the Well is a pet project for my colleague Bowden and I.

45
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:24,358
We've been dying to make a kind of video game that we thought was a little different, a little wacky.

46
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,338
and as beautiful as we can make it.

47
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:31,221
But I think, you know, calling it a pinball hack and slash is the quickest, most succinct

48
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,282
way to describe what it is.

49
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:39,377
for those watching at home, the basic mechanic is on display here where I'm using one of

50
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:44,041
my tools to hit the balls around, soon I will get the other tool, and that will let me charge

51
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:44,521
up the balls.

52
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:49,205
But yeah, as you can see, those are pinball bumpers, these are balls that you launch,

53
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:55,491
you navigate from room to room, and again, the 20 foot tall skeleton is kind of your

54
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,753
nemesis here, although I'll have some thoughts about him later.

55
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:03,116
Adam, you talked with some other outlets about where this game came from.

56
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:05,838
For our audience, what was kind of the foundation of Creature in the Well?

57
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:10,060
What was kind of the first thing that made you go, oh, this is a game we can ship?

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,522
As opposed to, this is a great mechanic that's going to take us 20 years to make.

59
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,623
Yeah, that's a good two-part question.

60
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:24,927
We started the project as a sort of competitive multiplayer local co-op multiplayer game.

61
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,629
It was going to be like air hockey with a character.

62
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:34,498
And we built that prototype and it was a lot of fun to play, but we started to add like little pylons to it

63
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,861
And we're like well these pylons are cool. Wouldn't it be cool if they were like pinball?

64
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,283
They had you know bells and bouncers and all that sort of stuff

65
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:45,226
And then we started adding more of those and like well, maybe we just make a game about that instead

66
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:50,590
Multiplayer was something we were toying with but was a little too much to chew on

67
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,935
And then you know like as we built these rooms we found that that was like really fun

68
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:57,976
mechanically to mess with

69
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:02,116
When we found out we could ship it was actually much later in development.

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,897
You know, like you can see the project where you want it to go much earlier than it actually gets there.

71
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:11,758
And it was some third party feedback actually we got.

72
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,859
That was like, I don't know that you guys have anything yet.

73
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,540
And it was a big moment in development for Beau and I to be like, wow, we really need to kind of

74
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,662
dig deeper into what we've built and expand the mechanics.

75
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:29,866
And that's kind of where the dungeons, the eight dungeons that each have like a different mechanical theme all came from.

76
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:36,229
Before that it was just a little less challenging. There wasn't quite as much progression in it.

77
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,870
So I would I would call those two

78
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,992
realizations very different parts of development.

79
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:46,094
Your role in the project, you're a creative director and also the art director, right?

80
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:51,997
Yeah, and like I said, it's a it's a team mostly of two people and so there's a lot of overlap

81
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,277
but my principal job is to

82
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,243
manage the style, the story, and then a lot of the level design.

83
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:01,246
Right on, yeah. Let's talk about level design for a minute.

84
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:01,887
Sure.

85
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:06,571
What's kind of the underlying logic of, like we're right now seeing some introductory puzzles,

86
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,193
but we'll see some more complicated stuff later. What was kind of the,

87
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:14,278
what's the core logic for building a pinball puzzle like this? I love this part where you just get fried.

88
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,383
Yeah, so you go room by room. We tried to make sure that everything was kind of like

89
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:24,166
The puzzles would be built so players would walk into them and have to activate them,

90
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:30,630
have sort of a twist or a conceit in them, and then solve them within a room.

91
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:36,074
So the progression was something we could also sort of plan dungeon by dungeon.

92
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:40,717
So we knew like, let's put something that's just difficult, like this room, for instance,

93
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:43,118
doesn't have a lot of challenge, but it's fun to like let the players.

94
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,726
just mess around and bounce a ball around every once in a while.

95
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:46,146
Yeah.

96
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,587
Um, but the...

97
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,528
But it's always kind of like, activating the puzzle was a big part of like,

98
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,388
what we built the design around.

99
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:52,748
Yeah.

100
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,669
And then each dungeon has a mechanical theme, so it was like,

101
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,750
what you activated would change.

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,491
Um, and then, there's uh...

103
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,712
Man, it's hard to describe.

104
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:06,093
Like, the last room had what we would call like an AoE bumper.

105
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:06,553
Yeah.

106
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,514
We have just like boring dev names for these things.

107
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:09,534
Area of effect bumper.

108
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:10,354
Yeah, it shoots a...

109
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,815
It shoots like a beam out in a line.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,671
So when we were building one of the dungeons around, like these ones here,

111
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:19,132
when we were building dungeons around that, it was like, can we put them in a cross

112
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,254
and then alternate with ones that, you know, go horizontally?

113
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:29,176
Bo made tools for me to set timers on them so I could make them fire in rapid succession

114
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,397
to try to move the player around the room.

115
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,299
We wanted to make sure that we weren't letting players just kind of

116
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,400
hit the ball and stand in a corner and let the puzzle win itself.

117
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,640
So it was really important to put the ball where you would get the dispenser,

118
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,162
like had to be in a dangerous area, or had to come from something that would shoot the ball at you.

119
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,363
Providing a ball to the player was another huge challenge.

120
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,624
Making sure there was always one available, making sure they were respawning at the right speed,

121
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:03,006
making sure that there weren't so many that you could get them anywhere.

122
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:12,555
Right on. I'm going to loop over to chat real quick, give folks a chance to get some questions answered.

123
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:21,840
I'm told that the answer to when this game can be played, the answer is soon, although you might have seen it if you dropped by PAX or GDC or E3 recently.

124
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:29,926
Ed Rockt would like to know, what is the playthrough time on this game and are there plans for DLC?

125
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:34,609
Which I guess is like, if you can answer Ed's question that would be great.

126
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:45,278
And then my follow up question would be, when you're planning a game like this, how do you gauge out what the right playthrough time would be for a game like this?

127
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:51,293
Yeah, so we did a bunch of testing in our Discord server.

128
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:54,094
We had some players come in at about 10 hours.

129
00:07:55,714 --> 00:08:00,456
That's not necessarily like 100% complete content, but that's like through the story.

130
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:06,839
Bowden and I take about half of that to play through now when we play through,

131
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,300
so I think it's safe to assume somewhere between 5 and 10 is what like an average

132
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,300
play through the game will take.

133
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,566
As far as extra content, there are some mechanics that we haven't used in this game that maybe

134
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,149
would be cool to put into stuff later, but there's nothing official about that.

135
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,954
But yeah, I think we wanted to make something that offered players a main through line where

136
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:36,077
they could complete it in a shorter amount of time, but then a bunch of secrets they could

137
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:43,003
also discover if they wanted to extend how long their playthrough of the game was.

138
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:49,953
Right on, I also want to highlight what I'm sure you must be shouting at me to just walk over and hit the glowing thing.

139
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:58,795
I like how the game is clearly telling me, go hit the glowing thing, and I just walked away from it and walked into town for a minute.

140
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,075
Moving on from that question, thank you Ed Rockt.

141
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,456
What I would like to know...

142
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:11,662
is there's kind of an element in this game of the fact that puzzles can be skipped you're going to

143
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:16,026
see later on that like there's just moments where i just i've had i've had it i've got enough power

144
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:20,369
moving on from the puzzle what was kind of your design decision for making like kind of creating

145
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:26,274
this broader um players don't need to make every clear every puzzle to advance what was kind of

146
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:29,996
your thought process around that yeah i think this is this is sort of a two-part answer

147
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,968
The first part is kind of a difficulty question.

148
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:37,893
So like, if there's a puzzle that is either like not communicated well, how it's supposed to be solved,

149
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,177
or it's just too difficult or maybe you're underleveled,

150
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:44,541
we wanted players to be able to opt out of that and still progress through the game.

151
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,705
And then I think like...

152
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,891
The second part is about resource management.

153
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:55,253
So every time you hit a bumper, you'll see numbers pop up, even these bubbles here, and

154
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,613
that's your currency of the game.

155
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:02,235
And managing that currency isn't super important, maybe in the first dungeon, but definitely

156
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:06,896
in the later dungeons, you'll have the ability to spend that on teleporters to make the dungeon

157
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,396
run back to the boss fight easier.

158
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,917
You'll have the ability to spend that currency to level up in town.

159
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:17,034
And then so managing that when the temples start to branch and the exploring becomes a bigger thing

160
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,056
Is a lot of why we allowed players to like skip forward

161
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,677
Some of the rooms they didn't want to spend time in yeah

162
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:29,139
There are there are places where you know we'll let a player sort of we'll reset the bumpers

163
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,180
They're all on a timer so each of the rooms reset

164
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,121
And we'll let players if they want to you grind out

165
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:39,724
To get more power to like level up everything unlock everything you know unlock all the teleporters

166
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,882
But we wanted to give them the option to do it or not do it.

167
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:51,739
Right on, um, uh, let's talk about the, uh, camera perspective for this game.

168
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,701
How did you and Beau kind of come together on like, uh, there's sort of a lot of ways

169
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,361
this camera could've gone.

170
00:10:56,381 --> 00:11:01,064
You could've literally just made a set fixed perspective of pinball, like, make it look

171
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:01,924
like a pinball table.

172
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,046
Sorry for any frame hitching you see in the video by the way.

173
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,247
That's my recording setup, not the game itself.

174
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:10,129
Um, what was kind of your thoughts on designing a camera for this game?

175
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:14,311
One that could keep everything clearly visual and visualized for the player.

176
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:15,577
Yeah, good question.

177
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:22,579
So the way the camera works is that room by room, I set it.

178
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,380
Bo writes some incredible tools.

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,840
There's a camera volume.

180
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,781
So in Unreal, there's a box.

181
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:31,581
And every time the player enters the box,

182
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,162
I blend it from the camera.

183
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:34,602
I don't blend it.

184
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,882
The game blends it from the camera it was in to one

185
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:37,382
that I set.

186
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,903
I can set things like FOV, distance, rotation,

187
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:40,543
all that other stuff.

188
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:47,759
And so what I tried to do was find a nice hybrid between a shot that I wanted to compose

189
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,320
and then what was good for gameplay.

190
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,524
We found really, really quickly that the game is super crappy to play when the camera's

191
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,425
low because aiming is really difficult.

192
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:02,869
So as close to directly above the player as possible is better for gameplay.

193
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:08,092
But I've always kind of wanted to make it more cinematic, both Bo and I.

194
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:12,889
come from a film background. And so there's a few hallways and a few rooms where I can

195
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:17,310
really take the camera low and have it track the player as you're running to try to get

196
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,411
interesting shots and make it feel dynamic. But what's cool is like we can fix it room

197
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:26,052
by room. So if there's a particular puzzle that the camera I've chosen makes it too difficult,

198
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:32,273
it's easy to just go in there and fix. And there's also a setting on it to decide how

199
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,553
much the player is tracked.

200
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:40,239
I can lock it so it doesn't move, and you'll notice in this room it drifts a little when you move.

201
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,062
And that's just another cool value to tweak as we make the puzzles.

202
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:49,624
So when I would make a puzzle, it would be like, load up an empty room,

203
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,487
and then fill it with a design, set a camera, play it a bunch of times, have Bo play it,

204
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,508
and just kind of tweak as we go.

205
00:12:56,912 --> 00:13:03,577
Right on. Is there any kind of effective, broad guideline you observed about the game's camera?

206
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,841
Anything interesting you learned about that you think another developer could benefit from?

207
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:13,925
I mean, if they're making a pinball hack and slash game, I've got a lot of specific advice.

208
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:21,511
I think aiming something really makes... Wow, I'm so glad you got this on the first try.

209
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,152
Nobody gets this puzzle on the first try.

210
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,107
Pro gamer, Bryan Francis right here.

211
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:26,727
Pro gamer.

212
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:30,569
Like I said, the top-down thing was really important.

213
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:31,889
I had to figure that out as we went.

214
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:40,793
Blending it from more than a 90 degree angle, from room to room really caused us a lot of bugs.

215
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:42,934
That would be something I would avoid.

216
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:48,576
We'd end up with cameras that would literally whip around 180 degrees if I'd set something incorrectly.

217
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:56,188
I don't know, like the entrance to the room was on the right side and the camera needed

218
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,110
to be on the left and it was coming from a room that had the opposite setup.

219
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,272
The camera would really struggle to spin around.

220
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:07,237
So it's just kind of like stuff you can't really find out until you run the game as

221
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:07,837
is intended.

222
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:16,808
Um, uh, there's a good question in chat about engineering I do want to get to but, uh, before I do, you talked to Boa before about using camera to control the mood for this game?

223
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:17,489
Yeah.

224
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:21,752
I don't know why I came back here. Uh, why did I- why aren't you going through the door past me?

225
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:25,595
Um, oh yeah, I guess I was trying to see if I could control that ball through the door. Um...

226
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:33,262
Anyway, so the question I have about mood, you mentioned in some other interviews that you're super inspired by Mike Mignola.

227
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:37,286
This does kind of have a Hellboy, BPRD look about it.

228
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:38,867
Awesome.

229
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,310
From... man, I got that on the first try too.

230
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,772
Yeah, those are difficult shots to make.

231
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:53,526
What I wanted to know is, this game has kind of like, you can see between the numbers bouncing up and the kind of high score-y elements, but there's kind of an arcade-y component to the game.

232
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:58,849
But there's also, as we've seen, like this very moody, deliberate aesthetic going on.

233
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,031
Like the kind of, I think in another interview described it as Oscar the Grouch as a bad guy.

234
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,314
That's kind of one of your inspirations.

235
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:09,698
There's kind of a deliberate mood about this weird apocalyptic setting you're in.

236
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:16,624
Can you talk about the decision to not make it stylized and not just a high score, charging single player experience?

237
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,348
Yeah, so, that's an interesting question.

238
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:23,911
I think like, I think a lot of this...

239
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,813
Wow, how do I answer that?

240
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:34,486
Beau and I build the game piecemeal, and it had a lot of inspirations when we started,

241
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:40,991
but it's kind of like one step at a time, like that's working, that's not working.

242
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:46,254
And so what you end up with as a final product is just an amalgamation of all of those little

243
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:47,335
decisions along the way.

244
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:52,259
I think we wanted something really dark and moody.

245
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,441
The character who is speaking to the...

246
00:15:56,468 --> 00:16:01,890
player out of a trash can turned into the creature. We needed darkness to put him in, but we didn't.

247
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,131
But we wanted him to feel large and scary. And like every time we would make a decision,

248
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:09,071
the whole game would sort of have to adapt and grow to that decision.

249
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:14,732
And all along the way, we're just trying to retain, you know, the mood, the feeling,

250
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:19,053
the camera and the arcadiness that we wanted, hoping that all of those elements would speak

251
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:25,415
well together and not be, you know, not compete, or that they that they would harmonize.

252
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:30,942
Um, so it's interesting that you're pointing out like it's arcadey, but also really moody.

253
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,706
Um, hopefully those things work well together.

254
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:40,795
Uh, but it wasn't really ever a decision to try to mash something disparate with something that wouldn't blend with it, you know.

255
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,879
Right on. That was another hard shot I pulled together.

256
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,120
I can now grab Nath Rackus' question.

257
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,782
Obviously, Bo sounds like he was kind of your tools guy.

258
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:53,943
He was doing a little more of the programming side.

259
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:57,305
What kind of engineering challenges did you face with a game like this?

260
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,626
This is an Unreal, right?

261
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,167
Yes, it is. It's in UE4.

262
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:07,050
So yeah, you're correct. Bo is the tech side of the development.

263
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,091
So I'll do my best to answer on his behalf.

264
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,632
And I'm sure if he's watching, he's rolling his eyes already.

265
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:20,672
But I guess one of the things that we did was, he really wanted to get right, was player movement.

266
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,134
That's something that he iterated on a lot.

267
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:27,535
How the animation, like how quickly the animation responded.

268
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,017
You know, how aiming worked.

269
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:33,058
Whether we rooted the player, which we do.

270
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:39,662
When you're charging the ball, how fast the dash operates, all that sort of stuff.

271
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:45,962
It was a huge challenge, it was an ongoing thing. Character control was really important to him.

272
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:53,223
The other thing that's kind of anecdotal, which is cool, is we originally made the game to handle the dungeons procedurally.

273
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:58,825
So Bo built a bunch of tools for that to work and then later in development we decided that wasn't the game we wanted to make.

274
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:02,705
And we got rid of a lot of that work.

275
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,706
But we're still able to keep the way the rooms connected.

276
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,167
So my job was to build...

277
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:17,140
Basically these art boxes, like I built this room without any bumpers in it, and then I

278
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,924
would set doors and where they connected and what type of door they were, and Bo had written

279
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:27,008
all these tools to create the dungeon so that anywhere I could connect any two doors together.

280
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:30,691
And then any room could hypothetically be connected to any other room.

281
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:37,176
And some of that stuff carried over from when we had originally made the game as procedural.

282
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,958
before we changed it to be, you know, handcrafted.

283
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:42,940
Right on.

284
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,362
This is, I'm actually really glad you finished answering right there,

285
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:46,883
because this is a great moment to talk about.

286
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:48,765
That was the first time I died in this game,

287
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:52,608
and I got grabbed by the titular creature in the well.

288
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,890
There's the creature, there's the well, there's the...

289
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:55,930
Anyway,

290
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:10,041
This death loop is really interesting to me because you can, you know, you die, uh, you get a moment with the villain of the game where you just sort of like get to stare down each other a little bit, and then you walk back through the dungeon.

291
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:20,906
You're gonna see it happen a couple more times, but it's kinda, um, it's a death loop. It's interesting death loop to me because it's not as, um, it's not, you know, as rogue-like, like, oh, you died, like, some stuff gets retained, but you lose other stuff.

292
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:25,888
It's not, it doesn't have that same, like, loop function to it, but that's still, like, that looping failure back into...

293
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:39,792
In the end, the game feels pretty good here, and it's an interesting decision, especially when later, as you see, I actually fail and then I have to walk a pretty significant ways back, and I have to take a long walk back through where I've been.

294
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:42,313
How did you sort of come to the decision to implement it that way?

295
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:50,755
Yeah, so that was about storytelling for us. It was kind of making sure that the player interacted with the creature, and that we made them feel like...

296
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,087
He was always watching.

297
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:59,011
I think it makes you feel really vulnerable for him, the villain, to pick you up and physically move you.

298
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:06,036
It reiterates that he doesn't want you doing what you're doing and fixing the machine and going back into the mountain.

299
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:15,063
And then we encourage you gently to read the dialogue we wrote for the story parts of the game.

300
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,166
And so all of that, we just felt like... I'm glad you feel that way.

301
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:27,959
Because all of that we felt like was reinforcing the relationship with the creature, the story, and all of that stuff.

302
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,744
The run, it's interesting that you mentioned the run because that is another point that we really, really wanted to...

303
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:36,426
We really paid close attention to.

304
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:41,410
Right after you died you actually walked up to a door in town that had a red blinking light.

305
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:46,635
Later in the game, once you complete more of the dungeons, that door opens and makes your run back much quicker.

306
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,649
And then this room actually turns into a teleporter.

307
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,413
If you spend money later in the dungeon to unlock it,

308
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,115
you can teleport right to the boss room.

309
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,996
So both of those devices were ways

310
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,517
that we made that easier for players

311
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:03,100
that they wanted it to be, the run to be a little shorter.

312
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,263
But we felt like the story win we were getting out

313
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,725
of having the creature pull you back to town was cool.

314
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:10,406
Nice.

315
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:14,529
Moving through my question pile here.

316
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:19,996
There's kind of an interesting thing you talked about in another interview I was watching.

317
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,377
We were talking about making sure that rooms don't beat themselves.

318
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:24,178
I thought that was kind of funny.

319
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:28,841
What's the danger of setting up a room like that and why was it something you wanted to avoid?

320
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,002
Well, I think it just makes for a boring game.

321
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:37,466
You know, if a player can just bounce the ball and then nothing...

322
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,207
you know, they don't have to do anything.

323
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,670
If the game is in design, if a game is solvable, that's really bad.

324
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:48,716
Meaning that if there's only one solution to beat it,

325
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,780
and that solution is really clear to the player at the beginning,

326
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,045
and there's not a lot of thinking, then it's not as interesting to play, etc.

327
00:21:58,545 --> 00:22:04,150
So a couple of ways we tried to handle that was to make the puzzles activatable,

328
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,271
like I was mentioning before.

329
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:10,556
There's also a lot of engineering under the hood about how long a ball will bounce

330
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,797
without you interacting with it.

331
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:16,036
So you'll notice the balls change in color. That's based on the player level.

332
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:21,361
Makes them more powerful. They'll complete a bumper. They'll fill a bumper with power in less hits.

333
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:28,667
But if you don't hit them, they'll slowly lose power and then they will only bounce three times.

334
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:31,029
And then they'll disappear.

335
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:38,616
So turning the balls into these sort of abstract energy things was a big part of fixing that solvability.

336
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:45,073
Apologies to the folks at home, we did not get to see that entire puzzle because unfortunately

337
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:52,621
this is a great game with some particles moving very quickly across the screen, which means

338
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:56,565
that's what causes load on the CPU when you're trying to record footage.

339
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:05,470
Um, uh, moving... oh man, like, chat said too, we missed that beautiful, just, moment of chaos.

340
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,973
Yeah, those are kind of our, like, breakout Plinko rooms where, like, if you get, if you sneak a ball

341
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:13,975
into the back of it, the whole, it's like that really satisfying where you're playing breakout

342
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:19,118
and you can get a ball to bounce up under the corner. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good, yeah man,

343
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:23,221
that's a good breakout, like, that's a good game to reference here, I think. Yes, of course,

344
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:26,363
through development that was one of our major references.

345
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,631
I really love this room because it feels like a batting cage.

346
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:29,691
Yeah.

347
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:38,795
Um, uh, um, uh, you, uh, talked somewhere about, uh, um, speed games done quick, SD,

348
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:43,457
SDQ, um, and how you were working with speed runners for some testing on this game.

349
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:47,018
Um, what was kind of, we, we've, we've done, I've done an article about this in the past.

350
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:51,500
We've been interested in how, uh, game developers kind of learn from high speed players.

351
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,161
Um, what was kind of the thing you learned, like working with speed runners to test your game?

352
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:06,107
Yeah, and again, this is a Bo question because this is near and dear to his heart, but I will try to remember all the things he was saying while he was making the game as good as it is.

353
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:13,511
It's kind of about like, if you were, it's really difficult to look at a game that you're making objectively.

354
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:20,014
Obviously, you spend all this time laboring over, you know, trying to design a puzzle that, like, you think is really cool.

355
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:24,257
And it might be bad, you know, it might just be boring.

356
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,241
or not interesting or whatever.

357
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:29,482
And so I think when we would always talk about speedrunning,

358
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:32,163
Beau would say, is there a way a player will skip this

359
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:34,364
because they can do it faster a different way?

360
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,164
And that was a really good question

361
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,865
to review what we'd made with.

362
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,826
So it would be like, yeah, he would be like,

363
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:45,287
I know you spent all day on this, but.

364
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:54,201
I can just beat it by cheating and standing over this and doing it this way, and we would have to change it for that reason.

365
00:24:54,301 --> 00:25:02,871
I think when we think about doing it quickly and trying to optimize, it's a bit like optimizing the gameplay, right?

366
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:07,676
That's when speedrunning and that stuff comes into play.

367
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:14,819
You've also, like I said, you've taken this tour around to a bunch of shows.

368
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,983
Is there anything you've learned about just playing at shows like PAX and stuff and getting

369
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,345
feedback from players that helped you guys out on this game?

370
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:22,405
Oh, for sure.

371
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:28,911
I think the first time we showed it was at GDC and we had a demo version then, but we

372
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,452
definitely went back to the tutorial.

373
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,535
It's always the beginning of the game that gets iterated on the most, I think.

374
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,377
We went back to that part a lot after we saw...

375
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,639
You know, we'll put the game in the hands of a bunch of new players.

376
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:46,181
We try to do as much testing as we can with friends and family, you know, in the middle of development.

377
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:54,306
But showing it like officially, announcing the game and all of that, you really learn a lot of new stuff about what assumptions you've made.

378
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,868
And the mechanic is so different and new that like teaching it is really, really important.

379
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:05,752
And so that those first three or four rooms in the game, you know, are probably like the newest rooms in the game.

380
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:13,417
Right on. Yeah, actually speaking of like how new and different this mechanic is, there's a lot of, you know, common language in game development.

381
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:16,218
Like a sword, when you swing a sword like this, it should do kind of this.

382
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:17,038
Right.

383
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:23,480
Your game does things differently in specific ways, but it's also, you know, there's like some conventional aspects, there's some unconventional aspects.

384
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,601
What have you learned about like designing game elements to help players understand what they are?

385
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:30,902
Like, kind of these orange things are an interesting example because they're not...

386
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:39,605
Enemies that you hack and slash to kill, they're energy things that can be dispelled with the ball, like they swarm you and add pressure.

387
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:49,828
What have you learned about designing in-game elements that are abstract, but, you know, they might be pinball-y and conventional, but they might not make sense in a hack and slash.

388
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:56,330
Yeah, that's a good question. Those particular enemies are still kind of a sticking point for me and Bo.

389
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:03,689
We decided to make them killable by the ball and not the sword because we want to make sure that the player is thinking about the ball always.

390
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,530
Yeah.

391
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:11,175
Um, but it is, it, it, I have noticed like of player after player find that not, um, super intuitive.

392
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:15,138
Um, so it's, it's, it's a difficult thing to answer.

393
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:24,185
I, um, we sort of operate on the design philosophy that we've stolen from a filmmaker.

394
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:24,245
Uh...

395
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,860
His name is Steven Spielberg.

396
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,661
It's just some random filmmaker.

397
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:34,725
He, uh, his company Amblin Entertainment put out this idea

398
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:40,730
that like, um, audiences like newness in a, in sort of like a

399
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,511
70-30 relationship to things they already know.

400
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:46,835
So 70% being, um, things that people understand with a twist.

401
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,738
So it's our world, but there's an island of dinosaurs or it's

402
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:53,440
suburban California, except there's an extraterrestrial that

403
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,341
lives with a small boy.

404
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,680
or befriends a small boy.

405
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,321
And so we were like,

406
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:02,122
there are swords, but they don't behave the way you expect.

407
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:05,722
Or it's a dungeon crawler, but it's full of rooms with pinballs mechanics.

408
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:09,944
I think if it was all super abstract and new,

409
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:12,424
we would have a lot more work to do to tell people about it.

410
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,985
But I think it's important for players to look at the game and go,

411
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,946
oh, I can see how that would be fun.

412
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,105
And I understand the format of how I'm going to play that, and that's really important to us.

413
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:28,667
So that, you know, it's not just...

414
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:34,832
It's just fun, you know, you should be able to speak the language fairly quickly, even if there's a lot of newness.

415
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:42,378
So, like, that's why we went with swords, and that's why we went with dungeons and rooms and boss fights and connecting them all that way.

416
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:51,259
Right on, right on. Do you think that's helped you? I don't know how hands-on you've been with any of the marketing for the game, because you have some support from Pop Agenda and stuff, but uh...

417
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,561
Um, uh, what, um... uh...

418
00:28:55,601 --> 00:29:01,583
Do you think that's helped you, like, explain the game to people, as you've tried to, like, get it out in the world and convince people to buy it when it comes out?

419
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,224
Looks at spreadsheets soon.

420
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:10,847
Uh, yeah. Well, I mean, I basically just say whatever they tell me. That's how I know it's good.

421
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,620
and appropriate. But really, a lot of the messaging comes from players.

422
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:23,724
The first time we played it at GDC, somebody called it a pinball hack and slash,

423
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:27,306
and then the next PAX East show we brought it to, somebody said pinbrawler.

424
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:32,428
And it's players being able to tell you,

425
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:37,191
like, oh, this is how I would describe it to a friend has been the best way to...

426
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:38,757
Continue to talk about it

427
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:44,080
Because Bo and I have all this baggage about what it used to be what it used to look like it used to be a

428
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,263
Multiplayer game it used to be have a lot more RNG in it and stuff like that so

429
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:52,165
It's it's kind of just like about listening. I think

430
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:52,965
Okay

431
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:58,800
Twenty-five, thirty minutes left in our show here.

432
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,201
If you've got questions, keep them rolling.

433
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,363
We'd love to ask them for you.

434
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:12,510
So Flight School Studio also does a lot of work in VR development.

435
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,154
You all have a cool World War I experience with Hardcore History's Dan Carlin out there.

436
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:21,657
I know you didn't work on that one specific, or I don't know if you did, you mentioned that.

437
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:37,091
Okay, yeah. You have said you've done some work in VR. I know this is sort of a tricky question, but I'm curious, how have you as a developer, like joining a company that's doing work for hire on VR projects and doing interesting...

438
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:41,195
Like, what's that been like working at this company compared to other game design jobs you've done before?

439
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:49,502
So, I think what's cool about what Flight School does is that our media... we work in all sorts of like...

440
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,382
real-time mediums, whether it's augmented reality or virtual reality, or just gaming.

441
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:59,544
It makes our team look at design abstractly.

442
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:06,408
And so, some of the VR stuff that I have done at Flight School has been both narrative and

443
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:12,170
gaming oriented, but we try to ask really fundamental questions about the way people

444
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,612
use those devices and what sort of thing we want to make.

445
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,612
and how it would be best on that device.

446
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:25,097
So wouldn't, you know, like one of my pet peeves is like joysticks on a phone, you know,

447
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:26,257
those digital joysticks.

448
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:32,522
I feel like we try to avoid things like that, and I'm trying to say this in a positive way,

449
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:36,585
we try to design for the platform, right?

450
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:37,686
And so...

451
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:46,319
What's been really cool about coming from that VR background is we're always asking those big questions throughout as much of the development process as we can.

452
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:56,726
So that's really let, like when we started making Creature, it was like, well, if we're going to make a game, it needs to feel like it belongs on the platforms that we would want to play it on.

453
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:01,050
And that affects the way it looks and the way it plays and the mechanic.

454
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,593
I think that's part of where the arcadiness came from, and it's definitely where the visuals came from.

455
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:08,535
And since there's stuff like that.

456
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:15,241
Right on. Does that mindset... I know you didn't necessarily design this for the Nintendo Switch first in mind,

457
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:22,425
but does the Nintendo Switch as a device make you think about making games differently than it does, say, Steam?

458
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:27,767
Yeah, for sure. I think you need... because...

459
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:37,112
I play my Switch a bunch on dock at home, but I also find some of the most fun I have with it is when I'm on the go.

460
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,312
Making something that was graphic, that could read at a small size, was huge.

461
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:47,473
You know, like I think, we weren't, you know, developing and putting it on the Switch like

462
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,894
every month or whatever, but we did have it in the back of our minds as we were developing.

463
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,155
We started the game on PC, obviously.

464
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:02,217
And then when we put it on the Switch, it was like, a lot of review of the UI, a lot

465
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:02,297
of...

466
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:06,964
Like tweaking of the colors, like it was very easy to get back into these dungeons

467
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:11,106
and say like let's make this a little brighter, let's make the contrast a little higher so you

468
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:15,068
can see the player, that sort of stuff, the stuff we tweaked you know with all that in mind.

469
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:21,250
But yeah it definitely affects it. You want it to look good where people are going to play it so

470
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:25,212
it would be foolish not to review it that way.

471
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:26,807
Right on.

472
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,569
Comments from chat.

473
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,353
Madame Laboe would like to know if you used the touch screen on the Switch.

474
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:35,497
Which is a really interesting weird feature the Switch has, that touch screen.

475
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,500
It is cool we don't use it.

476
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:42,664
I don't use it a lot when I'm playing games on my own because I don't want to dirty my

477
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:43,365
screen.

478
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:47,969
It's weird, it's not like the DS which gave you permission to tap away on the bottom screen.

479
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,934
The Switch feels more delicate than my iPhone in some ways, so I don't want to rub my dirty

480
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:55,815
fingers all over it.

481
00:33:57,056 --> 00:34:00,359
But it's so wild that Nintendo was like, oh yeah, we're going to keep mobile touch screen

482
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:00,879
functionality.

483
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,323
I guess that's helped some companies port mobile games to the platform.

484
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:07,284
It's just me pontificating.

485
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:12,086
John Nova would like to know, what was the most complicated part of development for you?

486
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:21,349
Getting the design right. I mentioned earlier that third party who came in the middle of development and was like,

487
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,931
I'm not sure you guys, that was really hard feedback to get, but was really really really helpful.

488
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:31,273
At that point, we had sort of maybe rooms like this, but they weren't...

489
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:36,094
This was probably the best that the design had at that point.

490
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,804
We sort of had this big moment where we're like, okay, let's gut everything that we've built.

491
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:48,009
And Bo made, as he saved me again, as he usually does, he made eight example rooms.

492
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,872
What he did was just kind of like, okay, I'm going to stop what I'm doing for the week and

493
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:57,498
make and try to take the game and create eight really, really unique puzzles that all have

494
00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:02,162
different, super different mechanics. And he actually ended up having to create a bunch of

495
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:03,003
new stuff for that.

496
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:09,420
But it was really good to really try to take the pinball hack and slash mechanic

497
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,601
and spread it out as wide as it could be so that players got something different

498
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:18,243
as they played through the whole game and it wasn't just hundreds of rooms of the same sort of stuff.

499
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:24,146
And then once he built those example rooms, we reviewed those for their uniqueness

500
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:28,047
and then I tried to build the dungeons based on his example.

501
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:31,268
So all of those, that's kind of how our design process works.

502
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:37,809
His bow would be like, I think this has something unique and this is what I was going for, and then I would expand it into the dungeon.

503
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,215
And then, you know, we would obviously be bouncing. He'd have an idea to make a room and then we would fine-tune each other's designs.

504
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:51,103
But that was really one of the toughest parts of getting something that felt like a whole game.

505
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:54,646
You know, it was kind of always a prototype until that moment, I think.

506
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:57,202
That's a really good answer, I think.

507
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:04,544
I want to talk about this mysterious stranger, this mysterious third party who came in and said there wasn't a lot there.

508
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:06,345
I guess they're going to remain unnamed.

509
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:08,845
I don't know. Jim, can I mention who it was?

510
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,467
Yeah, so it's a guy named Nigel from Devolver.

511
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,347
Oh, yeah.

512
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:18,409
And we were talking to him about the game, and he was like, it's cool, but I'm not sure.

513
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:21,670
And I really, really appreciate the feedback, so shout out to Nigel.

514
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,491
Right on, shout out to Nigel.

515
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,373
Really quick, where I was getting to with that is,

516
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,855
as a designer, I think a lot of game designers

517
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,056
and game developers are very used to critical feedback,

518
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:35,858
are used to, you know, ideas aren't precious.

519
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:39,961
They are meant to be worked on and then moved on from.

520
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:40,861
Yeah.

521
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,403
But when you get feedback like that,

522
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,004
you've been working on something,

523
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:46,205
you're trying to find a vision for it,

524
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:47,465
you're trying to find a future for it.

525
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:49,967
You described a very good...

526
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:55,769
Reaction to that, to that feedback, which is what you and Bo did, which was trying to realign like how

527
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,070
progression and dungeons work.

528
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,930
But what's kind of your

529
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,012
your mentality for getting that feedback and saying this is proactive feedback that I can use to make this better

530
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:06,593
and not oh, no, this means we should stop working.

531
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:12,035
It's not good enough. Like what's kind of the difference to get you across that threshold? I think it's a little more abstract.

532
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:17,277
Yeah, yeah, that's a tough one. It's about mood, but you know game developers deal with that all the time. That's my opinion.

533
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,022
Yeah, no, definitely. You know, sometimes you don't want to hear it, and sometimes it doesn't matter.

534
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:22,642
Yeah.

535
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,524
Sometimes you're like, I know what's bad, and people tell you what's bad, and you're like...

536
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:27,764
I think that...

537
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,245
Ooh, wow.

538
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:33,627
Like, how stubborn do you want to be is kind of the question you have to ask yourself.

539
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:43,952
You believe in something, and you have to decide whether you're lying to yourself about its quality,

540
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:46,333
whether it's something you like.

541
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:50,297
And maybe a lot of people generally don't.

542
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:57,059
I think that we really, really take, we really watch new players play something that is new for us,

543
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:01,860
and we say, like, is there genuine excitement and interest in what we've built?

544
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,081
Or are we lying to ourselves about something we love that maybe isn't resonating with people?

545
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:13,143
I think, in the case of Nigel's feedback, it wasn't that.

546
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:24,337
This isn't a game. It was that I don't know that this is going to scale to a full experience was his was specifically what he told us. And so it wasn't.

547
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:41,342
And, you know, we're reading between the lines, because I think for him, it was kind of, you know, it was a first blush at the game like he hadn't played a lot of it. We were in the middle of development. It wasn't, you know, so I don't even know that he knows how important it was. But it was it was kind of like

548
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:43,747
We had to decide, yeah, we had to sort of...

549
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,489
The first part of the conversation was like,

550
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:47,231
do we think that there is a game here?

551
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,253
And the answer was yes.

552
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:51,335
And then it was like, okay, well,

553
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:53,378
how do we address this feedback?

554
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,681
And I think we decided that because

555
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:57,923
we'd been taking it to

556
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:01,146
a local indie meetup in Montreal

557
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:02,528
and having people play it.

558
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:05,945
You know, super development builds, sort of as we went.

559
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:12,169
And I think the response was genuinely positive, and we had to trust in that response and have, you know,

560
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:14,211
players were like, yeah, this is cool, cool, this is cool.

561
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:19,154
And so, we knew there was something there. We just had to sort of expand it and find it.

562
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:24,218
I think that if, like, you have a core mechanic, like in the basic version of it,

563
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:29,742
players are either confused by, or they don't find it fun, or whatever,

564
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:32,524
then you've got a much bigger mountain to climb up.

565
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:38,726
I also think there was enough of what we built that was just mashups of things we already knew worked.

566
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:43,709
I think we trusted that Breakout was still a game people had fun playing on some level.

567
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:48,271
Sneaking a ball behind a bunch of bricks and watching it bounce around was still satisfying.

568
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:52,554
Planko is still satisfying and Pinball is still satisfying that we could trust that

569
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:59,877
if we could capture what worked there and add a little bit of Zelda to it then, you know,

570
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,959
we trusted that that would still make a game, you know.

571
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:07,268
And I actually think that those references gave us the...

572
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:12,090
were kind of part of the decision to be like, well, do we even keep going?

573
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,972
Yeah, because you're... because, you know, the question's good because it implies that like...

574
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:20,635
what Nigel was saying is kind of like, you should re-evaluate what you're making.

575
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:26,898
And once we did, we were like, well, we still know that these other basic games are fun, so...

576
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:30,880
we could... there's something here, we just have to work to find it.

577
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:32,226
Right on.

578
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:37,091
We would still love to take questions and chat from folks.

579
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,372
Bring them on.

580
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:39,333
We invite them.

581
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,737
We want to know if you're a game developer, if you're a game designer, and you have questions

582
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:45,640
for Adam, please toss them in.

583
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,741
Adam, let's have some fun.

584
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:47,963
Okay.

585
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:52,808
I don't know, it's tough to ask about narrative and mood things in interviews sometimes because

586
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,151
You're better off just playing the game, letting the game tell you what it's about.

587
00:40:57,191 --> 00:41:03,095
But, uh, I think Creature in the Will, the reason I specifically responded to your PR team's email and said,

588
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:07,617
yeah, we want to stream this game, is I looked at it and I saw that ten-foot skeleton,

589
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:10,839
and I saw the vibe of the little robot hero, and I was like, oh, yeah, that's my jam.

590
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,501
Like, it instantly clicked with me as a player.

591
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:18,003
What other kind of ideas did you want to get across?

592
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:27,607
You talked about Mike McNeil as a source of inspiration, but going deeper into that, what was your vision for what this adventure needed to be about?

593
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:38,171
Zelda, for instance, is very save the princess, go on a hero's quest, and this is a little bit more Dark Souls-y, reminds me a little bit of Below.

594
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:40,432
I think you get what I'm going for there.

595
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:48,692
Yes, so the story of the game is kind of, like for the protagonist, it's about figuring

596
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:50,393
out what your role in the world is.

597
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:54,894
And for the theme, I think it's about being insulated.

598
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:59,155
The town of Mirage is stuck in a sandstorm.

599
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:03,496
It's been stuck in a sandstorm for so long that the people don't know that oceans exist.

600
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:06,537
They don't know what a trees, they don't know what trees or forests are.

601
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,238
And they think their entire world is...

602
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,943
just the town and the mountain. And the creature likes it that way because

603
00:42:14,504 --> 00:42:18,906
he lives in the well, and they wish to the well. And they, you know, he gets to control their lives.

604
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:21,647
I think he sees you as a threat because

605
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:26,689
this machine might change all of that. And so

606
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,931
thematically everything that we wrote, the way the townsfolk react to you,

607
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:38,575
the way the creature, what the creatures goals are and what your goals are. What Danielle and Roger, the sort of main

608
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:43,591
NPCs of the game are all about. It's about sort of like perspective

609
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:48,593
it's about like realizing the world's bigger than yourself and

610
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:50,854
and

611
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:55,797
The dangers of being too insular with all of that. Mm-hmm

612
00:42:55,817 --> 00:42:59,718
I mean, I'm trying to talk about it without telling you how it ends. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know

613
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:00,499
I think that's valuable

614
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:04,781
But like I don't know if you walk up if you walked up to any of these houses in the game

615
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:09,103
But like you'll see that the people of town like, you know, they're afraid of you

616
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:15,647
And they're that way because the creatures told them, you know, like don't talk to this engineer. Don't talk to this robot

617
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:21,870
He's you know, he's threatening to change your way of life and people, you know can be afraid of change. Yeah, and

618
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:25,272
And so that's kind of what the story is about Roger

619
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:30,875
It is helping you out because he's really excited about knowledge.

620
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,237
And the thing that he really geeks out about is the machine.

621
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:39,880
He knows that his family was part of making it, but he's not totally sure how.

622
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,583
And then Danielle is cool with you because she's old.

623
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:47,084
And she knows better.

624
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:54,729
And so those two are the only two people in town that are really willing to help you on your journey against the creature.

625
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,330
But that's like.

626
00:43:57,142 --> 00:44:01,927
You know, we tried to build the theme around that idea and build the characters that would

627
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:07,093
help you, you know, making sure we were really clear about how they felt about that theme

628
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,915
and you know, all that.

629
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:13,620
Is there anything from your personal life that sort of drew that theme into the story?

630
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:13,821
Probably.

631
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:17,545
Like the sense of a town that was intelerate and not wanting to respond to people?

632
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:27,551
Yeah, well, I mean, I can't think of like an exact example, but I think, you know, the best writing and the best storytelling you do has to come from something that you've lived.

633
00:44:29,193 --> 00:44:35,980
But I can't think of like an exact moment where I was arguing with my grandfather or something about his...

634
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:44,604
point of view or anything like that. No. That's fair. Let's see. We are 45 minutes into this

635
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:51,488
chat. We've got a few minutes left here. Adam, I guess you're coming close to finishing this

636
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:56,591
thing. What's been one of the most exciting parts for you, this latent development? What's

637
00:44:56,631 --> 00:45:01,814
been exciting about getting here, I guess? Showing it to people is really the best part.

638
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:04,816
It's funny.

639
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:11,912
You know, the end of the process is very technical and very tedious, and it's mostly on Bo's shoulders,

640
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:19,034
and I'm trying to not annoy him too much, because it's just, you know, getting it on all the platforms

641
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:24,957
and, like, making sure it runs, different things break on different parts of it. But, like, really,

642
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:29,559
you know, getting to talk about it is a big, is sort of a huge milestone at the, towards the end

643
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,741
of a project. Announcing it and seeing how people react is such a huge thing. You know, development

644
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:35,041
now is...

645
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:39,618
isn't quite as announced release as it used to be.

646
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,201
People know about games a lot earlier than they are released and that's been a weird

647
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:45,281
thing to adapt to.

648
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:51,064
We're used to much shorter productions and so this is the first time when I've been working

649
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:54,886
on something for this long it's been announced and it still has a long time before it comes

650
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:57,527
out, back in March when we announced it.

651
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:03,550
And so it's just been really cool to see people actually be excited and actually anticipate

652
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,852
the release, which is soon I promise.

653
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:09,629
And so that's always super satisfying.

654
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:13,791
You work on something for so long and you love it, but you're not sure anybody else is going to love it.

655
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,632
And then if people do, it's really nice.

656
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:16,412
Right on.

657
00:46:17,113 --> 00:46:19,394
Um, kind of a... I had kind of a follow-up.

658
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:22,775
Oh, no, I had a question and I think it slipped out of my head.

659
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:25,316
It was something about... Oh, no, did I die again?

660
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:26,897
It'll come to you.

661
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:32,058
Yeah, this was weird. Something weird happened here and that's why I'm going to skip the puzzle when we get back.

662
00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:37,101
It's like the room, the puzzle, like, completed and the bouncer was there when I got back but it was still like wanting me to...

663
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,642
Oh, that's interesting. Okay.

664
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,623
You'll see it when we go through. I skip it at the end.

665
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:45,446
Um... Oh, there was something... Yeah, oh yeah, I guess, um, uh, when it comes to...

666
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:48,909
I guess, like, on some level you're concerned a little bit with about selling your game and getting...

667
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:53,711
I'm not sure if I have any interest for it.

668
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,552
Have you thought anything about how discoverability and how this game...

669
00:46:57,572 --> 00:47:00,013
Obviously you want your game to look...

670
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:01,073
I didn't heal up when I...

671
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,134
Okay, thank god I healed up.

672
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:06,976
Have you thought at all about what it takes to make a game that other people...

673
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:11,999
We'll care about, which sounds kind of vague, but at the same time it's the question that everyone's asking, like,

674
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,782
you can make a wild, unique game that doesn't get anything, or then you can make Slay the Spire,

675
00:47:16,382 --> 00:47:22,127
and suddenly you're one of the most popular games on Steam. Have you been thinking about it at all, about how your design process is affecting that?

676
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:24,488
Yeah, that's a slippery slope, I think.

677
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:26,930
We talked about it earlier with the 70-30 thing.

678
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:34,416
Yeah, it's a bit of that, a lot of that comes in, but I think, you know, you do have to...

679
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,077
You could just make a BR game.

680
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:42,180
and you know, try to like compete on that scale, like what are people playing the most of right now.

681
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,322
But that's what I say, it's kind of a slippery slope where...

682
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:47,784
Here it is, yeah. See the bouncers there?

683
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:51,526
Yeah, that's interesting. You activated the final part of the room but it wasn't completed.

684
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:57,409
I think, you know, we have to trust ourselves a bit.

685
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,431
And say, because Bo and I play a lot of games, so it's like,

686
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:04,353
what do we wish we could see that we're not seeing, is kind of where we start.

687
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,640
The 70-30 thing definitely comes into play.

688
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:14,643
I think, you know, unless you give some players something to latch onto, the newness might

689
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:15,144
be too new.

690
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:19,086
It might be too difficult to get people to check it out at all.

691
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:25,149
And I think we also decide to play to our strengths.

692
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,391
We haven't worked a lot of time, but we've been working for about a decade, and so we

693
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:31,212
know what we're good at.

694
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:33,393
And so we try to play.

695
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,662
To pick projects that highlight the things we know how to do well or work with people

696
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:41,064
who are much much better at the other things than we are.

697
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:47,767
And so I think we try, you know the best thing to do, the solution we've come up with is

698
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:51,389
just try to attack that, attack that problem like as logically as we can.

699
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:54,991
But you know it's a gamble, it's a gamble.

700
00:48:56,507 --> 00:48:59,929
You have to trust your instincts, like, if I like this, maybe other people will like this.

701
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:06,674
Let's use enough of the genre stuff that we know people do respond to that, like, will fit within those games.

702
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:14,258
Let's lean into our strengths, and then let's try to make a big enough twist where we actually get some attention,

703
00:49:14,278 --> 00:49:15,419
because people are like, that looks different.

704
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:20,009
Right on. That is a great note, I think, to end the stream on, unless anyone has any more questions.

705
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:23,093
So I am going to start the wrap-up process here.

706
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,696
Thank you all for joining us on the GDC Twitch channel.

707
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:29,941
If you have enjoyed this conversation, we'd love it if you hit the follow button,

708
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:32,665
because we're going to have more interviews with cool developers.

709
00:49:33,726 --> 00:49:36,468
So, you know, long as long as the lights are on, we're going to keep doing them.

710
00:49:36,968 --> 00:49:39,809
Uh, um, that was grimmer than I anticipated, but don't worry.

711
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,271
Uh, I was, I was trying to lead into hyping up.

712
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:44,012
We've got some really interesting interviews coming your way.

713
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:47,854
We're going to be talking to the devs behind, um, Age of Wonders, Planetfall,

714
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:49,134
which is out this week.

715
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,535
We're going to be talking to them later this month.

716
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:56,179
We're trying to talk to Richard Rouse III, a game designer who spends a lot of time at GDC,

717
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,641
about his new game, Church in the Darkness, trying to make that happen.

718
00:50:00,382 --> 00:50:04,204
There's some other great games coming out this fall that we want to be talking to the developers for,

719
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:08,407
and hopefully we will do it with you right here on the GDC Twitch channel.

720
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:12,710
If you are a game developer yourself and you want to know more about game making,

721
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,071
we encourage you to check out GDC.

722
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:16,933
If you've got a great talk idea, you can actually submit a talk for GDC.

723
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,838
Right now, the core concepts talks are still taking submissions.

724
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:24,380
Adam, if you want to submit something, that would be really cool.

725
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:25,321
Maybe I should.

726
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:30,386
Yeah, but then also look out for the summit submissions will be opening up soon later this month.

727
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:36,011
If you are a VR or AR developer, please join us at XRDC this fall in October.

728
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:38,454
You can check out xrdcconf.com.

729
00:50:39,455 --> 00:50:40,496
I'll put that in...

730
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:46,068
I just put that in chat for you guys so that you can check that out if you want.

731
00:50:46,768 --> 00:50:50,630
Actually, funny enough, Adam's coworkers will be there with their World War I game that

732
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,750
I'm blanking on the name of.

733
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,571
War Remains.

734
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:53,371
It's called War Remains.

735
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:54,091
War Remains, yeah.

736
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,312
War Remains with Hardcore History's Dan Carlin.

737
00:50:56,332 --> 00:51:00,374
They'll be showing off how they made it at XRDC, so check that out too.

738
00:51:00,694 --> 00:51:02,155
And that's all I've got for now.

739
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:05,136
Adam, if they've got any questions about Creature in the Well, where should they ask them?

740
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:09,118
You can follow Creature in the Well on Twitter at CreatureWell.

741
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,106
CreatureInTheWell.com has all the links to all the stores and all that coolness.

742
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:15,867
And that's it.

743
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:16,827
Right on.

744
00:51:18,768 --> 00:51:21,709
Okay, with that everyone, I hope you have a happy Wednesday.

745
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,670
I hope you're enjoying your summer.

746
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,471
Stay cool, stay hydrated, and with that, have a good day.

747
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:28,112
Bye.

748
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:28,192
Bye.

749
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:29,432
Bye.
