1
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:09,069
OK, so let's get started.

2
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:10,750
My name is Mike Chautau.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,052
I'm from Playbrain.

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:13,273
We're a company out of Tokyo.

5
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:17,476
This talk is about frictionless media

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,678
and why community is the new marketing.

7
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:24,581
So a little bit about me to start with.

8
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,062
Yes, you can see I look very Japanese.

9
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:31,125
I'm an Australian living in Tokyo for 16 years now.

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,327
And 20 years in games and marketing.

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,728
So I've worked in a number of different capacities doing that.

12
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:45,597
Most recently, right now my company Playbrain is a company that we started two years ago.

13
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:52,805
But previous to that I was running a creative agency in Tokyo where we were doing a lot of very youth market focused work.

14
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:59,151
So we're working for clients such as Red Bull, Heineken, Beats by Dre, brands like this.

15
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:08,380
And this one, this has given me a very interesting perspective on marketing that I've brought to games.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,424
But previous to that I was also very involved with games as well in Australia.

17
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:16,929
I worked for a gaming company for about four years before I moved to Japan.

18
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:24,416
Along the way I also built a social media analytics company called Lens, which later

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:29,043
on we actually absorbed into Ultrasupernew, which is the creative agency that I ran.

20
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:32,328
So just to give a bit of a broad background on what I've done.

21
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:37,189
At Playbrain we do a number of different things.

22
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,152
We run the LJL, which is the League of Legends eSports

23
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:45,275
Pro League for Japan.

24
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:49,658
We also develop Deki.com, which is a platform that game

25
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:53,641
companies can use to power their communities.

26
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:59,005
And so we run that for titles such as GWENT, Overwatch.

27
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:02,341
Hearthstone, et cetera.

28
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,204
And this is a service.

29
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:07,688
It's actually a more regional service,

30
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,011
but most of our clients and most of our users

31
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,132
are actually in Japan.

32
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:17,259
We support right now Japanese, Korean, traditional Chinese,

33
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:17,700
and English.

34
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:25,074
And we also do a lot of streaming production and video production for games companies as well.

35
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:28,935
So Playbrain itself, we're very focused on games industry only,

36
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:32,236
but we do a lot of the different things that we're going to be talking about today,

37
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,456
which is a little bit where my background comes from.

38
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:39,698
So, who here comes from a little bit of a marketing background?

39
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:40,118
Show of hands.

40
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,758
Okay, so we've got a bit of a marketing side and community side.

41
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,929
That's about 50-50, alright.

42
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,531
So I'm going to maybe sort of define some terms

43
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,913
so we know what we're talking about.

44
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:55,996
So marketing being the study and management

45
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,678
of exchange relationships.

46
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,859
Marketing is used to create, keep,

47
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,221
and satisfy the customer.

48
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,368
When we're talking about game marketing,

49
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,909
quite often we think about this acquisition.

50
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,990
It's like a lot of the perception of game marketing

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,490
right now.

52
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,852
And a lot of what we're talking about today

53
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:16,552
is well, maybe that perception needs to change.

54
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:20,094
And we need to be thinking more about those second two as well.

55
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:23,235
So the keeping that satisfies is an incredibly important part

56
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,455
of the marketing activities.

57
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:30,478
So more users in equals more players,

58
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:36,561
therefore the acquisition side is very much where the focus is.

59
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,682
But there is something missing.

60
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:41,103
So we're going to be talking here about frictionless media.

61
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:45,665
This is a concept that we use to describe the work that we do.

62
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:49,066
And this is very much powered by community.

63
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:55,912
And how is that bringing something very vital to today's games and why that's specifically

64
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:57,073
necessary in today's games.

65
00:03:57,073 --> 00:04:02,278
And I'm also going to take you through the four truths of frictionless marketing as well,

66
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:05,681
which is the emotions that we're actually trying to stimulate.

67
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,445
So when we talk about community, we actually want to think about what the intention and

68
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:13,889
what the emotion is of our users to make sure that we're actually giving them something

69
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,690
that's valuable to them.

70
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:19,087
Okay, so current marketing model as we talked about.

71
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:22,950
We're actually, we have these measurement analytics

72
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,494
that we use, CPA, cost per acquisition,

73
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,876
DAU, daily active users, ARPU,

74
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,898
the average revenue per user,

75
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,060
all these sort of stats that we have,

76
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,501
there's a lot more too.

77
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,684
They're actually really good ways to start to measure

78
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,146
the way that our game is performing.

79
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:43,657
and how successful our activities in marketing are.

80
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:48,443
But when we're actually looking at the way

81
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,449
that this data is used, most of the actions

82
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,733
that we're taking are very acquisition-based.

83
00:04:56,802 --> 00:05:03,849
And I think this is something that there is a bit of a trend starting to change right now,

84
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:11,116
but this is still within a marketing function of a company, still very acquisition-based, we need more users.

85
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:16,123
is the answer instead of let's make the users that we have more valuable as well as getting

86
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,124
more users.

87
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:22,865
So the most effective way of reaching a lot of eyeballs is focusing on mass visibility

88
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,826
and awareness, and we get a lot of that.

89
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:31,908
So let me take you through a few of what that means in today's market.

90
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,388
You know, 0.05 percent.

91
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:35,489
Anybody can hazard a guess at what that is?

92
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:41,755
This is the average click-through rate

93
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,138
that you get on a web banner, 0.05%.

94
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:47,462
And that's considered a good click-through rate.

95
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,665
So if you're doing display advertising,

96
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:57,579
You're getting an incredibly low response rate through that advertising.

97
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:03,282
And you're going to be paying cost per 1,000 impressions is going to be something between

98
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:03,603
$1 and $10.

99
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:06,184
It can be a lot more than that as well.

100
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:12,088
We see prices, depending on which media you go into in Japan, of up to $30 can be actually

101
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,449
a common thing as well.

102
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:24,587
Cost per acquisition puts it in the sort of that $2 to $20 mark generally, which is pretty

103
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,489
high if you don't have a high revenue churning game.

104
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:34,091
So all these things are very highly measurable, so generally marketers think this is a very

105
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,653
safe thing to work with.

106
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:40,514
We can look at those numbers and go, oh, okay, we're going to get about this back on it.

107
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:41,014
That's great.

108
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,095
But it's only part of the picture.

109
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:47,371
Here's a different type of advertising that we see a lot.

110
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,152
This is OOH.

111
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:52,097
This is a big billboard that sits in...

112
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:54,940
This is Shibuya Station, one of the most popular...

113
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,483
I think it's the number four busiest station in the world.

114
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,508
We have about 2.4 million people come through there every day.

115
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,540
One of the things there we've done,

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,180
this is a particular project we did

117
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,581
for Clash of Clans a few years back.

118
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,762
We were very proud of the creative work,

119
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:17,363
super happy with what we did there.

120
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:24,186
But if you notice something about this picture,

121
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,527
how many of those people are actually in our target market?

122
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,648
You have an answer?

123
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:31,809
One maybe, yeah.

124
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:32,769
So, you know.

125
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,235
In terms of that target market, we're actually,

126
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:38,757
even the girl at the left, at the bottom,

127
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,778
potentially could be, but generally,

128
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,219
for this particular game, we're actually

129
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,201
a very male-skewed audience.

130
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,142
Maybe that guy at the top, but he's actually

131
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,423
potentially older than our target market as well.

132
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:50,744
So, we'll give him a maybe.

133
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:56,207
But I did a quick on a napkin kind of analysis of this.

134
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,989
And we get to maybe 1 in 5,000 people

135
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,171
are really going to be interested in downloading

136
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:08,998
our game based on 5% are actually in that core target.

137
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:11,940
40% of those are maybe interested in mobile.

138
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,463
40% of those are interested in the genre.

139
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,885
And then about 2.5% will actually download the thing.

140
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:29,473
So that's about one in 5,000, and we're back to that 0.05% of actual people actually reacting to our advertising.

141
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:33,857
So, okay, we can see where we're heading down this trend.

142
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:38,301
So we can put a cost to that as well.

143
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,225
You know, if you want to do a takeover of Shibuya Station, you're probably looking at about $200,000 a day.

144
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,521
It's a big station.

145
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:48,264
There's a lot of different media that you can take over to do that.

146
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:57,031
So I mean, if you've got something that is a very mass market orientated product, taking

147
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,054
over Shibuya Station is probably a good investment for you.

148
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:00,934
You get a lot of impact.

149
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,717
But if you have something that has any kind of niche, not so effective.

150
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:15,768
So, you know, we could get a cost per acquisition of $4 if we do well, probably more.

151
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:22,334
But it also is a place with diminishing returns, because if you think about it, Shibuya Station,

152
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,876
same people travelling every day of the week.

153
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:30,480
Once they've seen it, once they've decided if they're interested or not, you know, you've

154
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,082
kind of wasted your marketing money on them.

155
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:37,500
OK, so let's jump to television commercials.

156
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,182
So this is another kind of advertising

157
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,143
that we see a lot, especially in Japan.

158
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,685
So if you're doing a game marketing in Japan,

159
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:46,268
we do look at television commercial advertising

160
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:47,429
quite a lot.

161
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:52,553
And I've actually chosen to take an example that's

162
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:56,156
a little bit more US-centric for this one.

163
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:59,919
So the Super Bowl, this has got about $0.40 per person.

164
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:04,035
that you're going to reach for a 30-second spot

165
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,836
during the Super Bowl.

166
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:08,039
So that's, again, pretty high cost

167
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,521
to pay for a very broad mass audience.

168
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:14,244
What's the clicks-through rate on a TV?

169
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,265
It's very hard to measure.

170
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:20,229
You can probably look at when that spot runs

171
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:23,251
and how many people download.

172
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,552
But you've got a bunch of people who

173
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,414
are watching a football game.

174
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,295
They're not necessarily interested in downloading

175
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,616
an app at that particular point in time.

176
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,252
And so we could probably say that visibility, great.

177
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,113
Actual action that comes off the back of that

178
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,454
may not be as successful.

179
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:43,456
And again, broad audience, so if you've got anything niche,

180
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,257
not so effective.

181
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:49,099
But changing the way we consume media and games

182
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,040
is also changing.

183
00:10:54,005 --> 00:11:00,247
If we have a look, we are much more interested in the long-term player engagement than we used to be.

184
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:06,029
The two big changes that we've seen in the last five to ten years is a massive shift toward multiplayer,

185
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:12,252
and real-time multiplayer, and also a massive shift towards microtransaction in just the last few years.

186
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:17,419
And that is changing the way that we want our users to behave.

187
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,242
We used to just want them to pay for the game, and then we're done, right?

188
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:24,547
As many people pay for the game as possible, and then we're on to making the next game.

189
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:27,751
But now we actually care about having those users for...

190
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,711
maybe five to ten years. It could be that long that we're after.

191
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,473
You look at a game like League of Legends, it's been around about eight years now.

192
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,554
A lot of the top games in the Japanese app store,

193
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,975
like Monster Strike, they've been around

194
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:46,577
six, seven, eight years. We're looking at the long-term retention

195
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,218
as a much more important part of the way that we deal with game marketing these

196
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:53,000
days. And I think we have to, you know, bring up

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
community as a solution for that.

198
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,728
Let me take you through one more thing, which is about how we're ingesting media.

199
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:04,591
And so we talked about television commercials before, but actually if we look at trends,

200
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:09,095
we've got things like Netflix starting to shift people's attention to places where there

201
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,116
aren't even any ads.

202
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:13,339
So there's no way to reach those people on Netflix unless you actually produce a Netflix

203
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:13,559
program.

204
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:21,326
We look at the core game of target's actually barely watching TV.

205
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:28,816
You can see here that second column is probably one of our core game of target age range,

206
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:32,818
16 to 24, and probably with the secondary one at 25 to 34.

207
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:41,663
Those ones, the numbers of the amount of engagement they have with television is really reducing.

208
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:42,724
And here's another one.

209
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:47,246
If you're looking at online advertising, the rate of people running ad blockers is increasing

210
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,107
very, very fast.

211
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:51,869
People don't want advertising is pretty much what I'm getting at.

212
00:12:52,792 --> 00:13:01,056
This is really, really important to understand because that is telling us something about

213
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:03,918
the way that we're communicating.

214
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:08,361
We're interrupting the way that people are wanting to enjoy the world.

215
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:14,124
Last one here, digital ads are actually getting more expensive and reaching fewer people as

216
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,585
a result of the previous.

217
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:21,448
So it's about time marketing teams started looking in different places to appeal to the

218
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:21,788
players.

219
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,862
And that's why I want to introduce frictionless media and the four truths.

220
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:27,943
We'll get to the four truths.

221
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,105
Let's start with frictionless media.

222
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:36,152
So frictionless media is media in the form of content the audience is seeking to engage with.

223
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:40,056
So as opposed to a television commercial

224
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:43,661
where you're trying to watch a football game, for example,

225
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,183
and we're gonna throw up an ad,

226
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,725
and that's actually getting in the way

227
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,407
of the thing that they wanted to do.

228
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,691
So if we wanna look at this as a very simple chart,

229
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,273
it looks like this.

230
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:56,017
That red circle is where they're actually trying to get to.

231
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,770
And that blue track is where we're trying to push them.

232
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,772
So we're trying to shift them to first of all, our marketing.

233
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:05,173
So we want to take them away from what they wanted to do

234
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:06,353
to our marketing.

235
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,614
And then we're trying to have them make a decision

236
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,756
to not go back to what they wanted to do,

237
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:14,357
but go to our game, our destination page, landing page,

238
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:15,258
whatever we're going to have there.

239
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,525
And that is the friction that we're talking about.

240
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:25,408
So my proposal is that we take an approach of frictionless.

241
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,770
So frictionful marketing is it gets

242
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,372
in the way of what you wanted to see to deliver a message.

243
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,153
Frictionless is a very straight line.

244
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,434
Let's keep it simple.

245
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:39,377
So we want to deliver marketing in a form that

246
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:42,899
is proposing what the user is wanting to engage with.

247
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,717
So very simple path, target user, what the user wants,

248
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,077
your game.

249
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:50,198
All right, so let's give you some examples.

250
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,458
So influencer marketing, so you probably, many of you

251
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,360
are familiar with this.

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:04,703
We're supporting influencers to create content.

253
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,844
Common formats, video on demand, streaming content,

254
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,785
social media, blog content.

255
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,363
There are many other forms as well that we could imagine,

256
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,224
but that's the common ones we're going to see.

257
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:20,987
And of course, your channels are things like YouTube and Twitch and etc, etc.

258
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:25,069
In Japan, we have a few domestic channels that are a little bit unique to the market.

259
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,190
In Korea, you also have ones that are unique to the market.

260
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,173
China, you have ones that are incredibly unique to the market.

261
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:34,915
But basically, the structure is the same.

262
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:37,337
Then what type of content are we looking at?

263
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,378
We're looking at asking influencers to play our game, right?

264
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,286
That's a pretty obvious one.

265
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:44,668
We're looking at asking influencers

266
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:48,952
to show build guides and advice on how to best play the game

267
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:50,993
in terms of structure, strategy.

268
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:56,859
We're looking on opinion pieces as well,

269
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,341
so giving an opinion about which games

270
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,723
are the best of this specific genre

271
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,746
or what is good or bad about this particular thing.

272
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,403
These are all different types of opinion marketing,

273
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,064
influencer marketing that we can leverage

274
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:10,965
to market our game.

275
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:13,586
Some of them we need to pay for, some of them we don't.

276
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,446
When we do pay for them, you know,

277
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,587
it can be pricey in some cases

278
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:19,888
or it can be incredibly cheap in others.

279
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,409
And it depends on what kind of influencer you're after

280
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,590
and what kind of relationship you build with them.

281
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:31,423
The job of a community manager can actually include maintaining those relationships as well.

282
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:36,529
So it's not that you're just going to an agency and booking whichever influencers you can get.

283
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:43,438
Build those relationships and actually you will find that you'll get much better performance out of the influencer marketing.

284
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:46,176
Next.

285
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,617
Content marketing is a different category.

286
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,878
Looks very similar to influence marketing.

287
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,901
So we're still VOD, streaming content, social media, blogs.

288
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:58,403
But now we're talking from you as a game developer's

289
00:16:58,403 --> 00:16:58,963
perspective.

290
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:03,546
And again, we want game plays, demos, special release

291
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:08,028
content, et cetera, possibly how to play content as well.

292
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,090
Developer insights, things that only you can deliver.

293
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,935
Things that help players get closer to you, essentially.

294
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,957
And of course behind the scenes, etc.

295
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:22,022
It's going to be a really good approach as well.

296
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:26,968
Let them learn a little bit more about your titles

297
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,511
and what you can share about that.

298
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,193
And they will get much closer to your game

299
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:32,895
and much more appreciate your game.

300
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:34,857
OK, next one, events.

301
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:42,120
So events, these can be online.

302
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,160
They can be offline.

303
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,801
It can be conference festivals.

304
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,962
You can be part of something bigger.

305
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,122
You can be your own thing.

306
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:50,063
They can be very casual, or they can be

307
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:51,323
very formal and grand scale.

308
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:55,545
There's a lot of different scope for events.

309
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:59,067
And I've given a basic cost breakdown here

310
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,387
of anything between $5,000 and $100,000.

311
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:02,968
But it could be free, just your time.

312
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:03,408
Or it could be.

313
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:10,094
a million dollars. It could be any level that you actually want to justify in your marketing

314
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:15,419
plan and it really depends on how you want to engage. And so we will talk about a few

315
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,963
of those examples, but some of the things that you might want to do are tournaments.

316
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:23,968
So if you have a competitive game, tournaments are great. It could be game trial events.

317
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,771
So we've done a lot of things like caravans around the

318
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,482
around the country, so that we'll set up in each city

319
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:32,723
with a little bit of a trial event.

320
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:36,407
People can try out a game.

321
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,828
You can do meetups.

322
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:41,011
So invite users to come and talk to you as the developer.

323
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:43,032
And just each other as well.

324
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,894
There's a number of games we'll actually have.

325
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,896
The community drives their own events

326
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,558
with meetups and things like that, which is also great.

327
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,199
Encourage that, support that.

328
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,060
Game culture based events is another one as well.

329
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,621
So you can have things like cosplay,

330
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:00,822
can help people get into the culture of your event

331
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,943
without actually necessarily playing your game even.

332
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:06,444
But these are all positives for the visibility,

333
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:07,384
the engagement with the game.

334
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:12,194
And the fourth category here is tools.

335
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:16,155
So these are things that could be website tools or app tools,

336
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,936
for example, that help the player perform better,

337
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:23,537
understand better, all these things around the game.

338
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,757
So some of the things that we're talking about,

339
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:26,918
the obvious one is forums.

340
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:31,999
So provide forums so that people can ask questions

341
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,799
of you or each other.

342
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,680
but also strategy builders.

343
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,282
So you can facilitate people to actually build strategies

344
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,162
of their own design, propose them to other players

345
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:49,943
as ways to beat the game or perform well in the game.

346
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,304
You can have maps of the game.

347
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:53,424
You can have things that you can't deliver actually

348
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,764
in-game necessarily.

349
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:58,205
You can provide as external tools to support the game.

350
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:02,214
And you can also have game assist tools as well.

351
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,257
So that's things that maybe there are little calculators

352
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,378
that will help you understand how much damage

353
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,319
you're gonna deal per second

354
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,041
if you have such and such a combination

355
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:15,545
or this kind of thing that helps you actually

356
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,667
do a more in-depth performance

357
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,828
for the people who wanna get to another level in your game.

358
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:26,533
And all of these things are going to be specific to your game, which you'll choose,

359
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:33,657
but all of these things are possible ways to further engage your audience in a frictionless way.

360
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:38,440
So not one of these needs to interrupt another experience, they can all stand on their own.

361
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,564
They can all be a part of the experience that the user is actually after.

362
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:50,428
Okay, so let's get to the four truths of frictionless marketing.

363
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,471
And so in this, I'll give you each of the truths

364
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,932
and an example of one thing that actually does that.

365
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:59,733
So the first one is the human truth.

366
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:03,574
So we gain a positive feeling of connection

367
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:07,395
from realizing we are playing or watching real people

368
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,056
with faults and strengths.

369
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:12,737
This feeling helps us build emotional connection

370
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:15,138
with the game and its players.

371
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:17,419
Why is this emotional connection important?

372
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,035
Whenever we're engaging with anything like this,

373
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:24,198
we're wanting to feel like there's something

374
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:25,339
actually getting affected.

375
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:28,942
And we want to have this human connection.

376
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:33,125
This is actually a subconscious deep desire

377
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,007
with most of our players.

378
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,870
And understanding that I could do better than somebody else,

379
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,732
or I could collaborate with somebody else,

380
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:45,695
or I could feel like there's places to succeed and fail.

381
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:53,640
These are all human interactions that will help you

382
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,240
engage with the game,

383
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,282
help you develop a love for the game, actually.

384
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,123
So, let's call this humanized media,

385
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:02,064
something we're gonna produce off the back of this.

386
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:06,006
So an example we have here is for the LGL.

387
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:09,528
The LGL is the League of Legends Japan League.

388
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,330
And we did this piece for

389
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,524
as part of the social media promotion which is operated on Twitter.

390
00:22:17,524 --> 00:22:22,410
Twitter is pretty popular, pretty powerful still in Japan.

391
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,450
and probably in terms of social media communication

392
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,491
is probably one of the strongest channels that we can use.

393
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:31,812
And so what we did is we built some content

394
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:34,974
interviewing some of the players and letting them,

395
00:22:34,974 --> 00:22:38,095
some of the pro players, and letting them

396
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,336
just communicate a few things

397
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:40,836
that opened up their personality a little bit.

398
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,537
And so this is an example.

399
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:45,518
This is in Japanese, so I won't run it for a long time,

400
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:46,859
but I can talk you through it.

401
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,060
I don't know if we have any audio on that anyway.

402
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:55,632
that not got hooked up.

403
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,120
Ah, it's not coming through.

404
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,085
Basically, he's going through a number of 10 questions,

405
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:11,528
which is just mapping with the League of Legends ban pick

406
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,389
screen.

407
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,811
And the things like, which players

408
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,933
do you like playing against, or which players do you

409
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:24,858
interact with, what's a famous phrase that you like to say,

410
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:26,139
what character do you like?

411
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,700
It's coming out of here.

412
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:30,023
Yeah, it's all right, it's all right.

413
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,645
It's okay, it's in Japanese,

414
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:35,608
so people won't understand it anyway.

415
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:37,770
And so it's just things to get at his personality

416
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,410
a little bit.

417
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:47,328
and this did amazing things in terms of increasing the profile of each of the players

418
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,828
and making people feel closer to the league.

419
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,069
It was a really successful thing.

420
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,530
At the end here, and I'll let it run just until it gets there,

421
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,750
he actually is asked like a bonus question at the end

422
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,931
where he's asked to mimic one of the casters from the league.

423
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:12,705
He had great fun with this and the response on his performance on this was just huge.

424
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,509
The fan base really loved it.

425
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:20,831
And there's nothing particularly skillful about it from him,

426
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:23,072
but it was really, really impactful.

427
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:27,255
And so what did we see there?

428
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:29,477
What were the results of it?

429
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:32,079
We actually had an increase 400%

430
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,841
of the previous top retweet records.

431
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,342
So just by doing these,

432
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,165
we did them twice a week for five weeks during the season.

433
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:44,953
two different players every time.

434
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:49,636
And we were upping the previous retweet total by about 400%.

435
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:53,577
Just the engagement that came off the back of it was just incredible.

436
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:57,639
It was a huge increase in the awareness of the players as well,

437
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,201
so people started to identify each of the players a lot more.

438
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:04,822
And there was a personal fan increase for each of those pro players too.

439
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:07,003
And so in terms of goals for this...

440
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:12,627
It hit all of our goals, actually.

441
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,608
We achieved exactly what we needed to out of it.

442
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:18,291
So that's an example of just exposing some of the human side.

443
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,615
There was nothing perfect about what he did in front of the camera, and actually that

444
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:23,396
was part of the charm.

445
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:32,603
His speech wasn't natural, it wasn't media savvy, but it made just such a nice impact.

446
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:37,415
Some of the other things that you might want in terms of humanized media,

447
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:38,595
direct response from developers.

448
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:41,997
This is something that any of you can do without a massive investment.

449
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:44,959
So if you want to respond to people on social media,

450
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:48,581
tell them things that you're allowed to leak,

451
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:53,424
or explain why you made certain decisions within your games.

452
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:57,466
These sort of things are really, really valuable for a player base.

453
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,672
studio tours. We did a...

454
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:06,635
For EA we did a studio tour of the DICE studio a few years back for the Japanese audience.

455
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:11,798
And this was received really, really well as a piece of content that people could actually

456
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:16,780
feel a little bit closer to the development process that was behind, I think at the time it was Battlefield 4.

457
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:23,277
You can also do things like play a documentary, so you can actually interview, whether you've

458
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:28,120
got a competitive game or not, interviewing some of the community and proposing that as

459
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,782
content to be engaged with, to share on YouTube, etc.

460
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:35,704
All these things can be a great way to do humanised media.

461
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:38,546
Okay, second truth.

462
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,166
So the progress truth.

463
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:45,450
So when somebody feels like they can grow and learn.

464
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,642
within a game, they're more encouraged to play and keep playing

465
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:54,325
and to enjoy the game. So this one as

466
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:58,203
If any of you are involved with your game design teams,

467
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:00,284
this is something game designers know very well.

468
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:03,387
You need to manage challenges and things like this.

469
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:07,430
But as a community manager, you can actually

470
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,951
empower this a little bit as well.

471
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:11,593
So you can identify places where players get stuck

472
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:13,694
and do things for it.

473
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:16,416
So let's call this over-the-hump media, right?

474
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,318
So somebody's hit a challenge within the game,

475
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:22,141
they can't get past it, they're considering leaving the game,

476
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,261
let's do something to help them.

477
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:28,086
So the example we can talk about here is Battlefield Senpai.

478
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:31,868
So this is another EA example.

479
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:35,909
So we did this, it's actually started a bit earlier,

480
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,930
but the example in the screenshot here

481
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,512
is that's coming up is for Battlefield 1.

482
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:43,333
We set up a channel, a Twitter channel,

483
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,694
which people could ask questions to.

484
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:52,071
and we had strong players able to answer through that channel

485
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:55,133
and give people advice on how to approach different aspects of the game.

486
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:59,236
This is great to avoid the churn that I mentioned before.

487
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:05,778
and help that engagement with the game maintain.

488
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:09,679
And so, especially when you're getting into a game

489
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,560
where you do want to keep people for a long time,

490
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,320
you want to have them engaged

491
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,861
because your revenue streams actually are affected

492
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,262
by the long-term engagement,

493
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:19,322
this is a great way to do that.

494
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,262
Okay, and what was the result of that?

495
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:30,184
We had an increase in Twitter followers of about 200% for this.

496
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:33,725
We had a strengthening of regular player base.

497
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:37,346
We developed regular interaction with the player base that could then be leveraged for

498
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:41,208
campaigns and communicating around new releases as well.

499
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:46,950
So this was also a very successful campaign that we ran for quite a while actually.

500
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,377
Okay, so other examples of over-the-hump media,

501
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,959
community build guides.

502
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:56,342
So the Dekki.com that I mentioned earlier allows that.

503
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:59,544
So we do like deck builds for Hearthstone and Gwent,

504
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:00,205
for example.

505
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,467
This sort of thing can be a great way

506
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,110
for the community to then share ways

507
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,552
to keep progressing and succeeding in the game.

508
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:11,433
And of course, influencer gameplay videos

509
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,694
are a good example of that as well.

510
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:13,715
Next truth, aspirational truth.

511
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:20,598
When people see a higher level that

512
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,039
could be reached within the game,

513
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:25,703
they develop an aspirational attitude to the game,

514
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:26,944
driving passion and effort.

515
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:31,648
So another one that, especially with competitive games,

516
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:34,770
this is really, really important.

517
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,012
But it can be appropriate to any games.

518
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:38,954
If people can see the top performance,

519
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:41,316
they can be excited by that.

520
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:44,459
So reach for the stars media, let's call it that.

521
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,894
And one example we've got here for Gwent, which actually

522
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:52,957
hasn't even released 1.0 yet.

523
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,600
We started a game tournament last year,

524
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,941
and it's still going every month now,

525
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,403
called the White Wolf Tournament.

526
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:03,505
And we run it every month.

527
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:11,031
It's been pretty well attended, and we livestream it on Twitch.

528
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:12,732
Very, very successful for such a new game

529
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:14,013
that is still trying to create buzz.

530
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:21,979
And Japan has become one of the key markets for City Project Red in the process,

531
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:27,481
because we've been able to stimulate the audience.

532
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:29,663
So this is just some screenshots from the stream.

533
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:33,785
I won't play the video because it has to run off Twitch.

534
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:39,828
But we set up with casters, and we have...

535
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:45,833
Nice professional setup there, we run every month, run the tournament, we find a winner,

536
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:50,435
we got a little bit of prize money, we fly the top four players to Tokyo and we have

537
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:51,316
them compete.

538
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:58,299
We even had one of the top performers was from Taiwan, so we even got a little bit of

539
00:30:58,299 --> 00:30:59,440
a regional impact from it.

540
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,734
He had to play the game in Japanese, though.

541
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:03,255
That was fun.

542
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:10,482
So the idea of creating something

543
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,765
that demonstrates top performance

544
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:15,628
excited other players to try to compete,

545
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:18,370
try to get into the next tournament,

546
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,495
and has done great for giving a nice baseline

547
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:23,235
to the community there.

548
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:32,338
What did we achieve? We established the community of Gwent in Japan and we also regularly get

549
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:36,940
into the top, we regularly top the rankings for Gwent on Twitch. Pretty much anytime we're

550
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,922
streaming we're top of the Twitch rankings.

551
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:47,425
Other examples might be pretty much anything eSports. There are more as well but that's

552
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,646
the one I'll throw out for now.

553
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,913
anything eSports is showing top-level play.

554
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:55,476
And the last truth, because I know I'm running short on time,

555
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:56,496
inclusion truth.

556
00:31:56,496 --> 00:32:00,100
When people feel like they're part of the culture of a game,

557
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,723
they are more inclined to contribute and engage with activities and gameplay.

558
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:07,764
So comfy sofa media, we're going to call it.

559
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:11,025
And the example I've got here is Hearthstone World.

560
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:16,887
And so working with Blizzard, we set up a weekly Twitch stream

561
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:20,049
where we have two key influencers come on

562
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:21,429
and they bring on a community.

563
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,873
someone from the community to talk about the meta,

564
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:29,876
talk about good decks to play, talk about news that's happening,

565
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,277
talk about fun stuff.

566
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:35,580
And we go through a bunch of

567
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,423
gameplay that they can play against people who are watching

568
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:42,646
live on the stream as well, so they'll usually play a few games against

569
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:46,409
people watching to our show weekly. We've been running almost a year already for this.

570
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:50,744
We also have some international guests occasionally too.

571
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:57,026
Jackie Chan who's a famous Hearthstone player out of the UK.

572
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:04,728
Results? We actually have near 100% awareness amongst top influences in Japan,

573
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:07,309
top Hearthstone influences in Japan.

574
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,370
Pretty much anybody you speak to watches the show.

575
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,311
So if you go to a tournament or whatever, they're all...

576
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:14,644
very heavily engaged.

577
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:18,226
We developed a regular audience who will tune in every week

578
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,588
and we provide a platform for news information

579
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:23,450
to be distributed to the most passionate users.

580
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:28,394
And I'm out of time, so I'm going to very quickly jump to the end,

581
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:29,815
which is just a little bit of a summary.

582
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:32,297
Traditional media is losing its effectiveness.

583
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,798
Community can fill that gap.

584
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:38,056
Frictionless media is a community-focused marketing

585
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:41,680
solution that can become a part of a game's marketing plan.

586
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,145
And frictionless media equals be the destination, not

587
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:47,126
the speed bump.

588
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:51,611
And the four frictionless media truths, human truth, progress,

589
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:53,152
aspirational, and inclusion.

590
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,814
Thank you very much.
