1
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:17,036
Hi guys, I'm Kate, I'm a physical therapist, and I'm here with some of the team from 1HP

2
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:21,099
to talk about the early research into health and performance in esports.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,982
So to kick things off, we'll do a little bit of an introduction and then we'll dive right

4
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:25,322
into it.

5
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,733
So like I said, my name is Kate. I'm a physical therapist.

6
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:32,756
I've been a physical therapist for about six years now since 2015.

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,439
I've been working in eSports for about the same amount of time.

8
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:40,442
I'm the co-owner of a company called OneHP,

9
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:42,444
which is a company founded by physical therapists

10
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:45,447
and we provide health and performance services to players,

11
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,849
to teams, to schools, as well as helping non-endemic companies

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,911
understand the eSports healthcare landscape.

13
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:55,555
And we provide our expertise for everything from compression gear to new research initiatives.

14
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,297
We are also, every single one of us, absolute gaming fanatics.

15
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:02,700
Ask me about my Guild Wars 2 crafting level hack sometime.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,202
I got my graduate degree from the University of Delaware.

17
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,275
number one PT program in the country.

18
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:13,199
I'm also the editor, co-editor of the Handbook of Esports Medicine,

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,603
which is the first clinical textbook in the field of esports health and performance.

20
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,746
I'm also an associate editor for the Annals of Esports Research,

21
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:24,590
which is the first ever North American-based esports research journal.

22
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,314
And I'm here with two of my colleagues, Elliot and John.

23
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,715
So Elliot, why don't I hand it off to you?

24
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:46,994
My name is Elliot Smithson, and first and foremost, I'm also a huge gamer, as Kate mentioned, played World of Warcraft for about 10 years, got into the Fortnite scene after that, but I've been playing games since I could hold a controller.

25
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:52,613
A little bit more relevant to my medical history, I finished my undergraduate degree from the

26
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:56,894
University of Central Florida in athletic training and sports medicine. Then I went

27
00:01:56,934 --> 00:02:01,955
on to Marshall University and got a master's in the same degree. I finished my doctorate

28
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:06,476
of physical therapy in 2019 from University of St. Augustine with a heavy emphasis on

29
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:11,757
manual therapy techniques. I've been working in sports medicine and performing arts medicine

30
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,877
for the past 10 years in various facets.

31
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,759
Esports really caught my interest because of a blending of several passions of mine

32
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,062
for helping gamers actually optimize their not only performance,

33
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:28,423
but also their health and ability to continue doing what they love without pain.

34
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,605
It's a great pleasure for me to be here speaking to you guys today,

35
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,326
and I really hope you guys can take something away from this lesson

36
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:37,287
that we can all apply to our individual practices.

37
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:42,570
Hi everybody, I'm Dr. Jonathan Chung, DC.

38
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm also a person's trainer.

39
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,914
I'm the chiropractor on the team. I'm from Canada as well, so the northern contingent of 1HP.

40
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:56,378
I did my undergrad in life sciences and a minor in economics from Queen's.

41
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,642
I also did my doctor of chiropractic at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto.

42
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,605
I've been with 1HP for a while now, about a year.

43
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:12,588
It's been an awesome time. I've learned a ton, and I'm hoping that I can help the...

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,893
Listeners here learn some more stuff about esports research.

45
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:24,620
It's a very interesting topic and it's something that we need to be evidence-based practitioners, which we should all aspire to.

46
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:29,606
Right. So let's talk a little bit about why we need that research in the first place.

47
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:34,270
Um, because e-sports medicine is a fairly new field. And in fact, up until about, I don't know,

48
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,194
two years ago or so, we didn't even really have a name for this field of medicine. It was just,

49
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:43,638
we were healthcare workers who happened to do e-sports stuff. And we've in that time coined

50
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:47,442
the name e-sports healthcare or e-sports medicine. And when I say we, I don't just

51
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:51,085
mean the team at one HP. There are other physical therapists, there's physiatrists.

52
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:55,829
There's absolutely sports psych professionals working in this industry, but we're pretty

53
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,612
short on data right now, or at least published, peer-reviewed, replicable data.

54
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,514
The reason that we need that data?

55
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:08,398
Well, for one thing, there's a pretty large population of people that play eSports.

56
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,619
They've probably got specific needs.

57
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,741
We need to make sure we're knowing what they are so we can address them appropriately.

58
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,400
Two, we need to consider the financial consideration for teams and developers.

59
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:26,486
So looking at the way that the NFL, for example, or the WNBA has invested in research on their players,

60
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:31,169
that affects player longevity, player injury risk, player performance,

61
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,571
all of which has a financial tie into the league and to the

62
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,542
I guess the ownership there, it's similar in eSports.

63
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:42,042
And really, this is a field in a population

64
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,103
that is distinct enough to need its own data.

65
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:46,703
Sure, there's some similarities

66
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,883
between office workers and eSports competitors.

67
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:50,324
And sure, there's some similarities

68
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:54,044
between traditional sports and eSports competitors.

69
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,645
But they're still, in our opinion,

70
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,265
as people who've worked in this field

71
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,345
for six plus years now,

72
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,526
distinct enough to need their own research.

73
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,802
One of the questions we get asked a lot is,

74
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:10,104
are esports sports and are esports competitors athletes?

75
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,084
As though this determines whether or not

76
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,025
this research should be done on this population.

77
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:18,166
And honestly, our answer is who the heck cares

78
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,307
whether they're athletes or not,

79
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,427
and who the heck cares whether this is sports or not.

80
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:25,269
We don't decide that something's not worth studying,

81
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,690
understanding, or approaching with intention.

82
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,998
just because it is or isn't a traditional sport.

83
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,220
So we should give the same amount of consideration

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,322
to esports competitors that we do to sports competitors,

85
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,163
even if we're considering the specifics

86
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,344
of what they do in different ways.

87
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,406
And sure, we can draw from what we know in sports science

88
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,227
about competition, about psychology in particular,

89
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,629
about periodizing training schedules,

90
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,511
but we need to make sure that when we're doing this research,

91
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,012
we're not just thinking of esports

92
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:55,833
as a more sedentary version of traditional sports

93
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:56,874
because it's not.

94
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,149
So in the meantime, who can we borrow from?

95
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:07,530
Quite a few, really.

96
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,371
As I mentioned, we can absolutely look at office workers

97
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,411
and traditional athletes.

98
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,252
Office workers obviously use much of the same equipment

99
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,533
as a large population that plays eSports competitively.

100
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,554
Keyboards, mice, monitors.

101
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:23,795
Not so much using joysticks and controllers as much.

102
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:27,257
So they're leaving out our console players a little bit

103
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,638
with just comparing that office worker research.

104
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:39,960
We can also look, however, at folks like air traffic controllers, who do a cognitively demanding task, sitting in the same position for a really long period of time. That's applicable to eSports.

105
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:48,223
Looking at musicians, competing, performing in front of a large crowd, having some component of entertainment as well as skill at what you're doing.

106
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:54,824
In addition to them, maintaining a single static posture with really precise spine motor movement, definitely eSports.

107
00:06:55,664 --> 00:07:01,126
And chess competitors, heavily cognitive, also involves stable static posture.

108
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:09,208
Doesn't so much require you to have perfect precision, but I suppose if you know you want to make sure you're not touching your knight when you mean to pick up your rook, I guess that requires some amount of precision here.

109
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:14,829
But even with our ability to borrow from the research that's been done in each of these regions,

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,413
esports is still separate and distinct from all these fields. Sure, we described overlaps,

111
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:24,877
but none of them are 100% this fits exactly. The Venn diagram is a perfect circle.

112
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,661
So to provide evidence-based care, we need evidence. We need our own evidence,

113
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,923
evidence that's specific to esports competitors.

114
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,063
So let's talk a little bit about the data that exists right now.

115
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:41,464
John, what do you got for us?

116
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,705
Well, we do have some research.

117
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,588
It's not like we are completely devoid, but we need more.

118
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,789
It's just not enough.

119
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,632
We have some anecdotal advice from osteopaths or people

120
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:56,595
who have some ideas on how to use acupuncture on gamers.

121
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,957
We have some specific pain presentation research.

122
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,878
So for example, low back.

123
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:05,401
But the very rare thing that we don't have a lot of

124
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:05,461
is...

125
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:09,346
causation of pain studies. And those are very important, as you

126
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,527
can imagine, because if we understand the pathology of a

127
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,928
condition, then we can be much more proactive about preventing

128
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:21,889
it or treating it. There's also some studies for gamers, we're

129
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:26,510
not just looking at studies that necessarily have to do with pain

130
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,870
specifically, I think there's a lot of different facets of the

131
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,311
medical literature that are being looked at here. Is that

132
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:33,651
correct, John?

133
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:40,906
Yeah, exactly. We are like Kate mentioned pulling from other fields. So the causation

134
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:45,629
of pain study I talked about where we're looking at the speed and force of keyboard operation

135
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,231
that was done on symptomatic and asymptomatic office workers.

136
00:08:49,374 --> 00:09:06,220
The other important part of esports is the performance aspect, which does have some research on it, and looking at some of the emotions and some of the differences between a pro player and a casual player are also really illuminating for us when we're trying to determine how to treat this population.

137
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,322
It's really, really interesting right now, being in the esports research field because there's just so many things we need.

138
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:15,422
Yeah.

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,024
If we can get some of those really, really interesting topics in, we're going to talk

140
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:26,387
about that a little bit, but we can do some really, really awesome things in this space.

141
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:32,671
Yeah, and so there's a reason that there's three musculoskeletal medicine professionals on this

142
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:36,734
call. There aren't too many of us who work in esports. I mentioned there's a couple. There's

143
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:41,758
a couple more than even just work at 1HP, but the number of folks who are really experienced

144
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,740
and experts in this particular field is limited.

145
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,983
And I don't even call myself an expert, I'm just reasonably experienced at this point.

146
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:56,386
We have experience, we have some degree of expertise, but we don't have data. And without

147
00:09:56,426 --> 00:10:01,609
data, we can't provide this kind of education to medical professionals who aren't as in the

148
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,611
know about gaming, who aren't gamers themselves, potentially. So we end up with this awkward gap

149
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:11,954
between players and the professionals that they go to. You know, we've had plenty of players come

150
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:12,595
to us and say, yeah.

151
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:30,435
Oh yeah, you know, I went to my doctor and because I had wrist pain and he told me to put on a brace and just rest for a while and that's not really an option for folks who eSports is their job, their career, they make money off of this, they need to be able to do it and they need something more proactive than just rest and brace, which doesn't really work anyway for most tendon issues.

152
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:36,680
So part of the reason why we need this data obviously is for medical professionals to do

153
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,644
better by the eSports community. But part of the reason we need the research too is so that eSports

154
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:46,209
competitors take their health and their performance seriously and recognize that they're being taken

155
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:52,755
seriously. It's kind of a mark of respect to be doing this kind of research that yeah this field

156
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,457
is serious enough that it deserves its own time and attention.

157
00:10:56,558 --> 00:11:06,306
So we're going to go into a little bit of some of the studies that are out there right now. This is by no means a comprehensive review. This is just a look at kind of some of the samples of the work that's available currently.

158
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:13,332
We'll make some recommendations about what we think could additionally be done, and then talk a little bit more about the overall research landscape.

159
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:15,834
Exactly.

160
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:21,699
So, this study was basically talking about what we were just discussing.

161
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:27,240
You need to treat eSports players like real patients.

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,021
They deserve care.

163
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,021
They deserve good care.

164
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,482
They deserve evidence-based care.

165
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:34,804
They also mentioned, like we've been harping on, we need more research too.

166
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:42,507
We want to be the most evidence-based we can and really push that side of things

167
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,348
because that's where healthcare is going.

168
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:50,589
The interesting part about the study was it is an editorial, but it has a very powerful message.

169
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,631
And I...

170
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,574
John, just for folks who aren't in like the research field, what's, let's describe what an editorial is too.

171
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:09,621
It's more of an opinion piece. So we're not really running an RCT, we're not doing a randomized control trial, we're not so much looking at subjects, but we're looking at...

172
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:16,120
What a need might be in this particular case and discussing it so that there's more information

173
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,262
on the topic and starting that dialogue. I will also say from a very pragmatic

174
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:25,304
perspective, people writing editorials and getting them published in research journals

175
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:30,146
is a really great way to convince your academic institutions that, oh, we should fund grant money

176
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:34,829
for this particular research project where you want to test gamers on things. That's one of

177
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,449
the utilities of editorials for sure.

178
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,105
Definitely.

179
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,747
It's definitely a hallmark of early research.

180
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,870
Yeah, this was a good paper.

181
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,470
I enjoyed it.

182
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,975
And one thing they brought up, which is interesting, is that esports is getting bigger, which means

183
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:53,018
that competitions are getting bigger, prize pools are getting bigger, and there's a lot

184
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:57,382
of pressure on the line when you're competing at the International for a million dollars

185
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:58,103
or more.

186
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,913
You can imagine that for some players that's a lot.

187
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:09,243
But if we can get ahead of that and look at some of those risk factors and be proactive,

188
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,927
then you won't have people retiring early.

189
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,369
They'll have long, fulfilling careers.

190
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,132
And that's what we want for every gamer.

191
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:20,465
Resident Dota Nerd, I do have to note that the last time a team competed for only a million

192
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:26,827
at The International was like at least 6 years ago at this point. Prize pool for

193
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,989
2019 was like what, 23 million I think overall. That's nuts.

194
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,309
Yeah. That's nuts.

195
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:33,750
More pressure, though. Right?

196
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,092
Sorry, I gotta defend my dota. No, no, please. Fact check me. I like it.

197
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,196
But yes, we know that there's a lot of pressure.

198
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,617
We know that there's a lot of competition.

199
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,018
We know that things are getting,

200
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:49,680
and more and more sports teams are buying

201
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,841
into the e-sports world.

202
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,964
But we still don't have that much data

203
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,787
on how to optimize play and practice in e-sports.

204
00:13:59,508 --> 00:13:59,868
Exactly.

205
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:19,632
This next study was also very interesting. It was a scoping meta-review, which is when you're looking at research for people who aren't as familiar, you're looking at other reviews. So you're taking a wide bird's eye view of what might be out there in the research. And surprise, surprise, we need more.

206
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:21,436
Surprise, surprise, there's not much.

207
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,177
Surprise.

208
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,218
There's going to be a theme here, guys.

209
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,338
It's, yeah, yeah.

210
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,759
Can you tell that we structured the presentation

211
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,341
in a certain way to maybe push a certain agenda?

212
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:38,484
But the interesting thing is that some of those hallmarks

213
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:43,426
of gaming and eSports that we assumed were inviolable

214
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,167
are perhaps not quite so much.

215
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:46,227
So...

216
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:53,044
One thing a lot of people assume is that esports can make you more sedentary and predisposes you to weight gain.

217
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:58,026
But in one of the reviews that this scoping review looked at, it was non-significant findings.

218
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:09,482
social aspects of gaming. Yes, it can be a little isolating at times, but it can also expand your

219
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:14,583
friend group online. And I'm sure that many of us who have been stuck at home for a certain period

220
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:19,925
of time, I'm sure you can understand that seeing someone virtually and spending time with them,

221
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:24,526
it's not the same as being in person, but it's still a very powerful and a very nice experience.

222
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:29,027
And gaming is one of the things that facilitates that. It lets us connect with each other,

223
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,387
which to me is one of the most beautiful things about it.

224
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,032
Elliot, did you have any thoughts?

225
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:46,497
Yeah, I think that there is some research out there that kind of looks at just what you were talking about, the socialization aspect of gaming.

226
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,718
I believe there's a study looking at World of Warcraft players and how they

227
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,721
are actually able to fight off kind of the symptoms

228
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,203
or the pitfalls of gaming, internet gaming disorder,

229
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:03,525
better than some of their counterparts that play solo games.

230
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:07,407
So I really think that speaks to the fact that

231
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,689
social gaming really does have some positive impacts

232
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,690
on people's ability to

233
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:16,590
Have better mental health.

234
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,652
So more studies like this that are specific

235
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:24,195
for gamers' mental health, I think are really, really critical.

236
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:26,076
And we're going to talk about a couple.

237
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,718
I think it's also really key that we're looking at not just the, you know,

238
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:32,840
how do we make sure that eSports is competitive?

239
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,822
How do we make sure that eSports competitors are healthy

240
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:35,742
and performing at their best?

241
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:38,664
But also looking at the general overall landscape of, I guess,

242
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:42,827
the community that surrounds that whole eSports competition sphere.

243
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:44,148
So looking at.

244
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:49,103
Does playing this particular game competitively

245
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,424
have any impact on your fine motor control?

246
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:53,525
Does it have any impact on your ability

247
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:54,826
to regulate your emotions?

248
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,288
Does playing a team game versus playing a solo game

249
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,930
have an increased or a decreased effect

250
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,511
on your ability to control your emotions?

251
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,832
How does team communication play into that,

252
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,653
you know, that feeling of tilt,

253
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:08,934
that feeling of being stressed out and anxious

254
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,975
and frustrated at a game?

255
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:12,636
These are all really great questions

256
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,497
that we don't have a whole lot of answers for.

257
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,297
There's definitely more research

258
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:19,018
on the psychological side of non-competitive gaming

259
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:21,379
and kind of the social health there,

260
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,980
but there's not nearly as much on the communication,

261
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,980
teamwork, and performance side of e-sports

262
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,701
as associated with mental health,

263
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,342
as associated with mental skills,

264
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:34,163
like emotional regulation, like executive function.

265
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:42,386
Exactly. So one of the things that this scoping review shows us is there's not all that much. We need more.

266
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,515
Yes, exactly.

267
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,258
This one was pretty great though, and I know John, you're pretty excited to talk about this one.

268
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,341
Because this was one of the first ones that discussed like gamer health specifically.

269
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,942
It's to be clear, not just esports.

270
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:00,265
But there really, again, there's not too many studies that are differentiating

271
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,547
gaming from esports, like competitive gaming right now.

272
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:07,009
So we did have to fold in some of the non-competitive gaming studies here.

273
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,469
Yeah, exactly.

274
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,811
So this was a really, really awesome...

275
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:22,097
And they looked at trying to optimize three things, which is you want to build awareness of common MSK problems and health hazards.

276
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:28,179
They want to promote health in the gaming space, and then some recommendations for performance.

277
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:31,801
I love this framework. You want to treat gamers holistically.

278
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,122
It's not just pain, but you also want to care about performance.

279
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,603
You play games to have fun and to compete.

280
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:43,446
And especially in eSports, the competition side is paramount, so performance has to be

281
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,207
considered in this situation.

282
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:50,049
One thing that I didn't love about the study was they did mention carpal tunnel quite a

283
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:57,132
few times, and Kate will explain why that perhaps is not ideal a little bit later on.

284
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,727
They did a great job but ergonomics, it gives you some

285
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:05,392
some baselines. So just to run through for anybody who doesn't

286
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:08,657
know, generally, ergonomics are a way for you to hold yourself

287
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:11,301
for a long period of time without a ton of strain on your

288
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:14,265
muscles to, ideally decrease pain, but

289
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,244
Ergonomics aren't everything.

290
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,745
It's also, are you taking breaks?

291
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:19,966
Are you hydrating enough?

292
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:20,966
Are you sleeping enough?

293
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,426
Is your nutrition on point?

294
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,027
Is your mental health solid?

295
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,248
All those things contribute to your pain perception

296
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,788
and your overall health as well.

297
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:33,830
And we also know that actually changing your posture

298
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,190
is the best.

299
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,091
Kate's smiling very widely right now

300
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:38,231
because she loves talking about this.

301
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,586
We have a catchphrase.

302
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:45,008
People think about their chair as like, ah, I'm sitting in my chair for so many hours

303
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:45,389
while gaming.

304
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,670
My chair must be the most important part of my posture and my ergonomics.

305
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,072
I did not coin this phrase.

306
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:54,714
I stole it from a designer for Herman Miller, but the phrase is, your best posture is your

307
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:59,397
next posture, which is to say moving around consistently is better than any one posture

308
00:19:59,417 --> 00:19:59,957
could ever be.

309
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:03,499
You've probably seen me fidgeting around in my chair during this presentation, and we're

310
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,780
only 20 minutes in at this point.

311
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:09,789
I strongly recommend everybody who's tuning in right now do a little bit of shifting around,

312
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:12,413
do a little bit of stretch. This is a great stretch break opportunity.

313
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:17,491
But that's something that we really want to make sure as we're doing this research, we're

314
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,912
incorporating, we're not reinventing the wheel, so to speak.

315
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:25,674
So yes, we want our own eSports specific research, but we also want to take what we already know

316
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:32,337
from really analogous lifestyles, office workers, chess players, air traffic controllers, who

317
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:36,679
do have to sit for long periods, and incorporating what we know there about consistent movement,

318
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,321
and rather than like going and testing.

319
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:43,884
Are gamers better at playing if they maintain the same position or are they better at playing

320
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:47,646
if they change positions often? We know the answer. It's going to be the second one. We

321
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:50,828
don't need to do that study. You can if you really want to and somebody's going to fund it,

322
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:55,051
but perhaps we should put our, you know, research efforts in some more specific regions.

323
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,051
Perhaps, perhaps.

324
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:00,454
And there's also the performance aspect of ergonomics too.

325
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:05,077
Your muscles have an optimal length-tension relationship where they can react the fastest,

326
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,719
they can be the strongest, and ergonomics is part of that.

327
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,922
It puts you in the position so that your muscles can work the most effectively.

328
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,984
Making that connection for some of our gamers we've worked with,

329
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,605
it makes a big difference because suddenly it's not just,

330
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,706
oh, do this and I won't hurt as much,

331
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,667
it's also do this and I'll click more heads,

332
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,108
do this and I'll play better.

333
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,068
That's important.

334
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:37,697
And if we're able to put the numbers in front of people, say, look, if you do this healthy thing, you will perform better if we have the data and the research to back that up, we can point them to a study and say, yes, we can prove that this helps.

335
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:51,587
That makes all the difference in the world because the gaming population and eSports in particular is justifiably skeptical of non endemic folks, let alone medical folks coming in and wanting them to make changes to what they're doing.

336
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:55,370
So if we're able to say, yeah, we can prove that this will make you play better,

337
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,133
then absolutely. That's so much better than just saying, I'm an expert and you should listen to me.

338
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,396
We have to give a why. Here's why you should listen. Here's the proof.

339
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:09,566
I think that is a really interesting paradigm coming in as non-endemic people in the space,

340
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:13,368
or even if you have some gaming experience, unless you've played at a professional level,

341
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:18,851
there is a lot of skepticism about your ability to make meaningful changes to the habits and

342
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:23,593
behaviors of these players, because the mentality really is, hey, I made it this far on my own,

343
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:28,235
when everybody else doubted me. They're coming from a lot of, oftentimes,

344
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,869
I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation.

345
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,230
So, I think we're seeing a lot of resistance from friends and families

346
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,292
that like have questioned like their journey to professional gaming.

347
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,635
I think we're seeing less and less of that as these things become more

348
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,135
accepted.

349
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:43,177
There are organizations dedicated to.

350
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:45,539
Educating parents on.

351
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:50,682
How e-sports is actually a profitable profession and can build these

352
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:05,511
make their dreams come true, it's really important that we are able to actually provide the research

353
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:13,934
that shows that this can be done in a safe and healthy way and how to really demonstrate the

354
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:18,696
benefits. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later, the benefits of gaming on kind of what

355
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,638
we can take away as a society as a whole.

356
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:34,114
But anyway, we're going to transition, speaking of performance, into kind of a more sports psychology, mental health, kind of intertwined with physiology type study here.

357
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:41,440
So this was a really interesting study that looked at both psychological factors and physiological factors.

358
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,744
So that kind of means more body response to stress and specifically pregame stress.

359
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:54,051
And while we took a look at this study and we kind of concluded that it was fairly obvious information,

360
00:23:55,372 --> 00:24:08,726
what they ended up doing or finding was that professional players have greater psychological stress responses than non-professional players before a match.

361
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,127
And I think that...

362
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:23,597
go without saying in a lot of our minds, like of course that the pro player with money on the line is going to have more stress than the amateur player who's just playing kind of for fun or for bragging rights.

363
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:29,722
It's really important that we start laying the foundation

364
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,983
for all of the work to be done on top of this.

365
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,724
So now you can take a study like this

366
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,904
and then cite this in other studies,

367
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,946
given that this is already a known factor.

368
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:45,447
Like, yes, we know that the psychological factors

369
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:49,068
of stress are gonna be greater in professional players.

370
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,809
So now you can start building the case out

371
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:55,010
for hundreds of other studies on top of this.

372
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,856
So foundational work like this, while it may seem very, very simple and very, very rudimentary,

373
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:09,282
is still wildly important in developing the field for everyone that comes after.

374
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,484
So I think... Sorry, go ahead, Kate.

375
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:16,328
I mean, it's obviously important for researchers and professionals.

376
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,732
But again, this is also really important to gamers, to teams, to competitors.

377
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,754
Because, sure, they'll take a look at this and say,

378
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:27,037
like, yeah, no, of course I'm more stressed when I'm playing, you know,

379
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:31,521
in the finals of the International than I was when I was playing in the AD2L,

380
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:33,743
Amateur Dota 2 League in the US.

381
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:49,568
But sometimes research needs to quantify or prove obvious things that everybody in the industry knows so that one, we can communicate this to outside people and so that two, we can find the ways to address it.

382
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:53,472
Because if we can't establish in the research, this is a thing we need to address.

383
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:57,376
Then how do we test what's the most effective way to address it.

384
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:02,418
We've quantified something we've only theorized about previously, which means we can address it more consistently.

385
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:09,539
And we can say, yes, absolutely, we need folks who have sports psychology backgrounds, who have performance psychology backgrounds.

386
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,941
We've provided concrete evidence here that competing at a high level is not the same as just casually playing.

387
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:23,423
So that's important data for the players, that's important data for the teams, that's important data for anybody who wants to talk about, like,

388
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,986
How are they making a million dollars playing video games?

389
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,008
I play video games.

390
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,150
I should have gone into eSports.

391
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,592
No, you're not actually any good of it, Jan.

392
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,313
I'm also not any good at it, which is why I'm not a professional eSports player.

393
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,734
We are spitting the facts.

394
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:44,958
But like, so studies like this, well to those of us who've ever had any exposure whatsoever

395
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:50,120
to eSports are like, no duh, of course this is the result. This is really, really important

396
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,762
to making sure that we're providing the best possible care to players because we're able

397
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:58,785
to say yes, we've established without a shadow of a doubt, this is peer-revealable

398
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:02,846
Replicable data that says, yeah, this exists, and we need to address it as a result.

399
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:08,968
Exactly. It's validating. And that's the important part. And it's not just for us,

400
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,549
but for anyone who might be new to the space who thinks, like Kate just said,

401
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,491
it's just video games. How could it be stressful? It is. When there's millions of dollars on the

402
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:21,251
line, I think anybody would be a little stressed.

403
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:35,518
And I like that they in this study not only looked at the psychological factors and psychological research can sometimes get a bad rap for not being expressly objective, but they actually looked at the cortisol levels in these players.

404
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:43,863
So cortisol is a stress response hormone. So they really went in and did the blood work and looked at the actual cortisol response and noticed that it was higher.

405
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:47,545
So it's not just something that you can say is, quote unquote, in your head.

406
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:56,828
But there is an actual physiological response to this, which I think is just a really cool blending of both the psychological and the physiological.

407
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:58,509
Yep.

408
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:02,330
You can't entirely disassociate the two, they kind of have to work together.

409
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:15,994
And I really think that that is something that once the entire eSports industry understands we will see a major explosion in progress, as far as performance goes and.

410
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:23,217
I've been really interested to see, actually, that a lot of the places where teams have been

411
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:29,200
interested in investing more long-term so far has been in that psychological side of things,

412
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:36,944
which I think is fantastic because that is such a key component of things. But as this and other

413
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:42,326
studies will show, we do have to address both sides of it. We can't just address the body or

414
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,208
the mind. We need to address the two in conjunction in order to improve not just health but performance.

415
00:28:47,087 --> 00:29:04,592
Right, this goes back to the our esports and athlete athletes discussion, where it's oftentimes brushed off that the whole athletic component because it's not perceived to be much movement involved but as we know from working in this.

416
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:09,693
And as you can see from the musculoskeletal pain patterns

417
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:10,774
that we're about to talk about,

418
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:13,254
there is a lot of movement going on here.

419
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,615
If you're using your body to do something,

420
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:18,176
you should be addressing that just as much as the mind,

421
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,257
but it is interesting how much emphasis is placed

422
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:22,917
on the psychological in esports.

423
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:24,978
But...

424
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:29,459
I'm segueing myself here into the next slide.

425
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,779
Self-assessment.

426
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:31,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,520
There was a study done on Danish esports athletes,

428
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,841
and this was a survey.

429
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:41,922
So again, this is kind of a hallmark of early research.

430
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:45,802
A survey is not necessarily the best way

431
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:48,983
to get hard, objective data,

432
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,084
and we're not testing anything here.

433
00:29:51,144 --> 00:29:52,904
So you're not comparing one group to another

434
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,424
like the previous study actually did.

435
00:29:56,045 --> 00:30:00,987
You are just looking at responses of these athletes.

436
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:06,030
So you may not be getting the highest quality of metrics from this,

437
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,233
but it is definitely worth looking at and then actually taking these findings

438
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:17,456
and then progressing them into more of kind of a randomized control trial study.

439
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:22,239
But anyway, they had 188 responses, which is pretty good for esports, to be honest.

440
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,159
It really is, honestly.

441
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,105
And they were pretty representative of the population.

442
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:35,048
And 42 percent report reported having some kind of musculoskeletal pain,

443
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,888
which is absolutely huge.

444
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:39,430
If 50 percent of your population is complaining of something,

445
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,291
it is definitely worth exploring.

446
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:44,252
Yeah, you address it.

447
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,673
If half the people we're working with are hurting.

448
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:47,233
Yeah.

449
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:52,529
And yeah, and as musculoskeletal professionals, as physical therapists,

450
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,371
we we have this.

451
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:58,634
This study is a little bit closer to our hearts,

452
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:02,677
but that doesn't mean to say it's more important than any of the other factors

453
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:03,797
that we've been considering here.

454
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:06,860
But a lot of the pain sites that people were reporting,

455
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,061
31% of people reporting back pain.

456
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:13,465
So whether or not they were differentiating between upper back, lower back.

457
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:22,407
I'm not entirely sure in this study, but back pain seemed to be the biggest, the site of pain for these players.

458
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:28,691
And that I think is massively groundbreaking for perceptions of the community.

459
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:33,874
I think every time that someone non-endemic to esports has...

460
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:37,439
I'm going to get into that. There's a slide about that. Don't worry.

461
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,733
Carpal tunnel is an issue in the hand.

462
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:57,455
And that's not even the biggest issue that we see

463
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:00,036
when we pull gamers at large.

464
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:02,917
Most of the pain is in the back.

465
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:05,638
So even just foundational studies like this

466
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,659
can be so meaningful just to be able to point to this

467
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:11,199
and be like, no, it's actually back pain.

468
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,360
Neck pain is huge.

469
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
Shoulder problems can develop.

470
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:15,841
There's a lot of hip.

471
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,802
and kind of glute pain that go along with gaming as well.

472
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:25,383
Nerve symptoms that can be triggered by tight muscles.

473
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:28,624
There's a lot more to this than wrist pain.

474
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,805
I actually pulled up the supplemental research on this

475
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:35,086
where they kind of list out the percentages of players here

476
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:40,387
that are experiencing different region or pain in different regions of the body.

477
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:44,352
So it goes back at 31%, neck at 11%, shoulder at 11%, headaches at 8%, forearm at 7%, wrist at 6%, hand and fingers at 5%.

478
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:44,612
That is...

479
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:04,764
That's huge, like to understand that, no, it's not really all wrist and hand pain.

480
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:07,885
You've got other areas of the body that need exploring here.

481
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:14,106
And that's going to change kind of the way that we approach studying this population

482
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:15,447
and molding future studies.

483
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:20,048
So I hope I've kind of delivered the point here

484
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:22,788
of how important these foundational studies are.

485
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:36,352
And how simple it is to come up with a concept and just run with it as far as the study goes, because chances are you are doing something meaningful, whether you think it's a very specific topic or a very simple topic.

486
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:50,163
And we'll get a little bit into kind of more action steps later and how we can go about formulating some of these study topics, but I think that's huge.

487
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:55,365
That one of the one of the things that we can run into with a survey study, which this one was.

488
00:33:56,606 --> 00:34:00,229
Is we're not getting necessarily objective data that we've measured, we're getting someone's

489
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:04,352
perception of what's going on. Which we can absolutely build out surveys that make things

490
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:08,936
less subjective, more objective. We can build in questions that kind of back check each other in

491
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:14,521
order to establish internal consistency within a survey. But survey studies like this are a

492
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:20,365
really great place to start for two reasons. One, they're pretty darn inexpensive and when

493
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:23,388
nobody wants to fund your research you need an inexpensive study to start with.

494
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:28,754
And two, the result of this study, you can then take it, especially if you get it published,

495
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:33,941
and say, look, we have published data that establishes back pain is a serious problem

496
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:37,605
for eSports competitors. We want to research that further. Then you can actually get grant

497
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,326
money for that stuff.

498
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:48,896
So kind of within kind of the progression of research, yes, we'd love to be testing a whole bunch of things that we've observed either anecdotally or from our experience.

499
00:34:49,997 --> 00:35:01,728
But survey studies like this basically quantify that observed experience, and then let researchers actually study it in a way that's consistent and objective and reliable over time.

500
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:10,453
So for all that survey studies can get a bad rap. They're really really valuable for as Elliot said the kind of foundation laying for building the research for a field.

501
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:17,852
And it's really important, though, to consider, here's what a survey study is good for,

502
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:23,014
establishing do people have pain of some sort. And it's really important to note that in this

503
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:27,456
particular study, they didn't pathologize any of the pain, which is to say, they didn't say

504
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:34,440
they're reporting then that they have sciatica, or yes, they've confirmed that they have

505
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,142
thoracic outlet syndrome. They're describing where they have pain. They have not ascribed

506
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,583
a diagnosis to that pain.

507
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:45,026
Which is accurate, fair, and reasonable in a survey study.

508
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:50,611
Because in order to diagnose somebody with something, there's usually a diagnostic criteria you have to go through.

509
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,334
So if you were diagnosing, say, sciatic nerve issues,

510
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:58,678
you'd probably want to look at their range of motion in their back.

511
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:00,659
You'd want to look at their hamstring flexibility.

512
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,722
You'd want to test the mobility of the sciatic nerve.

513
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:07,285
You'd do certain clinical tests, like a slump test, for example.

514
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:23,916
to put that sciatic nerve under tension and see does that replicate the symptoms. You'd also want to rule out other things so you might go in and palpate kind of the gluteal tuberosity which is the butt bone basically seeing is there is there tenderness here that way I would associate with like a hamstring tendinopathy.

515
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:30,018
You might check out and see, is there weakness or tightness in the glute muscles that I might

516
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,198
think that there's a muscle compensating that's putting pressure on this nerve.

517
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,960
And so all of those things go into creating a diagnosis. A survey can't replicate that,

518
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,401
but a survey can give you general information about pain.

519
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:46,642
Now why am I going on and on about how a survey can't diagnose?

520
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:50,123
I'm going to come back to yours, I promise, but this was just a bit of a segue to miss.

521
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:53,565
All right, fine.

522
00:36:55,086 --> 00:37:01,571
So there was a survey study that looked at carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms in e-sports competitors.

523
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:06,706
Which, not unreasonable, they do specify it's about symptoms.

524
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:12,610
But the danger of a kind of study like this where you're ascribing the results of a survey,

525
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:18,053
a player describing where their pain is located, to a diagnosis is you haven't actually confirmed

526
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:22,616
they have that diagnosis and you can, by publishing that research, create a misconception about

527
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,018
how common carpal tunnel is or isn't.

528
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:28,642
Now, this is not published research. This is my anecdotal

529
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,743
experience as a physical therapist who's been doing this

530
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:34,945
for six years. I have in my time, treating gamers, treated

531
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:37,926
exactly one case of carpal tunnel syndrome. And it was in

532
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,367
somebody who developed a carpal tunnel syndrome from a manual

533
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,628
labor job. And they also happened to play games, which is

534
00:37:42,648 --> 00:37:45,149
where their symptoms presented the most. So the games brought

535
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:50,491
out the pain, they didn't cause the pain. So there's, there's

536
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,924
Saying that you have symptoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome does not mean you have

537
00:37:56,964 --> 00:38:00,246
carpal tunnel syndrome. Some of the symptoms that are associated with carpal tunnel syndrome

538
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:05,070
are associated with other conditions like tendinopathy, like other median nerve issues,

539
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:09,673
like something like cubital tunnel syndrome, double crush syndrome, a cervical radiculopathy,

540
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:13,076
a thoracic outlet syndrome, all of which are words that just sound like jargon if you're

541
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:14,017
not in the medical industry.

542
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:29,324
But it's basically the gist of it is it's very, very difficult to diagnose any of those things without being hands on with a person, and it's absolutely impossible to diagnose somebody with those conditions over a survey.

543
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:40,409
So it's really important as we're starting to develop the research and the foundations for this field that we a contextualize our research and make it really clear that we're looking at.

544
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,332
A player reported pain as opposed to ascribing a diagnosis to it.

545
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:50,094
And two, it's really important that the folks who are doing research have familiarity both

546
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:55,657
with research and with gaming. There's got to be a blend of both. This can't be a one thing

547
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:59,959
or the other, which again we'll get into a little bit later on once I let Elliot talk about performance.

548
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,961
Yeah. Yeah. Where was I?

549
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:15,113
All right, so this study about performance was actually interestingly put together.

550
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:19,615
I've never seen a study kind of done like this, but it was kind of a two part study.

551
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:30,980
So in the first part of the study, what they did was they developed this kind of litany of abilities that they think that pro gamers should have or.

552
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:39,451
Um, be able to be proficient at. Um, so they kind of broke this down into several categories here.

553
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:47,193
Psychic or mental abilities, including personality. Social abilities. Um, the condition category. So

554
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:55,415
those are things like, uh, physical fitness, endurance, speed, flexibility. Um, constitution.

555
00:39:55,795 --> 00:40:00,056
So these are things like, um, sounds like a D and D statute.

556
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:05,286
Yep. Yeah, yeah, I really feel like they were very heavily inspired by.

557
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:11,257
Kind of RPG style stats, yeah.

558
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:16,962
But anyway, constitution is things like your age,

559
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:18,723
like your nutrition, sleep,

560
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,525
things like kind of baseline factors

561
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,367
and then media competency.

562
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,730
So those are like things like your ability to network

563
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:32,314
socially through internet media, like Reddit and Twitter

564
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:35,036
and like kind of finding information about the game

565
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:35,677
and stuff like that.

566
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:41,640
So these competencies, they then turned into a survey,

567
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,961
and then they sent the survey out

568
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:46,522
to a bunch of different gamers.

569
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:53,905
I think 1,835 players they sent the survey to.

570
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:56,886
So basically what they were looking at was,

571
00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:00,048
do these individual competencies change

572
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:01,589
based on the game that you're playing?

573
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:05,430
And again, this is another study where it's like,

574
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:08,097
Yeah, obviously it's going to.

575
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:11,719
But it is good to have data like this in order

576
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,701
to continue building that case up.

577
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:17,423
But yeah, they ended up finding that the different games do

578
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:18,744
have different skills that are more

579
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:21,106
important or perceived important for these players.

580
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,388
So while kind of oddly put together,

581
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:28,210
I think they did come out with some good information that

582
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,392
can be used by.

583
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:54,145
Both people in our profession as well as game developers, as well as sports psychologists, nutritionists, all of these different fields can I think maybe pull at least something from this study just to kind of look at what the perceptions of large games actual population are.

584
00:41:56,687 --> 00:42:01,771
Yeah, and something that could potentially come out of a study like this is testing what skills

585
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,374
are actually most important via an objective measure compared to what players perceive as

586
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:08,637
most important. And if there's a mismatch, they're determining why is there a mismatch?

587
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:13,261
How do we help them understand which is actually the most relevant skill for what they're doing?

588
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,204
Those are absolutely things that can then be built off of a study like this.

589
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:22,168
The really great thing about research is it builds more research, it builds more understanding,

590
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:27,153
it lets us as professionals provide better care, and it lets players play better if we

591
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:28,554
help them implement this research.

592
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:36,561
So we've got some proposed best practices for research when it comes to researchers

593
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:39,663
specifically, and we want to dig into that a little bit for sure.

594
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:52,738
The first one is I kind of mentioned that we wanted, we didn't just want non-endemic folks

595
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:57,021
to come in and do research on games without having any experience as gamers. That's not

596
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:01,644
to say that you need to be an avid gamer in order to do games research, but you need to at least be

597
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:06,888
familiar enough to kind of, I guess, respect the culture, have some degree of cultural competency

598
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:07,609
around esports.

599
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:11,518
This is not an us versus them venture.

600
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:15,863
This is not the gaming industry versus academia.

601
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:20,569
This is and should be a venture that incorporates the knowledge

602
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:22,752
and the experience of folks who are endemic to e-sports,

603
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,374
the players, the coaches, the staff.

604
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:39,233
And then the research qualifications of non endemic academic folks, combining those two things together, gives us studies that are relevant, that are well designed, and that actually have bearing on the on the eSports world so they don't just have.

605
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:54,500
Theoretical research use. They've got practical, actionable use in the field that is being studied, which research should do. Research should provide, you know, at least some amount of benefit to the folks who are being studied.

606
00:43:55,781 --> 00:44:02,846
And kind of on that note, I think it's really important when it comes to research to incorporate subjects into publications. And what do I mean by that?

607
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:10,190
Well, in pain science research recently, there's been this push to have, as co-authors on papers,

608
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:15,013
patients who are describing patient experience of pain, especially when you're talking about

609
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:20,556
like the provider understanding of a patient's pain or the patient experience of pain,

610
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:25,038
to have actual patients helping to write the papers. Now, does that mean that every patient

611
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:29,020
has all kinds of, you know, research background and experience? No, absolutely not. That's why

612
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,501
they're a co-author, not a sole author.

613
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:36,106
But we know that expertise is not confined to academia.

614
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:40,750
There are experts in their field, and we should absolutely make sure

615
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,974
that the knowledge of those experts is well distributed and well transmitted,

616
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:49,017
because otherwise we're just doing research on something

617
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:50,158
that the industry already knows.

618
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:51,839
And then that cements that kind of.

619
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,222
Well, there are these outside folks who don't know anything who came in and tested a thing that we could have told them if they bothered asking us.

620
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:09,827
So then there becomes kind of this this headbutting thing. Whereas, if you come in and you partner with folks who are already in the gaming community already in the eSports world, players, coaches, staff, us.

621
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:18,503
Then you're making sure that you draw on what's already there so that you can build what isn't.

622
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:25,070
It can't just be a thing that academia does to gaming, it has to be a thing we do with gaming.

623
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:29,524
It's very recognizable when it is the former.

624
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:31,025
It's very, very clear.

625
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:41,169
You see E-S and it's an immediate giveaway that these people have not talked to any players.

626
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:44,611
I will acknowledge some degree of possible okayness with that.

627
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:50,293
It's a paper in another language and it just got translated in the translation engine put e-sports

628
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:55,535
by the fact that the AP style guide says e-sports, single word, no hyphen, no capitalize this.

629
00:45:56,856 --> 00:46:02,579
All right, so also important to consider when it comes to research, who pays for it?

630
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:09,161
So this is the question that everybody really is asking at the end of the day.

631
00:46:09,938 --> 00:46:14,900
Um, and I think before we answer who's going to pay for this, I think we should answer why they

632
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,403
should pay for it. Um, so I really think that there's a lot of applicability of esports to

633
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:26,146
other fields. So esports is interesting because although we have established or tried to

634
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:33,529
establish that it is not just a mental function, it is kind of the pinnacle of mental functioning.

635
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:41,913
competitively. There really isn't a whole lot of other kind of ways that we interface both

636
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:53,558
in kind of the neuromotor control facets of intellectual, that's not the right word,

637
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:58,340
it's difficult to find another field that

638
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,672
quantifies all of these mental skills

639
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:05,614
that we see represented in e-sports

640
00:47:05,714 --> 00:47:06,675
in a competitive setting,

641
00:47:06,935 --> 00:47:10,297
as well as we see in the competitive gaming world.

642
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,719
So that being said,

643
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,481
there is application to other fields

644
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:20,023
within kind of that sphere of like mental function.

645
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:24,867
So cognition is the ability to think essentially.

646
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:28,749
And there are studies out there that show that gaming,

647
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:35,957
actually does improve your ability to think critically, rationally, logically, strategically,

648
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:44,227
all of these things that we value in society and in both children growing up as well as

649
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:45,108
aging adults.

650
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:48,292
So I really think that it is.

651
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:55,944
In the same way that when we send someone to the moon, we advance technology here on earth, it is worth looking at these

652
00:47:57,805 --> 00:48:12,515
These facets of cognition and fine motor skills and how we can prevent deterioration in patients with Alzheimer's by studying how to push the boundaries with competitive gaming.

653
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:19,011
And so who exactly would be interested in advancing this kind of line of knowledge?

654
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:24,513
I think both academic institutions as well as medical organizations are very interested

655
00:48:24,793 --> 00:48:29,656
in kind of understanding how to push the limits in this way, as well as the government,

656
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:36,919
for various reasons, whether it be developing practice guidelines for our medical health

657
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,000
systems, either for military involvement.

658
00:48:40,435 --> 00:48:45,639
All of these institutions, I think, can have a vested interest in kind of pushing that line of knowledge into

659
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,543
understanding how the brain works at the highest levels.

660
00:48:51,397 --> 00:49:16,242
Right. And so here we're talking about some of the more traditional structures of research funding, academic institutions, which publication, publication, publication, medical organizations, we provide care, of course, we're invested in the outcomes of our patients, and government organizations, both in terms of general for the public good. But also definitely there's when it comes to eSports, there are military applications for the kind of stuff we study in gaming.

661
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:22,000
But we are not at an academic conference, or at a medical conference, or at a government conference.

662
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,582
We're at the Game Developers Conference, so...

663
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:26,225
Why should developers care?

664
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:31,452
So, the first part of the answer to this is, not all of them have to.

665
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:33,174
Which is to say...

666
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:39,653
Yes, developers care about the players who play their games to some extent and in some way.

667
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:45,419
We're talking specifically here about kind of the larger esports kind of organizations. We're

668
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:49,783
talking about the developers who create games specifically to be played competitively as an

669
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:50,224
esport.

670
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,984
And those are, in our opinion, the kinds of developers who are probably going to care the most about this kind of research.

671
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:01,307
Now that's not to say that smaller indie studios won't care.

672
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:05,210
Especially if, say, you're developing a game that incorporates aspects of mental health.

673
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:11,755
Then sure, absolutely, you're probably interested in and maybe even invested in the kind of research that comes out about mental health in games.

674
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:20,622
But if we're looking at health and performance in esports, then the developers who create games that are esports are probably going to be the most interested here.

675
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:24,209
So why should those developers specifically care?

676
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:27,330
Why should the gaming and eSports industry care about this?

677
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,452
Well, when it comes to a purely pragmatic financial perspective,

678
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:35,353
having longer player careers, having career longevity

679
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:37,774
because players aren't injured and they're playing at a high level,

680
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,875
there's financial value there.

681
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:42,356
People want to watch people play at the highest level.

682
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,297
People want to follow their favorite players.

683
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:47,478
And a lot of fans follow players more than they follow just teams.

684
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:56,569
Leagues want to have players who are able to play consistently over time, because that gets people tuning in to watch it, which gets ad revenue, which gets your company money.

685
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:04,620
But in kind of a more public good sense, investing in this kind of research creates a more stable, more sustainable industry.

686
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:10,835
And sure, eSports really started with so much grassroots work.

687
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:16,339
eSports really started with community organization, especially in the fighting games community, for example.

688
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:20,321
It still does rely very heavily on a lot of grassroots organization.

689
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:27,705
But if we want to create the kind of stability that we wished we'd had when we were first getting started in all of this,

690
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:33,048
if we want to create some reliability, some degree of security, some degree of infrastructure,

691
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:39,852
that doesn't mean we have to become stodgy, and it doesn't mean we have to create the exact same thing that's already been done elsewhere that we don't particularly like.

692
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:46,595
We have the opportunity to create a new health infrastructure in esports, and a new performance and health model for our players.

693
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,257
But we have to put the time and effort into it.

694
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:55,362
Because otherwise we're just going to have to borrow from everybody else because that's the easier and less expensive way to do it.

695
00:51:56,163 --> 00:52:04,290
If we want a community that is ours, if we want an infrastructure that is ours and works best for us, we need to take the time and money to invest into it.

696
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:09,982
Other reasons that developers could potentially care about this really great way of correcting

697
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:14,445
misconceptions about gaming is providing research that says no you are wrong they're not basement

698
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:19,509
dwellers who just you know eat Doritos and drink Mountain Dew and no not just anybody could be a

699
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:24,052
top tier eSports competitor the kind of folks who win you know eight million dollars at the

700
00:52:24,092 --> 00:52:29,956
international really are exceptional on par with you know making it into the NFL in terms of the

701
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:31,997
elite tier of the thing that they do.

702
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,811
This also allows developers to tap into new markets, as we alluded to.

703
00:52:37,914 --> 00:52:42,657
Having research that shows kind of the health benefits of competitive e-sports,

704
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:47,320
as well as the ways in which e-sports can be integrated into an overall healthy lifestyle,

705
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,823
absolutely improves parental support. Parents being the ones who have the money to buy the

706
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:55,225
games that their kids play. It's a pretty important market to be tapping into.

707
00:52:56,125 --> 00:53:00,608
So this kind of research absolutely should be funded by traditional institutions,

708
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:04,971
absolutely should be studied by traditional academic, medical, and government organizations.

709
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:10,161
That being said, it's absolutely research that the industry should be interested and

710
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:16,005
invested in, because it helps us create this more sustainable playing field for esports

711
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:22,509
to continue to be a viable option to design games to be played in, for players to participate

712
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:27,472
in, and for support staff to then design the structures that keep all of that up and functioning.

713
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:35,630
It can't just be a thing that non-endemics care about, because if non-endemics are the only ones who care about this research,

714
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,832
and non-endemics are the only ones who are going to do it,

715
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:41,154
then we're going to end up with a whole bunch of people who don't know all that much about gaming,

716
00:53:41,654 --> 00:53:44,696
not drawing on the serious expertise that's already here,

717
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:49,319
that we could absolutely rely on for real value when it comes to research.

718
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:54,243
So, when it comes to research, what do we need?

719
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,821
Best practice guidelines.

720
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,362
Yes, what are those?

721
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:00,223
Exactly.

722
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,985
There's a reason I put three exclamation marks here,

723
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:11,450
because having some standardized care across the industry will do so much good.

724
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:14,853
There's some very cool research out on tendons,

725
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:18,115
and not everyone knows that isometrics can be really pain relieving.

726
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:21,078
being that disrupted to a training schedule.

727
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:25,339
And there's just so much cool stuff out there that if we can standardize it and

728
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,641
and help other practitioners understand what the best way to treat someone is,

729
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:31,381
we can make a humongous difference.

730
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:34,282
And think about the scale of how many gamers are in the world.

731
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:36,283
There's millions, billions of them.

732
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:39,603
And do they not deserve care any more than the millions

733
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,124
and billions of people who play basketball?

734
00:54:41,184 --> 00:54:42,424
That's not true.

735
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:43,785
They both need help.

736
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:47,646
It's not a you take away from one and then you take away from the other.

737
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:48,186
We can help both.

738
00:54:49,873 --> 00:55:00,961
Exactly. So prevalence data is basically in a population how often something occurs. And so having the understanding of how many

739
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:06,329
People may have a certain condition, whether it be low back pain, wrist pain, finger pain,

740
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:12,091
can help us a lot with understanding, okay, where do we need to invest the most time and energy?

741
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:18,753
As we just learned with Elliot, we have a lot of low back pain. Maybe instead of focusing so much

742
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:25,176
on fingers and hands, we should focus more on low backs with gamers, right? And understanding

743
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:29,437
the physical demands of gaming also really, really helps us

744
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:34,356
understand how to be proactive with injuries as opposed to reactive.

745
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:38,960
And as many of you might imagine, using a mouse and keyboard is very different

746
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,282
from using an Xbox controller or PS5 controller.

747
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:45,526
And then even then, you play Valorant, very different from playing Dota.

748
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:49,710
And even if you play Dota, if you're solo carry versus support,

749
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,033
that's very different inputs. Those have very, very...

750
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,450
We know that these are different, but we don't know exactly how.

751
00:55:57,091 --> 00:56:02,054
And we don't know the distribution of pain that comes from these differences is actually relevant.

752
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:07,699
So like the studies that looked at all these back pain issues, I don't think it was organized by actual game.

753
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,122
So like understanding very specifically to the population you're working with is so important.

754
00:56:12,442 --> 00:56:18,246
Yeah, like a great example of Smash Brothers, we've seen more folks who play Fox having,

755
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:21,868
you know, tendon pain across the back of their hand than folks who say mean peach.

756
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:27,111
Now, we can't prove that because we haven't done any research on it, but anecdotally, we're like,

757
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:32,094
yeah, this absolutely makes sense. And so being able to quantify that, as John referenced,

758
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:38,077
allows us to create more consistent care guidelines that are more specific and less

759
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:41,239
general. Because right now, the general guideline that gets given out...

760
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,524
by folks who don't know gaming well is rest and brace. Without really looking into, okay,

761
00:56:47,564 --> 00:56:52,048
what game do you play? What input device do you use? How long are you playing for? What character

762
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:56,872
do you main within the game that you play if your game is one that has a main character that you

763
00:56:56,892 --> 00:56:57,272
might play?

764
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:01,774
Okay, what are the most common inputs you use on your input device?

765
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,856
Are you wave dashing a lot as a Smash Fox player?

766
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:10,618
Are you in Dota playing invoker and having to do all of the, you know,

767
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,339
really complicated invoking combinations?

768
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:16,821
Or are you like me playing Vengeful Spirit and just pressing A?

769
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,181
Look, stuns are good, okay?

770
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:24,585
But all of this information is really helpful and really valuable for understanding what areas are

771
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:29,448
most under strain and what areas should we be starting to prevent strain in. What can we do

772
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:34,311
for players to help them not get injured in the first place? Because we really run into a lot of

773
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:38,354
players who don't want to see a healthcare professional because they don't think the

774
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:42,837
healthcare professional is going to know what to do to help them. Which, you know what? Fair,

775
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:46,739
based on our track record so far. That's a reasonable opinion to have.

776
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,322
But if we could have a few less, you know, highs and hacks in the world,

777
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:56,085
you know, having to retire due to medical injury that really could have been prevented,

778
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,428
then we end up with more top tier players.

779
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:02,109
We as spectators get to enjoy it a heck of a lot more.

780
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:06,232
The industry stays more sustainable and people leave because they want to leave,

781
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:09,994
not because they're forced out by a medical condition that absolutely could have been

782
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:14,477
prevented if we just had the data and the professionals who were in the right place

783
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:15,958
to help provide that care.

784
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:22,765
Exactly. We want to help healthcare providers help people better. And that's the whole point

785
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:27,931
of all this research in this entire presentation is that we can do better. We do, I think at 1HP

786
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:33,136
we do a great job, but we can help a lot more people. And ultimately at the end of the day,

787
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:38,322
we're all just trying to elevate the entire ecosystem of esports and the culture of gaming.

788
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:43,000
So I really think that that's a great kind of final note to end on here.

789
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:48,865
We have a bit of a motto at 1HP, and our motto is play more, hurt less.

790
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:50,907
And we want that to be an option for players.

791
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:52,389
We want people to be able to play.

792
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,631
We want that to be a part of a healthy lifestyle.

793
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,934
We want esports competitors to be competing at their best, playing more.

794
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:05,265
But without hurting and in order to make that happen, we need the research to develop this industry to develop this field of esports medicine.

795
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:10,734
And that's the way that we provide the best possible care to players so that they can play more and hurt less.

796
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:17,334
for joining us for this, guys. I think we've kept it to almost 60 minutes on the dot. We've

797
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:22,318
been pretty impressed by it, I've got to be honest. We've been in chat answering questions

798
00:59:22,378 --> 00:59:26,542
this whole time. This is a little weird because we're pre-recording this. But if you ever

799
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:31,506
have any future questions for us, you can always reach out to us on Twitter, which I

800
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:33,268
believe will be posted here.

801
00:59:34,956 --> 00:59:38,620
We're more than happy to answer questions at any time, because we really want to make

802
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:42,085
sure that this is something that sticks around, that this research really continues to grow.

803
00:59:42,605 --> 00:59:42,806
Yes.

804
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:45,269
Absolutely. Thank you, everybody.

805
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,690
Thank you so much.
