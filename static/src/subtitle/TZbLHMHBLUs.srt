1
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:12,679
Okay, welcome to Black Games Interview and Afro Future Flyby. My name is Lindsay Grace. I'm the

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,022
chair of interactive media at the University of Miami and I'm vice president of the Higher

3
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:23,625
Education Video Game Alliance. I'm also professor, game designer, developer, artist, and author.

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:30,108
I currently work as Knight chair in interactive media at the University of Miami and I'm,

5
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:32,930
it's a position funded by the Knight Foundation.

6
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:44,895
I've created and directed two academic game studios, one at the American University and the other at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

7
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:54,264
I am a solo game designer, developer, and artist. I've produced 25 plus different games for mobile, web, and PC.

8
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,954
I've also done some commercial solo dev, a couple of my games.

9
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:03,116
I ended up in the App Store's top 100 for arcade games and puzzle games.

10
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,497
Some of the icons for those games are shown here on the left.

11
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:10,620
And I'm an awarded game designer for a variety of designs that I've done in collaboration

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,983
with students, in collaboration with other designers, and in collaboration or as part

13
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,404
of some of the studios that I've run.

14
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:26,941
Most notably, in 2019, I was selected as the Games for Change Vanguard Award winner at the Games for Change annual festival.

15
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:37,226
And I've been a lead curator and co-curator for a variety of exhibits around the world, from Scotland and Germany to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.

16
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:43,435
I've written more than 75 chapters, articles, and books,

17
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,356
most notably in those categories include

18
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,176
Doing Things with Games, Social Impact through Play,

19
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,397
which is a book on designing social impact games,

20
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:54,877
and Love and Electronic Affection,

21
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:59,678
which is a book about designing playful experiences

22
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:02,499
centering on affection and love within video games.

23
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:08,859
I've also done work with people like Susan Gold to help document the experience of game jammers.

24
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:14,124
We created a book called Global Game Jam Stories where we collected the stories and observations

25
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:20,890
of people who were central to the early generation of game jams, global game jam.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,574
And I'm currently working on a book tentatively called Black Game Makers,

27
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:30,038
which is designed around helping document Black game makers and the games that they make.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,487
So this work is supported by the Higher Education Video Games Alliance and the Black Game Makers

29
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:45,379
Association and the book will be published through Carnegie Mellon's ETC Press. It's also supported

30
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,745
by the Interactive Media School of Communication at the University of Miami.

31
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,461
And I just want to highlight, if you're unfamiliar with the Black Game Makers Association, it's

32
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:59,344
actually founded by a fellow named Lamont Harrell. And Lamont, as a former student,

33
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:05,248
has done a really great job of kind of trying to encourage people to collect, know, popularize,

34
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:10,170
and sell games made by black developers. So if you're unfamiliar with the BGMA,

35
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,433
I strongly suggest that you go ahead and look it up and find out more about it.

36
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:22,267
And so when I started this project, I began collecting games made by black game makers.

37
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:26,410
And I looked at both analog games, like Black Car Revoked here.

38
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,316
You notice for each game that I mention, I'll actually show you the URL so that you can get a good sense for where to find out more about them.

39
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:40,400
To games, digital games like Combat Corps, which I'll talk about again in a few minutes.

40
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:48,934
So I analyzed more than 50 games by black game makers, and my aim was to try and help people understand some of the fundamentals.

41
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:57,565
So, for example, you'll notice here that the games that I looked at, about 69 percent of them were digital and the other 31 percent were analog.

42
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:04,408
You'll also notice that I predominantly in the analog side looked at far more card games than board games.

43
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:09,634
I'm not sure if this is an indication of what's available and the way the market works,

44
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:14,720
but generally it was far easier to find board games than it was to find,

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,263
I'm sorry, far easier to find card games than it was board games.

46
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:20,677
And then in the digital game types category,

47
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,898
you can see that I looked at a variety of mobile games,

48
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:26,020
console games, VR, mixed reality games,

49
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,661
as well as web-only games.

50
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:31,464
But the dominant space was digital games, including PC.

51
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,506
So there were a lot of products being made for the PC

52
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:39,369
in comparison to some of these other categories.

53
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:42,591
Secondary would be console games and mobile games at 19% and 16%.

54
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,834
So team composition was also something that I looked at.

55
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:51,120
And generally, the whole idea was to only document things

56
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,225
that were either created by people

57
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:58,710
from the African-American diaspora

58
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,011
or from people who were

59
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:05,217
working as co-designers. So generally one of the kind of the neat things that I

60
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:09,382
did find out is that if you look at the Steam scores for these games you find

61
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:13,927
that 81% of them are that as a mean for the ones that were actually scored they

62
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:19,192
got an 81% which is a relatively high scoring. So I just want to highlight some

63
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,317
of these games and give you a sense for how they work and what they look like.

64
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,465
So one of the easiest places to start is BCFX, which is a is sort of known as the

65
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:32,712
black college football game is called black college football, BCFX.

66
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,878
And it's a kind of a version of playing football.

67
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:43,615
wholly focused on historically black colleges and universities, what we call HBCUs. So this

68
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:49,816
is a football simulator. It has some novel sort of additions to being a typical football simulator,

69
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:55,797
besides being focused on HBCUs. It's also got this really interesting halftime show mechanic

70
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:00,838
where you can play through the halftimes. And it's incorporated in HBCU Legacy Museum,

71
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:06,579
where you can see some of the history and historical figures within the HBCU football history.

72
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:11,710
Another good example that I have to mention right off the bat is University of Dope,

73
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,652
which is kind of describes itself as the first party game to celebrate hip-hop culture.

74
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:22,393
And you can see more at universityofdope.com. This particular game has gotten a lot of great

75
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:27,695
press. It's been featured in the Huffington Post, Esquire, etc. And it's really kind of a fun party

76
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:27,915
game.

77
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:33,742
Both of these games do something that I've seen in a number of the most successful Black games,

78
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:38,486
which is that they're affirming positive elements of the culture. So they're really about the

79
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:45,111
successes that HBCUs have had within on the football stage, as well as University of Dope

80
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:51,056
being sort of a playful experience around pop culture and African-American contributions to

81
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:51,516
pop culture.

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,743
So others play with what I would call in-group knowledge. So they're really looking for you to

83
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:03,325
understand some things about blackness or about being a member of the African-American community.

84
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:09,988
And so a good example of this is Passport to the Hood, which is self-described. It highlights

85
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:14,510
stereotypes of urban culture, says everything that you hear behind closed doors, and reflects

86
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,252
on how you grew up. And that you grew up is clearly a reference to in-group knowledge.

87
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:26,333
So there are other games that do a kind of a role play opportunity. So Rap Gods is a good example of that.

88
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:33,675
You can kind of guess by the description what you're doing there. And another one, Rap Quest 2,

89
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:38,337
which is a mobile game, is a hip-hop simulation for a rap career. And there are a number of games

90
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:43,959
that follow this model where it's sort of a day in the life of, you know, a rap star, hip-hop star.

91
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,500
And these games actually illustrate

92
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:52,719
common expectations of black games, which is that I think a lot of times people are going to assume

93
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,641
that there's hip-hop and urban culture, that there's some element of black history, and that

94
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:02,064
there's some element of in-group and out-group experience. You have to sort of be a part of

95
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,286
the African-American community in order to understand what's happening in the game or to

96
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:11,048
do well in the game. And generally sort of expectation is that games are these games

97
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:15,210
are about blackness and that they're featuring elements of black cultural space.

98
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:22,766
And so there's another sort of variety of these games that focus on imparting some elements of history.

99
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:31,011
The 1998 deck, which is really just a card deck, is a suite of playing cards that pay homage to the hip hop rivalries of the 1990s.

100
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:39,337
And Insecure, the come up game based on, produced by Glow Up Games, is based on the HBO show Insecure.

101
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,157
And as they describe it.

102
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:45,962
It's about hustling heart and hype as your tools to build your new life in LA.

103
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:51,307
And LaToya Peterson is one of the people who's contributing to my book, and so I wanted to

104
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:59,456
give kind of a shout out to her work, as well as just describing games like Far Rock Dodgeball.

105
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:06,089
which is largely focused on location. You play in Harlem, you play in other sections of New York,

106
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,194
but it is incorporating that urban culture expectation that I think some people would have,

107
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:15,639
as well as things like H-Town minis, where you've got these sort of characterizations

108
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,344
or like extreme characterizations, and it's generally a fighting game.

109
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,312
Or you have other games that focus on black history, like the Black Movie Guest Quiz, which is a mobile game.

110
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,357
I believe the developer is out of Cincinnati.

111
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,883
And it serves a sense of community through history.

112
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:35,484
But I want to emphasize that black games are more than this.

113
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:39,245
I think of the examples I've given you previously as part of the yes and.

114
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,606
And I want to emphasize the and.

115
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,287
So games like Swim Sanity,

116
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,988
it's an online multiplayer underwater shooter.

117
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:48,809
It's really quite a beautiful game.

118
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:51,009
It's really quite a fun game.

119
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:56,532
I think it's a good example of how broad the spectrum of black games can be.

120
00:09:56,932 --> 00:10:05,619
Another really beautiful game is Ariel Knight's Never Yield, which just has this sort of really great aesthetic and really great feel.

121
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,242
It's just a really interesting game to play.

122
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:15,497
And you would, of course, in this context, talk about sort of well, well-known designers

123
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:22,402
like Mike Pondsmith and the Cyberpunk series, or another contributor to the book, Alan Turner's

124
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:26,866
work, where he created a tabletop role-playing game that takes inspiration from the myths

125
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:30,869
and folklore of tribal and indigenous cultures.

126
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,170
So reminding you of a kind of diaspora that exists.

127
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:41,040
And a lot of this work is actually in the book, so I'm going to kind of save it and couch it so I can tell you more about some of the digital games.

128
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,044
But if you do read, Aaron Tramiel has done a really great job of creating this comprehensive chapter on black analog game designers that will be a part of the book.

129
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:56,308
But I can also talk about another contributor, Boris Willis, who's mixing games and dance.

130
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:56,828
So again.

131
00:10:57,158 --> 00:11:00,220
If you're thinking about all the ways that black games are created, there's

132
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,282
really quite a variety. So I want to take this opportunity to talk about black

133
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:09,906
game makers. And I basically started meeting with people and listening to

134
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:14,249
some of their observations, some of their experience, some of their motivation.

135
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:17,691
And there was one theme that seemed to be repeated every time.

136
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,883
And it was that not enough people tell our stories.

137
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:26,225
And I emphasize that in quotes because it was something that I heard often over and over again.

138
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,766
That the stories of black game makers just weren't being heard,

139
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,447
their experiences weren't being shared.

140
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:37,429
And so I've tried to make a space for their stories to be told both here in this talk

141
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,490
and also in this particular book.

142
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:43,089
And I'm going to give my story as a case study,

143
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,590
to kind of position and I hope you understand

144
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,931
who's giving this presentation and perspective

145
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:49,952
that I come from, but also because I think

146
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:52,393
it helps you understand some of the experiences

147
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:54,034
that I've shared with other developers.

148
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,748
So I'm a Cape Verdean American. If you're completely unfamiliar with Cape Verde,

149
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:04,669
there it is on the right hand side. It's a little tiny country off the west coast of Africa. Yes,

150
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:12,411
that's Africa on the right. And I grew up in Massachusetts, very kind of far from Cape Verde,

151
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:16,332
but nestled in one of the largest Cape Verdean populations in the country.

152
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,793
And I've been making digital games off and on for 20 plus years.

153
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:25,896
and I have a variety of experiences that have to do with the way that I've built games.

154
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:30,739
But when I started making games, I think one of the most important things to note is that

155
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:35,583
I was the only child in our subsidized housing project shown on the right with a computer.

156
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:42,688
So it's a good example of what I've seen several game developers mention, which is that

157
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:50,032
I, like the other game designers, and I'm refraining from giving their stories because I want you to read their stories and hear them directly from them,

158
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:56,557
but 90% of my childhood friends owned or played a console game, but very few of them made games.

159
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:59,940
They all played, but they didn't really make games.

160
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,483
And so if you look at some of the data according to Pew Research, African-Americans are the most

161
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:09,805
likely to play video games of any of the ethnic groups that they looked at, particularly amongst

162
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:17,029
teens at 83 percent. In comparison, those who self-identified as white were 71 percent likely

163
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,991
to play video games and Hispanic teens were 69 percent.

164
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,695
Take that in comparison to the IGDA statistic that basically says that less than 2% of all

165
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:36,640
game makers identify as black. That's a huge disparity and it's the thing I felt as a kid

166
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,063
and continue to feel as some of the other game designers and developers have mentioned.

167
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:44,366
Basically if 90% of my childhood friends owned or played a console game,

168
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:48,381
I was the only one actually making games.

169
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:54,647
And so there's this real sense of loneliness or sense of being different and outside of

170
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:59,151
a community that you'll see persists in a lot of the observations.

171
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:03,055
So my story in a lot of biographies, my story illustrates a common tale.

172
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,984
And that common tale is basically that the community of black game makers is much larger,

173
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:15,108
or game players, is much larger than the community of black game makers. There are far more black

174
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:19,010
people playing games than there are in people of the African-American diaspora and the African

175
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,113
diaspora. There are far more people playing, obviously, than there are in the community of

176
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:30,918
black game makers. And it's not even a question of proportion. It's actually, it's disproportionate,

177
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,198
exceptionally disproportionate.

178
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:37,080
even when compared to any other population. So I want to share with you some Black Game Maker

179
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,843
biographies to give you some context. And again, I don't want to attribute them to anyone

180
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:46,845
individually, so I'm just going to suss out some themes that persisted. So a few themes that seem

181
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:51,867
to come up over and over again as people share their stories. One was often feeling unique in

182
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:52,407
the industry.

183
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:57,798
And so you can see this also come through in blog posts and discussions.

184
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:02,821
So there's an article in Blacks in Technology that asks where are all the black game developers?

185
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:08,885
And there's discussion on Polycount that do black game developers even exist, which should be really scary to people.

186
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:15,349
And then there are collections that are trying to help people understand where the Black Game Devs are.

187
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:19,671
And so BlackGameDevs.com is a good example of such work.

188
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:22,873
Another theme was feeling no choice but to go solo.

189
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:30,538
And for context, there are people like Aerial Knights Never Yield that have created really successful properties by going solo.

190
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,600
And I remember more than a decade ago, I wrote an article for...

191
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,571
for Gamma Sutra and Computer Game Guide

192
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,273
that basically encouraged people to go solo.

193
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,555
I think that one of the ways that people solve this problem

194
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:45,377
of limited access to the industry

195
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,697
is to just do it all on their own,

196
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,179
which is tremendous amount of work,

197
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,501
but also I think echoes a lot of the things

198
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,882
that we've heard about the future of indie games

199
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:56,624
when we were talking about it five to eight years ago.

200
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:03,302
And then another, I'm just going to take this anonymized Facebook post for you and just share.

201
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:07,345
Another person on Facebook just volunteered that they said that being African American,

202
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:12,048
they've actually had investors say they love their company and love their game,

203
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:16,691
but they won't invest because I'm black. But they say they still keep striving towards my goal.

204
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:21,895
So there's a sort of sense of persistence, even in the face of some pretty obvious obstacles.

205
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:29,604
Another theme that kept coming up was this idea of being interested in making impact or doing what matters.

206
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,367
And a good example of that is Phi questions.

207
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:41,114
So this is basically a card deck that helps families, communities, people playing, normalized discussions of finances.

208
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:49,681
So it's kind of like a way to create community around talking and working through real important questions about finances.

209
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:55,770
Other activities like iThrives, the Runaround, were largely focused on co-design.

210
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,112
So the idea here is that they're going to make an impact by working with a community of African Americans

211
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:11,037
and then basically creating a game around whatever sort of product comes from a participatory or co-design approach.

212
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:15,839
And then you have other folks who are doing things around indigenous economic justice.

213
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,360
So this is EarthCypher from MediaBreeze.

214
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,126
And you also have this other theme of fostering community.

215
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:25,287
There was a lot of discussion from people who were making these games

216
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:28,008
talking about how they want to foster community.

217
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:31,450
So Spill It is an interesting one, and I like some of the artwork from their website.

218
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,812
These photographs you see on the left, they'll have a persistent appearance

219
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:40,313
because I shot them myself after I played the games.

220
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:45,355
But in short, they're sort of talking about the opportunity to let Spill It spice up your kickbacks.

221
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:52,056
and help you understand sort of like getting a little more casual with folks.

222
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:56,399
But there's a whole other space where other people are creating games for

223
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,941
Black people by Black people. It's sort of the

224
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:03,144
by Black movement. And for some, being a Black game maker

225
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:08,048
is central to the design itself. And for others, identity isn't actually

226
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:12,371
central. And I want to emphasize that not every Black game is about Black

227
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:12,952
identity.

228
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:20,734
So almost everyone noted that there is an expectation of making what folks would expect is a black game.

229
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:27,417
And so it's important to recognize, and people had mentioned this, recognize the diaspora,

230
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:33,681
that African-American is quite diverse and that there are a lot of different experiences

231
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:37,903
and sense of what it means to be a member of the black community.

232
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:45,273
So basically, being black doesn't require that the game actually incorporate what are

233
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:49,777
kind of stereotypical black culture elements. It can still be a black game if it doesn't

234
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:54,722
include hip hop. It can still be a black game if it doesn't include what other elements

235
00:18:54,722 --> 00:19:01,608
someone might assume make it black. And so, examples of this, things like Sky Temple Stack,

236
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:05,812
a nice mobile game, quite pretty, are examples of that.

237
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:12,317
As is Tiny Bird Garden. Here's Tiny Bird Garden Deluxe being shown.

238
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,379
Really interesting game, very different.

239
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:19,921
Or Museum Multiverse to make sure I show you at least a few VR games.

240
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:27,026
Another VR game is basically Run, Die, Run Again, but it's a first-person parkour game.

241
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:29,027
Another really beautiful game by Retro Ninja.

242
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:37,613
And we've got other games on the independent side that focus on other

243
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:41,977
themes that are related to social impact. So operator is basically about a

244
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:45,501
journalist that has to use her police scanner to keep her sister out of harm's

245
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:50,285
way while an intense protest becomes increasingly unsafe. You can see the URL

246
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:54,289
there. I encourage you to play it, get that experience. And generally

247
00:19:55,501 --> 00:20:01,322
I want to help people understand that Black Games are as wide and diverse as the people that actually make them.

248
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:05,863
And it seems so obvious to state this, it seems like I shouldn't need to state this,

249
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:09,584
but in talking to people, especially folks who weren't familiar with Black Games,

250
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:17,046
what I found is that this is a surprising observation and news to people, unfortunately.

251
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:17,186
So...

252
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:21,746
For example, black games include art themes.

253
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:25,887
So this is Artifacts 2 by Fizzaro,

254
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,708
which is self-described as a game

255
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,829
about the entanglement of trauma in the mind and body.

256
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:36,090
And this is an IndieCade finalist or IndieCade selection

257
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,951
back in 2018, a really interesting game.

258
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,371
Or religious themes.

259
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:43,652
So When I Get Free is a Christian Bible-themed playable

260
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:45,893
graphic novel that...

261
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:51,498
I think illustrates how these things can be integrated into gameplay.

262
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:56,902
And then we have a bunch of other games that are sort of new takes on old mechanics,

263
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,023
as I've done these analyses.

264
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:03,126
So Rageball, for example, I like its tagline.

265
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,727
Anything else is just Pong.

266
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:09,530
But you can see some familiar mechanics and then some changes there.

267
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:16,654
Or I think you'd kind of be under a rock if you hadn't heard about Treachery and Beatdown City at this point.

268
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:22,999
But, you know, really different set of experiences.

269
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:30,805
Or Combat Corps is another game I think I'd reference here that I think is really interesting and available.

270
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:36,840
And then there are even games that maybe not are just flirting with interesting new mechanics,

271
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,941
but also just fundamentally distinct experiences that may, and I want to emphasize this,

272
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,803
may incorporate themes of blackness, but not in the ways that we would, I think, people would

273
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:53,845
expect. So it's not about saying, oh look, I have a person of color as my main character,

274
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:59,486
but there are experiences like the entanglement of trauma that come through in really interesting

275
00:21:59,486 --> 00:21:59,847
ways.

276
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:05,202
So, Hex Gambit's an interesting game I would encourage you to take a look at.

277
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:09,047
As is Chrono Ghost, really sort of pretty platformer.

278
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:14,794
Or, if you're looking for something really different, consider something like Galactic Bar Fight.

279
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:17,458
Weird Kid Studios produced this.

280
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:30,519
I just want to kind of wrap up with some closing thoughts and give some sense of sort of what's next and just kind of help you reflect on the situation of black games these days.

281
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,388
So I really did start this project to document the game makers in their games.

282
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,210
And I was really excited about doing that.

283
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,272
And as I did it, I realized that it's really important to tell black stories and to

284
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:46,413
recognize black cultural production in games.

285
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:50,455
It's not just this sort of horrible history in the U.S.

286
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:55,097
of really disrespecting the black community.

287
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:59,679
It's also just about recognizing the contributions that may not always be

288
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,219
amplified.

289
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:05,976
So from those stories, I've learned some things that I think are really worth sharing.

290
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:11,719
And one of them is this idea that in the absence of community, we build it ourselves. So there's a

291
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,100
lot of activity around saying...

292
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,577
It's really hard to get into the games industry.

293
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,458
People aren't really supportive.

294
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,498
It's really hard when you're the only person of color

295
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,879
or the only person in the black community.

296
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,020
And so a lot of people have made these efforts

297
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,702
to create their own spaces, websites,

298
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:30,042
Facebook groups, et cetera.

299
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,363
So in the absence of community, we build it ourselves,

300
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:34,384
seems to be a thing I've seen.

301
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:37,305
Likewise, in the absence of access,

302
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:39,186
you see people trying to create it.

303
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:41,526
So creating training programs, creating support,

304
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:43,347
creating social gatherings.

305
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:51,469
And again, it would be great if that absence of access didn't exist, but that the positive note is that people are creating those spaces.

306
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:53,130
And I think that's part of the future.

307
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:01,538
And then in the absence of support, we support ourselves, which is another sort of theme that kept coming through as I saw who was succeeding and how they were succeeding.

308
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:08,469
So I want to kind of remind people that games are actually part of a milieu of culture.

309
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:14,973
There's a wide array of cultural contributions that games make.

310
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:19,736
And so I strongly believe that games themselves, the games industry, the games practice, is

311
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:25,901
healthiest not as a monoculture, not rows and rows of the same work by the same people,

312
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,003
but instead as something that is born from diversity.

313
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:40,433
So much like a natural monoculture versus a diverse environment, a diverse environment can weather storms and monoculture can create some really bad situations.

314
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:46,238
So the game making community is stronger when it's diverse, in my humble opinion.

315
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:54,186
So I'd strongly encourage all of us to work towards cultivating that diversity, to cultivate diversity across the spectrum.

316
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,270
And of course, I have to remind you that Black Games matter,

317
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,811
which is why I did this research and why

318
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:03,051
I'm trying to share this work and put in front of you

319
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,492
a variety of work that others have created.

320
00:25:05,492 --> 00:25:05,672
So thanks.

321
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:10,614
You can shoot me an email if you have any questions,

322
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:12,894
and I'll be happy to answer them.

323
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:13,555
Have a great day.
