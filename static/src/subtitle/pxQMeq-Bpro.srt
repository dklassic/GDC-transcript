00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:05,312
On GDC Podcast episode 15, we're featuring an interview with Jason Ronald,

2
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:08,854
director of program management for the Xbox platform team.

3
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:14,378
This is a guy who led development of the new Xbox Series X and S.

4
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:18,581
He'll give us background into the development of Microsoft's powerful new consoles,

5
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:23,144
and talk about how the company designed the hardware with game developers in mind.

6
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:23,604
Back in a sec.

7
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:48,473
Hey everybody, this is Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra, and it's just me this week.

8
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:49,455
I am so sorry.

9
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:55,621
Alyssa's coming back next time, but for now we're doing something a bit different with this episode.

10
00:00:55,621 --> 00:01:00,945
We're featuring audio from an interview I did with Jason Ronald, the guy who led and actually is

11
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:10,592
continuing to lead development on the new Xbox Series X and S. But first a real quick GDC PSA.

12
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:14,375
We've just opened up submissions for core concept talk pitches for GDC 2021.

13
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:28,483
Which means, if you have ideas for advocacy, audio, business and marketing, design, production, team management, programming and visual arts, then you should apply.

14
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:41,551
Due to the fluid situation with the pandemic, this is currently planned as a hybrid physical-slash-virtual event, and GDC will be taking everyone's safety into consideration as such.

15
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:50,793
So you can find out more on GDC's official website as usual at GDConf.com.

16
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:53,694
And with that, here's my chat with Jason Ronald.

17
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,835
Chris, I think you and I've met in the past.

18
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:01,836
Um, but in case we haven't just introducing myself, uh, my name's Jason Ronald.

19
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:07,037
I'm the director of program management for the Xbox platform team, uh, and leading

20
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:10,578
development of the Xbox Series X, uh, and Series S.

21
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:16,906
Yeah, great. Yeah, we may have crossed paths sometime in the past. I wouldn't be surprised.

22
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:23,635
So can you just give a little bit more background about what exactly your role is on it? What has

23
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:28,080
your last few years looked like working on this thing?

24
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:36,106
Sure, yeah, I've actually been involved with the Xbox Series X and Series S from the very beginning.

25
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:42,711
You know, we started this program back in 2016, even before we had released the Xbox One X,

26
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:48,996
and we really sat down at that time and really, you know, had a lot of conversations internally,

27
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:52,158
as well as with our development partners all across the ecosystem.

28
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,141
Really trying to understand and define what the future of gaming looks like.

29
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:07,585
You know, and the developer feedback is a critical part of how we design our programs, how we design our hardware, our development environment.

30
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:14,868
Because at the end of the day, we really think of it as we have two primary customers for what we design and build here at Team Xbox.

31
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:19,070
One is obviously the end gamer, but two is the developer,

32
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,331
because it's really important to us that we're providing

33
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,072
the right technical capabilities, the right hardware,

34
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:27,013
the right services to really enable developers

35
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:29,114
to deliver on their creative vision.

36
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:31,275
So I've basically been involved in the program

37
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,556
since the very beginning,

38
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,637
all the way through launch next week.

39
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:39,739
You know, what were some major points of the evolution

40
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,221
of serving the developer between seven years ago

41
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,862
when Xbox One came out?

42
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,713
and now when the Series S and X are coming out?

43
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:50,194
It's a great question.

44
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,857
I mean, really for me, I think with the Xbox One,

45
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:59,581
you know, we really were trying to be kind of disruptive

46
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,563
and think differently about the ecosystem

47
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,964
and how can we provide different experiences

48
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:04,925
to different players.

49
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:09,570
With the beginning of Xbox Series X and Series S,

50
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,554
we really sat down and really had deep conversations with our partners.

51
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,816
In many cases, some of these partners,

52
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,399
we've had relationships for more than 20 years.

53
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,861
So we have long-term relationships with partners.

54
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:30,127
And they're never hesitant to provide feedback to us on, you know, things that we could be doing differently, things that we could be doing better.

55
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:37,552
We also want to sit down with them and really understand kind of where they see their franchises going or their technology stacks are going.

56
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:41,795
And we take all of that feedback in very early in the design process.

57
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:45,958
And I think over the Xbox One generation, we got a lot of feedback from developers of...

58
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:49,158
hey, you know, it'd be easier if we could do this.

59
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:52,819
Or, you know, when we think about a next generation piece of hardware,

60
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,140
here's some things that we're really interested in.

61
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,561
Because our goal at our level is to really remove all the technical barriers

62
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:03,761
from a developer's creative vision.

63
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,342
You know, and so some examples of things that we heard through the Xbox One generation

64
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:13,643
that really informed where we were going with Xbox Series X and Series S is,

65
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:13,903
you know,

66
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:23,529
Simple things like CPU performance, you know developers want to build more dynamic larger living worlds more complex AI

67
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,450
better AI

68
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,973
better animation systems and you know

69
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,916
One of the pieces of feedback that we received was, you know

70
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:34,280
The GPU as an example on the Xbox one X was super powerful

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,864
but the CPU power was really kind of constraining their creative vision and

72
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:41,110
Another good example is like IO performance.

73
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,674
You know, we're really at the upper bounds of what's possible with a traditional rotational

74
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:50,598
drive technology or traditional hard drives. So, you know, and when we think about, you know,

75
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:53,401
what that was incurring on developers, like.

76
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:59,606
having to force players down hallways or funnel them to an elevator or things like that. It was

77
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:05,050
really constraining the game design and the aspirations that developers had. So that's

78
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,134
what really resulted in things like the Xbox Velocity architecture embedding on

79
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:13,216
NVMe SSD level IO performance.

80
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:16,218
And then clearly from a developer's perspective,

81
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:19,900
you always want to advance the state of the art in graphics.

82
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,443
So beyond just the raw power of the graphics,

83
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:25,604
we really invested in next-gen capabilities

84
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,746
like DirectX ray tracing that's hardware accelerated,

85
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:31,287
things like variable rate shading

86
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,910
to really allow developers to get more fine-grain control

87
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,572
and just really be able to get the best performance possible

88
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:39,913
out of the hardware that we have there.

89
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:44,576
And I think really for us it's the marrying of the hardware

90
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,718
innovation with the software innovation and then the developer

91
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:52,781
tools to just really empower developers to deliver on those creative visions.

92
00:06:52,781 --> 00:07:00,165
Yeah, very cool. So when you are showing your close development

93
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:07,970
partners these new consoles and early versions of them, what kind of

94
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,463
reaction were you getting from them as you're bringing them these near final versions.

95
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:20,938
You know, we actually start before, you know, we get to what you described as near final,

96
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:25,842
you know, early on, we kind of sit down with them and we say, hey, here's the performance

97
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:30,206
targets that we want to go target. You know, here's some of the technologies that we're

98
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:35,491
planning on leaning into. Are these exciting for you? Are they in your technology roadmaps?

99
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:39,275
And the reality is that since these are, you know, we have regular conversations with them,

100
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,736
we're usually pretty aligned.

101
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:46,241
And then once we're kind of getting further along in development and the hardware starts

102
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:51,405
becoming real and we really start understanding what the capabilities are, then we also sit

103
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:56,549
down with them and really talk about how can we make the development process itself easier.

104
00:07:56,549 --> 00:08:03,814
One set of key decisions that we made very early on in the program is, as a large developer,

105
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:09,239
even as a small developer, you have an investment in your tool chains, in your development process,

106
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,480
in your QA labs.

107
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,723
So one of the things that we did is the exact same tools that developers were using on the Xbox One generation.

108
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:21,706
Those exact same tools work on the Xbox Series X and Series S generation.

109
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:26,990
Even with things like the development, the design of the development kit.

110
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,413
We designed it so that you could basically remove an Xbox One development kit,

111
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:36,716
put an Xbox Series X development kit in, and then plug everything right in.

112
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,076
And it's just up and working.

113
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:43,762
So it was really about how do we make this transition to this next generation as easy as possible.

114
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:49,868
And like one story I always like to share, we worked with the coalition earlier this year,

115
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:54,653
and they were able to basically get Gears 5 up and running on an Xbox Series X development kit.

116
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:01,780
within like three to four weeks, which in normal console generation transitions, that's kind of unheard of.

117
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,105
A lot of times there's a lot of engine rework you need to do, or toolchain work you need to redo,

118
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:12,730
but we really wanted to make this as easy as possible, so they were able to get the game up and running very quickly,

119
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,935
and then it was really about, okay, how do I take advantage of all this new power, all these new capabilities?

120
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:22,817
but they didn't have to go learn a completely new tool chain or rebuild, you know, how they

121
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:27,119
actually build the game. We really made a point to make it as easy as possible.

122
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:32,802
Yeah, so all this transitionary stuff is interesting to me. Like,

123
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:37,684
when, for example, with the Coalition, you're talking about Gears 5, what are some of...

124
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:41,000
the, you know, the bigger changes to the workflow.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,885
When you say that it took them four weeks,

126
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,528
what are they doing during that time

127
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,392
to get this ready for the Series X and S?

128
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:56,757
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, it wasn't a significant amount of work.

129
00:09:56,757 --> 00:10:02,120
You know, we do have a standard SDK that we deliver to all of our development partners

130
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,122
and all our engine middleware partners. So I think the early days is just really kind of

131
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,543
getting everything up and running on the latest SDK.

132
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,845
You know, we try to minimize API changes as much as possible.

133
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:20,789
The other thing too is we also recognize that a large portion of game developers do a lot of their development on PC.

134
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:28,574
So we really looked at kind of like the API design and the workflows and the designs on how people actually build their games on PC

135
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:34,898
to make it easier whether you're starting with say an Xbox One generation code base or a PC code base.

136
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,179
We want to make it as easy as possible.

137
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,640
to get your games up and running.

138
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,062
And then once the game's up and running,

139
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:42,242
like I said, then, you know,

140
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,024
a lot of times we talk about it as kind of

141
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,825
the time until you can see the first

142
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,826
pixels on the screen. You can

143
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,847
just start getting, whether it's a whitebox

144
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,888
environment or it's an existing

145
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,850
game, you know, just getting it up and running.

146
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,733
And then all the same performance tools, all the same deployment tools, all the same configuration.

147
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:05,776
So we really didn't want to make it so developers had to relearn things.

148
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:09,658
It's really about getting your game up and running and then just really starting to explore

149
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:13,700
some of these new capabilities and figuring out what's right for the title.

150
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:18,544
You know, the nice thing about with the hardware performance that we have,

151
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,386
you know, once you get the game up and running,

152
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:23,489
one of the first things that developers always do is they turn everything to 11.

153
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:29,854
You know, they max out their frame rate, they max out their resolution.

154
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,956
you know, and they start doing performance tuning.

155
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:35,137
And then in most cases,

156
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,038
they have a lot of headroom available to them.

157
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,738
And that's when all of a sudden it's like,

158
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,479
okay, looking at my development schedule,

159
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,360
maybe I want to lean into ray tracing,

160
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,641
or hey, there's this feature

161
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,382
that we've been incubating internally.

162
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,323
Let's bring that into the engine

163
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:49,923
or bring that into the game.

164
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,484
So it's really about empowering them

165
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:54,825
to be efficient and powerful on day one,

166
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,486
and then just really helping them deliver

167
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,466
on that creative vision

168
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,127
that they've been carrying for many years.

169
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:07,106
Yeah, so kind of back to the development of these Xboxes,

170
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:11,769
when you're mapping out the plan for these new ones,

171
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:19,413
what were the biggest technical hurdles that you knew you would have to address

172
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,715
when coming to the final version?

173
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:32,141
I don't know if I'd call them technical hurdles, but what I would say is we were very deliberate in the design decisions that we made.

174
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:48,875
You know, one thing is developers today often have a lot of really great tools and capabilities of doing things like scaling up and down on resolution or enabling or disabling different visual effects, especially if they ship on multiple devices or they ship on PC and console.

175
00:12:50,416 --> 00:13:00,200
So, you know, what was really clear to us was the things that developers had a harder time scaling were things like CPU performance and IO performance.

176
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,084
So when we designed the two consoles, we actually designed them to effectively be symmetrical in CPU performance and IO performance,

177
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:15,267
because we wanted to make it as easy as possible for developers to scale their games up and down across the Series X and the Series S.

178
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:20,631
And I think it's a win-win because I think us with developers,

179
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:24,954
we all want to reach the largest addressable audience of players possible.

180
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:30,858
So we saw an opportunity to deliver a premium next-generation gaming console on the Xbox Series X.

181
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:35,782
but we also realized that we could deliver next-gen performance just at a reduced rendering

182
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:41,468
resolution. But as a game developer, like I said, they already have the knobs, they already have

183
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:47,634
the ability to scale up and down on the visual side, but by making the CPU and the IOS subsystem

184
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:51,458
symmetrical, we really took a lot of work off of developers.

185
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,900
And then I think the other thing too is as we've designed our tools,

186
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,202
as we've designed our APIs, we're also really focused on how do we make it easy

187
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:03,104
for developers to move their game from, say, the console to the PC

188
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:06,306
or the PC to the console and even to the cloud.

189
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:09,388
So with things like direct storage, which is a brand new API

190
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:12,789
that we created for the Xbox Series X and Series S.

191
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,875
that gives developers a lot more fine-grained control of how they leverage the IOS subsystem,

192
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,018
we're bringing that exact same capability to the PC.

193
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:26,262
Because as a developer, I want to make sure that I have a common set of capabilities

194
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,385
and a common set of techniques that I can use,

195
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,747
and I don't want to have to dramatically change my game.

196
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,629
This is really kind of leaning into where

197
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:37,930
developers want and how they want to build their games,

198
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,111
regardless of what their starting point is,

199
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,793
or whether they make a console only game or they

200
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:46,054
make a game that will actually ship across multiple devices.

201
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:52,997
So right now you know we're seeing these games that

202
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:55,718
are existing and they're being optimized like Gears 5,

203
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,920
which by the way, it looks looks incredible and plays great.

204
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:05,381
I'm wondering when the games that are coming out

205
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:09,064
that are for, you know, in a couple of years

206
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:12,346
that are for Xbox Series X and S,

207
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,508
I'm curious how, when these games are utilizing

208
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:18,511
more of the console's, like, power,

209
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,273
you know, how is that gonna affect the experience

210
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:25,516
when they're introducing bigger, more complex worlds?

211
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:33,562
How might that affect the player experience in terms of frame rates, load time, resolution, and things like that?

212
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:37,705
Yeah, I mean, ultimately, when it comes to frame rates and resolution,

213
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,348
we really view that as a creative decision by the game developer.

214
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,771
They know their franchise, they know the world that they're trying to create,

215
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:48,713
they also know their player base, and they know what really matters to them

216
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,915
and how do we package those things together.

217
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:57,224
And I think to your point, as a system designer, the thing that's really exciting is, I totally

218
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,186
agree with what you said.

219
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:03,594
I think Gears 5 is stunning, it plays great, all the work they did on latency improvements

220
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:06,098
and just running at the peak performance.

221
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,219
But that's the game that you're going to see on day one.

222
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:14,641
What's really exciting is where I see games going two, three, four years down the road.

223
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,602
Because when you design a console hardware platform,

224
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:22,743
you're really setting the technical direction for the next seven to ten years of game development.

225
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:28,045
So we really design the hardware in such a way that we're thinking about where games can be going.

226
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:38,188
Right now, a lot of the positive press and the feedback we're getting from developers is really on the massive improvements in load times.

227
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:46,030
But that's, in many cases, just really leveraging the raw hardware capabilities that the SSD drive brings to bear.

228
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,791
When you think about what we've actually done with the Xbox Velocity architecture,

229
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:54,894
It was a radical rethink of how game streaming can and should work,

230
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:58,516
with an eye towards these larger, more dynamic living worlds,

231
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:04,359
where basically there's entire classes of assets that you don't even need to load into memory anymore,

232
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:10,262
because we have that ultra-fast I.O. between the processor and the I.O. subsystem.

233
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,684
You also think about things like, as a developer,

234
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:18,046
developers always would love more memory, more GPU, more CPU horsepower.

235
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,990
A huge part for us is the efficiency.

236
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,295
So, you know, for us it's critically important that we have consistent, sustained clocks

237
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,060
so developers don't have to worry about variable performance.

238
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,925
Because that makes it harder to optimize your game, you know, whether you're in intense

239
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,549
firefight or you're in just kind of another part of the world.

240
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:41,709
We also look at things like variable rate shading, like I mentioned before.

241
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:47,672
It's really about, you know, obviously we're really proud of the raw GPU performance that we have,

242
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:52,615
but it's how can we let developers be even more efficient in how they use that power.

243
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:57,817
So with something like variable rate shading, if something's in shadow or it's, you know,

244
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:03,581
got motion blur or whatnot, you probably don't need that same level of precision for that area of the

245
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:04,021
frame.

246
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:08,643
but now I can take that extra power that I'm not applying to that area of the frame

247
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:13,345
and putting it in my hero character or objects that are closer to the camera.

248
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:20,148
So it really allows us to deliver performance well beyond the raw hardware specs themselves.

249
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:24,350
And I think you'll see, you know, over the course of the generation, you'll really see

250
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,272
both us and developers really understanding how to take full advantage of all these capabilities

251
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:33,494
to really deliver transformative game experiences unlike anything you've seen before.

252
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:40,169
So maybe fewer elevators and fewer long hallways and narrow paths.

253
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:45,625
Absolutely. And I mean, if you just look at the trends in games, you know,

254
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,766
you know, even the games that are at the tail end of the Xbox One generation,

255
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:54,247
you look at an Assassin's Creed Odyssey, you look at a Red Dead Redemption two,

256
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:58,248
you know, these are massive living worlds that players want to be immersed in.

257
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:00,528
And for us, immersion is another keyword

258
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:03,609
that we really established very early on in the program.

259
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,430
It's like, how can we keep players really immersed in the universes

260
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,631
that these world class creators are building all around the world?

261
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:17,137
I've read some of what you said about backwards compatibility, but let's touch on that.

262
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:24,264
Can you speak to how it exactly works in this new hardware and why it's so important as

263
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,787
far as Xbox's overarching strategy, guys?

264
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,168
Sure.

265
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:35,131
So, you know, compatibility was another key pillar that we established very early in the program

266
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,935
because, as I've said before, you know, there's no other medium, whether it's movies or music

267
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:45,841
or books, that when I go out and buy a new device that my content doesn't move forward with me.

268
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:50,726
And games have been one of those only types of content that haven't been able to do that.

269
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:55,489
So we actually considered that when we designed the hardware.

270
00:19:55,489 --> 00:20:01,633
And one of the things that we're really proud of is that when games are running on the Xbox Series X and Series S,

271
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,776
they're running with the full performance of the Xbox Series X and Series S.

272
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:11,258
So they're running at the full clock rates, they're running at the full CPU performance,

273
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,540
they have access to the full I.O. performance.

274
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,986
And what that allows us to do is it allows us to actually run the games better than they've ever been run before,

275
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:24,029
oftentimes even further than the original hardware that they were originally designed for.

276
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,797
So one of the critical things that's important to us though,

277
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:32,861
is that we never violate that artistic intent of that original creator.

278
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,824
So, you know, we're never going to run a game at, say, you know,

279
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,446
ultra high frame rates and then, you know,

280
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:42,790
the game doesn't feel the same or doesn't look the same or you get visual artifacts.

281
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:47,995
And the only way that we can achieve that is through a tremendous amount of testing

282
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:50,577
that we do across the entire catalog of games.

283
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:56,042
And I think it just really comes down to, you know, for us, a real player-centric approach,

284
00:20:56,042 --> 00:21:01,267
as opposed to a device-centric approach. It's not about selling more copies. It's not about,

285
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:06,452
you know, oh, I want this player to, you know, purchase a remastered version.

286
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:11,336
If somebody's invested their time and their money into our ecosystem, we want to respect that.

287
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,960
And then I also think of it as, you know, it's preservation.

288
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,405
You know, there's so many games that I have from my childhood or over the last

289
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:24,711
10 to 15 years that I just love and I have these really strong memories about them.

290
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:27,314
And, you know, I should be able to go back and play them.

291
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:31,519
And like one of the things that's always been magical for me with the Series X and Series S,

292
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,520
is I can take a game from my back catalog,

293
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,521
download it, put it on the console,

294
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,743
and then my game saves instantly available to me.

295
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:42,784
And I might not have played the game for five or six years,

296
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,805
but I'm instantly taken back exactly to where I was,

297
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,686
you know, five or six years ago.

298
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,687
And then, you know, maybe I'll finish the game

299
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,948
or maybe I'll play the game again.

300
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:52,988
And that's the thing.

301
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:55,970
It's about preserving that art form that we love.

302
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,611
And that's why I think most of us are in this industry

303
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:00,752
is because we really view it as an art form.

304
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:00,832
Yeah.

305
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:09,578
Yeah, I was surprised when I started playing Mass Effect for 360 and then my old save floated up.

306
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,979
So that was a nice surprise.

307
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,099
Totally.

308
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:18,941
Wrapping up, moving forward, what are the next steps for you and the people working

309
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:24,903
on the technical side of the console? Are you already thinking about what's next?

310
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:32,382
Um, you know, it's a funny question. I mean, in many ways, launch is just the beginning. I mean,

311
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:36,386
clearly it's taken a tremendous amount of time and a tremendous amount of work from

312
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:41,932
thousands of people to get us to launch next week. But we're just beginning, you know, and like I

313
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:46,317
said, you know, the launch games are definitely taking full advantage of the power that we're

314
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,239
delivering and some of the next gen features.

315
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,683
But, you know, the average game takes three to four years to make now.

316
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:57,087
So we're already working with titles for the second holiday and third holiday.

317
00:22:57,087 --> 00:23:00,610
You know, obviously we're working really closely with all the major middleware

318
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,135
vendors to make sure that the engines are fully optimized to take advantage

319
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,757
of all this great next gen capabilities that we have.

320
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:11,660
And then, you know, we're always thinking about what's next.

321
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,022
You know, we're really listening to developers, we're really listening to players.

322
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:20,525
And our goal is to just really deliver the most premium gaming experience that we can

323
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:24,608
for, you know, the two and a half billion people across the world who play games.

324
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:27,149
You know, in some cases, that's going to be the console,

325
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:29,851
and the console is going to be the best in class experience.

326
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:33,534
In other cases, it might be, you know, somebody who's more PC-centric,

327
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,974
and we want to make sure we're great there.

328
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:37,556
And then for a large number of people,

329
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,797
it's giving them access to this wealth of,

330
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:43,279
you know, this huge catalog of content that we have

331
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,501
through things like Project xCloud

332
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:48,442
and enabling people who maybe have never played

333
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,244
or have never been able to play certain franchises,

334
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:53,385
you know, allowing them to jump in

335
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:55,286
and just really experience that.

336
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,987
So we're always thinking about the future.

337
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:59,309
We're really excited about the future,

338
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,231
but next week is really just the beginning of this journey,

339
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:03,892
but we couldn't be more excited about it.

340
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,575
Really appreciate you taking some time.

341
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:06,476
It's been enlightening.
