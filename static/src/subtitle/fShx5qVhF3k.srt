00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:09,477
Hi, I'm James Horne and I'm Creative Director at Pixel Toys Ltd.

2
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,503
We're a VR and mobile game developer based in the centre of the UK in leafy Leamington Spa,

3
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:23,209
a creative hub for the UK games industry and also home to Codemasters, Playground Games and Ubisoft amongst others.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,413
As a game studio, we're known most recently for our Games Workshop games

5
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,537
such as Warhammer 40,000 Freeblade, Age of Sigmar Realm War.

6
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:38,591
And most recently, Warhammer 40,000 Battlesister, which is available now on Oculus Quest and Rift.

7
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:44,716
In addition, we've also made Drop Dead, a zombie narrative shooter that originated on Gear VR

8
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:50,721
and has found great success on Quest over the last few years. Now none of this, of course,

9
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:54,625
sounds even remotely linked to theatre, so let me give you some of that side too.

10
00:00:55,444 --> 00:01:00,588
I trained in theatre and drama at Aberystwyth University in Deepest Wales, an absolutely

11
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:07,593
beautiful place which also has a history of pursuing creative, innovative theatre. Whilst there,

12
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:12,837
I worked with some fantastic pioneering creatives such as Mike Pearson of Brief Goff,

13
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:17,200
Richard Downing of You Man Zoo, and Dr David Raby of Lurking Truth.

14
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,817
What they have in common as theatre makers and what I saw in them was the breadth of theatre

15
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,500
and how it can break through from the more stifling or traditional forms

16
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:32,005
that can often be seen in the higher profile theatre that we see today in London or on Broadway.

17
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:39,211
My work there concluded with the founding of Word Theatre, a small experimental theatre company

18
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,734
that produced a series of devised pieces over a number of years across West Wales.

19
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:46,177
Our largest performance was Word.

20
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,942
It's a performative journey through the story of the Bible,

21
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,143
soundtracked by big beat music,

22
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:52,944
liberal use of angle grinders,

23
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:54,584
and a lot of scaffolding poles.

24
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:59,166
That's sold out to sell out audiences across Wales

25
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,626
and very much achieved what we set out for it to do.

26
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:05,268
It was about innovative and new ways to express old ideas

27
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,888
using what at the time was pretty high technology.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,002
So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to take you through my journey with theatre and games,

29
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:20,706
jumping into XR as we go through and give you some of my thoughts on how I believe the two interrelate,

30
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:26,509
the synergies that are there, and most importantly, how they can inform each other in their creative processes.

31
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:33,213
To do this, I've grouped my thoughts into four main headlines that I'll explore in more detail as we go on.

32
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,995
Those headlines are Theatre is Spatial.

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
Theatre is interpersonal.

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,600
Theatre is refined.

35
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,721
And theatre is.

36
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:49,562
Okay, so let's fast forward.

37
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,562
Career-wise, I worked for a time as an actor,

38
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:55,943
and I did various bit parts in TV shows and bits of theatre,

39
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,063
but eventually ended up changing careers

40
00:02:58,123 --> 00:02:59,304
and heading into video games.

41
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:01,364
As mentioned previously,

42
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,885
Leamington Spa is a hub for games development.

43
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:05,585
So I joined Codemasters,

44
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,845
working as an environment artist on Dirt.

45
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:14,885
Later on moving to Freestyle Games where we made the amazing DJ Hero as part of Activision

46
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:22,170
before ultimately ending up at Pixel Toys. This is where my eyes were opened to the possibilities of

47
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,955
theatre and games coming together and it came via a Samsung phone strapped into a plastic hole.

48
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:35,542
I joined the company just as they were beginning a project on Gear VR.

49
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,743
It was creating a zombie shooter.

50
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:43,448
Now I actually find zombie shooters a little bit lazy and cliched, but what struck me as

51
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:48,531
I put on that headset for the first time, even in a fairly rough prototype form with

52
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:51,233
prototype code, was the sense of space.

53
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:55,977
Immersion, yes, but also that depth, that sense of architecture.

54
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,640
The relationship of you, the protagonist, the audience.

55
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,942
to the content, and this is a key tenet of theatre,

56
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:10,105
and a recognition of this is vital for creating compelling VR experiences.

57
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,948
So what do I mean by this? Well, Peter Brook,

58
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:19,431
the acclaimed theatre director, wrote in the opening lines of his seminal book

59
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:24,955
The Empty Space in 1968, I can take any empty space and call it a

60
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:25,815
bare stage.

61
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,032
The heart of theatre, the most basic unit, is a space for performance.

62
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:39,738
Whether this is the amphitheatres of ancient Greece, the Commedia dell'arte performing in the

63
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:45,321
piazzas of Tuscany, Shakespeare's great wooden O, the Globe in London,

64
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:48,363
through the proscenium of the Victorian age.

65
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:54,807
And then those paradigms being shattered in the 20th century by modernism and experimental theatre,

66
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:58,310
things like theatre in the round, site-specific work.

67
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:04,716
But one thing they all have in common is a physical defined space,

68
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:10,001
a spatial relationship between the audience and the performers.

69
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,745
So why does this matter for XR?

70
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:24,305
And I will use that term now rather than VR because this is true for augmented reality, mixed reality, spatial computing, whatever other terms you like to use.

71
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,245
They exist within a space.

72
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:35,507
In the case of VR, it's a digital space that cuts out the real world and shuts it out, creates a new world.

73
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:44,589
For augmented reality, it's a digital space that sits on top of and exists in relation to our real space.

74
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,693
In the case of spatial computing, it's a digital space that interacts with our real world space.

75
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:57,737
And this is a significant difference to flat screen or pancake formats, as they're often called, which are not.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,502
I, the user, am kept at a fixed distance through the window and my presence is not relevant to the content.

77
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:13,688
This is actually an ideal moment to bring another small part of my journey with theatre and digital technology out.

78
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:21,299
Through 2019 into 2020, I had the pleasure of being one of six digital fellows working

79
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,722
with the Royal Shakespeare Company and Magic Leap, plus some fantastic partners in i2 Media

80
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:29,703
at Goldsmiths and the University of Portsmouth.

81
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:36,587
We were researching how digital technology could transform theatre and performance going

82
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:40,369
into the future and the relationship of audiences to digital technology.

83
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,128
Over the course of the year, I investigated the potential of Magic Leap,

84
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,569
working with the other fellows to create an interactive dining experience

85
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,511
based on a Midsummer Night's Dream and featuring live actors, projection mapping, and the Magic Leap.

86
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:02,813
We're preparing to present this work, which is titled Where Once We, at South by Southwest in

87
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:07,374
March 2020, and I think I probably don't need to sum up ultimately what happened to those

88
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,015
performances as sadly global events overtook things.

89
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,451
But I'll share some elements and learnings from this as we go along.

90
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:24,277
Any piece of theatre considers the space that it will take place in and defines it for its own purposes.

91
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:34,582
The needs of the drama are reflected in this. A stage designer working with the director will spend a great deal of time during the design phase of theatre,

92
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:39,304
considering the movement and the relationships between the audience and the performers.

93
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:44,074
Proximity can heighten threat or intimacy.

94
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:48,515
Space and isolation can reinforce a sense of loneliness.

95
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,896
A busy, ever-moving stage can illustrate

96
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,537
or create chaotic drama.

97
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,738
This is very important for how we create

98
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,258
our XR experiences too.

99
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,459
We need to design them for space.

100
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,500
An example of this, from my experience,

101
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,181
was a devised theater piece I worked on some years ago

102
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:08,922
called Genet.

103
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,802
directed by Judith Aston.

104
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,465
As part of the show, based on the life of the anarchist poet,

105
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,447
Jean Genet, who we can see in the center there,

106
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,750
we wanted to create the feel of a descent into madness.

107
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:22,633
The audience were positioned around the room,

108
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:25,215
and an increasing number of actors

109
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,837
moved around the space surrounding them,

110
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:28,958
moving even between them.

111
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:35,996
The action, music, and sounds were getting less and less focused on single actors and individual performances

112
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:40,458
and became more and more chaotic around the audience members as the madness built.

113
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,699
It certainly wasn't a comfortable experience for the audience.

114
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,700
It was certainly memorable and striking.

115
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:52,983
And this is very important for how we create our XR experiences too.

116
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:56,484
We need to design them for space.

117
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:02,384
For XR, then, we need an awareness of space and spatial relationships.

118
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:09,830
This is both the actual physical space that the experience takes place within.

119
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,133
In the case of augmented reality, for example,

120
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:16,635
we need to author an experience that is flexible to user space,

121
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,297
yet it's also defined and controlled.

122
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,701
How do we restrict where the user can place the experience?

123
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,083
And then how can we take advantage of this?

124
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:29,328
We need to consider those usage cases.

125
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,810
Where will the experience likely be?

126
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,132
What are the commonalities?

127
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,753
Where in the world will this be?

128
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,694
Is it local or is it global?

129
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:41,177
A living room in Australia is a very different place

130
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,459
from one in the UK in terms of space, likewise the US.

131
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,881
And ultimately, what are the spatial relationships

132
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,183
that are core to your audience?

133
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:55,246
When we began developing the Dream Magic Leap RSC

134
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:55,827
project in 2019.

135
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,397
We came to realise that this ambiguity about space

136
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,459
was a huge opportunity, but also a huge challenge.

137
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,602
In the case of Magic Leap, the headset can see and can scan the world.

138
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,603
And this is absolutely amazing.

139
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,106
But is it actually aware of what the world is?

140
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,327
And thus, can it respond to it?

141
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,650
The engineers at Magic Leap were working hard to add this functionality into the SDK.

142
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,031
This is object semantics.

143
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:29,687
And that is ultimately is the code understanding the meaning of something,

144
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,449
which is actually a step further than computer vision.

145
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,691
So when I scan a chair or a table,

146
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:41,094
the system knows not only that that shape is likely a table or a chair,

147
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:45,517
but what a table or chair represents or is useful.

148
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:49,559
And then how does our authored content relate to that?

149
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:54,866
For more information, there are some really great videos from Magic Leap out there, including

150
00:10:55,286 --> 00:11:02,291
a very comprehensive breakdown of Lumen OS Perception by Jean-Yves Bouguet and David

151
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,153
Molyneux, which is well worth checking out.

152
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,179
So what do I mean by this? It's talking about spatial awareness and performance,

153
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,723
and why would this be useful? This again circles back to theatre and acting.

154
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,006
An actor performing within a space is

155
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,622
aware of and understands the space in which they act. By means of what are commonly referred to as

156
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:31,744
physical actions, and we've got a great quote here from from Konstantin Stanislavski, the great

157
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:39,747
theorist and actor, in every physical action, unless it is purely mechanical, there is concealed

158
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:45,569
some inner action, some feelings. This is how the two levels of life in a part are created.

159
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,950
The inner, the things going on within,

160
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,432
and the outer, the things we're presenting.

161
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,253
They are intertwined.

162
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,854
A common purpose brings them together

163
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,435
and reinforces the unbreakable bond.

164
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,477
That actor performs within a space.

165
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,957
They respond to that space.

166
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,318
This could be the simple action

167
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,819
of leaning on the back of the chair whilst talking.

168
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,820
It could be the subconscious coming through

169
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,921
as you use a prop to stem and define the dramatic action.

170
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:22,985
In an XR experience, that activity when related to a real-world space can be incredibly compelling.

171
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:30,152
At a very basic level, playing Dr. Grawbotz on Magic Leap for one of the first times in my home,

172
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:37,099
and when facing the enemies, it took me a moment to realize that the enemies were both behind my sofa,

173
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,923
using it as cover, and also shooting around some of the objects in my room.

174
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:48,221
These characters were in my space, and actually at that moment, the experience becomes much more profound.

175
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:56,086
This content is not being projected on my world, but rather is within my world and within my reality.

176
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:58,428
It then becomes a form of theatre.

177
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:11,997
Anthony Arto was a visionary playwright and theorist, and in 1938 actually coined the phrase virtual reality for the first time.

178
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:20,905
In this quote he talks about how alchemists create gold and that within the theatre, when

179
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:27,207
characters, objects, images come together in the theatre it becomes a virtual reality.

180
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,127
And that's where the really amazing stuff is.

181
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:34,009
The theatre performance is a virtual reality.

182
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,910
The XR experience is a virtual reality.

183
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:41,371
We create.

184
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:44,373
immersive realities for our audiences.

185
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:53,620
So these same spatial relationships are hugely important when developing a virtual reality game

186
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,144
experience of course. Recently we launched Warhammer 40,000 Battle System on Oculus Quest

187
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:05,848
as mentioned before and one thing within that Warhammer world is the sense of scale and space

188
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:10,311
that we wanted to create. We wanted to have soaring cathedrals

189
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,171
We wanted to have that sense of scale that the brand carries with it.

190
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:20,893
These huge, brutalist concrete structures, oversized people, tanks, weaponry.

191
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:28,256
It's really a striking thing when you first experience a space marine spatially in relation to you in VR.

192
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,817
Games Workshop, who made the franchise, even questioned whether the scale was correct.

193
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:37,699
They stood beside this eight and a half foot tall marine for the first time in VR.

194
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:45,813
So in this sense, we designed our environments and our gameplay to maximize the theater of our VR experience.

195
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:57,383
Now, the core narrative within our game is between the player, another battle sister called Sister Rosalina, and a Primaris space marine called Julius.

196
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,266
They're played by the fantastic Victoria and Obi that you can see here.

197
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,335
Within the game, we have a motion-captured narrative,

198
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:08,537
and I was really keen for those moments that you have

199
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,960
where you're telling a story between these three characters,

200
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,542
that you would have that spatial intimacy

201
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,123
that you get when you're in a theater.

202
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,745
This is particularly interesting with a space marine

203
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,046
who's eight and a half foot tall.

204
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,688
The amazing thing about telling a story in this way

205
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,610
is that there is a sense of presence

206
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,492
that you as an audience member get

207
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,653
when you're standing close to these actors

208
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:31,295
who are responding to you.

209
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,098
looking at you and each other.

210
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:39,479
In order to do this, we had to treat the motion capture shoot

211
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:43,140
like a theatre experience. I directed the shoot from the

212
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,821
point of view of the virtual audience member. So we get that

213
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:52,842
connection, those little looks between characters, that

214
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:57,884
intimacy. This for me was one of the reasons why I was so excited

215
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:01,245
about virtual reality. We're telling stories from and

216
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:05,484
showing actors' performances in this very personal way.

217
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:11,028
We configure the space, the way we block out that action,

218
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,470
in exactly the same way as we would in the theatre.

219
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:16,833
Block like theatre.

220
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:19,875
We're trying to capture the nuance of performance.

221
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,118
And ultimately, we're configuring the space to do that.

222
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:32,160
And this is where we cross over from the theatre is spatial into theatre is interpersonal.

223
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:40,221
Because it's about space, but it's also about people and the relationship between people and that contact.

224
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:49,563
Now, obviously, I know there are lots of fantastic virtual and augmented reality works which have no figurative or human elements within them.

225
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:54,384
But there is definitely something special about meeting human beings within a virtual space.

226
00:16:55,572 --> 00:17:01,756
You can see the popularity of things like VRChat and the under-presence performance of The Tempest,

227
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,577
which brought live theatre into virtual reality.

228
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:11,521
Likewise, the RSC's Dream Project earlier this year that streamed live mocap to huge audiences.

229
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:17,944
Perhaps this is magnified by the situation we've been in over the last year and a half under lockdowns,

230
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,247
but just meeting people digitally or virtually still has a power.

231
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:31,885
Something that's also important to take from this interpersonal theatre is the contact

232
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,126
that takes place between an audience and an actor.

233
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:41,830
If you watch a recording of a live piece of theatre on TV, it's often somehow a drier,

234
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,992
less exciting experience, particularly a film before an empty house.

235
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:49,233
Add an audience and that energy rises.

236
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:53,095
Be there in person and it's an entirely different experience.

237
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:58,795
Partly this is because of the shared experience you have with other audience members, that

238
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:05,159
unique moment in time shared with a select few, but also because the audience completes

239
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,059
the experience.

240
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,163
Shown here are images from King John, fantastic performances that played at the Swan Theatre

241
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,525
in Stratford in 2019-2020.

242
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:22,928
The excitement of the audience in this show was so important to two really key scenes

243
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,628
within the play.

244
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,551
There's a boxing match that ranged across the stage.

245
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:32,996
The pugilists were even falling to the crowd at times as the performance

246
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:36,579
almost became a sporting event.

247
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,161
The messy match taking place.

248
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,505
Then again, later, there's a wedding that descends into a real food fight

249
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:47,388
where the audience roars with laughter whilst trying to avoid being hit

250
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,990
by flying cakes and hot dogs.

251
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:53,473
The actors play to the crowd.

252
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:57,928
They catch their eyes, they respond to their responses,

253
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:00,209
they feed on the energy of an audience.

254
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,110
And this is what we're missing

255
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,831
by not having live events at the moment.

256
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,732
And this can be the same with our XR experiences.

257
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,215
In Battlesister, we had our mocap,

258
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,336
but we intentionally broke our mocap

259
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:16,658
to introduce elements of this into our dramatic action.

260
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,899
We know the player is wearing a 6 DoF helmet,

261
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,640
Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift.

262
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:26,204
and we'll be moving around the scene as our actors talk.

263
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,906
So what we did was we layered in responses

264
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,807
through predominantly through look-ats,

265
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,709
and they make a huge difference

266
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,212
to the feeling of immersion within that scene.

267
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,616
We have responsive gestures where characters

268
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:44,498
will hand the player items

269
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:46,259
at certain parts within the storyline.

270
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,621
And it feels great to reach out and take that

271
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,323
from a character who's reaching out to where you are.

272
00:19:52,020 --> 00:20:03,384
We'd love to take this further, obviously, layering in more responsive systems, putting in alternative takes and captures for responses to different ways the main player can respond.

273
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:08,566
And what I say is it's really great to consider this kind of thing for impactful moments.

274
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:15,208
You don't have to put it everywhere, but for those moments where you need that contact, those key parts of the drama, it's worth doing.

275
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:19,415
However, I would say it is quite expensive to develop.

276
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,478
Adding any of those systems in and trying to do them in a way

277
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,362
that's subtle and looks natural is quite hard.

278
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,725
It's definitely a cross-discipline effort.

279
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:33,308
You need your coders, you need your narrative designers,

280
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,210
and you definitely need your animators in there as well,

281
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,853
all to try and get that subtlety and to make sure

282
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,775
that those systems are finely tuned

283
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,937
to where the player is looking.

284
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,622
And ultimately, there are diminishing returns as well.

285
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:49,165
So I'd say keep up those impactful moments,

286
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,267
but the more responsiveness we can get

287
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:53,730
to play a position, the better.

288
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:59,876
Now, whilst working on the Magic Leap RSC Fellowship year,

289
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,459
I did a series of experiments using motion capture

290
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,401
to convey a piece of Shakespeare,

291
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:08,024
the Duke of Clarence's speech from Richard III.

292
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:14,046
I found that the sort of filmic motion capture performance didn't really work when placed

293
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:17,187
into an XR environment, in this case the Magic Leap.

294
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,767
Partially this was the hardware.

295
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:22,569
The light field technology is fairly early in the Magic Leap one, which means that the

296
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,629
subtler nuances are captured and lost.

297
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,911
Likewise, a limited field of view on the headset meant that full-size humans didn't really

298
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,031
fit very well in the frame.

299
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:37,073
This led to the experience becoming more of a traditional tabletop look, shrinking down

300
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,774
the performance so it can be viewed in full.

301
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:45,044
But what this required was for the actor to play to the crowd,

302
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,485
giving a much bigger performance that you can see here

303
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,886
on the lovely Unity robot.

304
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:57,108
The RSC's own Seven Ages of Man also

305
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,788
shows this in a very refined way.

306
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,810
So if you're designing your experience theatrically

307
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,370
with that awareness of space and the power

308
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,971
of those interpersonal connections,

309
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,691
You can also make the user work a bit to see that.

310
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:17,193
So what I mean by that is framing the action so that the player is encouraged to look around,

311
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:21,475
interact, and interrogate the performance, to engage.

312
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:25,196
If we look at the scene from partway through Battle Sister,

313
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:29,838
we can see the player's view of Malachi. He's our resident Inquisitor.

314
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:35,500
A traditional cutscene would frame the actors so we would catch all of their performances

315
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,581
in one or two shots, depending on the camera angle.

316
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,887
There can be a tendency for us to do this in XR2,

317
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:47,070
to frame all of that action right in front of where the player or the user is looking.

318
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:52,413
However, in XR, we can stage the action around the player.

319
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:58,577
So as the action unfolds, they look left, they look right, they engage with the action.

320
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:01,639
This is certainly a more engrossing experience

321
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,041
and can lead to an involvement that is ultimately more memorable.

322
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,724
On a practical note, I'd say that if you want to do this,

323
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:15,966
you need to rehearse with your actors.

324
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,648
And what I'd say is, we always book up,

325
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,649
we book in our shoots for motion capture,

326
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,550
and then we kind of work back from there.

327
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,831
Book in more rehearsal time with your actors

328
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,592
and get them as involved as possible.

329
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,073
You need to build a company of actors.

330
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:32,175
Help them to understand what the game's going to be.

331
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,477
Help them to understand the nuances

332
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:36,758
of their individual characters.

333
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:40,514
Get them their script as far in advance as possible.

334
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,896
Share it with them, share all the details you can, concept art,

335
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:49,398
and you'll have some actors who are much more engaged with the piece that you're creating.

336
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,281
Making them aware of where their audience is going to be is also crucial.

337
00:23:56,141 --> 00:24:00,343
One thing we found when we were working with Victoria and Obi is that

338
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:04,385
working towards a virtual reality camera is much harder because

339
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,566
the player can be wherever they are.

340
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:11,267
We had to really target down where we think, where we want the player to be.

341
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,929
Listen to your actors as well.

342
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:17,711
Theatre productions are collaborations and not dictatorships,

343
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:21,013
and actors are professionals and have really good insights

344
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,274
into how a drama can unfold.

345
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:27,256
I would encourage people to bring along your lead animator

346
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:29,697
to any motion capture shoots that you're doing

347
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,118
to watch that data capture and work with the team.

348
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,640
And some of these are slightly more common sense

349
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,601
within motion capture, but blocking your environments

350
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:41,622
and using accurate blocking models makes a huge difference.

351
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:44,523
And making sure your props have got accurate grip points

352
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:47,244
means that extra step of accuracy

353
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:49,425
will save you a whole load in the long run.

354
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:53,426
And what I'd also say is, as you're rehearsing,

355
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:54,987
refine your action.

356
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,487
Don't be afraid to cut.

357
00:24:56,647 --> 00:25:00,329
Don't be afraid to cut out all that fat and flab

358
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,730
that's sitting within those performances.

359
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:11,314
The great thing about that last note is that it nicely segues into my next headline, that theatre is refined.

360
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:17,396
Now, of course, most XR experiences these days are the result of a great deal of thought, time and effort.

361
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:26,558
But one thing that struck me about theatre as I worked with the RSC over the course of the year was the stages and levels of concerted refinement that took place.

362
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:33,500
I was reflecting on the difference between what in games and films we would call the pre-production and production processes,

363
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,220
theatrical rehearsal processes.

364
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,822
Now on the surface, these two sets of processes

365
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:42,023
can seem superficially similar,

366
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,224
but there are quite significant differences

367
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,144
in how they are structured.

368
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:47,725
So I'm going to share some experiences I've had

369
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:50,266
in rehearsals in the past and give you some examples.

370
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,468
Now it's worth saying I'm talking here

371
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,749
about my experiences of theatrical process.

372
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:59,210
There are many, and they can be very short,

373
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,111
sometimes too short, and can also be entirely different.

374
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,422
But usually there is somebody with an idea of what they want to present.

375
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:14,027
Often this is embedded in a script, a story to be told, staged or revived.

376
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:19,732
In theatre, text is often the anchor that holds the production together,

377
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,715
a backbone or an armature which the different elements can be hung off.

378
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:31,161
If we're actually honest, do our XR experiences have that backbone, that anchor?

379
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:38,798
I've been involved in many games where the vision, the central idea of the game still isn't truly resolved, even at launch.

380
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:44,159
And if you're still finding the core, the truth, the vision of that game right to the end of production,

381
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,880
then your development team is swirling around with that backbone.

382
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,581
You can see here a typical theatre process.

383
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:55,102
This can be anywhere from one year to possibly even to five years long.

384
00:26:55,853 --> 00:27:03,994
with a long script development process, a design stage where staging, lighting, visual design is developed.

385
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:10,696
Casting can be a year before, music composed alongside that as well, and then your visual

386
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:15,437
graphic design is often chosen much that's long before the rest of the production is developed.

387
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:20,918
It's an elongated experimental period and there's loads of really interesting

388
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:25,307
Opportunities for ideas to be developed, lots of discussion,

389
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:30,028
dramaturgy as well is in there which is about editing the drama.

390
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:38,449
With Where Once We, which was the ultimate aim for our Magic Leap RSC event, we followed this

391
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:44,830
pattern, not with that length of duration, but it was a cross-discipline creative process with a

392
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,971
real freedom to ideate.

393
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:52,772
We came up with loads of ideas, loads of images, throwing lots of things around.

394
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:56,795
We explored the text together, reading the whole play aloud several times,

395
00:27:57,216 --> 00:28:00,558
and just listening to the changes that the spoken text brought.

396
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,202
We had space. We had time to immerse ourselves in the project.

397
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:16,366
We looked at loads of different images related to classical Shakespeare, to old traditions of Warwickshire,

398
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:21,630
what does a forest mean, and other things like that.

399
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:29,707
As we progressed, we created a Things We Know To Be True document to begin to cement some of these ideas down.

400
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:40,636
And this is actually crucial for a design process, being able to know when to lock ideas down and to begin to create the foundations upon which your creative project is going to be built.

401
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:48,203
We had a lot of unknowns relating to budget, performance dates, technical support for app development.

402
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,991
So we focused on elements we could control and this was a fantastic creative process.

403
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:03,393
Now at a certain point, usually dictated by budget and release date, a theatre company will move into

404
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:10,054
actual rehearsal and this is the meat of theatre making. Actors, directors, producers and other

405
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:16,875
creatives in a common space working on the production. Theatre is rarely a pure dictatorship.

406
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,932
and I do choose my words carefully there,

407
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:23,874
truly successful theatre empowers the actors and creatives

408
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:28,136
so that the process is truly collaborative.

409
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:30,717
The production is discovered

410
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,657
through the process of rehearsal.

411
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:36,179
It is continually refined in alignment

412
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,260
with the overall vision of the piece.

413
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:43,362
What this often is,

414
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,823
is that there is an intense

415
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:49,750
focus and an honesty there. And actually I think that's really

416
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:54,794
something we need to value and we need to encourage within our games as well.

417
00:29:55,094 --> 00:30:00,698
And often it's not too late to amend. For Where Weren't We, we actually had a very short rehearsal

418
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:06,182
time as we pulled together the technical aspects of the Magic Leap experience, the music, the

419
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:12,106
physical props. These physical props featured projection mappings, small physical details

420
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,707
that audiences could interact with.

421
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:20,252
And it was all due to be set within a seedy bar in Texas during the South by Southwest festival.

422
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:26,556
During rehearsals in Stratford and following discussions with a wide range of test audiences,

423
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:31,838
we heavily reworked sections of narrative to tighten the experience and to make the

424
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:37,721
narrative more compelling. This was really difficult and actually controversial amongst us as a group.

425
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:44,368
Likewise, certain technical elements just didn't work so well in Magic Leap, and so we revised the

426
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:51,034
conclusion of the piece, the ultimate end point, simplifying and streamlining the ending.

427
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:57,059
Ultimately, the piece we prepared was more accessible and more practical than our earlier

428
00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:02,383
version, and was ready for first night, a night that sadly never came to be.

429
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:06,809
And that's the presentation.

430
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:09,031
That's the final stage of the process.

431
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,413
I've grouped Tech Week into here.

432
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,354
This is talking about theater,

433
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,216
where it's that really important moment,

434
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,097
like we said before,

435
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:19,599
where it's the coming together of all those elements.

436
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:26,155
It's very similar to the final QA phase that you have within game dev, where all the nasty

437
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:26,936
bugs come out.

438
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:30,359
And lighting, costumes, sets, music will all be in place.

439
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,243
And there's actually a very fast period of evolution that takes place then.

440
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:39,488
In theatre, the performance can still be developing at this stage, responding to the moment.

441
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,181
Playing isn't even fun at this stage, even after first night.

442
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,902
The great power of theater is that it's unique every night,

443
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,263
a special occasion every performance.

444
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,844
Performers are working with the audience.

445
00:31:55,645 --> 00:32:00,026
So, relating this back then to game dev and XR dev.

446
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:03,427
We have our idea,

447
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:07,128
and usually never enough time for anything.

448
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:09,589
But we should, and never enough budget.

449
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:13,469
But we should learn from theatre about the design process.

450
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,012
That pre-production shouldn't rush too fast to prototype.

451
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:24,075
Do we actually give our creatives time and space to actually think about ideas?

452
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,957
To play with crazy notions? To experiment?

453
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:31,600
We should elongate this process.

454
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,861
Allowing time for ideas to gestate.

455
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:38,023
Trusting creatives to be creative.

456
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:44,052
If we have narrative elements, then we need to bring our writers in earlier than we do.

457
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:50,500
We need to get them to engage with the earlier stages of production so that their work is

458
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,502
fully integrated into the whole.

459
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,529
Involving cast earlier as well pays huge dividends.

460
00:32:56,989 --> 00:33:00,130
Performer's experiences can really help shape a piece of drama,

461
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,131
particularly if you employ someone like Victoria, like we did on Battlesister,

462
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:07,132
who's done so much games work before.

463
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:11,173
Her experience was so valuable to us as we developed.

464
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:19,924
Ultimately, this process should be about refining and defining a vision for the project that

465
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:22,125
can stand up to argument and scrutiny.

466
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:26,888
This means having those difficult conversations and working through the conflicts.

467
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,810
A solid vision will be worth that pain in later development, worth that pain in data

468
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,290
development.

469
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:37,413
So how do we define a shared vision?

470
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,925
Ultimately, it requires a great deal of negotiation and discussion between all the relevant stakeholders

471
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:48,789
and should be laid out and communicated to and with the team really clearly.

472
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:57,237
This becomes the test that the entire project, this becomes the test point where we can test our entire project against

473
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:59,760
and it's very important during the later production.

474
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,324
It's very important to form a company of people that trust one another.

475
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:10,483
Now there are many ways to do this of course but ensuring that there is a safe space for people to

476
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:16,666
express ideas without them getting immediately shot down is vital. Many theatre companies spend

477
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:22,548
a lot of early rehearsal time just getting to know each other, socialising, learning about each

478
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:28,071
other's backgrounds. It makes them a more cohesive and more creative unit and ultimately a unit that

479
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:34,954
trusts itself. With ideas, keeping them nebulous to begin with and then beginning to narrow them

480
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:35,314
later.

481
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,181
It makes a huge, it can be really, really helpful.

482
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,762
Things like Miro boards are really great for this.

483
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,264
Feeding in the advice of specialists,

484
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:49,385
writers, composers, actors to help develop your vision.

485
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:52,907
And then ultimately your directors must direct

486
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:54,428
whether you've got one director

487
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,709
or a series of directors in different disciplines.

488
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,210
Your directors need to take you through

489
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:02,652
because groupthink rarely arrives

490
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:04,032
at a clean and coherent whole.

491
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:12,259
Testing the idea with your friends, family, market research as well is really a great thing to do.

492
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,260
All feedback is good, even the negative stuff.

493
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,141
You just need to work out how to interpret that.

494
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:20,182
And ultimately, you need to take risks.

495
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:23,103
You need to be creative in that when you're making your vision.

496
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:30,445
So once we move through into full production, this is the meat of game dev.

497
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:32,988
where we actually make the thing.

498
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:36,230
Like a theatre rehearsal, this should be a group of professionals

499
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,873
enabling each other and working collaboratively

500
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,814
towards that shared vision,

501
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:44,636
held aloft usually by the director.

502
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,058
This can be a longer period of time, and so

503
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:50,920
we need to make sure that we've got enough stamina for that, and

504
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,782
we need to remember to keep refining as we go forward.

505
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:58,525
Sometimes it can feel like a slog just to get everything over the line.

506
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,026
But that's fine.

507
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,143
We're often still answering pre-production questions, and that actually is a problem.

508
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:10,087
We should try and stamp out any of those pre-production questions which we should

509
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:16,052
have answered way back in pre-prod. Now, change will of course be needed as we're doing this,

510
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:21,556
but we should try and make this subtractive change rather than additive. Let's try and

511
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,780
cut things out. Let's try and tighten up the experience rather than bloating it.

512
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:30,304
User testing as well can be really helpful, as mentioned in the previous.

513
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:36,850
if it's done right and if you've got somebody who can actually be interpreting that data for you.

514
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:44,394
So the director needs to make time to review the work as it progresses.

515
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:49,076
And this importance of the review to this process is really, really key.

516
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:56,490
Production is a long slog and so having those regular moments of review and retrospective

517
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:02,334
is vital to make a compelling experience. Agile can help with this although there are other ways

518
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:07,798
you can do it. You need to make decisions and that's ultimately that's the director's job,

519
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:13,802
but individually we need to make decisions as a dev team and not wallow around in indecision

520
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:18,866
at this stage. That was our pre-production process where we were wallowing, now we're making

521
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:19,306
decisions.

522
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,391
But it's rarely too late to change your mind either.

523
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,352
Keep cutting things if you need to.

524
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,593
Most plays are flabby, most games are flabby.

525
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,254
Let's tighten it up as we keep going.

526
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:37,257
So as we come to release, and the joy of those final few weeks or months of QA

527
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:39,258
where all those bugs start to come out,

528
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,620
we need to still consider and think about refinement.

529
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,001
Things can still be cut, although no adding please.

530
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,802
Remember that there's a content lock.

531
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,607
And we should have a plan for post-launch.

532
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:56,568
In this ever-connected age, the potential to evolve an XR experience

533
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:03,230
post-launch is actually really huge, but we do need to allocate budget to allow for that.

534
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,651
Think about how long you want to support your experience post-first launch,

535
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:11,292
and have a plan for how you'll measure data to inform that process.

536
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:17,634
In larger companies, you'll be blessed with data analysts, but for smaller XR devs, who'll do this?

537
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,212
How will you evaluate that feedback and feed that back into the development process?

538
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:26,375
This is exactly the same process as you would do in a theatre production.

539
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,997
And we need to listen to those reviews.

540
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:37,461
And so I come to my last main headline. Theatre is.

541
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:40,423
What do I mean by this?

542
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:47,186
Well, ultimately, theatre is confident. It's brash.

543
00:38:47,981 --> 00:39:11,730
It's political, it's resilient, it's fun, it's challenging, it's cheap, it's expensive, it's unafraid of risks, it's dangerous, it's exciting, it's nuanced, but it's also rough, it's resourceful, it's ever-changing, it's human, it's now, it's unapologetic, it's expressive, it's interactive, it's surprising, loud,

544
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:16,920
A community, a place to create. It's cutting edge, it's redefining itself every day.

545
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,364
It's fresh, it's immediate, it's relevant, it's powerful.

546
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:23,287
A lot of words, I know.

547
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:29,474
But we need to take that from theatre. Theatre doesn't try and defend itself, it just is.

548
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:31,856
It's all of those things at once.

549
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,001
Playwright Howard Barker says,

550
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:39,721
the weakness of contemporary theatre is its fear of the audience.

551
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:42,622
The horror that they may not understand the scene,

552
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:44,803
that they may lose the thread of the narrative,

553
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,763
that we shall be accused of elitism if meaning becomes obscure.

554
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:51,904
This cripples the theatre with this false democracy.

555
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:54,345
He's talking about boring theatre,

556
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:58,385
but what he's loving is exciting theatre.

557
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:00,426
So what about us?

558
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,886
With our XR experiences, we need to be confident in what we make.

559
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:10,588
We need to have that theatre confidence. We don't need to defend what we're building,

560
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:14,729
whether it's AR, whether it's spatial computing, whether it's VR.

561
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:21,051
We need to take risks and be dangerous. This is an exciting time for this medium.

562
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:25,672
We've got loads of really creative new things, new things every day,

563
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:29,333
new ways of using technology, new ways of interacting.

564
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,890
We need to trust our audience to engage with what we create.

565
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,133
Ultimately, we don't necessarily have loads of money,

566
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:39,434
so we need to be resourceful,

567
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:41,716
and we need to find new ways to solve problems.

568
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:44,898
One way of doing that is we need to be a community

569
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:47,180
that supports one another and is open.

570
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,922
We need to share those learnings with each other,

571
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:50,923
build each other up.

572
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:55,347
So in summary, looking back through

573
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:56,728
what we've been talking about,

574
00:40:57,528 --> 00:40:59,110
theatre is spatial.

575
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:01,832
We design it for our spaces.

576
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,233
We need to author the experiences

577
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:06,893
that we make to maximize immersion.

578
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:10,474
We need to stage our action within defined spaces.

579
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:16,136
We need to embrace the theater of the interpersonal,

580
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:20,017
understand the relationship of your project to the audience.

581
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,778
We need to find that human contact.

582
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,298
We need to build responsive systems

583
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:29,620
so that your audiences know that they're there.

584
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:33,038
We need to be collaborative with our creatives.

585
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:37,920
Theatre is refined, so we need to define that vision.

586
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:42,243
We need to build our company, our company of actors, our company of creatives.

587
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,084
And then we need to review and we need to direct our work.

588
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:50,907
And ultimately, theatre is, we need to be confident.

589
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,088
We need to be a community.

590
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,469
We need to take risks.

591
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,350
And ultimately, we need to create.

592
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:00,544
Thank you so much for listening.

593
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:02,725
Pigs and Toys is hiring.

594
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,167

595
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,129
