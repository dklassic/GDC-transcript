1
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:07,145
Okay, um...

2
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,347
When you say pretty quickly, what do you mean?

3
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:12,428
Okay, okay, okay.

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,790
Um, okay, okay.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,331
Hello, everybody. Thank you for coming out.

6
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:17,992
My name is Matthew Weiss, and I'm going to go very quickly.

7
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,814
Um, okay, so, uh, uh,

8
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,375
I'm here to talk about cinematic games.

9
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:25,336
My talk is, uh, well, you can see the title.

10
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:30,119
Um, so, I think traditionally, cinematic games, uh, uh,

11
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:32,808
So in a historical sense, cinematic games

12
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,951
tend to mean games that adopt the language of cinema.

13
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,695
So dramatic camera angles, cutting, et cetera.

14
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:41,220
But I'm going to talk about how the term can mean so much more

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,343
than that, and how some of our confusion about what

16
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:46,287
cinematic means in games sometimes trips us up

17
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,970
from doing really interesting cinematic adaptations.

18
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,397
So, I'm going to start with a little history.

19
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,659
As you can see, these are two games from the early 80s,

20
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,040
from two films from the early 80s.

21
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,922
You can see E.T. on the right there and Toronto on the left.

22
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,904
And as you can see, both of those images

23
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:05,887
actually refer to the exact same thing happening in the scene.

24
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:08,449
And I wanted to show these because I wanted to point out

25
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,912
the, what I'm calling the representation gap,

26
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:14,874
or the gap, the visual gap between film and games,

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,020
I think in the early 80s was beginning to really show itself.

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,143
And this is kind of the beginning of the obsession with trying to close this gap.

29
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:25,185
As you can see here, just look at the image on the right of ET.

30
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,886
It's literally the exact same image.

31
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:31,490
But, um...

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,852
So anyway, but, and I think that, you know...

33
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,320
Games industry began to become interested in closing this gap for better or for worse.

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,301
But there were really some interesting attempts to do so.

35
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:46,023
The image on the right is from a video game.

36
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:47,944
The image on the left is from a film.

37
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:53,547
But they look exactly the same because they're from the same animation studio.

38
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,428
The image on the left is from The Secret of NIMH.

39
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,389
The right is Dragon's Lair.

40
00:01:58,104 --> 00:02:01,005
And these games came out at the same, or this game,

41
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,847
Dragon's Lair, came out at the same time, actually,

42
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:06,109
as the games we saw on the previous slide

43
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:07,109
in the early 80s.

44
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,291
So you could be at an arcade and you could see

45
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,852
that Tron light cycle thing and then walk to the left

46
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:14,054
and say, oh my god, what is going on in this game

47
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:15,235
that looks exactly like a movie?

48
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,856
And of course, this game at the time just did it

49
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:19,197
with these laser discs that were cutting between clips

50
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,180
inside an arcade cabinet, but it showed you

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,982
just how powerful people wanted this idea of,

52
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,703
they wanted something that looks like a movie.

53
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,234
but actually is interactive.

54
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:32,156
And I think that in the 90s, there was this,

55
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,718
you kind of saw this tension get worked out.

56
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:36,820
Because in the 90s, the laser disc technology

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,521
had become CD technology that was now cheap.

58
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,482
And then, of course, there were all these, those of us

59
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:42,504
who are around remember it like a dark time,

60
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:47,468
the full motion video problem that video games had.

61
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:51,091
And you had all these cheap actors and bad writing.

62
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,913
And there were a few good ones, to be fair, not very many.

63
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,670
And over the course of the 90s, I think,

64
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,213
that we went from this kind of pre-rendered, pre-shot attempts

65
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:05,435
at having narrative cinematic kind of dramatic angles

66
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,337
and cutting and acting in games.

67
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:10,798
We went from that slowly as kind of real-time 3D

68
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:15,481
came into the stage to finding the techniques of that

69
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,062
that worked with real-time 3D.

70
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,483
Of course, you can see Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil,

71
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,384
which were taking these dramatic camera angles

72
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,905
and were using cutting actually as part

73
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:23,826
of real-time gameplay.

74
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,528
And then, of course, you have games like Metal Gear Solid 1,

75
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:29,150
which, at the time, it was a big deal because it was all...

76
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,131
There was no pre-rendered cut scenes in it,

77
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,811
but it had a lot of cinematic cut scenes.

78
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,012
It also used some cinematic camera angles

79
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:35,913
in some of the gameplay.

80
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,034
And then, of course, and it's funny that we don't think of games

81
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,635
like Deus Ex or other kinds of, like,

82
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,636
highly immersive sims this way,

83
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,377
but it used traditional, kind of, like,

84
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,458
film school 101 shot-reverse-shot stuff

85
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,219
for the conversations.

86
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,960
And, of course, I think we still see this stuff today.

87
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:52,521
And I think that...

88
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,091
The dream of the interactive movie is still with us.

89
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:58,712
I think we're a bit smarter about using a lot of these conventions.

90
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:00,472
But I still think when you say, like,

91
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,233
oh, that game's so cinematic, or this is cinematic,

92
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:05,654
that you run into this, kind of the same set of ideas

93
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,515
that kind of go back to Dragon's Lair

94
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,535
that we're kind of better at implementing now.

95
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:11,716
But it can be much more than that.

96
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,377
So this is a game I worked on.

97
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:15,077
I worked at Harmonix as a music designer.

98
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:18,499
I worked, I was, to my knowledge, I was the...

99
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,811
There were many narrative designers on this project,

100
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:24,752
but I was the one person who was hired exclusively

101
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,432
to do narrative design on the project.

102
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:28,753
And one of my jobs was to try to figure out

103
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:33,674
how to make a lot of the different elements

104
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,575
that were being kicked around at the time come together.

105
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,196
So, you know, why is this interesting to talk about

106
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:40,516
as a cinematic game?

107
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,737
Because it was actually presented...

108
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,158
One of the conceptual notions for the game

109
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,998
is that it was actually being made instead of a third film.

110
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:52,505
There was the first Fantasia in 1940, the second Fantasia in 2000, and then it was kind of like, okay

111
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,147
we're gonna do this game instead of the third film.

112
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:58,090
It's like we're gonna make a game of Return of the Jedi instead of actually release a movie.

113
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,251
So that was kind of the idea.

114
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:05,675
So it was interesting because we had to think about it as a film in some way, as kind of following this legacy.

115
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:10,779
But of course it was also kind of coming off the back of Dance Central and the other games that Harmonix had been making.

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,123
It was a Kinect game. So it was very, had this very like deliberate staging where you had to

117
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:19,364
always be able to see the screen and it was hard, not that we would want to, but even

118
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,125
if you wanted to, it would have been really hard to do something that was more like Heavy

119
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:22,386
Rain.

120
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,006
Of course, because of...

121
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,308
Okay, I think I can skip this because I was just explaining that.

122
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:34,091
So one of the things that we tried to do to draw it all together was to try to find the

123
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:40,514
metaphorical through line between what is going on in the story of this original film,

124
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:43,416
which is kind of a concert film with all these vignettes.

125
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:48,495
that has a conductor kind of putting all this stuff together.

126
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,737
And of course, people who know the film know that there's the Sorcerer's Apprentice vignette

127
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:53,277
in the middle of it.

128
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,138
But one of the things that was kind of clear about it is that, and it's funny, if you actually

129
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,180
watch the film, even though this is kind of never explicitly stated, the film has a whole

130
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,102
lot of people pointing at things and making things happen without touching them.

131
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:12,344
So there's a whole lot of Mickey kind of pointing at stuff, and even the devil, or technically

132
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,125
he's a Slavic god.

133
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,880
When I was a kid, I was like, oh, it's Satan.

134
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,142
So there's quite a lot of this pointing at stuff

135
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:20,922
and making things happen.

136
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:24,325
And this is very much the fantasy of magic.

137
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,126
And so we tried to bring this all together

138
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:30,289
under this central idea of it being like the idea

139
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,832
that in the 1940s, Fantasia already was a Kinect game,

140
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,734
in a way, a Kinect game that was waiting almost a century

141
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:38,935
to be made.

142
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,882
So this is where the cinematic aspect of it comes in.

143
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:46,083
So it's not using cinematic camera angles,

144
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,665
it's not using these kind of traditional elements

145
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,045
that we expect from games like, you know,

146
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:49,986
The Walking Dead or Heavy Rain.

147
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:54,129
But, you know, for us, to some extent,

148
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,771
narrative design was interface design, right?

149
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,492
So it was not about looking at,

150
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:00,413
it was not about just copying cinematic language.

151
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,395
It was about looking for visual elements in the film

152
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:05,477
and not just copying the image,

153
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,998
but trying to figure out what the image meant.

154
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,632
and how that meaning could be transferred to a game

155
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,872
by using the language of games.

156
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:14,393
And of course, if you see on those images on the upper left,

157
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,133
there's the conductor in the original film

158
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,574
and another image on the left of these kind of, like, instruments

159
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,295
from the original film.

160
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:23,036
And on the right, this is like a UI kind of screen

161
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,736
in the actual game where you actually see your silhouette

162
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:27,057
embodied as this...

163
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,797
And people who know Kinect know that that's the animation data

164
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,518
that the game is getting from you.

165
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,179
So that was kind of a very clear take from the film.

166
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,899
And it wasn't about...

167
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,416
copying the visual language, but it was about,

168
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,697
but you can look at it and you can see

169
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,758
there's a very clear reference to a 1940 film.

170
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:43,259
So I can't think of a lot of other games

171
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,901
that use a 1940 film as the kind of reference for their UX.

172
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,804
You know, so this also came into,

173
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,405
this was also kind of like a general idea

174
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,005
that kind of permeated every aspect of the game.

175
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,187
And kind of like ended up building,

176
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:00,768
it ended up making the story,

177
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,989
we ended up finding a story that was kind of trying

178
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,369
to find the intersection of all these things

179
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:04,950
across all these.

180
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,273
different narrative axes. So it became a story about, you know, the music and magic being, all being kind of represented as this

181
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:18,196
ability to control things without touching them. And of course, because it's a music game, being able to control them through music. And

182
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:21,397
you can see this in the film. You can see the film is like a blueprint,

183
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:26,639
not just for how the game looks, but for how the game functions in a really deep way. So

184
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,261
another game I worked on last year was, I don't know, how many people saw this movie, Transcendence?

185
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:32,969
No, almost nobody.

186
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,112
It was a movie starring Johnny Depp

187
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,713
where he gets his brain downloaded into a computer

188
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,574
and Johnny Depp becomes Shodan and that's the movie.

189
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:44,597
And so it was a...

190
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:45,438
We were...

191
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:46,939
So I was working at a...

192
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,541
We were a small team that was hired basically to...

193
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:51,942
With very little money.

194
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:52,263
They were like,

195
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,524
can you make The Walking Dead in two months?

196
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:54,224
We're like, no.

197
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,986
So they're like,

198
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,427
but we want characters and dialogue

199
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,928
and dramatic things happening.

200
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:00,368
We're like, well...

201
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,426
If there's literally no animation, maybe we can do that.

202
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:08,888
So we ended up with, one of the inspirations actually is this,

203
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,789
how many people know this film?

204
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,410
Legite?

205
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,651
So this movie is the origin,

206
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:14,731
and you may even recognize it

207
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,832
if you're familiar with 12 Monkeys,

208
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,813
but this is a film that 12 Monkeys is based on.

209
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,414
But it's a movie without motion,

210
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,315
it's a story without motion.

211
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,435
There's no animation, there's no,

212
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,116
it's just sound and still images.

213
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,157
And this movie always made a big impact

214
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,818
on me and some of the other people making this game.

215
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:34,308
And one of the things that we noticed in the film is that when brain data is downloaded,

216
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:37,449
it appears in the world of the film as still images.

217
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:42,032
So we thought, okay, well this is a mobile game.

218
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:48,455
So you know, if we're looking for something that, you know, can have characters but can't

219
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:53,177
have animation, and we can have sound and we can, and UI art is cheap to make.

220
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:57,113
But how can we build this all together into a central idea?

221
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,154
So we thought that a game where you're

222
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,994
kind of moving these kind of clips,

223
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,415
snippets of somebody's life that kind of manifest

224
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,136
as kind of these still images, we

225
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,116
could make that into something that was like a kind of Instagram

226
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:11,537
app or something that was like a kind of a phone app,

227
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:15,398
phone picture app, that you could put a story together

228
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:16,898
that way, also stories without motion.

229
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,443
One of the cool things about this is that we got to go to LA

230
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,144
and actually shoot all these, we had actors, we had sets,

231
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,084
we had lighting and all this stuff.

232
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,806
We didn't have motion camera, we just had a still camera.

233
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,127
And this was interesting because this actually

234
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:30,487
wasn't narrative design, this was gameplay.

235
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,508
This was essentially, I was directing shots,

236
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:36,570
but it was puzzle design because I had to choose a shot,

237
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,631
I had to choose series of shots that would make sense

238
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:41,512
to be cut together, and in this case,

239
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:43,933
the cutting together was not just about creating the story,

240
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,914
but also about creating like, you know,

241
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:50,790
The design of how like well if it's the same object in all these shots, maybe that's the clue for the player

242
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,292
So there was a lot of puzzle design and we couldn't go back for reshoot

243
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:58,476
So basically we just had to shoot everything we could possibly think of to figure out how to put puzzles together and then just use

244
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:01,858
What we had but it seemed to work out pretty well and then the

245
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,522
Final oops the final game was

246
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:11,768
this game where you can move these little icons around that represent the memories

247
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,568
and you can kind of zoom in on them to look at them

248
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,629
and then when you're done with them you kind of put them together out of order

249
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,309
and then you have to try to figure out what's going on

250
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,970
and it's very much using the gaps of the narrative

251
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,671
as a way to try to get the player emotionally and intellectually engaged in what's going on.

252
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:30,272
Of course, because they really wanted talking in the game and moral choices

253
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,892
we were like, okay, well we can't do The Walking Dead with talking and moral choices

254
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,493
with this shot, reverse shot, 3D characters

255
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,953
but hey, what if the game just all takes place on a tablet?

256
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,747
and you're a graduate student who's using a tablet,

257
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:42,088
and one app on the tablet is the memory shuffling,

258
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,729
and the other app is actually a chat window

259
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,190
with Kate Mara on it talking to you about stuff.

260
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,710
So that's what we did.

261
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,772
And so, you know, the thing I want to emphasize here

262
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:56,073
is that obviously, you know,

263
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:57,754
in some, even in some of the examples,

264
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:58,894
I think especially in the second one,

265
00:11:58,934 --> 00:11:59,694
in the transcendence one,

266
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,415
there was some use of like traditional cinematic language,

267
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:03,776
but the point is that,

268
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:08,695
you don't have to reproduce the language in a particular,

269
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,757
in exactly as it is in the film, right?

270
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,398
It's not about just looking like a film.

271
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:14,819
Obviously, it's about choosing the aspect of a film.

272
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,621
I don't want to say that already fits in

273
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,162
with the existing contours of game design,

274
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,883
because I think we should also use cinema

275
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:23,005
as a way to kind of push us in new directions.

276
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,846
It's not just about, what are the blank spots we have?

277
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,747
And, oh, we can drop this in there, right?

278
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,408
I mean, that sometimes works, but I think that.

279
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:34,315
We would have never come up with the idea of using la jeté as an inspiration for a game

280
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:39,117
if some of these other constraints hadn't been apparent.

281
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,820
So I think in our particular cases, in the case of these particular games,

282
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,802
there was narrative as interface design and narrative as editing

283
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:52,384
as a kind of approach to what it means to make something cinematic

284
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:56,746
or at least inspired by a film.

285
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,639
And I just want to end by saying really quick that, obviously,

286
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,582
I'm not against using what we traditionally

287
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,564
think of more as cinematic language in a game.

288
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:09,386
I mean, I think that some games use it very well.

289
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:13,650
Like the running animation when you're running in Gears of War

290
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,552
is basically just ripped right out of Saving Private Ryan.

291
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:17,734
But it really makes a lot of sense, I think, in that game.

292
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:18,995
And of course, there's other games

293
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,416
where you have these kind of micro cut

294
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,498
scenes that actually don't take you away from the game at all.

295
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:23,459
And I think that's fine.

296
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,039
I mean, I think that one of the problems can happen

297
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:27,519
when we get really obsessed with this,

298
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,100
and it's kind of like, you know, the kind of,

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
you know, the holy grail of this kind of obsession

300
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,501
that kind of goes back to the original, like,

301
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,201
E.T. and Tron game, can get in the way of, you know,

302
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,902
usability and the player being kind of in the world.

303
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,362
Of course, any of you familiar with Heavy Rain?

304
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,003
And I think there's a lot of really good stuff

305
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,423
in Heavy Rain, but the scene where you're kind of in the,

306
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:49,364
it feels like, the scene where you're kind of

307
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,984
in this tunnel, it feels like the challenge is not,

308
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,333
trying to get through the tunnel.

309
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,874
The challenge is trying to get through the tunnel

310
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,735
with a cameraman that is constantly trying to,

311
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,536
you know, show pictures of you.

312
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,619
And I just want to end with this quote that I really

313
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,800
like from this film.

314
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,863
This is from an audio commentary that comes with the film.

315
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:13,745
So this is a shot on the right.

316
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,286
It's from Pleasantville, which is a film about these people

317
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:19,368
who get sucked into, kind of magically sucked

318
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:19,948
into a 1950s TV show.

319
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:25,461
And one of the things that the director says in the commentary is that he defends the kind

320
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:29,744
of fact that beyond being black and white, the film doesn't look at all like a sitcom.

321
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:31,185
It doesn't look at all like a 50s sitcom.

322
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,987
You can see from the lighting here, it's like dramatic.

323
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:37,510
It has this kind of like dramatic camera angles and lighting that are not anything like a

324
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:37,930
sitcom.

325
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:42,874
And he says in the commentary track that we are not in a sitcom, we are in the world of

326
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:43,415
a sitcom.

327
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:50,120
We are using the language of cinema to describe what it feels like to be in the world of a

328
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,520
sitcom.

329
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:52,912
And I can't think of a better way to describe, for me,

330
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,653
what it means to make a cinematic game

331
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:56,093
or to make a game that is inspired

332
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,094
by cinema in some way.

333
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:02,136
For me, it's not about being in a movie.

334
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,737
It's about being in the world of a movie

335
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:07,298
and not necessarily using cinematic language,

336
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,979
but using the language of games, the language of interface,

337
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,940
the language of action to recreate

338
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,022
what it feels like to be inside that cinematic world.

339
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:21,303
And this is just one really final example is is a really good example of something that's not cinematic at all

340
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:27,606
Just the fact in Metal Gear Solid ground zeroes that you can choose to play right of the Valkyries in your helicopter

341
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:36,870
Allows you to replicate the scene from apocalypse now, but it has nothing to do with cutscenes has nothing to do with anything

342
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,492
It's simply a choice of using a particular music track in conjunction with a set of mechanics

343
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:45,094
And I really I think as hopefully as we move forward we can

344
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:48,768
Again, if we use cinematic angles when we feel like it's really necessary,

345
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,531
it fits, that's fine, but I think that we should really not be trapped by that,

346
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:55,455
and we should really find these kind of interesting, organic, and new ways

347
00:15:56,056 --> 00:16:01,282
to really have this more fruitful relationship between games and cinema,

348
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:04,045
where they really help each other and take us into all these new directions.

349
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:04,385
Thank you.
