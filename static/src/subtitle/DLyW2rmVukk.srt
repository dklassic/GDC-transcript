1
00:00:07,864 --> 00:00:08,466
Here we go!

2
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,300
Thank you all for gathering here today.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,766
And since you're here, I imagine that maybe you've played this game, and that makes me very happy.

4
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,529
How many of you attended the Legend of Zelda panel this morning?

5
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,030
That's great.

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,670
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,032
The Zelda team is very happy.

8
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:10,015
Today, I will be sharing the thought process that went into the creation of Super Mario Bros.

9
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:11,035
Wonder.

10
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:17,058
I am also hoping developers across disciplines will become more interested in 2D games in the future.

11
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,054
Hello everyone, my name is Takashi Tezuka, and I was the producer on Super Mario Bros.

12
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:35,475
Wonder.

13
00:01:45,219 --> 00:02:02,617
Since I joined Nintendo in 1984, I have been involved in the production of the first Super Mario Bros., the Legend of Zelda, the God of Triforce, Super Mario Yoshi Island, New Super Mario Bros., and Super Mario Maker.

14
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:02,838
Thank you.

15
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,562
I've been working at Nintendo since 1984.

16
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:13,125
I began work with the company doing graphic design for the original Super Mario Bros.

17
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:15,707
series, as well as the Legend of Zelda series.

18
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:25,432
I've worked on many titles over the years, including The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past, New Super Mario Bros., Yoshi's Island, and Super Mario Maker, among others.

19
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:27,693
I'm excited to speak with you all today.

20
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:29,895
Hello, everyone.

21
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,496
I'm Shiro Mori, the director of Super Mario Bros.

22
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:32,896
Wonder.

23
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:36,472
Hello, everyone.

24
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:47,501
I am Shiro Omori, the director of Super Mario Bros.

25
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,164
Wonder.

26
00:02:52,124 --> 00:03:01,112
After working as the main programmer on 2D Legend of Zelda and 2D Mario titles, I have been working as the director on 2D games featuring Mario, starting with New Super Mario Bros.

27
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,813
U Deluxe and many more.

28
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,595
I look forward to talking with you all today.

29
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,603
Here is today's overview.

30
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:16,464
Up first, Mr. Tezuka will be introducing the appeal of 2D game development and Mr. Tezuka's POV.

31
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,307
Today, I would like to introduce the appeal of developing a 2D game.

32
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:42,010
I'd like to first start with explaining why I thought to touch on this topic.

33
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:11,452
In a media interview last year, I was asked why they decided to release a 2D Mario game a few years ago.

34
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:32,576
During media interviews last year, I was asked, why is now the right time to release the first 2D Mario game in years?

35
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:41,583
I said that we had been busy making other side-scrolling Mario titles, like Super Mario Run and Super Mario Maker, and honestly, 11 years just went by.

36
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,882
It's true.

37
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:56,327
However, I was reminded of the fact that when we go for such a long time without the release of a new 2D game, people may think 3D Mario games have taken their place.

38
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,701
And while it's true that New Super Mario Bros.

39
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:17,164
and Super Mario Odyssey are both action games where you control Mario, the gameplay is not the same.

40
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,240
Each one has its own brand of fun, and I think everyone should enjoy them both.

41
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,262
Do you think that's too much to ask?

42
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:52,472
In many games, 3D expression has been adopted, but when it comes to making games, the methods are very different.

43
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:58,678
Even if the production period is the same for both games, where to put effort is different, and the fun of the creator is different.

44
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:06,895
We're in a time where many games use 3D presentation, but the methods of creating gameplay are quite different.

45
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:23,443
Even if the production time is the same, where we allocate our efforts is different, and so is the enjoyment we experience as creators.

46
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:25,704
What are the differences between these two?

47
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:29,626
Mr. Mori, what do you think, from your perspective as a creator?

48
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm originally a programmer, so I'm coming at this from my experience of creating games from the ground up.

49
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,043
The first three things I create are the player, camera, and map.

50
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,526
This is the same for both 2D and 3D games.

51
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:02,332
In particular, it takes time for the 3D camera to create.

52
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:06,998
In 3D, you need to move the camera so that it doesn't get stuck in obstacles.

53
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,042
In 2D, you don't need to do that, so you can focus on creating the angle of play.

54
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:21,423
Among these three, building the camera for 3D games takes a lot of time.

55
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:26,285
That's because in 3D, you have to be able to move the camera without it getting caught on obstacles.

56
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:31,728
You don't have to worry about that for 2D games, though, so you can focus on what we call the core of play.

57
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,850
That's right.

58
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:41,113
When I first started making 3D games, I remembered that I had studied cameras, which I didn't have to think too much about.

59
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:41,793
One more thing.

60
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,394
How about game design?

61
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:46,407
That's right.

62
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:52,949
I remember studying about cameras when I first started working on 3D games, which was something I rarely had to think about before.

63
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:54,869
So how about game design?

64
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,091
Well, there's not a big difference in how it's done, but the merit of 2D games is that it's easier to experience the game's design as it was intended.

65
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,340
I think so too.

66
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,544
Let's think a little more about 2D games.

67
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,446
I asked the Super Mario Bros.

68
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,787
Wonder staff about the pros of 2D games.

69
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:29,129
Let me share two of the comments I received.

70
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:29,349
First,

71
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,313
Here's the first comment.

72
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:47,118
In 2D games, it's easy to create and present ideas that would in reality be impossible.

73
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:51,120
I have fun thinking of how to incorporate these types of ideas.

74
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,161
This was from a designer.

75
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:11,831
In my opinion, the world of games is all about imitating and exaggerating the real world.

76
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,896
In a realistic 3D space, it is hard to find a way to express a strange feeling.

77
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,939
In a 2D game, it is hard to find a way to express a strange feeling.

78
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:29,578
In my opinion, all game worlds are fabrications that imitate or exaggerate things in the real world.

79
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:37,901
Even those on-screen presentations that might not feel quite right in a 3D environment can feel surprisingly natural in 2D games.

80
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,422
And it's not easy to see when you're cheating.

81
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:03,601
For example, when Mario is mid-jump and you press a directional button in the opposite direction, his jump path changes.

82
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:10,004
In reality, that's not how physics works, but I think it feels very natural for the player.

83
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,256
The next comment is from a level designer.

84
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:30,839
2D games can incorporate the creator's intentions in an easy-to-understand manner.

85
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,803
Compared to 3D, it's easier to rebuild courses.

86
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:36,404
I think so too.

87
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:39,467
I'd like to go into more details about course design.

88
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:51,831
I once had a conversation with Mr. Miyamoto about whether or not anyone can create a 2D game.

89
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:21,460
Of course, you can't say anyone can do it, but if you have easy-to-use course editing tools and the right instincts, then it just might become possible.

90
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:27,727
In the case of 2D Mario, the course design itself has a significant impact on the value of the game.

91
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:33,042
Let's look at Super Mario Maker.

92
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:37,943
We created a system in which players freely design courses and post them.

93
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,244
Other people then download the courses, play them, and rate them.

94
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:57,925
What I want to focus on here is that everyone can use the course parts and enemies as they see fit.

95
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:00,787
So everyone is creating courses under the same conditions.

96
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:26,807
However, when we play the posted courses, and let's keep this here, some of them were not very good.

97
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:43,986
Good player controls, sound, graphics, exciting enemies and game design are all important, but whether they come alive or fall flat is dependent on the level designer.

98
00:12:56,325 --> 00:13:00,986
When allocating development time and cost, it's very important to make course design easy.

99
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:08,168
This is because in 2D Mario games, you spend as much time possible adjusting courses until the end of development.

100
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:35,736
Changing the topic here a little, I'd like to talk about what goes through my mind when creating a Mario game.

101
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:42,359
With the passing of time, the expression of games has evolved, and we can make both pictures and sounds more realistic.

102
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,181
On the other hand, how does the reality of playing games evolve?

103
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,732
The presentation of games has evolved over time, and images and sounds can now be produced to look and sound more real.

104
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,857
But how is realism in gameplay evolving?

105
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,331
For example, does Mario feel pain when he hits an enemy?

106
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,093
I think it's important to feel real in the experience of playing.

107
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:23,515
That's why we've made the expression real.

108
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,778
I don't think we should expect a sense of accomplishment just by making the expression real.

109
00:14:53,628 --> 00:15:03,116
If anything, I think it's important for the gameplay experience to feel real, but I don't think we should seek a sense of accomplishment based only on the realness of the presentation.

110
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:10,042
For example, we should think about whether there are ways to make the gameplay realistic even if the presentation itself is not.

111
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:17,734
Even if expressive character movements and sounds are produced, what's important is how we make use of them.

112
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:25,016
I recommend that art and sound leads, as well as the entire team, share what they were thinking when they were working.

113
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,426
For example, in Mario Wonder, when two walking children bump into each other, an attractive animation is created.

114
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:53,495
However, if you don't notice this animation and level up, you may not be able to see that attractive scene when you notice it.

115
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,878
For example, in Super Mario Bros.

116
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:04,741
Wonder, we created this cute animation for when two Koopa Troopa bump into each other while walking.

117
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:12,927
But if work on course design is done without anyone noticing it, it's possible we might not see this charming interaction happen very often.

118
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:25,715
When we think about level design, we think about what we should do to intentionally create a scene where the Koopa Troopas bump into each other, and the sound person in charge wants to create an SUV that fits that scene.

119
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:37,166
When thinking about course design, it would be ideal to consider how to create scenes where Koopa Troopa collide, so that the sound staff would then want to create the perfect sound effect for that happening.

120
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,469
I think that by influencing each person in charge, the expression will come to life.

121
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,915
If we don't do that, we won't be able to make use of the special effects we've created, and it will be a waste.

122
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,953
In this way, I believe that leads of different disciplines can influence each other's work in ways that infuse courses with life.

123
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:08,696
When teams don't do this, it's hard to make the most of the game spec, and that's what we call mottainai.

124
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:11,437
There's a word in Japanese, mottainai.

125
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:33,788
To put it simply, it means when you aren't able to make the most of something and you feel regret or frustration that it's gone to waste.

126
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,711
Is what you spent so much time creating and development working the way it's supposed to in the game?

127
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,298
For example, in Super Mario Bros.

128
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:55,301
Wonder, we implemented a badge system whereby player abilities could be freely swapped out.

129
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:02,425
This is because we wanted players to enjoy frequently changing their abilities and play the courses again and again using different badges.

130
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:15,145
Once you clear it, you can move on to the next one.

131
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:18,049
It would be a waste if you can't play anymore.

132
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:35,645
Clearing a course once, moving on, and then never coming back to it is an example of something being mottainai.

133
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:46,813
Additionally, players not swapping abilities using the badge system is another example of mottainai, and that's why we implemented a badge swap opportunity whenever a player gets KO'd.

134
00:18:55,776 --> 00:19:03,103
And this wasn't a system implemented from the beginning of development, but rather something that came about while considering the concept of Mottainai.

135
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,045
Our entire team wants to fill Mario games with so many surprises that people are always excited to play.

136
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,747
And for Super Mario Bros.

137
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:30,112
Wonder, we came up with big changes as the way to create those surprises.

138
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:32,976
So why did we make big changes in our mantra?

139
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:54,573
The path we took until arriving at Wonder Effects, the various prototyping, the results of our experiments.

140
00:19:55,274 --> 00:20:01,197
Next up, Mr. Mori will be unraveling all of this while sharing some real examples from Super Mario Bros.

141
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:01,517
Wonder.

142
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:09,321
From here, I will explain how Mori evolved traditional 2D titles and made them available in the current market.

143
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,820
I will take over from here.

144
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,304
I would like to introduce how we evolved a traditional 2D game to be compatible in the current market.

145
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:25,169
First up, new surprises, things we did and didn't adopt with Wonder Effects.

146
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:25,789
Super Mushroom

147
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:51,163
In the first Super Mario Bros., coins came out when you hit blocks, and you grew bigger when you got a Super Mushroom.

148
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,686
Everything about it was new and full of secrets and mysteries.

149
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,233
However, as 2D Mario has been played for many years, at some point all of this has become normal.

150
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:24,376
For that reason, this project began with the goal of creating a 2D Mario game full of new secrets and mysteries.

151
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,993
I think back to the first Super Mario Bros.

152
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:47,295
and the elements that represented secrets and mysteries to me back then.

153
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:56,460
Elements like entering the warp pipe and being able to explore the underground area, or hitting a block, seeing a vine come out, and climbing that vine to an area in the sky.

154
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:15,119
Therefore, in the latest game, I thought about creating a new version of these secrets and mysteries.

155
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,023
And I tried making something where when you hit a block, a special item comes out.

156
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,685
And if you take this item, you can go to another area.

157
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:38,095
When I showed that to Mr. Tezuka, he said, this isn't so different from how it's always been.

158
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:42,137
Can't you make it so instead of going to another area, the environment itself changes?

159
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:49,300
So I thought, well, if I'm going to change the environment anyway, I might as well go hard.

160
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:08,875
So, I made drastic changes that have never been seen in a Super Mario Bros.

161
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:09,196
title.

162
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,657
I made the warp pipes wiggle and the piranha plants break out in song.

163
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,582
And so, this is how the strange changes that happened to the course, the wonder effects for this game, came to be.

164
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:30,365
Here's what the prototype of the wiggling warp pipes looked like.

165
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:43,528
And here's the final version.

166
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:50,370
By the way, the badge I'm wearing on my chest is handmade by my daughter.

167
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,272
By the way, this badge of the warp pipe that I have on me right now was made by my daughter.

168
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:17,898
Thank you.

169
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:26,422
With the evolution of hardware, the scale of game development has increased, and so has the number of developers.

170
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:38,755
As hardware has evolved, the size of development teams has increased in proportion to the scale of game production.

171
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:45,137
And something we didn't focus on during the NES days, which was team management, is now an important job.

172
00:24:56,822 --> 00:25:03,826
Getting lots of people working in the same direction to develop a game with as little waste as possible is without a doubt an important job.

173
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:06,468
However, there is something even more important.

174
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,869
Working with many people means we are also working with many abilities and approaches.

175
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:32,810
So, it's about how can we represent each person's individuality and strengths in production.

176
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,071
And team management should be developed for this purpose.

177
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,819
We are always workshopping team management.

178
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,342
Mr. Mori will talk about how he and his entire team work together to create wonder effects.

179
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:02,686
In order to make it full of secrets and mysteries, you need a lot of types of wonder.

180
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:12,681
Many types of wonder effects are needed to fill a game with secrets and mysteries.

181
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,826
We therefore held brainstorming sessions where the whole team shared their ideas for wonder effects.

182
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:32,319
It was up to everyone on the team to come up with ideas, regardless of job title or seniority.

183
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,460
Nintendo believes that everyone on the team is a game designer.

184
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,962
At first, we asked everyone to write any and all ideas on sticky notes, without any conditions.

185
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:44,663
After all, if you start with conditions, you stifle creative freedom.

186
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:07,060
At this stage, we collected around 2,000 ideas.

187
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:18,492
As we looked at the various ideas that came up, we were able to gradually narrow down what criteria made up good wonder effects.

188
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,754
Among these ideas, the ones we liked had a connection between pre-Wonder Effect and during Wonder Effect.

189
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,983
For example, if the player were to suddenly transform into Balloon Mario due to a wonder effect, that would feel unnatural.

190
00:27:51,604 --> 00:28:00,369
However, by having balloon-esque enemies appear first, then having the player transform into Balloon Mario due to a wonder effect, the feeling of unnaturalness is removed.

191
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:25,931
Other features that we pinned as good wonder effects were having players suddenly be able to do something that they couldn't before, and having effects that could be explained simply in one short phrase.

192
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:30,255
With these figured out, we started to try out different ideas that met these criteria.

193
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,184
This testing phase was also conducted by everyone on the team.

194
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:45,186
Each testing team was comprised of one game designer, one artist, one programmer, and one sound engineer.

195
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,203
When necessary, we created new temporary design data and sound data.

196
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:22,176
Once the testing phase was over, all team members would play the prototype, then share their opinions.

197
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:29,322
In response to these opinions, team members would share and layer even more ideas, and this eventually led to the product version taking shape.

198
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:44,348
More than half of the prototypes did not make it to the final product, but these testing sessions had many effects, such as everyone gained development experience, everyone's motivation increased, and the team solidarity improved.

199
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:11,815
And more importantly than this, coming up with prototypes is just fun.

200
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:16,537
I will introduce two of the wonder effects that were adopted after the wonder effect testing sessions.

201
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:19,859
The first one is the wonder effect, the terrain tilts.

202
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,962
Here's a video of when this idea was prototyped.

203
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,632
And this prototype ultimately became this in the final version.

204
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:23,525
Here is the second wonder effect we adopted.

205
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:28,049
This is an idea that came from a programmer in his first year at the company.

206
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:34,974
At Nintendo, even first-year employees and programmers pitch in ideas, and if those ideas are good, of course they're adopted.

207
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:54,835
All he did is write, a wonder quiz starts, on a sticky note, without any other specific info.

208
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:57,556
Do you think we can call this a good idea?

209
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:21,505
When I saw this, I thought to myself, this idea has potential.

210
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:54,421
What I saw was the opportunity to create a unique wonder effect where Mario takes action to answer questions, a way to supplement the worldview of the game, and motivation for players to play multiple times to see all the questions.

211
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,262
Here's what the final product looks like.

212
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:06,888
When I first heard about this idea, I wondered, and it's kind of out of the blue, is this really okay?

213
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:39,369
The note, A Wonder Quiz Starts, was more the start of an idea than a full-fledged idea, and we expanded on what the people who saw it came up with until we landed on the final implementation.

214
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:42,730
I don't think this is an idea that I would have ever come up with.

215
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:55,470
And I believe this is what's interesting about creating play with other people.

216
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:04,154
Next, I will introduce two wonder effects that we did not adopt.

217
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,456
The first one is an idea from our sound director, Mr. Kondo.

218
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:36,337
His idea was, when a wonder effect activates, a live-action version of Mario with human proportions appears, starts progressing through the stage while humming the background music, and mimicking the various sound effects himself.

219
00:34:42,036 --> 00:35:01,808
As an idea, it's very funny, but it's hard to see the connection between pre-Wonder Effect and during Wonder Effect, and it's hard to imagine the gameplay changing much by having Mario turn into a live-action human-proportioned version of himself.

220
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:17,796
There were a lot of ideas like this that didn't meet the criteria of what constitutes a viable wonder effect, and they were all closely examined as we figured out our approach.

221
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:41,173
While we couldn't use Mr. Kondo's idea as a wonder effect, we thought it could instead be used as a badge, a system where players can select their own special powers.

222
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:45,336
It was such an interesting idea, it would have been motainai to not use it.

223
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:49,180
And so, the Sound Off badge came to be.

224
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,501
Here's how it ended up in the final version.

225
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:02,568
I'm wearing it!

226
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:21,216
This badge makes you want to hear a lot of different voices, so I think it's good that you want to try a lot of different actions.

227
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,300
I think that the appeal of this badge is that it makes you want to try out various actions in order to hear all the sound effects.

228
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:56,343
Incidentally, the man behind the voice of the SoundOff badge is Mr. Kondo himself, the one who pitched this idea.

229
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:20,637
Here's the second example of a wonder effect that was not adopted.

230
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,880
There is an enemy called Nosher that eats blocks.

231
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,142
So the idea for this wonder effect was to transform yourself into a giant block Mario and advance while preventing your blocks from getting eaten.

232
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:47,305
We felt like it had a very strong and interesting visual appeal, so we tried prototyping it.

233
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:48,126
Here's a video from that time.

234
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:26,984
Although we did prototype it, this was ultimately not adopted as a wonder effect.

235
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:36,587
This is because the area of the blocks was large, and it was impossible to develop a strategy of how to avoid enemies, so it just turned into a game of making a mad dash for the end.

236
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:57,226
However, reducing the area of the blocks would have resulted in losing that visual appeal, so we decided to not use it.

237
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:02,089
We weren't planning to include wonder effects from the beginning.

238
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:06,632
Rather, it was created by considering and solving issues faced by 2D Mario games.

239
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:29,555
At first, there were no rules on what constituted a good wonder effect versus a not-so-good wonder effect.

240
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:36,720
Nobody knows what the new elements are going to be at the beginning of development.

241
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:40,544
I believe that the answer to this question is uncovered together as a team.

242
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:51,887
What makes development of a game like this so fun is the fact that we're creating something that nobody holds the answer to.

243
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:56,872
Now, let's take a quick look at the design of past Mario titles.

244
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,500
The original Super Mario Bros.

245
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:13,404
game was simply focused on clearing various courses, and if players didn't clear the castle course that appeared every four courses, it would be game over and they'd have to start over from the beginning.

246
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:32,345
We didn't have a system to save the game, so it wasn't a big deal for the players.

247
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:35,070
But by playing the same course over and over again, it was fun to gradually improve.

248
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:52,909
This is back when you couldn't save your play data, so there was no way around it.

249
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:05,715
However, playing the same course over and over and the joy of gradually improving combined with the tension these challenges brought contributed to a greater feeling of accomplishment when you finally cleared a difficult course.

250
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:12,038
This gameplay loop was a new system that utilized a similar flow seen in arcade games of the past.

251
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:41,670
After that, on Super Mario Bros.

252
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:49,453
3, we implemented a map system similar to that found in board games, and added new elements that weren't just about clearing courses.

253
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:55,936
Even so, we've always valued having easy-to-understand courses, where the course design is a straight road.

254
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:59,438
But the tastes of players have also changed over the years.

255
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:13,793
So what challenges exist for Mario now, and how did they affect our approach for Super Mario Bros.

256
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,133
Wonder?

257
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:16,575
Let's have Mr. Mori speak on this.

258
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:25,442
Okay, I'd like to talk about gameplay strategies and player choice.

259
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,994
Another challenge for 2D Mario games that came to mind was limited player choice.

260
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:59,928
Past 2D Mario games had a minimum number of branches on the world map, but options such as being able to choose a course from multiple courses or being able to skip courses you couldn't clear did not exist.

261
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:14,174
Also, there were various power-up transformations, such as Fire Mario, Raccoon Mario, and Cape Mario, but since they were tied to the course, as in, you could only use a specific transformation on a specific course, players were not able to choose their preferred power-up.

262
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:45,147
In order to resolve the issue of limited player choice, we created an area where players can freely explore the world map and progress in the game while selecting the courses they want to play.

263
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:51,451
We created an area where players can freely explore the world map and progress in the game while selecting the courses they want to play.

264
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:15,255
Because the player can move freely, they can look at the thumbnail of a course and play what catches their interest, start with courses with lower difficulty, or play the easier break time courses.

265
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:23,981
It is also possible for players to skip the courses that they don't enjoy playing and progress in the game.

266
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:37,439
We first decided on a structure where if you collect a certain number of wonder seeds, the key item, you can progress in the game.

267
00:44:50,202 --> 00:44:52,103
Wonder Seeds can be obtained in various ways.

268
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:57,646
Clearing courses, clearing Wonder Effects in courses, or buying them at poplin shops, and so on.

269
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:01,228
I believe this leads to an increased level of freedom in gameplay strategies.

270
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,232
Badges are a system that allows players to add abilities of their choice.

271
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:14,915
Here, I will be introducing some of these badges.

272
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:17,036
Impressive!

273
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:29,734
These are some of the things we adopted to address the challenge of limited player choice.

274
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:34,696
I think it's better to have an image of how you want to play when you think about playing.

275
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:36,477
For example, what do you imagine when you play Mario with your family?

276
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:04,280
When thinking of gameplay, I think it's a good idea to have an image of how you want players to play.

277
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,763
For example, what scene do you picture for a family playing a Mario game?

278
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:12,586
How about when someone's playing with someone they don't know over the internet?

279
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:16,889
What kind of gameplay did you imagine, Mr. Mori?

280
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:24,649
When I played with my family, I imagined everyone smiling with unexpected wonders.

281
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:27,933
Also, when I played with someone I didn't know online, I wanted to say thank you.

282
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:43,024
I imagined a family playing local co-op together, and an unexpected wonder effect happening, and everyone laughing about it.

283
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:50,167
And for online play, when playing with a stranger, I really wanted to create gameplay that would naturally make you want to say thank you to the stranger.

284
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:51,787
That's sweet.

285
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:59,310
I'd like to hear from the programmer and game designer, Mr. Mori, what he thinks about online play in Super Mario.

286
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:08,745
So what should online play look like for a Super Mario title?

287
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:12,606
I'd like to hear what you have to say as a programmer and game designer.

288
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:16,027
Okay, let me talk about online play.

289
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:37,559
From the beginning of development, in order to help 2D Mario games evolve, one of the topics we wanted to address was making a Mario game that can be played and enjoyed online.

290
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,843
However, while playing online with people from all over the world is very fun, I think there are a few challenges.

291
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:10,785
For example, when it comes to competitive games, beginners may lose a lot and quit.

292
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:18,949
If it's a cooperative game, less experienced players may slow the game down, and there is always the risk of people with poor online etiquette causing trouble.

293
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:28,047
These issues have been mentioned before, even within Nintendo.

294
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:55,706
In fact, Mr. Iwata has said the following, We've been discussing things for a long time, such as how parents can safely give online play to their children, and how to create a world without harassment.

295
00:48:56,887 --> 00:49:03,392
There are many ways to solve this problem, but in Mario Wonder, other players don't directly interfere with you.

296
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:08,076
They help you when you make a mistake, give you items, and only do good things for you.

297
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:16,554
While there are many ways to overcome this challenge, for Super Mario Bros.

298
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:27,102
Wonder, instead of making it so other players can directly affect your environment, we made it so they can only take actions that would benefit you, such as reviving you when you get KO'd or by sharing their items with you.

299
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:29,084
Here is a video illustrating this.

300
00:49:48,816 --> 00:50:00,143
Other players have been implemented in the form of translucent live player shadows to make it clear that they cannot break blocks, defeat enemies, etc.

301
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:27,772
However, there were challenges with the live player shadows.

302
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:32,314
There was no guarantee that there would be players near you on the same course at any given time.

303
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:38,455
To solve this problem, we made it possible for players to play standees of themselves on courses.

304
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:56,864
For these standees, we made the specs so that players cannot revive themselves with standees they place themselves.

305
00:50:58,385 --> 00:51:03,487
Therefore, standees are placed not for your own benefit, but rather to help other players.

306
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:15,264
You can also play standees to tell other players about hidden elements.

307
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,988
Many people are involved in game production and online play.

308
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:47,954
When people interact with one another, we believe that acting not for yourself but for the people around you is important.

309
00:51:48,735 --> 00:51:50,857
We help people around us when they are in trouble.

310
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:56,602
When you have a team made up of people with that mindset, there is a good chance something good will come out of it.

311
00:52:07,443 --> 00:52:09,165
This holds true in game development as well.

312
00:52:11,387 --> 00:52:12,127
For Super Mario Bros.

313
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:18,993
Wonder, we wanted to create a kind world like that, where online play is where you act not for yourself, but for the people around you.

314
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:43,680
We've been discussing things such as how can parents safely give online play to their children, how can we create a world without harassment, and we think that online play this time has become one of the answers.

315
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:01,359
During the development of online play for Super Mario Bros.

316
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:05,460
Wonder, we settled on the theme of subtle connection.

317
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:13,121
I believe this is one of the answers to the question, what should online play look like for a game featuring Mario?

318
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,802
Now, there may be some people who think there's a secret method behind game creation at Nintendo.

319
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:40,544
But the truth is, there is no definitive way to make games.

320
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,727
Each project has different set of priorities, and it's really up to you.

321
00:53:58,049 --> 00:53:59,410
In the case of Super Mario Bros.

322
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,351
Wonder, our method was the one Mr. Mori shared today.

323
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:11,875
Our approach was to create and test various ideas for wonder effects and other seeds of gameplay, while also thinking about the best way to implement them.

324
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:31,831
While we hadn't decided on anything when development first started, we did hit a point where we felt like we had enough ingredients and therefore were ready to start cooking.

325
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,121
Essentially, we were creating while running.

326
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:55,204
But to be honest, I think we were running while also carrying feelings of uncertainty.

327
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:06,712
However, while we were running, while we were trying out various ideas, a unique character was born.

328
00:55:26,706 --> 00:55:27,706
In Super Mario Bros.

329
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:30,907
Wonder, we introduced this unique character, the Talking Flower.

330
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:34,487
These Talking Flowers are the only characters that are fully voiced.

331
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:47,552
We use a variety of effects, graphics, and sounds to increase the player's immersion in games.

332
00:55:55,318 --> 00:56:02,284
In previous Mario games, we included a clapping sound effect that triggers when you collect all the coins in a specified area.

333
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:21,203
The fanfare that sounds when players reach a goal was implemented because we knew players wanted to be praised for their gameplay.

334
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:27,670
But I thought players would feel even more immersed in games if that praise came more often, even for smaller accomplishments.

335
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:34,641
The results of these thoughts was the talking flower.

336
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:42,547
The character's number one goal is to give out praise or sympathy to increase player motivation and make play more rewarding.

337
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:09,407
In other words, they were created to aid in gameplay, like other effects.

338
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:16,910
I believe that the talking flowers helped contribute to increasing player motivation and making the play feel more real.

339
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:29,235
Now, I know there's a lot more we want to talk about, but I guess I should address the future of 2D games.

340
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:37,237
Before I do that, however, can I ask you for your final remarks, Mr. Mori?

341
00:57:38,717 --> 00:57:39,657
Super Mario Bros.

342
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:41,058
will be 40 years old next year.

343
00:57:41,078 --> 00:57:44,939
It may be difficult for the series to evolve for a long time.

344
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:54,799
However, not only in Mario, but also in other games, each title has its own challenges, and by solving them, new games will be created.

345
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,743
By doing so, 2D games will continue to evolve.

346
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:05,018
Super Mario Brothers turns 40 next year.

347
00:58:05,779 --> 00:58:08,681
You might think it's difficult to make such a long-running series evolve.

348
00:58:09,382 --> 00:58:14,427
However, new play is created by facing and solving the challenges that come with 2D titles.

349
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,010
This, of course, is not limited to Super Mario Brothers titles.

350
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,714
By doing this, I believe 2D games will continue to evolve into the future.

351
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:24,516
Thank you, Mr. Mori.

352
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:35,754
We noted that there are many ways to create games, but the first thing we think deeply about is what will become the core of the game.

353
00:58:53,506 --> 00:59:01,652
I get very worried about production if I can't imagine what's going to be the fun of the game before we start polishing the graphics, sounds, and on-screen presentation.

354
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:20,257
If we proceed without that understanding, I don't think anything becomes more interesting as we move forward.

355
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:26,279
This is why I think it's good to put a considerable amount of effort into finding the core of the game.

356
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:33,501
Considering the angle of the game and its gameplay, it is easy to verify 2D games from various perspectives.

357
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:47,311
In addition to thinking about the core of the game and gameplay, we also need to verify they work.

358
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,072
And for various reasons, that's easy to do with 2D games.

359
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:56,755
2D games have a simple structure which makes it easier to focus on creating gameplay.

360
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:22,508
I don't mean to imply that the time and effort ultimately required to create a game is different between 2D and 3D.

361
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:30,673
Both take about the same amount of time, but in the case of 2D Mario, it's easier to make adjustments to courses and add new elements through the end of development.

362
01:00:31,872 --> 01:00:42,901
As Mr. Mori noted, while we move forward taking on the challenges inherent in this franchise, a variety of new technologies will be created, blended with traditional 2D presentation, and perhaps, gameplay itself will change.

363
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:06,086
Did today's presentation pique your interest in 2D game development?

364
01:01:08,146 --> 01:01:08,566
Thank you.

365
01:01:08,586 --> 01:01:17,870
If you remember Mario Wonder and want to play it again,

366
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:29,341
If you heard what we had to say, were reminded of Super Mario Bros.

367
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:33,586
Wonder, and felt inspired to play it again, well, I could go home happy.

368
01:01:54,387 --> 01:01:57,410
Mr. Mori talked about how 2D games will continue to evolve.

369
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,793
Perhaps I'm the one most looking forward to that future.

370
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:09,902
Maybe somebody in this audience will create a new 2D game, and of course, we hope to continue creating new ways to play in the years to come.

371
01:02:11,804 --> 01:02:14,668
And let me say one last thing.

372
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,714
Thinking about gameplay is super fun.

373
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:39,965
I'd like to express my appreciation to all the people involved in the development of Super Mario Bros.

374
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,906
Wonder and everyone who supported our presentation today.

375
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:47,667
And of course, I'd like to thank all of you for listening to the end.

376
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:47,907
Thank you.
