Hey there, my name is Jason Grimblatt and I'm co-creator of a game called Caves of

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:07,184
Qud that's currently in Early Access.

3
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:12,507
Caves of Qud is an open-world, science-fantasy, roguelike epic where you chisel through a

4
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,989
layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,572
Last year at GDC, I talked about procedurally generating in-game books.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,655
This year, I'll be talking about generating whole in-game histories.

7
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:30,109
When you start a new game of Caves of Qud, a new history is generated as part of the world creation process.

8
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:37,172
Important places and artifacts that come out of the history are instantiated in the game world and placed on the world map.

9
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:45,255
Then, as you explore the world, you learn about the history bit by bit, by visiting historic sites, by talking to NPCs,

10
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:51,038
and by examining cultural artifacts like shrines, paintings, and engraved items, such as this dagger.

11
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:56,915
I plan to talk about how we took something as dauntingly complex as history and proceduralized

12
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:01,579
it in a way that jives with our design principles and the handwritten lore we'd already developed

13
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:02,139
for the game.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,184
I'll use examples from two other games that generate history, Dwarf Fortress and Epitaph,

15
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:12,168
to define some patterns I see emerging in this blossoming subfield of procedural generation.

16
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:17,152
Finally, I'll point to some resources that'll help you procedurally generate histories in

17
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:17,933
your own games.

18
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:19,394
I hope to see you there!
