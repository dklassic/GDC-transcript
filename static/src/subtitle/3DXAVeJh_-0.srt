1
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,258
Thank you.

2
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:33,389
This is a great opportunity for those of us who already do this full-time to also branch

3
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:36,230
out into consulting, freelance work.

4
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,031
I've been doing exactly that for the last few years.

5
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:44,453
And in the next 20 or so minutes, I'm going to kind of share with you some of the mistakes

6
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,554
I made, some of the pitfalls I found.

7
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:50,415
So maybe if you're interested in this as well, you can avoid those.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,283
Who am I? I am the senior tech artist at StrayKite Studios.

9
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:58,345
I've been in the industry for about eight years now.

10
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:02,328
I've worked on things like those.

11
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,150
But more pertinent to this talk,

12
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,451
back at the tail end of 2019,

13
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:10,414
I started freelancing and consulting as Technically Games.

14
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:14,938
And in that time, I have worked on things like that.

15
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,019
But I'll get to that later.

16
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,733
So why would you even want to do this, right?

17
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,914
You're already doing it full-time during the day.

18
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,895
Why would you also want to fill your free time with tech art?

19
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,415
Well, for me, there's three main reasons.

20
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:31,377
One, like I said, the demand is absolutely booming right now.

21
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:35,038
In prep for this talk, I checked the job pages of EA, Ubisoft,

22
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,278
and Activision.

23
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:39,820
And between those three, there are

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,141
over 400 open tech art or tech art-related positions.

25
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,122
And if you've been in any sort of position

26
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,744
to hire a tech artist lately, you've

27
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:50,585
probably seen this shortage firsthand.

28
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,567
Two, it can be really lucrative.

29
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,129
Tech art is obviously a technical skill,

30
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,810
and you can charge like it.

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,712
Now, when you're doing this part time, like I'm doing,

32
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:03,393
you're probably not going to retire to the Caribbean.

33
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:05,775
You're probably not going to buy a yacht.

34
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:09,277
But you might be able to buy a car, or go on a vacation,

35
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,418
pay off some student loans.

36
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,525
And three, it can just be plain fun.

37
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,787
You get to work with people you would never be able to.

38
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:19,089
You get to work on really cool projects.

39
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,651
You get to expand your skill set into areas

40
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,613
that maybe your day job would never have you see.

41
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:28,896
So let me show you some of my numbers

42
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:32,939
so you kind of get a sense of what I'm talking about.

43
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,401
When I started this back at the tail end of 2019,

44
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:39,624
I had one contract that just kind of fell into my lap,

45
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:40,484
made a little over $500.

46
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:44,676
But it kind of broke me out of a creative rut, right?

47
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:48,501
I did a cool thing, it was fun.

48
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,123
I decided, hey, if something comes along,

49
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,685
I'll probably keep doing this.

50
00:02:53,887 --> 00:03:03,015
Then 2022 came along and I went from commuting for an hour and a half every day to sitting in my office for 16 hours a day.

51
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:14,444
A few other contracts came along to at the beginning of the year, one at the end of the year, and made a little over three thousand dollars with that last contract, especially.

52
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:21,271
I really found that I was kind of getting into it. I really started to enjoy myself. I incorporated

53
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:26,576
as Technically Games and I decided that in 2021 I really wanted to hit the ground running.

54
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:33,055
Last year I took on 15 contracts between January and September,

55
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:34,316
made a little over $20,000.

56
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:37,218
I really started to get the hang of it.

57
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,700
I really started to learn how to work with clients.

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,043
I started to learn what I like to do, what I don't like to do,

59
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:46,705
how to find contracts, all of that kind of stuff.

60
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:50,248
I got really burnt out at the end of the year.

61
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:52,229
And I'll go over that later.

62
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,410
I actually took October through December completely off.

63
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,550
It was not great.

64
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,971
And like I said, because I'm only doing this part time,

65
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,912
it's not, I mean, I'm not going to retire off of that.

66
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,732
I'm not going to quit my day job.

67
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,332
But it did help me pay down some student loans

68
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:11,913
and for a down payment on a house.

69
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:18,091
So you're sitting there and you're like, okay, this sounds interesting, when do I start?

70
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,894
There's a first, a few things you really need to do before you start.

71
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:27,337
Number one, always check your non-compete with your employer.

72
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:33,001
A lot of studios and publishers don't allow moonlighting whatsoever.

73
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:36,923
Always check your employer agreement for this kind of stuff.

74
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:43,916
If you have any doubts about whether or not you can do this kind of stuff,

75
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,097
always talk to your lead or always talk to HR.

76
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:52,861
I've found that these employee agreements for the moonlighting clauses are always really vague and broad.

77
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:58,464
They say things like you can't compete with our business interests, but what does that really mean?

78
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,527
Does that mean you can't work on video games? You can't work in specific genres?

79
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,749
to specific demographics.

80
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,491
And if you work at a place like, say, EA,

81
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,854
who makes games for everybody in every genre

82
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,236
for every demographic, that can be really limiting.

83
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,038
So you really want to make sure.

84
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,820
The last thing you want to do, though, is be sneaky.

85
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,162
Don't try to find the gray areas.

86
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:23,923
Don't try to find where you can kind of slip

87
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,404
in between the cracks.

88
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:27,346
That can really put you in legal trouble,

89
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:30,548
but it can also really put your clients in legal trouble.

90
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:33,030
Think kind of John Carmack with Oculus, right?

91
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:38,774
And if you are looking at a new place of employment,

92
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:42,238
always include this in your negotiations.

93
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,039
Some places will be really strict

94
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,721
about their non-compete.

95
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,405
Some places you might be able to redline the non-compete

96
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,887
or better yet, go to a place that doesn't have one

97
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,128
in the first place.

98
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,813
So once you have that out of the way,

99
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,474
you know you can do this stuff,

100
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:01,237
you really need to lay some groundwork first.

101
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,118
The very first thing you need to do,

102
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,780
the very first thing I wish I would have done

103
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,061
is to form an LLC.

104
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:11,145
An LLC basically is just a corporate entity

105
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:16,069
that you work under that protects your private assets.

106
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,111
So if somebody decides to sue you,

107
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,712
they have to sue your business.

108
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,493
They don't sue you personally.

109
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:24,215
If they want to get to your money, your assets,

110
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,616
they have to go after the company's assets.

111
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:28,798
They can't go after your personal stuff.

112
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,379
Really important.

113
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,760
You're going to want to make a separate bank account.

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,102
You do not want your invoices from your clients

115
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:39,424
going where your W-2 income comes from.

116
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,566
That just muddies the water.

117
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,128
It can really introduce doubt if somebody decides to sue you.

118
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,229
So you really want to keep these things separate.

119
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,530
Additionally, that really helps with taxes,

120
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,531
makes taxes a lot easier when everything is in one place.

121
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,372
It really helps with expenses as well.

122
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,713
You know that basically everything that's coming out of

123
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:00,753
the account is probably an expense

124
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,214
because you need to get an accountant.

125
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,555
An accountant will help you with expenses.

126
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:09,056
I really wish I would have done this sooner.

127
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,756
I only did it about six months ago.

128
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,094
Tech art is already pretty stressful.

129
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,735
It's a really big subject.

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,796
You don't want to compound that by also

131
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,517
having to learn tax law.

132
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,258
And in the US, there's this thing

133
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:24,260
called estimated quarterly taxes.

134
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,861
And it doesn't make any sense.

135
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,806
So please hire somebody to do this for you whose job it

136
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,228
is to do this for you.

137
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:36,653
It's money well spent, I promise you.

138
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:39,298
You're also really going to want to figure out your payment

139
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,501
processing sooner rather than later.

140
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,012
This is kind of a really big subject, but for me,

141
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,353
I never accept PayPal anymore.

142
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,973
They're kind of shady, right?

143
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,894
And I also don't accept credit card payments anymore.

144
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:57,876
Basically, all of the payment processing websites

145
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:02,497
or whomever out there, they will charge a 3% to 5% fee

146
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:03,778
on all credit card transactions.

147
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,299
So when your contracts are a little smaller,

148
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,340
maybe that's not much.

149
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,361
But once your contracts get to a certain size, that's...

150
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:19,704
a car payment, right? So now I only take ECH or wire transfers. Usually there is also a

151
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:24,827
fee on this as well, but they're almost always capped at something like $5, so it's much

152
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:31,330
more manageable. Um, okay, so we have all the boring stuff out of the way. Now there's a

153
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,051
little bit less boring stuff, but still kind of boring stuff.

154
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:39,299
You want to make a list of things that you actually want to do.

155
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,440
Get it out on paper. Prioritize the list.

156
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,582
Do you want to do rigging? Do you want to do tools?

157
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,744
Do you want to do shader work?

158
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:49,807
Get it out on a list so you can see it whenever you're talking to a client.

159
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,668
And probably more importantly,

160
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,170
make a list of things you absolutely don't want to do.

161
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,831
Because when a client comes to you,

162
00:08:56,292 --> 00:09:01,275
and they're waving a big paycheck in your face with something you don't want to do, you want

163
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:05,758
to have that list in front of you to remind you why you don't want to do it. For instance, I

164
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:10,821
don't do any contracts that involve unity anymore and I don't do shaders. I did a contract

165
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:16,224
that involved shaders, I'll kind of talk about that later. It wasn't good. I'm terrible at it,

166
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,965
I don't really enjoy it, it was bad.

167
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:26,095
Unfortunately, I think social media is kind of required, at least to start with.

168
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:30,541
Probably half of my clients have come from just seeing random Twitter posts.

169
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,686
It's unfortunate, but I feel like it's kind of necessary.

170
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:43,935
Design an invoice, make it professional, make it easy to read, and if you can, design a

171
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,817
logo or better yet, hire somebody to design a logo for you.

172
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:53,918
And going back to those expenses, logos are expensible, which is very nice.

173
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:58,769
Um, when you first start out, you really want to brush up your portfolio when you're real,

174
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:04,752
especially, I've found, as the more junior you are, you really want to have a rock solid

175
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:10,175
real. This gets a lot less important as time goes on, once your kind of word of mouth

176
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:14,297
starts to grow with your clients and among their networks. You don't have to pay so much

177
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:17,799
attention to this, but you know, it's probably always good to have. Okay, so all that's out of

178
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,922
the way, you're ready to do the thing. Before you start the thing.

179
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:28,058
Always charge for art tests.

180
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,940
I know this is a very controversial subject

181
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,541
for some people.

182
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,344
I think we should just do it as an industry.

183
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,846
If you're asking somebody to spend their time,

184
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,449
you should compensate them for it.

185
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,971
But especially more so in this case.

186
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,933
Remember that you are not a candidate for a job,

187
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,974
you are a company.

188
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,618
They are one of your clients, a potential client.

189
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,743
If they need you to do an art test,

190
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,266
you should charge them for it.

191
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,491
I usually charge a flat fee to make it a lot easier on everybody.

192
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,654
But still, you should do this.

193
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,152
And be really discerning about your clients.

194
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,294
Do your homework.

195
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,675
Check Glassdoor.

196
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:08,737
That can be a really good option.

197
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:11,480
Talk to people who currently work there that you trust.

198
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,622
Talk to people who don't work there anymore.

199
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,023
See why they left.

200
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,225
All that kind of stuff.

201
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,008
The way a company treats their internal employees

202
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,331
will be magnified with how they treat

203
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,852
their external contractors.

204
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,962
Bad clients are always worse than no clients.

205
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,822
Remember, you're doing this in your free time,

206
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,683
and yes, this is still a job,

207
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:33,864
it's not always gonna be awesome,

208
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:36,144
but you don't wanna compound that

209
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,765
by working with bad people.

210
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:42,806
So setting your rates could probably be a talk

211
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:46,908
all in and of itself, but just a few tips for doing this.

212
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:49,602
Charge like an engineer.

213
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,782
We were actually just talking about this at lunch.

214
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:56,103
Tech artists, a lot of times, kind of pigeonhole themselves

215
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:59,324
into, well, I'm just an artist, right?

216
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:02,025
No, you're doing a highly technical job.

217
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,725
You should charge like an engineer.

218
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,466
So my tip, whenever you're first starting

219
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,606
to get your rate in line, just add 50% to it.

220
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:13,167
Doesn't matter what it is, just add 50%.

221
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,948
If a client can't pay it, they'll tell you.

222
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,688
But a lot of clients will do it.

223
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:21,009
Your rate also doesn't need to be static.

224
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,630
You don't have to set a rate and then that's your rate

225
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,830
for the rest of the year or whatever.

226
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,351
You can probably charge a bigger studio or a publisher

227
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,012
your full rate because they can afford it.

228
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,352
But if you're working with some little indie outfit,

229
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,593
maybe a solo dev working on a passion project,

230
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,334
you know, don't undercut yourself,

231
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,474
but still be cognizant of their resources.

232
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,435
Set your rate accordingly.

233
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:50,559
There's three main variables I take into account whenever I'm setting my rate for a particular contract.

234
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,502
One, the enjoyment of the job, how much do I think I'm actually going to enjoy doing it?

235
00:12:55,502 --> 00:13:01,285
Two, the time frame in which they need it done. Do they need it done in a month? Do they need it done in a week?

236
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:05,548
That's really important. And three, again, the client resources.

237
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:11,052
Is it some person in their basement or is it, you know, a multinational corporation?

238
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,885
But for me, what I always do,

239
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,768
I always prioritize enjoyment over the other two.

240
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:21,350
Again, you're doing this in your free time.

241
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,292
You wanna enjoy yourself.

242
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:26,235
If you have a bad client who's gonna pay you a lot of money

243
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:28,677
or a good client who's probably not gonna pay you

244
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:32,000
as much money, for me, I will always choose the latter

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,361
every single day of the week.

246
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:37,303
Life is way too short not to enjoy yourself.

247
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:41,049
And let's all be honest, we're in like 2020 part three, right?

248
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:45,556
You need to enjoy yourself, especially in your free time,

249
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,658
even if you're doing work.

250
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,567
Get to know your client in the kickoff.

251
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,129
You'll probably usually have a Discord meeting

252
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,571
or a Zoom meeting or something like that.

253
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:57,972
Just get to know who they are.

254
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:01,055
You don't have to be friends with them necessarily,

255
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:02,917
but you wanna know their idiosyncrasies.

256
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,958
Are they gregarious?

257
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,220
Are they a straight shooter?

258
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,081
All of that kind of stuff will really help you

259
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,583
when you're talking to them throughout the contract.

260
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,246
This isn't always applicable though.

261
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:16,472
If you're just working with like the outsource manager,

262
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,297
that's probably just gonna be a bunch of cold emails

263
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:20,560
back and forth.

264
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,842
Don't sweat it, it's not a big deal.

265
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,748
So I've only been doing this for a while,

266
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,029
that's why the question mark is there,

267
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,114
because these best practices are probably gonna change

268
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:33,335
as I keep doing this.

269
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:35,738
I do not have the definitive answers

270
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:37,000
of how best to do this.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,342
I still make a lot of mistakes,

272
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,324
but these are some of the things that have really helped me.

273
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,183
You wanna really stretch yourself, right?

274
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,004
Tech art is huge.

275
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,006
If you ask 10 different tech artists what tech art is,

276
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:52,010
nine of them will give you a different answer,

277
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,373
and then that one guy is gonna try

278
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,435
to convert you to Blender.

279
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,898
Don't be that one guy.

280
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,005
You really want to stretch your abilities

281
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,288
and open up your wheelhouse.

282
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:05,729
Your day job is probably going to see you

283
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,392
do a certain set of things probably over and over.

284
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,895
This is your chance to really do that thing

285
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,118
you've always wanted to do but never had a chance to do.

286
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:16,301
You want to know your limitations, certainly.

287
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:19,045
You want to be honest with yourself about your limitations.

288
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:27,401
Also, don't be overconfident though, like I was. Um, so one of my first contracts was

289
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:32,643
doing a bunch of shader work, like I said earlier. Um, I thought, hey, this seems pretty

290
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:37,244
easy, there's a lot of resources out there that will really help jumpstart me into it. I

291
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:45,267
set my, uh, time range, my time frame based on what I thought it was going to take, instead

292
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,568
of actual real data.

293
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,579
Don't do that.

294
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:53,122
Always do your research before you accept the contract.

295
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:56,745
It turned out that I was not good at shaders,

296
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,207
not near as good as I thought I was.

297
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,590
And I ended up spending twice the hours,

298
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,072
but in the same amount of calendar days.

299
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,573
So I just crunched for a month.

300
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:06,494
It was brutal.

301
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:09,997
Don't ballpark your hours based on what

302
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:12,158
you think it's going to take.

303
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:14,260
Really get the data beforehand.

304
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,770
So working with multiple clients that all have different proprietary plugins and

305
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,432
modules can get really overwhelming. So to manage this, I always set up environments

306
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:32,633
for every single contract because the last thing you want is for, say, client X's

307
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:39,475
custom deformer module to get into client Y's scene file. That would be really bad

308
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:43,276
and especially bad if that stuff got into your employer's files.

309
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:48,519
that would be really bad. So what I do is actually pretty simple, I just create like a bat

310
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,302
file that just shuffles around all my modules and scripts and I just double click on it

311
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:58,885
before I start some client work. It removes everything, it brings everything in, so

312
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:05,169
there's no chance of that kind of intermingling. It doesn't have to be complex, this

313
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:08,911
doesn't have to be some like huge bat script, some of my bat scripts are literally like

314
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,413
three lines. Just don't overthink it.

315
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:18,010
Uh, Git Perforce, definitely always, I mean, I'm sure everybody in here knows this,

316
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,698
version control is absolutely crucial. And especially Perforce, I don't know, some people love Git,

317
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:27,781
um, just use Perforce, um,

318
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:34,560
It's, it's free for under five users and you are obviously under five users.

319
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,222
Super quick to set up a repo.

320
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:42,786
It's been invaluable for me, especially when you open that one file and Maya

321
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:47,630
corrupts it for like the 10th time in a week, you really want to be able to roll back.

322
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,975
So this one sounds like a huge no-brainer, right?

323
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,597
You just need to know your NDAs.

324
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:56,600
And it probably is a no-brainer, but I don't have common sense,

325
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,582
apparently.

326
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:03,767
About a year ago, I disclosed some confidential information

327
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,468
in a public setting.

328
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:10,313
I checked my own NDA first, and I was totally in the clear.

329
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:10,573
But.

330
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:12,862
Oops.

331
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:15,323
A few frantic messages later, I learned

332
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,946
that I had not broken my NDA with my client,

333
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:22,108
but I had broken my client's NDA with their client.

334
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:24,570
Can get really tricky.

335
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,452
Just because it's not in your NDA

336
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,833
doesn't mean you're free to talk about it,

337
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,055
especially if you are a subcontractor.

338
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,516
This can get really tricky

339
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,918
as that rabbit hole kind of goes deeper.

340
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,864
So now I just don't talk about anything.

341
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:43,308
Hence the slides at the beginning.

342
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:44,909
It can be kind of a bummer, right?

343
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,490
Because you're doing a lot of cool stuff

344
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,991
and you really want to talk about it.

345
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,592
Just don't talk about it.

346
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:53,235
If you have to in order to kind of land that next contract,

347
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,556
be really vague.

348
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:57,738
Say what you need to in order to prove that you

349
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,280
know what you're talking about.

350
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,601
But never go in as any sort of specifics.

351
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,483
Just, again, kind of common sense stuff.

352
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,073
Tech art can definitely be mentally exhausting at the best of times.

353
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:14,358
Once you start filling your free time with it, burnout is almost inevitable,

354
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:18,401
but there's a lot of things you can do to mitigate this.

355
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,723
Just always remember that this is your business.

356
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,206
It's not a grind. It's not a hustle.

357
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:27,029
You want longevity, so you really need to take care of your mental health here.

358
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,713
You need to set boundaries with your clients

359
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:33,374
and with yourself about the amount of time

360
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:38,116
you're gonna spend, and you need to be really firm about it.

361
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:41,237
For me, I limit it to 15 to 20 hours a week at max.

362
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,657
Excuse me.

363
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:48,380
If a client needs more of your time than that,

364
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,060
turn them away.

365
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:54,537
It can be brutal at times, especially when it's something you really want to work on,

366
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:57,698
but if they need you for 30 or 40 hours a week, don't do it.

367
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,058
It's not worth it.

368
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,939
There will always be more clients.

369
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:05,100
Like I said about the huge tech artist shortage right now,

370
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,740
everybody is looking for a tech artist.

371
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,881
I promise you there are more clients out there.

372
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:16,583
And document your hours for every contract, even if the contract is on a per-deliverable basis.

373
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,244
I'm going to go into this later.

374
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:25,344
But time estimates, a valid good time estimate

375
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:26,164
is so crucial.

376
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:27,945
And then on the back end,

377
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:31,166
always add 15% to all of your time estimates.

378
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,327
I call this my Maya crash padding.

379
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:37,186
I love Maya, I really do, but it crashes so much.

380
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:41,431
You can just never kind of expect

381
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,412
what's going to happen, right?

382
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:46,276
They're gonna want something in an older version of Unreal

383
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:47,418
and you have to download that

384
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,780
and you didn't think you were gonna have to.

385
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,044
A Maya file will not open for whatever reason.

386
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,305
You just need that extra padding.

387
00:20:57,913 --> 00:21:02,057
Finally, keep your work life and your freelancer life separate.

388
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:06,140
And this is especially important now in this world of work from home,

389
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:13,365
when your work work and your freelance work is right in front of your face at all times of day.

390
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:18,790
Your employer is paying you for your 40 hours a week, so honor that.

391
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,472
Don't double dip. Don't do two things at once.

392
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:23,714
It's kind of unfair to your fellow workers.

393
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:30,959
You really want to set boundaries with your clients right out of the gate about communication

394
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,061
and how much they get of you.

395
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:37,764
For instance, I'll email during the day because it's usually pretty quick, but I will stay

396
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:43,508
away from Slack because it can be a huge time sink, and obviously I'll never get on meetings

397
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:46,951
like Zoom calls or something during the day because those can be a huge time sink.

398
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:51,520
There will come a time, there will absolutely come a time

399
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,184
when your client will expect and demand you to do work

400
00:21:55,184 --> 00:21:56,546
throughout the day.

401
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,409
The correct answer to this is always no.

402
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,812
They'll push you, but you really need to stand firm on this.

403
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:03,693
It's really important.

404
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:05,895
If you can, try to create,

405
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:08,817
I know this isn't doable for everybody,

406
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:12,080
but try to create a different physical environment

407
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,501
for your day job and your freelancing work.

408
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:18,164
Maybe your office is during the day and then

409
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:21,086
the couch is at night with your laptop or something like that.

410
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:23,608
Or it can be even simpler than that.

411
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,289
Maybe move some potted plants around,

412
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,130
maybe change the color of the lights.

413
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,292
Just anything to further

414
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,294
that delineation between those two environments.

415
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:41,556
So looking long term, like I said,

416
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:46,622
I burned out really hard at the end of last year.

417
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,065
I took October, November, and December off.

418
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:56,272
I think some of the things I could have done to avoid that were to mix it up more, mix

419
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:57,574
up the work you're doing.

420
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:02,038
Remember that one of the reasons you're doing this is for fun, and that's not to say it's

421
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:08,285
always going to be fun, but going back to prioritizing enjoyment between contracts is

422
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,768
when you really can reassess this and do it.

423
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:15,793
Actively seek out clients that need something different than your last client

424
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:23,742
The first three contracts I took on all heavily involved skinning. I was also doing skinning in my day job

425
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:29,749
I got really burned out. So the next contract I decided to do shaders, which didn't turn out so well

426
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,110
But I think the thought was there

427
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:35,713
Really take your time finding the right client that's for you.

428
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:39,055
Again, there's always going to be more clients.

429
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:42,237
You don't have to take every single job that walks through the door.

430
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:47,120
If they need you for something that doesn't sound particularly interesting, look for another one.

431
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,801
Or if it's something that you just did, look for another one.

432
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:55,745
This is really a good time to reevaluate that list that you made at the beginning and kind

433
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:56,846
of shuffle it around.

434
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,887
Get a new number one, a new number two.

435
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:03,270
Really kind of reassess yourself after every contract.

436
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:11,136
Coming back to time estimates, I think this is probably the most important way to avoid

437
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:11,596
burnout.

438
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:18,400
you really need to keep track down to the minute if you can of how long different

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,063
things take you so your time estimates can be more and more accurate as time goes on.

440
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:28,245
Um, one of the, like once you have these numbers,

441
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:30,588
absolutely stick to them.

442
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:34,593
So what I did was actually just make a little Python tool

443
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:38,157
that I can just say like, I'm working on a biped

444
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:40,400
and I'm doing skinning and it'll keep my times

445
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,584
and it'll export all of that to an Excel file

446
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,106
and then I can filter that Excel file.

447
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,788
I can tell exactly how long.

448
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:49,491
Skinning a biped will take me.

449
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:52,453
I can tell exactly how long writing a new tool will take me.

450
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:58,278
And that just helps further along when you're going to that next client, really keeping

451
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:00,820
your time in track, and then add that 15%.

452
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:07,389
Aggregate this data from one client to the next as well.

453
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:11,011
Again, you're just trying to get to that convergence, right?

454
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,192
You're trying to get to a very specific number

455
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,333
of how long it'll take you.

456
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,414
That's not to say that every biped

457
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:20,775
will take you the same amount of time,

458
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:23,036
but it's an estimate and you need to get it better.

459
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:26,534
Annotate it, like I said, if you can.

460
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:29,855
It's going to take a different amount of time

461
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:32,956
to work on a biped skin than a quadruped skin.

462
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:35,077
So you just need that data again.

463
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,878
And finally, probably most importantly,

464
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:40,680
you really need to take time off.

465
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,422
Remember that this is your business,

466
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:47,404
and I know every business how-to book,

467
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,206
and just capitalism at large,

468
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,287
tells us that if you're not growing your business,

469
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:56,671
you're shrinking, but that's just not true in this case.

470
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:59,933
It can really feel good to make more money than last year.

471
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,956
It can really feel good to have more clients than last year,

472
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,497
but it's not the end-all be-all.

473
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:09,318
What I found this year is that when I was doing all this work,

474
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,279
I wasn't really enjoying the reward.

475
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,820
I was getting all these invoices in,

476
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,241
and I wasn't using it for anything.

477
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,681
I was just kind of sitting on it like a dragon.

478
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:19,742
I wasn't going on any vacations.

479
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:23,223
So what was the point?

480
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:25,263
You really need to take time off in order

481
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:26,824
to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

482
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:32,126
And I've said it plenty of times already, but there will be more clients.

483
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:36,128
If you need a break, this isn't your day job.

484
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:40,311
You're not dependent upon this to pay rent or anything like that.

485
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:41,952
If you need a break, take a break.

486
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:45,013
If you can feel yourself getting burned out, take a break.

487
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:51,177
Even if it's just a few weeks, even if it's a month, or in my case, if it was three months,

488
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,218
you have to look out for yourself if you want to do this long-term.

489
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,091
Life is really short, and time is really precious.

490
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:02,391
And I promise you, you are not going

491
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:05,712
to regret spending that extra time with your family

492
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:10,373
or your dog or doing that hobby you love instead of working

493
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:11,534
on that client project.

494
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:12,914
So hopefully, I kind of gave you a little bit of sense

495
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:19,376
of if you want to do this as well, kind of some

496
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:23,117
of the things you should avoid, some of the things

497
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:25,297
you should do right out of the gate that I didn't do.

498
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:37,145
Thanks.

499
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,445
And I think we have like two minutes for questions.

500
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:42,106
Yes, so I was wondering like.

501
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,886
You know, you talked about like NDAs.

502
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,607
How do you, like, starting out,

503
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,888
how do you build a portfolio to really show

504
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,710
that you can do these things for your clients?

505
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,311
Right.

506
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,888
Again, I think it just goes back to the reel.

507
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:15,391
You don't want to kind of advertise yourself

508
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,453
as doing something you're not good at.

509
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:19,815
So if you have a really good rigging reel

510
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,116
or something like that,

511
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,718
go after those contracts in particular.

512
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:27,401
But really, I think it also comes down

513
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,703
to just being on social media, unfortunately.

514
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:32,405
Especially to start out with.

515
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:34,707
That's where I found most of my starting clients.

516
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:42,530
Just write, they'll post something on Twitter and then you'll message them and then you'll talk for a little bit.

517
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,912
You just have to have that reel up to date so when something does come along, you can kind of jump on it.

518
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:48,432
Sweet, thank you.

519
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:57,135
Hi, great talk. I'm just wondering where you find the work. You mentioned social media is about half of your work.

520
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:03,057
So where do you find the work? And second question, what do you think of freelancer platforms?

521
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:07,698
I find most of that social media work on Twitter.

522
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:11,080
Game dev Twitter is bonkers, right?

523
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,641
Everybody is on Twitter in this industry.

524
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,843
That's kind of where I found all of that.

525
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:18,324
I've never used any sort of freelancer platforms

526
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,565
for anything like that.

527
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:22,487
I've been really fortunate in that the word of mouth

528
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,088
has been really good, so the other half of my clients

529
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:27,009
are all from word of mouth.

530
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,951
So I can't really answer that, I guess.

531
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,552
Perfect, thanks.

532
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:38,661
Hey Taylor. Hey. Um, okay. I had a quick question about when you take your breaks,

533
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,722
like in this case you took like a three month break.

534
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:43,764
I'm assuming you're going to jump back into it.

535
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:47,266
How do you make that transition from like not working on stuff,

536
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:51,588
not talking to clients to just jumping back into working with clients?

537
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:54,950
Um, I'll tell you when I find out. Um,

538
00:29:56,523 --> 00:30:02,208
Most of this year as well has been on other things.

539
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,391
Just bought a house and all that kind of stuff.

540
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:08,654
So again, I've been really fortunate in that a lot

541
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:11,797
of my clients are still asking, like, hey,

542
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:13,939
whenever you're available, we have work for you.

543
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,083
But I think going forward, I can actually start to,

544
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,165
I've never really advertised myself before on Twitter

545
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:24,026
or any other forum.

546
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,648
I think that's something that I'll start to do,

547
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:28,870
actually actively look for clients.

548
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,171
Okay, thank you.

549
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:32,997
Hey dude, nice talk.

550
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,318
Could you tell us a little bit more

551
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:36,980
about the kinds of work that you're doing?

552
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,061
Is it like, hey, rig five characters,

553
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,781
skin five characters, make 10 materials

554
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:42,002
or something like that?

555
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,103
Or is it a more broad like,

556
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:45,684
hey, we need you to help out for a month?

557
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,445
Yeah, it's kind of both, honestly.

558
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:51,467
What I've found is that skinning in particular

559
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:55,112
Everybody needs somebody to do skins for them.

560
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:57,917
Nobody really wants to do it, right?

561
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,301
So quite a few of my contracts have just been,

562
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:03,706
hey, we have 12 characters and we need you to skin them

563
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,770
and turn them in when they're done.

564
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,667
But then there are others where it's like, hey,

565
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,427
we have this big project.

566
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:14,489
We need you for two months.

567
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,250
Just do whatever the art director says kind of deal,

568
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,171
which can be a double-edged sword because you can get

569
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,953
put on tasks that you don't particularly want to do

570
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,214
and maybe you're not even good at.

571
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:30,574
But again, that just goes back to the communication.

572
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:33,555
You need to get to know the client in that kickoff meeting

573
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:34,496
what they actually need.

574
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:37,635
try to discern what they actually need

575
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,137
instead of what they say they need

576
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:42,722
because those things are never the same.

577
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,985
But yeah, you just kind of have to work that out

578
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,347
as it goes along.

579
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:47,048
Cool, thanks.

580
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,822
Hi, thank you for the talk, by the way.

581
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:54,844
So how do you go about trying new things

582
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:56,606
or new skills to build up your skill set,

583
00:31:56,606 --> 00:32:00,410
especially when you talk about shaders versus rigging?

584
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,092
Do you do it between clients

585
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,575
or even when you're working a day job and doing this,

586
00:32:04,575 --> 00:32:05,997
how do you find the time to do that?

587
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,172
Usually it's between clients, yes.

588
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,472
Or again, if you've done something for a client

589
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:16,393
and that might be relevant to your next client,

590
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,394
talk about it but be really vague about what you worked on.

591
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:21,834
Maybe I worked on this particular system

592
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:26,115
but don't go into the specifics of it.

593
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:26,295
Yeah.

594
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:28,016
Thank you.

595
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:29,856
Good, thanks.
