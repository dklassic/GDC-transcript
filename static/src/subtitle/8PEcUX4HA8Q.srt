1
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:18,826
I'm Bo, hi. So I got started in games in 2014, started at a company called Wabi Sabi Sound

2
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:23,008
on a, or in the Blind Forest, The Witness, then moved on to Bungie, worked on Destiny

3
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:29,691
2, some of the DLCs. Then made my way to Naughty Dog, helped ship Lost Legacy, and then Last

4
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,473
of Us Part II, the lovely, beautiful Last of Us Part II, and then now my PlayStation

5
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:36,194
just shipped God of War Ragnarok, so.

6
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,597
Yeah, it's been a couple years of a lot.

7
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,258
Yeah, and I'm Jesse.

8
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:47,520
I started my career pretty much early on in commercials

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,521
and then I came out here and worked for outsourcing companies

10
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,542
like Formosa and Technicolor, things like that.

11
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:54,924
I actually got to work with Naughty Dog on Uncharted 4 as an outsourcer

12
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:58,266
and then came to Naughty Dog back in 2018 to help ship Last of Us Part 2

13
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,447
and then most recently Part 1.

14
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,949
So I've gotten a little bit of both sides, being an outsourcer with companies

15
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,810
and then being in-house with the company as well.

16
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,805
So in this talk, we're gonna be diving pretty deep

17
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,546
into the breathing system we developed

18
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:12,867
for The Last of Us Part II,

19
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,889
which was later brought into The Last of Us Part I.

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,130
So early in the production of Part II,

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,331
there were, you know, we were hearing about whispers

22
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:23,333
and murmurings of this Bleeding Edge prototype,

23
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:26,594
and many Bleeding Edge prototypes and systems

24
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,956
from upstream departments, like animation,

25
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,737
programming, props, rigging departments,

26
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,858
that frankly made us a little nervous.

27
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:34,399
It was becoming very clear.

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,780
that the studio at Naughty Dog was gunning to release

29
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,962
a technical beast with The Last of Us Part II,

30
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:43,383
a title that would dazzle gamers

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,984
with its interactive props, set pieces, and systems.

32
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:49,186
So the audio team understood early on

33
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:51,107
that we needed to evolve with the studio

34
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,768
and reinvent how we handled certain audio challenges,

35
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,410
specifically for player enemies and buddy characters.

36
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,652
After some time spent in pre-production,

37
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,953
our needs solidified into two key pillars.

38
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:07,265
The first pillar being a creative need.

39
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,688
The Last of Us aesthetic merited a robust breathing system.

40
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,151
The Last of Us is gritty, it's realistic,

41
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,232
and insanely detailed.

42
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,735
It has a story with characters you can feel excitement with,

43
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,337
laugh with, and even cry with.

44
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,540
The high dynamic range soundscape begged

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,602
for a robust breathing system that really telegraphed

46
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,264
the player's level of velocity, fear, pain,

47
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,246
and exhaustion all through sound.

48
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,805
If there was a game that required a detailed breathing system,

49
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,206
The Last of Us pretty much fit the bill.

50
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,508
The characters you play as are, they're vulnerable,

51
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,110
they're broken, but most importantly, they are human.

52
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,212
The goal for sound is always to support the story.

53
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,556
We knew if we could hear their breathing reflecting

54
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:51,517
and supporting these truths,

55
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,039
that we could be achieving a higher level of detail

56
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,720
that would support both of these goals.

57
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:00,267
The Last of Us features extensive stealth gameplay, which is a break from the exploring

58
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:04,551
combat states because of the dynamic nature of the audio in the Thiele universe.

59
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,974
A breathing system would be an audible welcome addition for immersive storytelling and gameplay

60
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:09,335
feedback.

61
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,861
And the second being a technical need.

62
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,203
So starting with The Last of Us Part II,

63
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,184
the studio adopted this new technology,

64
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:18,886
which was later added to Part II,

65
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,387
and it's called motion matching.

66
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,108
I'm sure many of you have heard of it.

67
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:26,271
Motion matching is a system that programmatically checks

68
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,993
the desired character trajectory

69
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,796
based on inputs from the stick or from character pathing.

70
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,958
Every game frame, there are dozens,

71
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,019
if not hundreds of animations being searched

72
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,761
to find the right animation to play in a given context.

73
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:44,676
It's an extremely detailed and elegant solution to achieve a realistic moveset for a character.

74
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,919
And with this addition to our animation pipeline,

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,006
audio now has a new beast to overcome in terms of how we traditionally tagged animations.

76
00:03:55,778 --> 00:04:03,903
And just for some history, in The Last of Us for PS3, circa 2013, infected vocal efforts

77
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,045
were hand-tagged to animation frames.

78
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:12,449
The animations played back in a less granular way and were more long-form, so this method

79
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,670
was far more feasible and less error-prone for audio.

80
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,492
The vocal efforts were also streaming and not loaded into memory.

81
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:23,335
And the cons of using streaming sounds meant

82
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:26,717
when a sound triggers, there was a possibility that it may be delayed

83
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,420
based on how hard the I.O. was getting hit at the time of the audio triggering.

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,662
So, you know, if the game is trying to load a bunch of textures all over,

85
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,625
so, you know, sound, streaming sounds are also trying to load,

86
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,707
if the I.O. is getting hit, then that sound might get delayed a bit.

87
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:43,650
And that's kind of the last thing we want with a game like The Last of Us, where...

88
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:48,234
If a clicker looks at you really quickly, you want to feel like, oh my god, there it is.

89
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,518
And you hear a sound associated with that visual.

90
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,243
So looking forward to part two, we knew that the old method of tagging animations was a non-starter

91
00:04:57,623 --> 00:05:00,166
with this more granular spliced animation technology.

92
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,273
We felt that all characters needed two things.

93
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,956
The first being a looping sound concept leveraging game data.

94
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,378
So for this, it's sort of like a single looping sound event

95
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:14,479
that plays on a character's jaw joint or face, right,

96
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,741
where we can pipe in game data to our audio middleware,

97
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:21,403
like player velocity, health, any game data

98
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:24,724
that would be helpful to make this a more modular setup.

99
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,766
So we can align.

100
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:30,367
So we can play back modular bits of audio to align with the animation.

101
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:35,549
And the other need was utilizing in-memory sounds for frame-accurate triggering.

102
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,451
This is so we can ensure our sounds are completely married to the pixels.

103
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,873
So when a clicker does that, you know, whoop, what was that, right?

104
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:47,775
That head turn, that contort, when you hit that with a shriek,

105
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:51,336
that, you know, that clicker inhale, that's the sound...

106
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,651
It glues to the animation.

107
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,916
It's merging the pixels and the sound, and it becomes this thing that's super heightened.

108
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,419
It just feels more next-gen.

109
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,502
It pushes the story in a more threatening, interesting way.

110
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:09,584
All right.

111
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:15,269
So we got to thinking, what kind of technology do we need to expand our audio systems into

112
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,552
something that we can manage for the scope of this demanding title?

113
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:22,648
After much work and collaboration with dialogue, programming, and other disciplines,

114
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:26,430
we landed on the beginnings of a system that would snowball into something expandable,

115
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:29,733
flexible, and something that we were all really excited about.

116
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,574
It can be summed up into two core concepts,

117
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,177
and we call those murmuration and heart rate.

118
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,980
Murmuration is a persistent loop sound on a character.

119
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,802
We call it murmuration because it's basically the sounds under the sounds.

120
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,668
For Joel, Ellie, and Abby, it's immersive breathing.

121
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,549
For infected, it's groaning, mumbling, clicking, shrieking,

122
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:51,810
frenzying, things like that.

123
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,311
And for dogs, it's like mouth sounds, licking,

124
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:54,951
things like that.

125
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:59,313
And we even used it on the baby, on baby JJ

126
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:03,074
as well, to be able to play individual cooing or things

127
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,015
like that that babies do.

128
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,356
It's kind of anything that we wanted it to be

129
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,377
or needed it to be, and that's kind of the power behind it.

130
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,638
Let's watch a demo of this in action.

131
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:31,256
All right.

132
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:34,257
So murmuration is the lowest priority sound possible

133
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:35,417
within our dialog system.

134
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,278
There's a big laundry list of vox priorities

135
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:39,999
where the higher priorities will basically

136
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:40,779
stomp the lower ones.

137
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,340
For example, a player leaping over maybe a short wall

138
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,821
or like a vault, the player may play an effort.

139
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,122
This effort has a priority of what we call effort low.

140
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,802
This effort would stomp the murmuration loop,

141
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:54,503
and once the effort has ended,

142
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,203
the murmuration loop would seamlessly return.

143
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:00,293
Now that we had a functional looping sound event

144
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:02,654
implemented into the dialogue system,

145
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,157
we now have the unique challenge to create a game variable

146
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:07,758
that would relay that theoretical heart rate

147
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,480
of the character to this looping sound at runtime.

148
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:15,123
This illustrates their tiredness, pain, exhaustion,

149
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:18,586
and fear, or really any emotion that encapsulates

150
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,087
what we needed to telegraph to the player.

151
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:24,370
And not surprisingly, we called that heart rate.

152
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:26,951
Heart rate, yeah.

153
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:31,739
So ultimately we needed a base way to express the tension of the game,

154
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,702
which manifested as the danger level for the player.

155
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,824
And we chose to express this value as a floating point,

156
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,605
ranging from 0.0 to 1.0,

157
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:43,789
with 0 being the most relaxed and 1 being the most intense.

158
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:50,068
The basic tensions of the last of the combat loop is what's called ambient explore,

159
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:53,070
and this is where, you know, Joe and Ellie are having a light conversation.

160
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,953
Maybe there's some scavenging, maybe there's some narrative lines that are playing.

161
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:58,154
You know, pretty low energy.

162
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:00,156
And then there's stealth.

163
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:03,499
So stealth is where the player is, you know, sneaking around enemies,

164
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:07,302
but the enemies do not yet have a full awareness of the player.

165
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:12,244
So there's obviously a lot more tension than ambient in that sense.

166
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:15,366
And then combat, of course, is when the enemies have full acquisition,

167
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,087
they've acquired the player,

168
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,188
and are now actively engaged in combat,

169
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,789
actively trying to shoot, maul, whatever.

170
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,791
This is a brutal game.

171
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,532
Shoot, maul, whatever, you know.

172
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,020
So yeah, and with these three base AI concepts,

173
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,102
we broke up the logic in that there were

174
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:36,863
different heart rate states for pressing L1,

175
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,024
so running or not running in each

176
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,145
of the three base tensions.

177
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:41,646
So if you look at the, you know,

178
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,248
this is kind of a simplified version of it,

179
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:48,930
but essentially you see like there's ambient high and low,

180
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,331
unaware low and high, combat low and high,

181
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,713
and the purpose of that is high,

182
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:58,400
It's basically, it's that AI state, but you are deciding to sprint. You're sprinting.

183
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:03,187
And then low is you're not sprinting, right? So you're either walking, idle.

184
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,181
Things like that, crouched.

185
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,564
So after we found a potential solution

186
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:11,525
for the heart rate states,

187
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,986
we worked with gameplay programming

188
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,988
to create a way for us to interpolate

189
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,470
or slew the values that heart rate was sending

190
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,391
to the audio middleware.

191
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,913
This was so we can get a more hand-authored,

192
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:23,796
realistic sense of growing exhaustion

193
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,498
or the opposite, that recovery in the breath

194
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:29,080
after having sprinted for a long period of time.

195
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,506
And so here's a video to demonstrate heart rate active

196
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,735
with debug to actually see what's going on.

197
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:08,933
Let's see how.

198
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,437
So as you can hear, when Ellie started to sprint,

199
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,800
her target heart rate immediately snapped

200
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,701
to a destination value.

201
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,325
And the current heart rate then slews up over time

202
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:24,768
to get to that destination target heart rate.

203
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:30,351
And so using current heart rate as a basis for driving all the sounds in the middleware,

204
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,512
that gave us the ability to add what we call, you know, stages to the breathing.

205
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:37,614
So for example, we broke up the combat sprint into buckets of three stages,

206
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:42,717
with stage one sounding the least exhausted and stage three sounding the most exhausted.

207
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:45,698
So, actually show of hands, who's played part one?

208
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,619
Like the recent part one, maybe? Or just...

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,821
Part two? Part two? Alright, alright.

210
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:56,054
So, I mean, maybe you get it, you get the whole, you know, combat, sprint, the AI, that's great.

211
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:57,775
So, um...

212
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,637
Well, now I'm like, off.

213
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,923
So yeah, so they were broken up into three buckets.

214
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,526
So yeah, as you're running, I'm hoping you've kind of noticed

215
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:12,947
that there is that tension, you know,

216
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,948
Ellie and Joel, when you're sprinting with them,

217
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,070
you start to hear like, oh my gosh, they sound exhausted,

218
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,690
they sound beat.

219
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,032
So that was our effort, right?

220
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,775
And hearing that really like glues you to the character.

221
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:25,557
You feel like you're in that headspace, you know,

222
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:27,558
with the bullets whizzing by, the dogs mauling,

223
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:28,199
whatever it is, right?

224
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,521
So these stages, and this is actually a really important point,

225
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,063
was all of this was recorded with those principal actors,

226
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,584
with the system in mind.

227
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:40,266
So with that, what you get is this, you know,

228
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:43,308
very natural, seamless representation of a growingly exhausted

229
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:46,710
or decreasingly relaxed breath in the character's breathing cycle.

230
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,828
And so here's just a bunch of text for you to squint at.

231
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,591
So on the left is an image of the heart rate states

232
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,833
and the settings sound designers were able to modify.

233
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:04,255
The delta value is the difference between the target heart rate values.

234
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:04,816
So...

235
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:07,915
I'm going to do my best here.

236
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,998
But so this is at 1.0, combat high.

237
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,979
So this is when you are sprinting in combat.

238
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,981
And the delta for the growth duration

239
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:19,364
just basically means if you're coming from combat low,

240
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,246
aka you're not sprinting in combat,

241
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:21,926
the delta would be 0.3.

242
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:22,467
So I threw in 18.

243
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,148
So over 18 seconds, it's going to increase and hit

244
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:24,488
that target.

245
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:34,134
So yeah, so we were able to say,

246
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,155
and what's really cool about this is we were able to say,

247
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,555
like, you know, for a character like Ellie,

248
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,135
maybe she's more light on her feet.

249
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,176
Maybe she's, you know, done cardio more.

250
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,977
So let's make it so that she sounds more tired

251
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,317
after a longer period of time.

252
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,078
But for Joel, maybe, you know,

253
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:49,038
maybe Joel hasn't been as strict

254
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,679
with his cardio workouts, right?

255
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:51,999
Maybe he's drinking too much coffee.

256
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,720
So his sprint stages, you know, progress quicker,

257
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,901
aka he sounds more tired quicker.

258
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:02,022
This was a great setup for us to not only get a feel for what sounded good,

259
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,383
but also to tell you a little bit more about the character.

260
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:08,904
You know, it's a really interesting subtle way to add storytelling just to breathing, you know.

261
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:16,707
And to speak on the audio implementation side, the image on the right is from our proprietary PlayStation audio middleware, Scream.

262
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:23,253
So what you're seeing is a small slice of what the looping player murmuration is doing under the hood.

263
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:30,080
So the audio executes from top to bottom, and what happens first are what I call the initial checks.

264
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,922
So it's just checking a bunch of game data.

265
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:40,747
Yeah, so these checks are for variables like,

266
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,028
is the player injured?

267
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:45,250
Is the current heart rate greater than or equal to 0.5?

268
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:45,971
Or 0.85?

269
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,933
And so with these checks,

270
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,855
that's the way to route the logic to,

271
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,676
oh, you are injured, so go here,

272
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,137
and then play this bunch of logic

273
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,639
that will pepper in the injured sound.

274
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:59,140
So, and that's what's amazing about Scream,

275
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,483
is the SCR is an acronym, it's scriptable.

276
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,604
It's essentially a scripting...

277
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:09,166
middleware, which is really empowering when you get a hand on it, you know.

278
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:13,929
And lastly is the sound execution stage,

279
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:17,432
where the middleware will randomly pick a breath asset to play.

280
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,494
And this matrix of logic on the audio middleware side

281
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,856
is the core of how we dynamically change stuff like, you know,

282
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,598
the volume, the frequency, what assets to play,

283
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:31,020
and the overall mix of the breathing context, really.

284
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:36,836
And here's it in action.

285
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:17,223
You should have done more cardio.

286
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,426
You should have done more cardio.

287
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:36,396
So yeah, I really hoped, or wished, Troy was here so he could just sit here and watch himself,

288
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,582
you know, breathing.

289
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:46,847
It is hard to say apologies, but I did try to superimpose that text.

290
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:50,711
But essentially what's happening is all these curves, all these values up here,

291
00:16:50,731 --> 00:17:02,784
this is all game data where we are able to smooth and adjust and basically alter the breathing loops and assets to where it just fits in the context of the game.

292
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,025
So using variables like velocity, current heart rate,

293
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:08,526
we were able to do things like, one,

294
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:11,706
decrease subtle delays between breaths

295
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,947
as heart rate increases, which can suggest

296
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:16,007
a more rapid breathing.

297
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,748
We were able to slowly creep up volume and pitch

298
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:22,748
as heart rate increases, suggesting larger exertions.

299
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,068
And we set a flag based on velocity

300
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,469
to seamlessly change the idle breath to the walking breath

301
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:30,189
buckets.

302
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:31,290
And this.

303
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,252
I mentioned before this is a view of Scream,

304
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,054
but this is specifically what's called the CC,

305
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,115
or Continuous Controller view for Scream.

306
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:44,819
All right, everyone still with us?

307
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,242
Sorry, so now that we basically have solved

308
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:50,643
all the technical blockers in our way,

309
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,704
we now had a different challenge.

310
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,386
This brings us back to the main goal of the system.

311
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,489
If you remember, we said this will always be something

312
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,230
to support the story and its characters.

313
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:04,916
So how can this system support the narrative the game was trying to tell?

314
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:08,478
This brings us to arguably one of the more important features of this system,

315
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,519
which is the narrative impact.

316
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,540
So in a studio where story is absolutely king,

317
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:17,962
everything that we do in the audio department always comes back to a single concept.

318
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,602
How does it support the story?

319
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:23,184
From small drawer opens all the way to, you know, characters breathing.

320
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:28,526
To achieve control over this newfound system, we added script functions to do things like

321
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,036
Suppress the breathing loop for a period of time.

322
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,340
So there were times where suppressing murmuration

323
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,983
helped the narrative and it kept combat tense.

324
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,507
We could be silencing stalkers during big infected fights.

325
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,469
We could be silencing Tommy when he's

326
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:45,012
playing cat and mouse with Abby during the sniper showdown.

327
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:45,553
Spoilers.

328
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,237
There were key moments where silence basically just

329
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:49,857
was the answer.

330
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,937
So in this next video example we're going to show,

331
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:54,858
Ellie is entering a new location.

332
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,320
This is in Last of Us Part 1.

333
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,941
She's entering a new location where the player needs to feel

334
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,262
like there basically are no more threats.

335
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:03,103
They've achieved their previous combat area,

336
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:03,804
and they're moving on.

337
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:07,166
So to achieve this, the ambient infected in the distance,

338
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:10,368
which you can't see, we silenced them until Ellie

339
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,308
reaches a certain point.

340
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,370
The sound of the infected breathing loops would turn on

341
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,032
right before her body language and her efforts change,

342
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,333
basically to telegraph to the player that there actually

343
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:20,174
is danger nearby.

344
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:21,352
Let's watch.

345
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,355
OK, so two things.

346
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:07,319
One, as you heard, when the infected get turned back on,

347
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,761
Ellie also has a big like, right?

348
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:12,824
So right there, we also spiked the heart right there

349
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,666
to give her that sense of like, oh, there's danger nearby.

350
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,349
At the very end, we had a unique kind of problem.

351
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,370
So another feature at the end that we had

352
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,072
was when Ellie is closing the door,

353
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,254
And she's invading the infected, right?

354
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:28,418
So in this section, once you close the door, this whole entire previous level

355
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,880
would just completely unload due to memory issues.

356
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,663
Something that I'm sure a lot of us game developers are very used to.

357
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:37,567
So, because of that, if there were any infected still alive,

358
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,669
you would basically hear them abruptly just cut off.

359
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:40,629
Right?

360
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,931
And that would completely break the suspension of disbelief.

361
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:47,595
So to fix this problem, we were able to take the current breathing loop on any infected

362
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:51,018
and seamlessly transfer it to a spawner in the world

363
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:52,499
where we were able to place wherever we'd like.

364
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,504
To basically to allow for like a seamless handoff to other objects, like if they would unload.

365
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,607
So we would take that, and in this specific situation I took those

366
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,550
and I just like lerped them, those spawners, towards the door to basically build tension,

367
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,073
almost like you're voluming, you know, raising them up.

368
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:13,836
And then as soon as she actually closes it, then I do the same thing and I alert them away from it,

369
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,478
all the way far away so that they would fade away seamlessly,

370
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,800
right before we would basically just completely suppress them for good.

371
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:24,043
So this allowed a good storytelling idea of like, oh, okay, you've closed the door,

372
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:27,205
maybe the infected now have tried to run away, maybe they're going to try to find another way out.

373
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,687
But it allows them to fade out rather than to cut off.

374
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:34,730
And in that situation, as soon as the door closes, it's just those objects that are completely taking that sound

375
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:39,013
and populating it onto a different spawner and then sending it away to be able to do that.

376
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,543
So another way we elevate the narrative is what we call

377
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:49,325
spiking the heart rate, which Jesse mentioned.

378
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,728
So we created a script function which snapped the current

379
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:55,450
heart rate, which basically was a knob for us to say,

380
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,352
sound scared or tired right now.

381
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,135
And that leveraged the systemic breathing assets

382
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,217
that worked procedurally in a way where

383
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,700
it just worked wonderfully in very choice

384
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,841
narrative gameplay beats.

385
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,583
So let's see an example of that.

386
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:12,844
This could be a tad loud.

387
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:14,005
Oh yeah.

388
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:14,865
Just a warning.

389
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:16,485
There's a bloater in it.

390
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,444
I want to get out of here.

391
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,676
Other than drinking a lot of coffee?

392
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:24,318
Uh, yeah, so, yeah, this is an interesting one,

393
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:27,140
because, um, one of the cool details about spiking heart rate

394
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,201
at the end there was, um, that tired breathing loop was acting

395
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:32,942
as this, like, really awesome, interesting, connective tissue

396
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:35,884
between those narrative lines that were, you know,

397
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,945
directed to sound tired, like you just,

398
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:40,966
you know, you just thought a bloater, right?

399
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:44,228
So it was a really interesting, uh, cool way

400
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,369
to, to, to web it all together.

401
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:55,579
And then lastly, and this is one of my personal favorites, we were able to override the whole breathing loop.

402
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,242
So far, all we've talked about is the base systemic breathing loop that supports the tension.

403
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:05,444
So ambient, stealth, combat.

404
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,725
It's a lot of assets, a lot of complication, but you know...

405
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,184
What if we add a custom breathing loop to a very specific narrative moment that just

406
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:17,364
plays a whole different loop?

407
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:25,448
And so yeah, so this let us play custom tailored assets and it allowed us to assemble a whole

408
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,790
custom breathing set for key narrative moments, pushing the storytelling through sound.

409
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,471
So here are some examples from part two.

410
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,555
Where is that coming from?

411
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:36,471
So in the first example, the moment Ellie hears Joel getting tortured, the murmur loop

412
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:38,954
changes completely to a custom breathing set.

413
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:43,782
And what's so impactful about this set is that not only is it emotionally charged, but

414
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:44,503
uh...

415
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,685
A little technical, but it's kind of cool.

416
00:25:47,065 --> 00:25:52,669
The whole Maya XYZ is exposed as a global variable for sound.

417
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:58,953
And so as you descend, go down the chalet, I was able to make it sound more high-tension,

418
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:03,736
more like a climax getting to that door of fear and terror.

419
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:08,255
So, that was really cool.

420
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:14,597
And then the second video, yeah, so I'm overriding her default breathing loop there to custom

421
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,118
breath assets that Ashley did for that cinematic.

422
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:21,660
So the breathing transitions seamlessly into the cinematic dialogue stem.

423
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
And that was really cool.

424
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,161
And that was just a collaboration

425
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,342
with the cinematic team where, hey,

426
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:28,764
do we have any Ashley breaths from the cinematic

427
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:32,166
that I can take and build a breathing set with that

428
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:34,247
so that transition can happen?

429
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,149
Because that moment's pretty quiet.

430
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:40,551
You just hear that tone of the music with breath.

431
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:43,853
So it's just another cool way to add

432
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:45,234
that detail and that quality.

433
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,776
OK, awesome.

434
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:49,617
So.

435
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:53,633
We now have a hyper-realistic breathing simulator

436
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,533
for an interactive player character.

437
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,614
So then we thought, how can we expand this system

438
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:00,815
into something other departments could leverage?

439
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:06,377
So we began branching out with an interdepartmental mindset.

440
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:09,358
So why animate the player's facial expressions

441
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:12,359
divorced from this robust and expansive technology

442
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,380
that we've all created?

443
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,441
So our first collaborators were with animation.

444
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:26,802
So Keith Passiello, who was pioneering the emotional facial system with Mike Herhan,

445
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:31,944
Christian Whirlwind, and others, they were incredibly excited at the pitch that we gave

446
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,985
them basically in regarding to a breathing solution.

447
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:40,747
So he was able to provide us with a myriad of custom facial animations to play in tandem

448
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,068
with whatever breathing set we wanted.

449
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:47,890
For Abby, basically Abby's vertigo, featured in part two,

450
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,573
Troy Slough animated the shoulders

451
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:55,357
so that you can clearly see a sense of Abby's body tension,

452
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:56,959
like the terror of heights that she has.

453
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,861
So we're going to show a video for this,

454
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:02,644
but for both examples, the duration of breathing assets

455
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,085
dictated these animations.

456
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,997
The sound was driving the animations,

457
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,901
basically ensuring perfect sync.

458
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:13,567
So we were, in a way, kind of animating, like in a sense,

459
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:13,827
right?

460
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:16,251
So here's a video demo, and then we'll talk about it.

461
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:02,167
Let's see if we can achieve this.

462
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,275
It's funny you're showing that like yeah, it happened but like

463
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:33,957
The amount of time it took to for me to move the camera lock it and do that and look at him like oh my god

464
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:34,378
It works

465
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:36,518
This is unreal

466
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,423
So yeah, this is a very brief description of how we made it happen, but it's such an amazing collaboration.

467
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:53,748
So yeah, I mean, I did my best to overlay text to give some insight, but yeah, it's really cool stuff, you know, working with programming.

468
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,969
Like, just as an example...

469
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,410
The fade of that facial animation was,

470
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:04,212
we could input values of how much does the heart rate

471
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,632
actually affect that animation,

472
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:08,513
because we can set it so, all right,

473
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,713
as the heart rate gets higher,

474
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,494
basically are you more exhausted, right?

475
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:15,695
That facial animation could look more intense,

476
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:18,376
or her eyebrows are more down and she looks more beat.

477
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,637
Yeah, it's really, really amazing.

478
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:23,317
The next one.

479
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:23,497
Yeah.

480
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,138
Let's show the next one with Abby.

481
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:25,538
Mm-hmm.

482
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:36,712
Watch our shoulders, or not, in particular.

483
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:08,167
Huh?

484
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:08,288
Huh?

485
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:08,368
Huh?

486
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:09,414
Huh?

487
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:28,545
So as we know, we work on software, essentially, right?

488
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,027
So programming is the core of how games are made.

489
00:31:31,827 --> 00:31:33,429
And their success, or sorry, geez,

490
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,731
and their support on these projects

491
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:36,932
was paramount for our success.

492
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,754
Everything we've shown so far wouldn't be possible

493
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,055
without their knowledge, insights,

494
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,577
and critical additions to the tools and technology.

495
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:48,430
So here's another thing you have to squint at, sorry.

496
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:52,413
So on Tilo 2, programmers Jonathan Lanier and Eli Omernik

497
00:31:52,473 --> 00:31:53,854
provided the audio team with features

498
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:56,516
that radically altered how we implemented breathing assets.

499
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:59,219
And to go into a little bit more detail,

500
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,821
in our audio middleware we had the ability

501
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:05,103
to send integer values to the engine that dictated,

502
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:07,766
one, which facial animation to play,

503
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:09,687
of the ones that were supplied from animation,

504
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:12,329
and two, the duration in milliseconds

505
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:14,251
of the corresponding breath sound.

506
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:18,847
So in the image on the left, we can see our breathing sounds

507
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:21,630
paired with what's called the plug-in command grains.

508
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:26,655
Essentially, a plug-in command grain

509
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:29,498
is just sending game data back from the middleware

510
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,220
to the game engine.

511
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:39,031
So the image at the top that you see there is the property view of this plugin command crane.

512
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:45,775
So you can see int1, integer 1 expresses which animation to play in the array or list

513
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:48,657
defined in the image on the right.

514
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:54,440
This gave us the ability to actually cherry pick which facial animation went with which breath sound,

515
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:57,963
enabling us to essentially define and polish the facial animation

516
00:32:58,463 --> 00:32:59,964
in tandem with our breathing work.

517
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:07,570
And yeah, so integer two expressed the time in milliseconds

518
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,592
of the corresponding breath sound file.

519
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:16,095
And so I believe Eli was able to create a technology

520
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:19,397
that either stretched or compressed

521
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,458
the facial animation per sound file.

522
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:25,700
So I believe each breath animation,

523
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,061
facial animation was 30 frames.

524
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,925
Everyone, I believe, was all 30 frames.

525
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,546
And so this logic would essentially go,

526
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:37,107
oh, if the sound asset is longer than 30 frames,

527
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:38,147
then it will stretch.

528
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:39,808
Or if it's shorter, it will compress

529
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,789
each corresponding facial animation,

530
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,009
in real time, of course.

531
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,940
Which is an amazing, amazing thing that worked really well.

532
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,561
So yeah, this feature working in concert with a breathing sound feature was the pinnacle of our efforts.

533
00:33:53,241 --> 00:34:00,683
Yeah, so kind of in summary, you know, this was an amazing, amazing thing that was able to happen because of this team coming together and, you know, working on

534
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,643
trying to, you know, push for something that we were really excited about.

535
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:10,365
It's such a gratifying experience having all these departments come together.

536
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:15,329
Okay, so a lot of information.

537
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:16,831
We're going to do a quick recap.

538
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,954
So basically with things that we've talked about, right?

539
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:23,417
So we said The Last of Us really required like a robust breathing system

540
00:34:23,457 --> 00:34:27,721
to support a gritty, realistic combat with vulnerable characters, right?

541
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:32,125
So to achieve that, we really ran into another greater need,

542
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:33,206
which was the technical need,

543
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,168
which was with our animation team adopting motion matching.

544
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:40,133
This birthed the creation of two main pillars in our system,

545
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:41,614
which we called the breathing system.

546
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:44,176
And those were the core concepts that we called

547
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:46,338
heart rate and memoration.

548
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,342
The breathing system was used to impact the narrative

549
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,523
in ways that we were never able to do before.

550
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,046
And then we started collaborating

551
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,348
with other departments within our studio

552
00:34:58,368 --> 00:35:00,730
to spearhead features like facial animation that was

553
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,991
driven by the breathing system.

554
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:08,543
So at the end of the day, our number one priority was to honor the characters and immerse the

555
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:13,266
player in the story and give them an interactive experience that would leave a lasting impression

556
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:13,927
for the players.

557
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:18,750
There was a lot of pie-in-the-sky ideas for the system, most of which were able to be

558
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,993
fulfilled, thanks really to the passion, the creativity, and the talent of the entire team.

559
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:29,819
So we'd like to give a little bit of special thanks for people that were able to work with us and help us on this.

560
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:36,281
None of this really would be possible without the passion and just the creativity of the co-collaborators

561
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:40,122
within the company, within Naughty Dog, and be able to help with this.

562
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:42,823
So we just wanted to express our gratitude to some of those.

563
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,224
And that is it. Thank you so much for coming out.

564
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:48,184
Thank you.

565
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,618
Yeah, we wanted to leave a good amount of time for Q&A,

566
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,161
because this is quite a technical talk.

567
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,922
You know, there's a lot of confusing,

568
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,685
potentially confusing stuff, so please feel free to...

569
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,351
Yeah, ask any questions you have.

570
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,932
Yeah, it was an incredible talk.

571
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:12,793
Thank you so much.

572
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,974
I had a question.

573
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:15,915
You were talking about what some of the more specialized

574
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:16,576
breathing loops.

575
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:19,258
I was wondering how you account for kind of like

576
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,660
player freedom in those situations.

577
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,922
Like if someone in the chalet went down to the basement

578
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,683
and then turned around and went back upstairs,

579
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:27,085
would you maintain that momentum?

580
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,666
Would you kind of roll it back?

581
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:29,947
How did you deal with those situations?

582
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:30,407
Great question.

583
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:34,050
So in that case, yeah, it was just based on the Zed.

584
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,310
So the,

585
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:38,834
The height.

586
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:42,798
So yeah, when you would go back up, it would revert back to the less intense,

587
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:44,740
but that's a great point, right?

588
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,083
Like, maybe not. Maybe it shouldn't be like that.

589
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:50,286
You know, there's a lot of ways you can do that, but...

590
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:50,826
Awesome.

591
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:51,447
Yeah.

592
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:52,948
I was just wondering what you guys chose to do with it.

593
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,690
Yeah, it's a good way to think about it, because you can, you know,

594
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,712
and in that way, that way of thinking, right, is...

595
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:58,453
is a story way of thinking, right?

596
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,454
Because you're going down and you're like,

597
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,035
well, I've already heard those yells,

598
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,417
so maybe I should stay, you know, really heightened.

599
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,398
Maybe I should stay that way.

600
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:05,478
So you can change it to say,

601
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,560
no, I want the character to feel this way.

602
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,601
And that's the right way to think,

603
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:10,122
because then you're thinking about the character

604
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:11,463
and about how the player is perceiving it.

605
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,364
In that situation, yes, you know,

606
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,847
most people did not turn around and go back.

607
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,788
But it's a good thought.

608
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:19,509
A lot of it comes down to scope.

609
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,389
Because you could do a thing where,

610
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,650
well, if you stay at the door,

611
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:23,372
maybe after 20 seconds,

612
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:25,834
they have a whole new set of breathing for the...

613
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:29,855
The I'm at the door tension, you know, breadth assets.

614
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:33,236
Like, you know, so, you know, this was already a lot,

615
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:34,757
obviously, because we had other,

616
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:37,738
this was just incepted on part two.

617
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,518
Like we didn't, this was not our main task.

618
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,319
This was just kind of added on top.

619
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,100
And we got, you know, it snowballed, like it was mentioned.

620
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,781
So we were definitely trying to manage the scope of this,

621
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:51,162
you know, so.

622
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,282
Awesome.

623
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:52,922
Thank you so much.

624
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:53,403
Yeah, thank you.

625
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:54,123
Thank you for the question.

626
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:57,308
Hi, thanks a lot. Awesome talk.

627
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:04,250
I'd be curious to know how far you kind of push things in terms of exposing game variables

628
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:09,091
and having this kind of procedural approach come from the animation side, and there's

629
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:15,593
a lot of other things happening. There's footsteps, kind of gear and pack, and ambience based

630
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:21,214
on clothing, grabbing objects. Did you expose more things, or did you still put tags in

631
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,415
animations for specific sounds?

632
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:28,210
Yeah, so basically, the core of the question is,

633
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,812
were there animations that you would play

634
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:34,455
systemically that would talk to the breathing?

635
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:36,176
Like picking up or...

636
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,859
Like, for example, footsteps.

637
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,801
Did you tag these in the animation data as before,

638
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,704
or did you have, say, maybe a game variable

639
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:48,006
which indicates when footsteps are occurring?

640
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,347
Oh, yeah.

641
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,969
So what's interesting about the murmuration,

642
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,650
which is just the looping sound on the player,

643
00:38:55,363 --> 00:38:55,924
persistent.

644
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:59,368
And yeah, it was literally just based on, you know, velocity

645
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:01,690
or are you sprinting or not sprinting.

646
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,155
We didn't consider, you know, footsteps,

647
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:08,098
the rapidness of footsteps or anything like that.

648
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:11,162
Yeah, we had, I mean, I would say the things that we tagged

649
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:12,283
that would cut off the breathing loop

650
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:13,224
would be things like efforts.

651
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:19,170
So like swinging a machete that would play like maybe a specific type of effort set or specific type of efforts or...

652
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,631
Or narrative line of course.

653
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,734
Or narrative line going over or jumping over a vault or even death, right?

654
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:28,418
All of that would have different effects on the breathing loop and then bring the breathing loop back when needed.

655
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:32,621
But the cool thing about it is that if you were constantly running and you were constantly swinging your machete,

656
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:37,806
you would get all those efforts which are very like high energy, but your heart rate would be going up as you did that.

657
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,928
So then your breathing loop would come back in at a higher...

658
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:44,895
Like at a higher set possibly, so it would complement the efforts, which was really one of the main goals.

659
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:52,159
Especially when we moved on to the remake of the first game, because we didn't have any of those assets, we had to re-record everything.

660
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:56,981
So that's why we had things like injured states and stuff like that, and we re-recorded Troy with all that.

661
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:02,204
But yeah, for, as in like, for tags and things like that, that's not something that we did, you know.

662
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:11,313
Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, I'd really love to see this kind of procedural approach applied to more things like, I don't know, how heavy your clothes are or you know how

663
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,681
figure out what material they are,

664
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,002
have all of these things feed in.

665
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:19,463
I mean, actually, what was not talked about was,

666
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:24,005
on part two I was experimenting with a bunch of stuff,

667
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,606
like when you vault,

668
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,107
like spike the heart rate every time you vault,

669
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,868
or spike the heart rate every time you get out of the water

670
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,309
after swimming, but procedurally.

671
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:35,410
It was like the nudge value was the name of it.

672
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,812
And so we were experimenting with a lot of stuff, but in the end when the game shipped, all those were just zero, zero, zero.

673
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:46,335
Like, no delta was applied. Like, it just didn't really work great, you know.

674
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,896
And yeah, it's just about hearing and feeling.

675
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:51,457
And if it feels like, oh, that felt...

676
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,798
In that context, that felt weird.

677
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,459
But that's always going to happen, right?

678
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,320
And when you get out of water, I...

679
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,487
It's a weird sensation hearing that.

680
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:03,328
Especially, you know, you have to account for,

681
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:04,988
oh, are you in combat when you're getting out of the water?

682
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,508
Are you in stealth when you're getting out of the water?

683
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:10,129
So we actually found, like, the more simple approach, the better.

684
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:12,310
We're going to have a whole suite of sounds for prone.

685
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,470
Like when you're prone, what does it sound like?

686
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,431
Maybe the mouth is close to the grass or the dirt.

687
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,671
Like, I don't know, scope, right?

688
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:20,732
Like, and the bang for the buck.

689
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:22,412
My big thing is bang for the buck.

690
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,992
Like, is there value in doing this?

691
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,293
Are we just doing it just to do it?

692
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:28,153
Or is it going to have, like, a, it's going to make, you know.

693
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,855
the player feels something, is it going to add something of value.

694
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:33,075
Right.

695
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:33,996
Thanks a lot.

696
00:41:34,336 --> 00:41:34,716
Yeah, thank you.

697
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:37,677
Thanks.

698
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:38,417
Great talk, by the way.

699
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:38,997
Thank you.

700
00:41:39,238 --> 00:41:46,540
I was wondering when you said that each heart rate had its own delta to move back down between states,

701
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:55,544
if the player changes target heart rates in between thresholds, how do you decide what delta to use?

702
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,612
Um, yeah, well, it takes your current heart rate.

703
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:03,033
So yeah, if it was going up, slewing up from .7,

704
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,895
and so it was at like .76,

705
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,777
then at that moment when you go to a new destination,

706
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:14,640
that's your new delta, .76 and .4, or whatever that is.

707
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,561
Oh, so you just... okay.

708
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:23,919
Because you talked about how if Joel has a little more hard time doing cardio.

709
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:24,639
Exactly.

710
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:30,241
So in that instance, we had different heart rate sets for them.

711
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:33,643
Specifically for that character, when we set those deltas,

712
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,783
we could set them different for different characters.

713
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:40,525
So a good example of this in part one with Ellie,

714
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:43,086
we had all of Ellie's data from being a player.

715
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:45,048
And she is a player at some point.

716
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:47,629
So what I had to do is I had to create two separate completely

717
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:48,370
breathing sets.

718
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,951
And I created two separate breathing

719
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:52,032
characteristics for her.

720
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:56,314
So I made her basically recover from certain types like combat

721
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,836
when she's like we could, because she's younger.

722
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,997
So she could recover maybe a little quicker.

723
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:02,819
And we made Joel recover a little bit later.

724
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:04,580
Those are completely different breathing tables,

725
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,380
breathing sets.

726
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,162
Their deltas are set for them specifically.

727
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:10,303
So that was nice, because I was able to get

728
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:12,705
a toggle that said, oh, is she a buddy or is she a player?

729
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:14,645
And we could actually affect them differently.

730
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,386
So when she's a player,

731
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:20,188
she also has way more detail in her breathing system.

732
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:23,689
She has catches, like so when she's really exhausted and she's trying to catch her breath.

733
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:23,950
Oops.

734
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,791
She's trying to catch her breath and things like that. There's way more there.

735
00:43:27,211 --> 00:43:31,073
But we found that if I had that breathing set in while she was a buddy, it was very distracting.

736
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:33,835
Because at that moment, who are you? You're Joel.

737
00:43:34,135 --> 00:43:35,776
So you're walking around and you have your breathing set,

738
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:40,280
and you have little Miss Ellie running around all over the place like she shouldn't be,

739
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,221
but that's just what she did.

740
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:42,842
And then she was exhausted.

741
00:43:43,463 --> 00:43:46,085
So she was like, you know, breathing heavy and was like, what is going on?

742
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:49,748
So I had to set a specific breathing loop for that with completely different characteristics.

743
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:53,875
Even had a situation where she's laying on the operating table and she was breathing

744
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:55,036
heavy because she's in combat.

745
00:43:55,617 --> 00:44:00,366
So we had to suppress that for the rest of the game almost because you walk in as Joel

746
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:02,990
and Ellie's unconscious going, huh, huh.

747
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:04,982
Very problematic.

748
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:06,704
So yeah.

749
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:07,404
Thank you.

750
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:08,125
Yeah, thank you.

751
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:09,346
That's the fun thing about game development.

752
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:10,607
Yeah, I think I'm part two.

753
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:15,010
Because animation will override the tension, because it's an easy way to like...

754
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,632
Right now, there's a combat set for animation.

755
00:44:17,672 --> 00:44:18,353
So like, what was it?

756
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:21,435
It was like a pop-gun game with like Abby and...

757
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,961
What was that one in the aquarium?

758
00:44:24,682 --> 00:44:26,802
Oh yeah, yeah, the like, Nerf gun thing.

759
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:27,463
Oh, was it a Nerf gun?

760
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:30,583
Yeah, so they had like, you know, it was set to combat or?

761
00:44:30,844 --> 00:44:34,185
It was set to combat I think because they were technically in a combat state.

762
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,205
Yeah, so then the breathing would like follow that and it would work.

763
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:39,726
And it's just like, geez, sounds like she's gonna kill somebody.

764
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:40,806
She's just playing along with a Nerf gun.

765
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,927
We had that in part one too with the water gun.

766
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:48,470
And, you know, the water gun fight, they were running around and it really sounded like they were like, you know, really trying to fight.

767
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,671
But I had to make it more playful. So that was a whole separate breathing loop for that.

768
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:56,154
So then the programmer added this cool thing that was basically like a, like lock the AI tension.

769
00:44:56,234 --> 00:45:01,136
So it could only adjust within like a boundary, which is really cool.

770
00:45:01,436 --> 00:45:01,596
Yeah.

771
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:03,237
Sorry, go ahead.

772
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:06,289
No problem. It was an amazing talk. I learned so much from this.

773
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:10,451
My question actually was about the accessibility features that were built in for Part 2.

774
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:14,212
And factoring in the closer we get to more realistic audio,

775
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:18,334
how are we compensating for that for people that are hard of hearing?

776
00:45:18,354 --> 00:45:22,256
And as we increase the amount of sounds that are going to be surrounding the player,

777
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:28,538
how do we still enable players with that lack of ability to hear distance?

778
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:30,439
And how did you guys calibrate that for Part 2?

779
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:33,556
So, specifically for the breathing stuff?

780
00:45:33,956 --> 00:45:37,940
Just, yeah, the breathing and the heart rate changes, because they are a lot louder for the player.

781
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,603
I'm just curious if you guys had made any adjustments for the...

782
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:43,646
Because the accessibility features were huge in part two.

783
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:44,106
Yeah.

784
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:50,895
I know for the breathing system, it was a really good question, I can't say that I know of what we did for accessibility.

785
00:45:50,935 --> 00:45:53,216
That was a different person who worked on accessibility part, but...

786
00:45:53,856 --> 00:45:54,516
For breathing specifically?

787
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,277
For breathing specifically, yeah, for breathing specifically.

788
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:59,138
So, I'm not sure. I don't know the answer to that one.

789
00:45:59,478 --> 00:45:59,758
I mean...

790
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:00,498
I don't know if you have...

791
00:46:00,538 --> 00:46:03,179
Yeah, I mean, just a spitball.

792
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,660
Like, you know, captions, heavier breathing?

793
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,840
Like, is that kind of a suggestion?

794
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,320
So are they...

795
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,101
Or like, maybe...

796
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:10,081
It's a good idea, I mean...

797
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:12,343
I think my question might have been a little confusing.

798
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:17,229
I actually meant more of hard of seeing, where players are relying on so much sound in their

799
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:22,254
environment where the louder we get around the player, now they're having more difficulty

800
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:24,336
actually being able to understand where the sound is coming from.

801
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:30,343
So I'm curious to see how you guys adapt to that system and having to still be accessible.

802
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:39,087
No, that's great. Yeah, I mean on part two, definitely, you know, a lot of folks were talking about, and I agreed and I wish we added this, but

803
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:48,954
an infected slider, or basically a toggle to kind of tame the infected, because, you know, the clicker frenzy was, is, many people,

804
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,267
doesn't sit well with them.

805
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,929
Like it's painful, it physically hurts them to hear

806
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:55,390
that kind of quality of sound,

807
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,392
really high frequency piercing grating.

808
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:01,254
And yeah, like that was, I think that was tossed around,

809
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:03,315
but I'm not sure, I don't think it happened unfortunately,

810
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:05,296
but that's a great question, yeah.

811
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:06,817
Learning opportunity for everyone, honestly.

812
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:07,498
Yeah, exactly.

813
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:10,040
And it's, yeah, totally possible.

814
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,361
I could totally see, yeah, like a breathing cold,

815
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:15,763
like maybe don't have it as maybe loud or as prominent

816
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:19,546
or as a constant, I'm not sure, but.

817
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,621
Yeah, no, it's something to think about for sure. It's a good one.

818
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:22,081
Thanks.

819
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:27,885
That's what's cool about it. We are always thinking about it and there's, you know, coming off of God of War Ragnarok,

820
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:31,827
like, we did a lot of, you know, looking at the industry and going, what can we do?

821
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:36,770
How can we be better? And I think every game, there's so many opportunities to be better, especially for sound.

822
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,513
Mm-hmm. You guys did an amazing job. It was a very impressive game, audio-wise, so.

823
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:41,513
Awesome. Thank you so much.

824
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:42,033
Thank you.

825
00:47:44,015 --> 00:47:44,195
Hi.

826
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:54,872
When it comes to, you mentioned the compression and stretching of animations based on the

827
00:47:54,912 --> 00:48:00,475
length of the sound for the breathing, was that applied to other things or just the facial

828
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:01,035
animations?

829
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:04,497
I was also applied, I mean, so it was applied to a lot of things.

830
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:06,118
Things meaning animations?

831
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:07,319
Yeah.

832
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:08,740
Driving animations based on...

833
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:12,443
Yeah, so it was applied to other types of animations, not just facial animations.

834
00:48:12,483 --> 00:48:15,725
Like we showed the example with Abby with her shoulders, her entire shoulder set.

835
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:20,489
For the baby, which was very like, a last minute thing, because we were trying to figure out...

836
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:23,110
You know, depending on the type of content you have,

837
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,411
babies can be really hard to put together.

838
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:30,232
So we actually got specific animations tied to the specific audio that we made.

839
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:35,174
Little things like, OK, if the baby laughs, we can have parcels where it'll lean back

840
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:37,895
as Ellie's holding the baby and it'll throw its arm up like this,

841
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:39,816
or maybe it'll throw both arms up or throw the left arm up.

842
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:44,721
So I had the exact same system being able to choose, okay, well, which animation are we going to play?

843
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:48,965
And then if the baby—I had sneezes in there as well, which is part of the breathing loop—

844
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:51,748
the baby would be cooing or whichever, and then when the baby would sneeze,

845
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,652
it would play that asset. The plug-in grain would then tell the game, like,

846
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:59,936
oh, okay, play this one out of three sneezing animations, and it needs to be this long.

847
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,418
So it would literally animate the baby to sneeze.

848
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,722
And it would sneeze, or it would cough, you know, this like disgusting child cough.

849
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,183
And it would cough, you know.

850
00:49:09,124 --> 00:49:13,088
So yeah, we were actually able to build custom animations based on the sound for that thing.

851
00:49:13,108 --> 00:49:18,773
And the whole baby moving around and coughing and sneezing all in the right time is all based off of that system.

852
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:22,716
So it was cool because you can kind of do a lot of things with it other than just the facial animation.

853
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:24,017
You're making me think, though.

854
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,347
That sounds awesome. Thank you.

855
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:29,048
Yeah, thank you.

856
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:30,348
What other animations can we do?

857
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:30,989
Oh, we can do a lot.

858
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,531
Stretch, based on sound, speak my language.

859
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:35,971
Oh. How's it going?

860
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:38,993
Yeah, so you have your murmur system,

861
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:41,154
which is just a loop that's going on the entire time,

862
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:45,877
which I'm assuming isn't being synced with facial animations and breaths,

863
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:50,339
or maybe it is, but I'm wondering, so like, you showed later

864
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,660
that there were specific breaths that were...

865
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:59,584
that were informing the animation and they were specific lengths for those breadths.

866
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:04,886
I was wondering if there's anything that you guys need to do as audio guys,

867
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:08,548
or if you just kind of send those variables over to animation and they just handle it.

868
00:50:10,197 --> 00:50:10,838
Does that make sense?

869
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:15,163
So, the first part, I believe, of the question you were saying, like with the memorization

870
00:50:15,283 --> 00:50:18,648
loop is pretty interesting, like, you know, are there facial animations tied to all that?

871
00:50:18,688 --> 00:50:24,014
So every individual breath that happens in any bucket can be, you know, hundreds of breaths

872
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,338
has a corresponding plug-and-grain for facial animation.

873
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:27,976
That's crazy.

874
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:29,277
So every single one has one.

875
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:32,539
And we had to enter, actually, Grayson Stone is right there.

876
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:36,582
He painstakingly entered every individual millisecond number

877
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:39,104
for every individual, which we are trying to streamline

878
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:40,485
better, but that's how it was.

879
00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:41,706
And that's how we did it for the next one.

880
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:44,307
But yeah, he helped out with basically choosing mouth open,

881
00:50:44,348 --> 00:50:45,989
mouth closed, and that.

882
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:46,909
So it is for every single one.

883
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:49,811
So it's not just like a loop, a straight up loop

884
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:50,612
that you're just playing.

885
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,993
It's literally individual.

886
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,254
Yeah, one shot.

887
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:57,335
I don't think I mentioned that, but yeah, each breath asset is an exhale into an inhale.

888
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,096
Gotcha, okay.

889
00:50:58,116 --> 00:50:58,996
Together in one.

890
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:03,918
And we found that that, because it's funny, I'm actually consulting a lot with other folks

891
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,800
doing a breathing system, and there's so many ways to do it, you know?

892
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,382
And just personally, especially with the Naughty Dog engine and the dialogue, it kind of makes

893
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:17,184
sense to do an exhale, then an inhale, because an exhale is almost like an effort or a line.

894
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:18,144
For sure, yeah.

895
00:51:18,164 --> 00:51:20,185
When you're speaking or efforting, you're exhaling.

896
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:24,950
Giving your breath and then you're inhaling. Yeah, so when it we're stitching it all together

897
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,573
It becomes more in line and becomes more seamless and cohesive

898
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:35,373
Yeah, basically each individual state or each individual type of breath table within that one main loop that's always on,

899
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:39,717
it's constantly checking variables, different states, heart rates, things like that.

900
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:43,561
And it's picking the inhale, the exhale, the inhale, the exhale from all different buckets.

901
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,363
That's why you get a lot of good variety on it.

902
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:53,330
And it's like, I mean, some of the individual, like one, like, just stealth breath or just combat breath may be like a...

903
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,574
350 line scream script that's bouncing back and forth between that and another

904
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:02,878
350 line scream script just choosing. It's messy.

905
00:52:03,698 --> 00:52:09,062
I would think of like just the looping sound as just a nest of logic.

906
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,066
It's just a lot of deep logic instead of, yeah, because usually like

907
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:17,729
traditionally, you know, me before doing all this work for part two, I would have

908
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,232
a loop is a sound that has a zero crossing and it loops.

909
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:26,013
But with Scream, it's just nested structures of logic and it gets so dense.

910
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:30,554
The systemic stuff is just one loop.

911
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:35,936
We can play so many different variations of sounds based on all this data.

912
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:38,496
I don't want to take up too much time.

913
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:40,997
So you have random containers filled with...

914
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:47,124
this level of effort, and then that's the loop that's cycling between those.

915
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:51,987
So it plays whatever, waits for the voice to finish, then goes back up and does a bunch of checks.

916
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:54,809
And then it's like, oh, I'm injured, so I'm going to go down here, right?

917
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,871
And based on your velocity, possibly, of running or things like that,

918
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:01,593
it will actually change a random delay grain to delay the breath between each other.

919
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:06,056
So if you're more exhausted, that delay can be less, so that breath, it's like you're, you know,

920
00:53:07,176 --> 00:53:07,477
rather than...

921
00:53:08,947 --> 00:53:13,511
So that randomness of that delay based on the height of the heart rate will actually

922
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:16,695
allow those like the space between the breaths to give a whole different set.

923
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:18,577
Yeah, that's so cool.

924
00:53:18,937 --> 00:53:19,297
Really cool.

925
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:20,118
Thank you so much.

926
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:20,779
Yeah, thank you.

927
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:21,360
Thanks for the question.

928
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:23,306
Hi.

929
00:53:23,546 --> 00:53:25,046
It's really cool what you guys built.

930
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:28,547
I had a question regarding the animations driven by sound.

931
00:53:29,828 --> 00:53:33,229
One of the things that is kind of interesting animation system

932
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:35,369
is priority based, like who's driving the animation

933
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:36,490
and who takes precedence.

934
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,430
How did you guys resolve that with regards

935
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,751
to the sounds that are driving facial animation

936
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,751
versus the dialogue system potentially coming in

937
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,092
or other systems coming in?

938
00:53:44,672 --> 00:53:47,153
Same with any of the other kind of full body or shoulder.

939
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:57,455
Yeah, I mean, I think the whole murmuration loop was pretty bulletproof in that it will always wait for a voice and you will never hear overlapping breaths.

940
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,916
That was pretty much impossible from what I've seen.

941
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:06,599
And so there was no issue with the facial animations that were driven by the breathing stuff,

942
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:14,483
but of course, yes, there's going to be the systemic lip flap for gameplay lines and all the narrative lines.

943
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:16,104
And.

944
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:22,876
I'm not exactly sure, but I assume that the dialogue system stopped the breathing loop

945
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:27,201
and then that lip flap took over or that other animation took over.

946
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:33,189
So I think it all just kind of worked where things would trump in line with our VoxPriority

947
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:33,970
stuff.

948
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,553
So the animations would also work in that way.

949
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:40,366
And a lot of times we'd have efforts with certain animations, like jumping over something

950
00:54:40,426 --> 00:54:44,169
or swinging, whatever I was saying before, and they would have their own, it's its own

951
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:47,492
animation, its own facial animation, so that would take priority and that would play and

952
00:54:47,512 --> 00:54:49,594
then it would go back to our breathing loop with our animations.

953
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:55,700
And it was pretty seamless, the way that would go, but also it helps that it's more difficult

954
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,462
to turn the camera around, it's not perfect.

955
00:54:57,942 --> 00:55:07,472
So, you know, you're typically, the camera's kind of behind you, so it was like when that would switch, it would feel kind of seamless because you weren't necessarily looking right at the player's face.

956
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:12,398
So, you know, it's not, like I said, it's not perfect, but it did give that sense.

957
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:14,840
It switched, I think, between it pretty seamlessly.

958
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,502
Cool. Thank you.

959
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:16,702
Thank you.

960
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:25,885
All right, hey, I came in a little late to the talk, but I caught the end and it sounds very

961
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:30,146
cool and it's like, wow, I didn't realize there was like a whole breathing system.

962
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:35,088
I myself am visually impaired and I have friends that are completely blind, so I want to first

963
00:55:35,128 --> 00:55:40,389
commemorate you and the rest of the audio team on like doing such a good job that a completely blind

964
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:44,590
person can play the game and especially with the audio descriptive cut scenes in part one,

965
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,091
like I've never seen any game do that. So that's super cool.

966
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:56,482
And I also wanted to know, like, was it easy to, how difficult was it to preview,

967
00:55:57,503 --> 00:56:03,206
like the, like, you know, preview and QA test, like the, like how well all the

968
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:08,530
different breathing loops work, cause it sounds like such a, like a nitpicky thing

969
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,332
to be like, okay, we have to go in this scene and like, like, you're like run the

970
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:15,254
game and like, okay, we have to wait for it to run.

971
00:56:15,294 --> 00:56:17,355
And, you know, like how, how complex was that?

972
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:28,735
I mean, it all started with Ashley Johnson's work on the 2018 E3 demo, where she was going

973
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:32,897
through the forest and then you meet the Seraphites for the first time, the gutting, all that

974
00:56:33,117 --> 00:56:34,017
whole E3 demo.

975
00:56:34,677 --> 00:56:39,079
She did basically a run of just that whole moment, like linearly.

976
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:45,041
You know, was in the booth and did a, like, breathing, exertions, efforts, through that whole thing.

977
00:56:45,741 --> 00:56:51,003
And I was able to take all that content and a couple of additional stuff and just kind of figure it all out.

978
00:56:51,063 --> 00:56:56,545
Like, alright, with what I have, how can I make this work? The whole breathing stuff, right? The whole system.

979
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:58,085
And then, with that...

980
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:03,408
We were able to go, alright, we now know what we need, like exactly.

981
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,989
So then we were able to go with Laura Bailey, alright, this is what we need.

982
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:10,651
Like no questions, we know because we already built it with Ashley's set, right?

983
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:14,353
So when recording Ashley, that was interesting because we just needed like a little bit more,

984
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:18,355
you know, because we already had so much from her, we already built most of what you heard

985
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:22,157
before doing a proper breathing session.

986
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:25,678
I think, does that answer your question?

987
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:34,632
I guess I'm coming from the point of, so I do sound for games and like a lot of times

988
00:57:34,672 --> 00:57:39,415
like when tying stuff to animations it can be very difficult when the engine, I know

989
00:57:39,435 --> 00:57:42,417
you guys got your own engine so I'm sure you sort of like easier, but like for example

990
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:46,599
like with Unity it's like you gotta, it's like okay the animation event is here.

991
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,021
Now to actually see this, first I have to run the game,

992
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:52,962
and then I have to do the animation,

993
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:54,723
and then like, oh no, it's not off.

994
00:57:54,963 --> 00:57:57,184
I pause it, like stop it, move it over.

995
00:57:57,204 --> 00:57:59,325
Oh sorry, you're talking about like iteration process.

996
00:57:59,505 --> 00:58:01,886
Yeah, so how difficult was that?

997
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:03,427
Not too bad.

998
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,548
Yeah, so screen in the proprietary middleware

999
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:07,469
has a lot of really great features.

1000
00:58:07,629 --> 00:58:09,489
So you basically like restart script.

1001
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:17,560
You can connect to the game, be able to adjust your logic, I believe you can adjust the sounds, and you can hot reload banks.

1002
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,462
Yeah, it'll just immediately update in the game as you edit, whether it's CC sounds, things like that.

1003
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:30,225
Also, the iteration process of choosing breaths takes a little bit of time because it's all about the feel of being able to get it right.

1004
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,925
It does handle it pretty well, trying to iterate,

1005
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:34,966
the process of iterating.

1006
00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:35,327
Is that?

1007
00:58:35,567 --> 00:58:36,268
I'm not sure if that answers.

1008
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:37,909
Yeah, that answers it.

1009
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:39,791
Now I have to figure out how to recreate that in Y school.

1010
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:40,833
Yeah.

1011
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:41,674
Thank you.

1012
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:42,294
Yeah, thank you.

1013
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:42,815
Thank you so much.

1014
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:44,960
We have time for one more.

1015
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,640
Yeah.

1016
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,441
Perfect.

1017
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:47,821
Look at that.

1018
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:48,141
It's me.

1019
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:48,621
It's you.

1020
00:58:48,681 --> 00:58:52,664
Hey, so did you guys run into any issues with the breathing

1021
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:56,105
animation being restricted to 30 frames with the randomness

1022
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,607
that you were intending for the breath?

1023
00:58:58,627 --> 00:58:59,047
What frames?

1024
00:58:59,407 --> 00:58:59,607
30 frames.

1025
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:00,187
30 frames.

1026
00:59:00,227 --> 00:59:00,468
30 frames.

1027
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:01,868
Is it restricted to 30 frames?

1028
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:03,169
I don't think so.

1029
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,533
Oh, I thought that's what you said.

1030
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:05,914
30 frames.

1031
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:08,476
Oh, no, no, yeah, sorry, yeah.

1032
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:10,157
Any restrictions with them being 30 frames long?

1033
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:10,717
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,618
I don't think we...

1035
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:14,459
With the randomness, because I feel like, I mean, 30 frames was that...

1036
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,101
Oh, I see what, yeah.

1037
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:17,802
Right, with the amount of time.

1038
00:59:17,942 --> 00:59:20,403
What was interesting is, yeah, it was literally like one breath.

1039
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:26,147
It wasn't like, oh, this is variation number two or four of this one breath for the animation.

1040
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:27,728
It was one base animation.

1041
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:31,931
And then, you know, after a while I asked Keith for,

1042
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:33,833
oh, can you give me like a different kind of exhaustive?

1043
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:36,316
So there was sort of variations of the exhausted.

1044
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:39,759
But I think for the most part, because of that whole setup

1045
00:59:39,779 --> 00:59:41,781
that the programmers were able to do where it would, you know,

1046
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:45,064
compress or stretch or whatever, that 30-frame animation,

1047
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,006
it's just hard to see the sameness.

1048
00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:48,727
Like it just...

1049
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:54,209
A lot of the audio felt very varied, like it was, you know, it felt varied.

1050
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:58,630
So the facial just kind of fell in line and you didn't, I don't know, like the association,

1051
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:03,511
I didn't look at it and go, oh yeah, this feels samey or uninteresting or.

1052
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:08,892
Because it seemed a little choppy and it wasn't, it wasn't like a, you know,

1053
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:12,633
a criticism.

1054
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,693
Why there was kind of

1055
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:19,790
and hearing the

1056
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:23,772
30 frames I

1057
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:27,774
The other questions it's definitely not

1058
01:00:33,398 --> 01:00:34,818
Like it's it really helps else

1059
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,641
Her nose and out there her mouth

1060
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:43,003
Round or was able to see the player

1061
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:46,925
It really helped with that stuff if you

1062
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:50,294
I never noticed.

1063
01:00:50,394 --> 01:00:50,794
I don't know.

1064
01:01:18,644 --> 01:01:23,147
So it's like you're being yourself to the enemy.

1065
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:30,710
So in that situation, the whole thing is to sell like.

1066
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:38,314
So as soon as you and she'll be.

1067
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:43,017
So there was certain tech created for that.

1068
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:47,139
So I mean.

1069
01:01:50,395 --> 01:01:54,160
Her mouth will be in the correct position.

1070
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,405
But it's a really good thing that we're trying to do.

1071
01:01:58,786 --> 01:01:59,106
Thank you.

1072
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:01,069
Alright, one more. Can we do one more?

1073
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,991
Very cool. Well, thank you all for coming out.

1074
01:02:11,452 --> 01:02:12,332
You can ask one of them.

1075
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:13,353
We'll quickly answer them. It's quick.

1076
01:02:13,653 --> 01:02:13,973
Let's do it.

1077
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:14,553
Then we'll go.

1078
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:15,334
The last one, sorry.

1079
01:02:16,214 --> 01:02:17,035
I have a question.

1080
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:20,957
If you have any problems with the transitions

1081
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:25,659
between the loop system and the individual efforts,

1082
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:29,081
like, I don't know, hittings, jumpings, and so on,

1083
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:31,102
because sometimes it sounds...

1084
01:02:31,743 --> 01:02:34,404
Each individual sound in-stream has an answer,

1085
01:02:34,804 --> 01:02:35,945
and so I believe...

1086
01:02:36,505 --> 01:02:38,506
I think we set the release to be pretty...

1087
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:40,548
You know, long-ish.

1088
01:02:40,648 --> 01:02:45,452
So, yeah, you would never get anything super jarring

1089
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:47,334
when a sound would stop.

1090
01:02:47,794 --> 01:02:51,357
And the only time the loop would actually aggressively get cut off

1091
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:53,339
was when you were sprinting or not sprinting,

1092
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:55,281
which is why this whole catch idea happened,

1093
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:57,083
where, like, right when you let go,

1094
01:02:57,703 --> 01:02:58,424
without having, like, a...

1095
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:02,673
Without having that, it felt really, like, oh,

1096
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:05,214
it sort of digitally just stopped, right?

1097
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:07,136
It felt fake, so we had to, like,

1098
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:10,557
fake the realness by adding something, like, organic,

1099
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:12,478
like a catch the moment you let go,

1100
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:14,299
to kind of blend it all, but.

1101
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:15,860
Yeah.

1102
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:17,141
Thanks.

1103
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:17,841
Thank you.

1104
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:18,262
Thank you.
