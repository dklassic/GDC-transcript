1
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:12,224
Holy crap, a lot of people turned up. I'm totally pumped because the crazy Cliffy B,

2
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:16,909
Peter Molyneux mega panel is going on at the same time. So I was expecting no one to turn

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:17,069
up.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,939
I'm just looking around to see if anyone realized they're supposed to be at that instead and

5
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:21,919
are about to run out the door.

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,920
All right, so I've just been told to let everyone know to turn off your noise-making devices

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,901
in whatever form that may be.

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:31,721
And yeah, we'll get started.

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,822
So this talk is called Depth in Simplicity, the Making of Jetpack Joyride.

10
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:37,902
My name's Luke Muscat.

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,183
I'm Chief Creative Officer at Halfbrick Studios.

12
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:46,284
I made these, Fruit Ninja, Monster Dash, Jetpack Joyride, and a whole bunch of other games

13
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:47,665
that no one cares about or has heard of.

14
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:49,766
So let's just move along.

15
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:54,573
So this talk is kind of like a post-mortem sort of.

16
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:58,177
I'm really just going to be stepping through a lot

17
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:00,861
of the different design stuff we did for Jetpack Joyride.

18
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,023
It kind of might get a little bit crazy at times.

19
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:07,066
I started organizing it all chronologically,

20
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,228
but because we worked on so many features in unison,

21
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,769
it was kind of jumping around everywhere.

22
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:13,451
So we sort of look at a feature from beginning to end

23
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,294
and then travel back in time and check out some more stuff.

24
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:19,417
So yeah, and there's way more in here

25
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,698
than I can fit into an hour.

26
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,539
There's heaps of other stuff I wanted to talk about.

27
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,321
So we'll see how we go.

28
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:27,143
So just for a bit of context,

29
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:29,905
Huffrick Studios is now over 50 people.

30
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:33,746
But internally we're divided up into a bunch of teams.

31
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:37,067
This is my extremely attractive, good-looking team right here.

32
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:37,968
We're seven people.

33
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:41,249
And we actually work on two projects at once.

34
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:44,851
So right now half of the team is working on jetpack joyride updates.

35
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,392
The other half is working on prototyping some new IP.

36
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,315
It's just kind of useful to let everyone know that this is how we work,

37
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:55,159
because when I say, hey, we spent 10 months working on a one-button game,

38
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,662
people go, what, 50 people for 10 months?

39
00:01:58,062 --> 00:01:59,103
It's not like that.

40
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,128
Jetpack Joyride was pretty much, you know, three people at its core,

41
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:06,311
and then, you know, a whole bunch of extra people who helped out along the way.

42
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,416
So, chapter one, a game in four weeks.

43
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:16,696
Originally Jetpack Joyride was going to be this game we made in four weeks.

44
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:19,117
So Fruit Ninja is already out.

45
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:22,399
It's done about three million units or so at this point.

46
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,341
So, you know, we can really tell that that's, you know, going along.

47
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,922
It's got its own velocity now, which is great.

48
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,623
Monster Dash was already out, and it was doing good.

49
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,224
It was sort of starting to flag off a bit.

50
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:36,566
And, you know, it wasn't really carrying that same momentum as Fruit Ninja.

51
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:37,747
So we were looking to do something new.

52
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:42,498
and we kinda had this idea where you know we really liked the machine gun jetpack in

53
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:46,621
monster dash it seemed really badass and you know when we were coming up with it the spec

54
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:52,425
was what's the craziest most ridiculous stupid weapon we can make and the machine gun jetpack

55
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,245
is what we came up with.

56
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,272
So we had this idea of maybe what we'll do is

57
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:01,854
we'll kind of hack up Monster Dash and we'll make this one button game with the

58
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:02,834
machine gun jetpack

59
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:05,996
and we'll make it in four weeks and we'll just release it for free

60
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,658
and it'll be like this kind of, I don't know, almost like a fan service thing

61
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,218
where you know just

62
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,460
hey guys here's something cool we made in four weeks. It just seemed like a nice

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,720
little

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,382
mini project, almost like a distraction on the side that we could work on.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,743
And so right from the beginning, even when it was going to be this really simple four-week game,

66
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:26,885
we had some goals and some pillars of the design.

67
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,547
We wanted it to be one button.

68
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,309
Didn't want to have kind of contextual buttons all over the screen.

69
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,292
Just you touch somewhere, you fly up, you let go, you fall down.

70
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,393
As simple as that.

71
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,755
And you know, we wanted to be super accessible.

72
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,497
Hopefully, one-button game design, pretty accessible.

73
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,459
Most people should get that figured out pretty quickly.

74
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,471
wanted to have this kind of ad break play model that both

75
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,753
Monster Dash and Fruit Ninja had where you could play it in an

76
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,315
ad break, right? Like you can fit it in in a couple of minute

77
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:54,637
break or you know on the train or the bus. But at the same time

78
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:57,059
we were hoping that this time we could add a bit more kind of

79
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,061
depth for the more hardcore players you know we because you

80
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,623
know this was kind of aimed at our fans we thought we could

81
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:06,846
really you know add a bit of extra in there as well. So this

82
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:10,428
is the prototype for Jetpack Joyride. This is programmed by

83
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:11,569
me. I'm not a programmer.

84
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,568
You can tell I made it in one day because I spelled shield wrong.

85
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,429
So this obviously wasn't photoshopped.

86
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,391
And what we did is, you know, I knocked this up in a day. You know, you can tell, it's

87
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,312
simple as anything. It's basically, you know, a cave flyer.

88
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:31,533
You know, just like iCopter or whatever. And just with a couple of power-ups in there to

89
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:33,474
spice it up. And you know, we had some collectibles.

90
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,975
And I sent it out to the office and I was like, all right, whoever gets the highest

91
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:39,016
score at the end of the day wins a candy bar.

92
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:43,978
So something you should know about everyone who works at Halfbrick, they are hyper competitive.

93
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,519
Like crazy competitive.

94
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,681
There's a poker tournament every Friday night, there's a 500 tournament running at the moment,

95
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:54,203
there's a group of 10 people who play Smash Bros every single lunchtime and have done

96
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,284
so for like the last 7 years.

97
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:00,947
So people go, free candy bar! And they just lose their minds.

98
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,890
And it was great because everyone was playing the game.

99
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,652
I mean, it was just simple. I spent like a day on it.

100
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:10,755
It was really basic, but, you know, it became really clear to me really quickly

101
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:13,997
that this game could kind of support that competitive social side,

102
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,098
which was very cool.

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,841
So then, started working on it.

104
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,163
So I just have a little bit of a thing here.

105
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,765
Last year we announced Jetpack Joyride at GDC

106
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:29,588
and I think it might have even been the same day we announced it. I was at a talk here.

107
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:32,952
I can't remember which talk so I apologize for whoever it was but

108
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:36,795
they said this acronym and then explained what it was during a talk which

109
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,357
was JSI RSO

110
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,380
which stood for jamming shit in and ripping shit out.

111
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,262
And I'm sitting in the crowd and I'm like, oh my god!

112
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,744
That's Jetpack Joyride.

113
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,045
That's exactly how we've gone about developing that,

114
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,766
and you'll kind of see that as I go through,

115
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:52,747
you know, the design process for this.

116
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,589
Right from the beginning, you know, we kind of had this

117
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,750
vision of what we wanted it to be, you know,

118
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,992
this simple accessible game with lots of explosions, basically.

119
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:01,492
But...

120
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:08,077
we certainly couldn't have envisioned how big and crazy and out of control our development got.

121
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:13,221
So you'll see as I'm going through this, the crap that we tried sticking in there didn't work,

122
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,063
and all the stuff we got rid of.

123
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,186
It's had quite an interesting life,

124
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:23,390
which is cool, it makes it good for post-mortem style critique.

125
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,222
So this is the game at three days old.

126
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:29,484
Isn't it beautiful?

127
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:31,886
I remember when it was just a boy.

128
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:36,850
And you know, you can sort of see already we have some basic stuff in there,

129
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,193
the jetpack's in there, we have some coins, mucking around with some lasers, there's

130
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:40,573
some things

131
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:42,755
to dodge and also it looks like shit.

132
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:48,904
So one of the first things I had to work on was, you know, the procedural level generation.

133
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,105
I really wanted to do procedural level stuff.

134
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,508
And that's not because I'm against level design. I love level design.

135
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:59,110
You know, before I started Fruit Ninja and all that, level design was my bread and butter.

136
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:00,953
I have a big passion for it.

137
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,756
But there was this simple fact when I was working on

138
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,839
both Fruit Ninja and Monster Dash at the same time,

139
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,442
one designer, I was shit at a time.

140
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:12,024
There was no way I would have had the time to author levels.

141
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,627
So we thought we'd go with procedural levels.

142
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:18,291
And this is why you can see like this extremely scientific,

143
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,973
well-researched graph right here.

144
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:29,673
This is kind of my feeling on, you know, the design workload on a procedural level design game versus an authored level game.

145
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,777
So with an authored level, you know, right at the beginning you're getting your mechanics going and all that and that's cool.

146
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:37,640
And you can knock out some white box levels, test out some stuff and that's cool.

147
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,225
And then for the life of the project, you're forever working on the levels, making new ones, generating content for your game.

148
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,466
With procedural levels, it's a bit different because

149
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,408
although in the back-end you don't have to do all that creation, up front

150
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:53,389
you can't do anything until you have the system working.

151
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,930
You gotta sit down with the programmer and figure out how this thing's gonna work,

152
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,811
how you're gonna edit it, what you might need to do in the future,

153
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,092
how it's gonna be extensible.

154
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,653
So it takes a bunch of extra time up front.

155
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,974
But then on the back-end, you know, the workload gets a lot lower.

156
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:09,775
It doesn't go all the way down to zero, just like any design.

157
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,516
It needs to be iterated on and refined and improved.

158
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,066
But yeah, so that was kind of my feeling about doing procedural level generation.

159
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,570
So we had all these different entities we wanted to place.

160
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,853
Zappers, coins, lasers, all kinds of stuff.

161
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,865
And we came up with this idea of the interval system.

162
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,408
This is extremely basic, this is not rocket science by any means.

163
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,109
Basically, the game comes up with a whole set of intervals,

164
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:33,631
you know, down the corridor that Barry runs down,

165
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:39,394
and every type of entity has the probability of falling into the next slot.

166
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:42,196
So it's like a 50% chance it'll be a zapper,

167
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:44,457
50% or, sorry, 20% chance it'll be coins,

168
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,038
20% chance it'll be missiles,

169
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,360
and 10% chance it'll be something else.

170
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,441
So you know, this is all pretty simple stuff.

171
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,476
So then the problem was figuring out, you know,

172
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:57,238
where to put these intervals.

173
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:58,980
By the way, if you're looking at this screen

174
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,862
and for some reason, and you don't know why,

175
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,224
your fingers are cramping up,

176
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:06,149
it's because I was looking for an athletics track

177
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,772
and I just completely stole the background out of QWOP.

178
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:16,502
So a regular interval system, you know, you see, it's there, it's reliable, but it's boring.

179
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:21,245
So if we randomize it a bit and have totally random intervals, then that's cool,

180
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,608
but total random is crazy, right?

181
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,271
It's really hard to keep track of what's happening in a total random system,

182
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:30,132
and maybe it works fine, like 90% of the time.

183
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,630
But then every now and then you'll have that outlier where

184
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,232
you have this massive gap and nothing happens and there's no gates and then, you know,

185
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,414
all of a sudden there's like three gates right on top of each other and, you know, that's no good.

186
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:46,596
So our solution is pretty basic. It's basically, you know, you have a minimum interval length,

187
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,277
a maximum interval length and you randomize inside that.

188
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:54,220
Again, there's nothing all that exciting about that, but what's really, really good about this system

189
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,121
for, you know, randomizing and, you know, doing procedural level generation

190
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,862
is how easy it is to change.

191
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,313
you can really easily modify that minimum interval length and maximum interval length

192
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,154
and in doing so you dramatically change

193
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,835
the difficulty of the game.

194
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:14,638
Monster Dash, when we had that, that just got faster and faster and faster forever

195
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,921
and the problem was, at a point you were just jumping blindly and just

196
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,763
hoping you would make it over stuff. It got so fast that there's no way you could

197
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:23,603
actually react.

198
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:27,396
By using this system, we were able to do it a bit smarter.

199
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,957
You speed up at the beginning, and then your speed

200
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:30,698
stays constant.

201
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:32,318
And we start messing with these numbers.

202
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:35,319
We start bringing the minimum, maximum interval lengths down.

203
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,000
And that brings everything closer together

204
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,541
and requires the player to have more accuracy when

205
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,662
flying between obstacles.

206
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:47,321
So the minimum interval is what's really interesting in this MinMax system,

207
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:51,425
because the minimum intervals kind of represents what's unfair about the game.

208
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,528
So in Monster Dash we had these enemies, the zombies are a good one,

209
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,790
where they just pop out right in front of you, right?

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,533
And where they can pop out in front of you is measured in distance from Barry,

211
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,075
and there's a minimum and a maximum value.

212
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:09,810
And the minimum value is really deciding how unfair this system is, right?

213
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,731
So here's some more scientific graphs, as you'll see.

214
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,132
I'm all about really carefully researched data, you can tell.

215
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,913
And this is the player reaction-o-meter.

216
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,414
And obviously, if this zombie appears right in front of your nose,

217
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,395
the player's just gonna be like, well, fuck this game.

218
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,136
You know, screw this. This is impossible.

219
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,077
This game is treating me unfairly.

220
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:30,637
I want to have nothing to do with it.

221
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,498
slide it along a bit and you know it'll still be impossible,

222
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:37,439
but then you're gonna start getting this point where it's gonna get a bit blurry

223
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,561
and they're gonna be like, well maybe if I was just a little bit faster,

224
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:43,962
just a little bit quicker off the mark, then I could have gotten it.

225
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:48,383
And a little bit past that, you know, where they actually get it at the very last moment,

226
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:51,864
that's your crazy oh shit moment, which you know, the player feels really good about.

227
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:56,666
So really where this minimum interval is set is deciding how unfair the game is.

228
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,207
And...

229
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:05,041
Fruit Ninja, Monster Dash, Jetpack Joyride are all deliberately designed to be a little bit unfair.

230
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,313
So in Fruit Ninja you have the bombs and often you know like the bombs get right up in the fruit.

231
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:14,517
We could do something about that. We could make it so you know the bombs never overlap with the fruit.

232
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,620
But it's deliberately has a little bit of overlap at least.

233
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,122
Because we want the game to be a little bit unfair.

234
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:24,705
And the reason is, is in these games that are all about you know getting a high score

235
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,488
and then retrying to get a high score again and again and again.

236
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,710
By making the game a little bit unfair,

237
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,873
the player can assign some of the blame on their failure on the game.

238
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,325
you know, rather than getting to 200 points and going, well,

239
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,607
I'm never gonna beat that, I've reached my maximum skill limit.

240
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,488
By making the game a little bit unfair,

241
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:46,010
the player can go, well, if only that bomb wasn't there,

242
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:50,413
if only I got that extra critical, if only, you know, all these scenarios.

243
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:54,575
They're placing some of the blame and, you know, some of the credit as well, to be sure,

244
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:58,157
on the game itself rather than entirely on themselves, and it doesn't

245
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,779
sting so much when you don't get the high score.

246
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:06,796
So when you think about it, Fruit Ninja, classic mode at least,

247
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,679
Monster Dash and Jetpack Joyride

248
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,642
don't seem like they're going to be a really good game for the player because

249
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:16,765
effectively it's an inevitable march towards failure.

250
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:18,287
There's no finish.

251
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,711
The end game for every game is failure on the player's behalf.

252
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:29,305
So when you're doing a game like that, it's really important to make sure you fully understand what the costs of failure are.

253
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:32,327
These for me are the three big costs of failure. Time lost,

254
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,708
the feeling of failure, like the emotion,

255
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,212
and the friction on starting again, or the retry loop, how long it takes to retry the game and get going again.

256
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,807
So time lost, you know, changes a lot for different games.

257
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,648
This is really vaguely organized, like on the left,

258
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,289
from not much time lost to right, more time lost.

259
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,249
So, you know, Canabalt, if you're really shit like I am,

260
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,990
your times are only like 10 seconds long.

261
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,391
So, you know, when you fail,

262
00:13:57,811 --> 00:13:59,091
it really doesn't hurt that much.

263
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,331
You're ready to go again,

264
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,432
and you can just keep going and going and going and going.

265
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:09,577
even when they throw, you know, unfair situations at you like the glass window you have to jump in

266
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:13,979
and the crazy car bomb thing that falls right in front of you, it doesn't hurt quite so much.

267
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,622
On the other hand, you know, a game like Spelunky, you could be spending quite a long time on that before you die.

268
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:24,904
And that, you know, you really feel it when you die in that game, you know,

269
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:29,206
you scream at your monitor and all of that, which is fine, you know, for the game it is, that works perfectly,

270
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:33,308
but especially on a mobile game, you want to be careful on how much time lost there is.

271
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:38,154
There's also the emotional cost, so just how bad you feel.

272
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:41,356
So if we just came up and as soon as you die in Jetpack it says,

273
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:45,578
you failed and you're worthless as a human being.

274
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,100
That's probably not a great way to treat the player.

275
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,042
So what we do with a lot of our games is we actually reward the player for failing.

276
00:14:52,762 --> 00:14:54,303
In Fruit Ninja, you know, when you...

277
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,808
When you die when you hit a bomb in classic mode or drop the fruit

278
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,169
We actually give you like a nice little fruit fact there

279
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:06,831
You know gives you something to take your mind off the failure sensei's there. He's smiling at you like yeah, good job

280
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:10,933
So you know we do a lot of things to minimize the emotional cost

281
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,890
In Jetpack Joyride we took this to the extreme.

282
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,691
So you know, you die and then you have the slot machine.

283
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,672
So like a whole nother mini game of prizes and excitement.

284
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,372
And then even on the results screen

285
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,273
we have the little Polaroid photo of you

286
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,713
that gives you something to focus on.

287
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,454
You got the leaderboards to check out.

288
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,274
You know, you're getting all of this kind of

289
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:33,135
positive feedback and all this recognition for your game.

290
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,616
If you get new best, then stuff pops up as well.

291
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:39,136
We really do a lot of steps to minimize

292
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,417
the emotional cost to the player.

293
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:45,799
There's even this thing we do where, originally, when you ran into a zapper,

294
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,700
Barry just vaporized instantly. He just went, poof!

295
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,222
And that was it. That was your score that you got.

296
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:56,004
What we found by, you know, changing it so that he kind of, you know, gets zapped,

297
00:15:56,044 --> 00:16:00,726
and he bounces along and slides on his face, and sometimes he bounces and picks up a few coins,

298
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:05,048
and if you're really lucky, you know, maybe you might pick up a spin token or something else along the way,

299
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:08,950
or even complete a mission sometimes when you just need those extra few meters.

300
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,476
is it almost fades in the failure

301
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,678
rather than just being instantaneous, boom, you have failed.

302
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:18,979
I mean, you take the hit, you know you've taken the hit and you've failed,

303
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,180
but instead of immediately considering

304
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,081
the fact that you've failed,

305
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:26,323
you have this little mini thing, it's only like two seconds or so long,

306
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:29,004
but you're watching Barry bounce, you're kind of anticipating,

307
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:30,945
trying to figure out whether he's gonna, you know,

308
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,987
run into that next zapper or collect that coin or that token.

309
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,688
And it almost fades in the failure in a way.

310
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:48,568
The other stuff that we do is, you know, obviously, if you completed a mission, boom, you know, there's stars and explosions and coins and, you know, we do a lot to really try and make the player feel good about themselves.

311
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,632
Come back to the mission system a little bit later.

312
00:16:51,964 --> 00:16:54,506
So the other one is restart friction as well.

313
00:16:55,287 --> 00:17:00,371
So when I say restart friction, I mean like how difficult is it for the player to restart the game?

314
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,034
You know, how seamless does it feel?

315
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:10,300
So in Jetpack, you'll notice I have, this is kind of like a comic book, so you start at the top left and read across.

316
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,503
When the final spin machine comes up, instead of cutting abruptly to a whole different screen,

317
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:23,347
we actually kind of simultaneously slide the machine up and fade the game in the background down,

318
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,588
but the game in the background is always there.

319
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:31,585
So rather than kind of cutting to a whole nother area, you're still being, you know, you're still within the game world.

320
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:37,449
And it just kind of makes it feel a bit more seamless and, you know, rather than kind of cutting out to a whole nother room.

321
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:41,791
Even then when we slide the final spin off, you'll see the game is still in the background.

322
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:45,434
We mess around with the tint of it a bit just so that it doesn't conflict with the menus.

323
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:51,817
And, you know, the other thing is, is we always make sure that restarting is as easy as possible.

324
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:53,678
So in the final spin, if...

325
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,313
You don't want to play if you really just want to go again.

326
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,934
You have the cash in button so you can just tap it,

327
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,455
cash in your tokens, skip past it.

328
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,277
All of these transitions you can tap on the screen

329
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,398
and it will speed up or skip past them.

330
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,459
And then we have the play again button

331
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,720
which is in the bottom right hand corner and massive.

332
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:15,018
And what you'll notice is the play again button is in the bottom right hand corner.

333
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:20,683
So is the cash in button, so is the next button on the missions, so is the continue.

334
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:24,406
Every button that involves you progressing is always in the bottom right hand corner.

335
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:29,771
And the main reason it's there is what we found is in playtesting was people were typically

336
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:33,294
like around 80% of people were using the bottom right hand side of the screen.

337
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:35,294
for actually putting in their input.

338
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:36,915
Even though you can touch anywhere on the screen,

339
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:39,836
the bottom right-hand screen is the preferred area.

340
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,316
So every single thing in the game

341
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,377
that involves you continuing or progressing to the next area

342
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,938
is put in the bottom right-hand corner,

343
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:50,478
and that way, even if you're not really paying attention,

344
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,139
you're kind of playing and talking to someone,

345
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,559
you just keep mashing the bottom right-hand side

346
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:57,140
of the screen, you're gonna go to the next area,

347
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,600
and you're gonna be able to restart.

348
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,742
So, testing.

349
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,045
This is what the game looks like Christmas 2010.

350
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:11,969
You can see it's still called Machine Gun Jetpack at that stage for everyone who

351
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,830
remembers that whole

352
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:18,214
thing. You know, originally you'd touch this window

353
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,636
and Barry was supposed to burst through the window.

354
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:24,758
We actually changed that because then we realized we'd have to, you know, do frames of

355
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,941
Barry facing forward, which is fine, but we wanted to customize

356
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,743
all the different outfits and it meant all these extra frames over time we'd have to do.

357
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:36,117
It's looking pretty simple. You can see this was pre-scientist.

358
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:37,818
We didn't have any scientists in there yet.

359
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:41,199
We added them later just to add some kind of visual interest.

360
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,541
We had a couple of other interesting things in there at this stage.

361
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:49,302
Originally in that crummy flash prototype you had these pickups

362
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,883
that would literally just add meters to how far you'd go.

363
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,164
They were still in there.

364
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,105
And we had these close calls.

365
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,066
So every time you got close to a zapper,

366
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:02,521
you would actually get an extra 20 meters added to your score and then if the next one

367
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,104
you got it as well it would chain up and it would exponentially get higher and higher

368
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:06,544
and higher.

369
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:10,527
We ended up taking that out because even though you know like you know that's your classic

370
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:11,867
risk reward design.

371
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,491
But it was so... it was almost too powerful.

372
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:18,453
It kind of subverted the way people were playing the entire game.

373
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,874
And you spend your entire time trying to get really close to the zappers,

374
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:22,895
and then you would die.

375
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,656
Because the collision on these zappers is, you know,

376
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,256
they're really spiky and everything,

377
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:31,078
it's not super clear, not as clear as, you know, just like a hardcore,

378
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:32,979
this is a red box, don't touch this.

379
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:36,180
It was, you know, it just didn't quite feel right.

380
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,502
We actually took it out to simplify the game a little bit later on.

381
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:43,872
So the way that we do playtesting is,

382
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,396
we do a bunch of different ways, but one of my favorite ones is

383
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:52,062
we'll sit down, we'll go to the company and we'll present the game on a big

384
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:55,085
screen, get the whole company and be like, check it out, this is what we've been

385
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,646
working on.

386
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:59,671
If you like the look of it, come down to our room, we'll put it on your iPhone and

387
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,273
you can play it. You'll be our playtesters.

388
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,586
And then once it's out on everyone's phones in the company,

389
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,108
we almost treat it like it's a live release.

390
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,969
So everyone's sort of coming back to us

391
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,411
and they have all these suggestions and, you know,

392
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,152
bugs and stuff that's coming up.

393
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:15,734
And rather than just sort of like taking all of that in

394
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,296
and then, you know, later on we do another major test,

395
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,317
we actually update the game.

396
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,979
Whoa, I think my thing just fell off.

397
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,231
That's still working? There we go.

398
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,233
And so we would actually treat it like a live release and you know every two

399
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:35,416
weeks we would update the game. We'd even make up these like posters

400
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,218
and you know say this is what else is

401
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:41,060
being added this time. These changes, these fixes.

402
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,663
And we're almost treating it like it's out on the store already and being updated.

403
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:50,407
You can actually see like a final beta. It was still called Machine Gun Jetpack.

404
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:56,058
One of the other things we do is something called street testing.

405
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,301
Full credit to Simon Joslin of the Voxel Agents,

406
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:04,323
who made Train Conductor and some other games for giving me this idea.

407
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:09,846
I've completely stolen it and adopted it because I think it's amazing for casual game testing,

408
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,287
which is literally just...

409
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:16,792
taking the game out on the street on your iPhone and approaching completely

410
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:17,893
random people and saying

411
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:19,635
play this for two minutes

412
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:20,616
and that's it

413
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:26,021
and in terms of evaluating accessibility and you know how quickly people will

414
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:26,942
understand the game

415
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,524
cannot be beaten I highly recommend it

416
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,766
so thank you Simon for that I looked up like

417
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:35,570
games on the street and yeah joust came up

418
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:43,803
So the revelations we had from this very first company playtest that we put out over Christmas,

419
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,664
and putting it out over Christmas turned out to be really cool,

420
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:50,565
because it was right before everyone's two-week break, so everyone got to spend two weeks with it,

421
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:54,587
you know, not in the office, treating it as if it was an actual game on their iPhone.

422
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,168
First thing was that this game needs more time.

423
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:02,390
We'd spent over four weeks already, and it was really obvious to us that it wasn't going to be done

424
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,290
in four weeks or anywhere near four weeks.

425
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,216
The other thing was, you know, Fruit Ninja was getting more and more velocity.

426
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:12,121
And we started to feel like releasing a free kind of half-assed game

427
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:16,726
really doesn't feel like the right way to go about following up Fruit Ninja.

428
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,650
You know, there was already people kind of talking about on the net, like,

429
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,733
ah, what's the next game gonna be? And, you know, we started to feel that pressure.

430
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,708
The playtesters had two major problems.

431
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,270
First, it feels hard and super intense.

432
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,071
There's no low points in the pacing.

433
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,673
And you're always one moment away from death.

434
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,075
And the other one was that there's just not enough variety.

435
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,377
You know, it was simple, but simple to a fault

436
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:41,858
at this point where people were really burning out

437
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,700
and, you know, getting sick of it quite quickly.

438
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,142
So the first problem of intensity, basically this is what the intensity looks like

439
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:50,724
initially when

440
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,585
at this point in the design.

441
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,208
The game starts off, it speeds up and then boom, you're always one hit away from death

442
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,390
and it is intense, it is always intense.

443
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,952
So we're playing around with how can we make this a little bit less intense.

444
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,356
We tried putting in a three-heart system just like Monster Dash,

445
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:11,161
and you kind of get this effect where at the beginning you're kind of cruising along and you're relaxing,

446
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,925
you know, I got three hearts up my sleeve, nothing to worry about, easygoing,

447
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:17,868
and then you take a hit and it kind of jumps up a bit and like, oh.

448
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,069
Shit, I've only got two hearts left.

449
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:24,332
And then you lose the last heart and you're right back up against that intensity line the whole time.

450
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:28,034
Even when we added in hearts to collect and all that, it kind of, you know, just

451
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,855
put some downward steps in this graph. And it really didn't feel

452
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:34,197
right. It still just didn't feel like the best possible solution.

453
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:40,201
We also tried a Call of Duty style intensity. You know, the one you get shot and all the

454
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:43,282
red comes up in your peripheral vision and you've got to make sure...

455
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:46,064
I'm sorry, I know heaps of games other than Call of Duty had done it,

456
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:47,425
you know, even before it.

457
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:52,199
always, that's the one that comes to mind for me. And so what would happen is your

458
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:55,861
intensity would be, you know, semi-low and then you would take a hit and it gets

459
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:56,742
ratcheted right up

460
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,404
and then it would come down again. And the weird thing here was the only way we could

461
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:03,686
kind of kill the player, because we don't want the player to play for too long, remember?

462
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:07,249
We need to keep our cost of failure in terms of time lost

463
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,012
under control. It's to make the game extremely hard, you know, we're throwing

464
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:16,114
millions of zappers at them so they take that second hit while they're in that state.

465
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:17,635
So that didn't quite feel right either.

466
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,112
So we'll come back to that.

467
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,954
Problem two was variety. How do we add more variety?

468
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:28,658
Well, we add variety in the same way that every other game in history has added variety.

469
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:30,059
Power-ups.

470
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,222
And so we're coming up with these power-ups, and the problem is, is

471
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:38,765
again, the game is so simple that we're really struggling to come up with power-ups.

472
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:39,485
We have ones, you know...

473
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:45,257
What are you going to do? You give Barry a shield, you make him invulnerable for a period of time,

474
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:48,358
you slow down the game like a bullet time type thing,

475
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,722
make the zappers smaller. I mean, you know, all these things kind of worked and they were

476
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,884
interesting, but it was far from inspiring.

477
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:59,885
It felt quite basic and wasn't quite there.

478
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:05,148
So we're spending a long time bashing our heads against the wall, like, why is it so, so hard to

479
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,569
come up with power-ups for this game?

480
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,989
So we had this idea of what if we change the controls?

481
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:11,750
Maybe that's what we need to do.

482
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,672
People hate it when you change the controls, right?

483
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:15,972
Because you die.

484
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,874
You don't have enough time to get it figured out, and you die,

485
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:22,136
and it feels really unfair and almost, like, disrespectful to the player.

486
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,418
So this is where the idea of the vehicles came in.

487
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:26,879
The idea of the vehicles is simple.

488
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,721
We're going to change the controls, but we'll do it as a vehicle.

489
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,563
And because it's a vehicle, you'll take the hit, you'll explode,

490
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:34,724
but Barry will be okay.

491
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:35,384
So...

492
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,154
The controls are going to change, yes.

493
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,256
But the thing is, it doesn't really matter.

494
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:41,717
This is just a bonus run anyway.

495
00:26:41,737 --> 00:26:44,399
And because it was a bonus area and there was no real risk

496
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,342
to your overall game, we kind of felt like we could

497
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:50,204
treat the player a little bit more disrespectfully

498
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,466
in this time and make the assumption

499
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:54,168
that they're going to die the first few times

500
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,949
until they figure out how to use the vehicle.

501
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:01,254
And all of a sudden the pacing completely changes for the game.

502
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:04,996
Now it looks like this. It's always really intense still, like that very first graph.

503
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:08,237
But when you get the vehicle, it drops way, way down.

504
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:12,219
You're in a safe area, you've got this cool little variety moment,

505
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,560
you know, the pacing has changed dramatically.

506
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,362
Certainly, you know, while you're in the vehicle, the speed picks up and it does so quite quickly.

507
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:21,983
We don't want you to spend too long in the vehicle,

508
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:23,964
or else it's not going to be special anymore.

509
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,826
But you know, this really, you know, we were really excited about this.

510
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:32,190
You know, the pacing was fixed, the variety was better.

511
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:35,343
more explosions equals more beta, obviously.

512
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:38,484
You can never have too many explosions in a game like this at least.

513
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:41,925
And so, you know, we were feeling really, really good about this.

514
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,386
It was definitely a big breakthrough for us.

515
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:47,727
The other thing was the game had a big injection of character at this point,

516
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:51,008
which is great, because before it was feeling a little bit dry and all that,

517
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:52,789
and, you know, the Barry Steakfries universe,

518
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,350
a game where the very first Barry Steakfries game,

519
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,991
Age of Zombies, the opening line is,

520
00:27:58,131 --> 00:27:59,831
surprise, Professor Shit for Brains.

521
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:03,874
really felt like it needed some extra character in it to, you know,

522
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:05,714
make sense that it's Barry Steakfries.

523
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,215
That said, you know, we kept everything much more G-rated this time.

524
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:14,676
So then we're playing around with the vehicles and we're like, well, how dumb can we be?

525
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:18,497
How crazy can we go? How stupid can these vehicles be

526
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,898
before they're too dumb and too stupid and players don't like them?

527
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,201
I'll concede as well, but not every player likes the crazy freaking teleporter.

528
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:33,582
But this was our test, our foray into like, maybe we just come up with this really stupid

529
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:37,684
bizarre, our original, I couldn't find a screenshot of it, the original prototype had this as

530
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,945
the DeLorean for some reason with some really bad coder art on it.

531
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:45,146
And this was us really testing the boundaries of the crazy stuff we could do.

532
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:49,087
And you know, because it was wrapped in this bonus system and it was part of this world

533
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:53,648
that was kind of ridiculous, it all seemed to fit and you know, we didn't have any problems

534
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:53,868
with it.

535
00:28:56,823 --> 00:29:00,004
So this kind of gets us to last year's GDC when we announced the game.

536
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:03,746
It was the first time we'd done like a big playtest of the vehicle system,

537
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:07,487
especially with external people that hadn't been there during the development of it.

538
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:11,528
And the big thing that we learned straight away was people would make critical mistakes,

539
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:15,389
like in close proximity to the control changes, which is kind of what we anticipated.

540
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:18,890
You know, we knew that people were going to have problem with the control changes,

541
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,331
but we didn't anticipate to have, you know, what extent.

542
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:23,412
People really did have difficulty with it.

543
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:24,792
So...

544
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,529
Again, more explosions.

545
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:29,971
Explosions are the answer to all of our problems.

546
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:32,392
When you pick up the vehicle, it explodes.

547
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:35,174
There's a big doo-hoo, and it clears away all the obstacles.

548
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:36,755
So this just gives you a bit of breathing room.

549
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:39,497
Same when you destroy the vehicle.

550
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:40,938
I mean, that worked to an extent.

551
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:41,859
That worked OK.

552
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,842
But where we really, really found ourselves breaking through

553
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:49,223
was when we started mucking around with these kind

554
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:50,864
of scripted coin sequences.

555
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:53,086
So the first time you pick up a vehicle,

556
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,920
Well, sorry, every time you pick up a vehicle, no matter what, you get two sequences of coins.

557
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,125
And what these coins do is...

558
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:05,719
they're never on the ground, they're never where you can get them without having to do something.

559
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,981
So it really provides the player with a goal

560
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,704
and something that, you know, they're not going to get it just by watching the game play out.

561
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:15,486
They're going to see this goal and they're going to have to figure out how to get there.

562
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:19,729
So it acts like this little kind of mini tutorial time and we do it every single time.

563
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,552
Because, you know, there's six vehicles and you've got the jetpack as well,

564
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:28,056
seven control schemes to keep track of, this control...

565
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,637
Sorry, this playground area almost.

566
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:35,199
really gives the player a chance to explore the controls and get familiar with them again,

567
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,680
get recalibrated with them again.

568
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:41,645
You might remember how it works but you might not quite remember how it feels, how quickly

569
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:45,549
the gravity changes, how quickly you can press it again.

570
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:51,895
Also when the vehicle explodes we add another coin sequence again, and this gives you another

571
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:55,298
kind of little section of time to get recalibrated and kind of re-buried.

572
00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:00,041
The number of vehicles is kind of an interesting thing as well.

573
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:04,363
Because these vehicles have so much kind of character and they all control really differently,

574
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,064
everyone has their favorite, right?

575
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:08,506
Like, people really latch on to what their favorite one is.

576
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,009
The balance here is, if you have too few vehicles,

577
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:18,412
you are getting your favorite one so often that it doesn't feel special and that you're not excited.

578
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,215
Too many vehicles, you're not getting your favorite one often enough.

579
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,663
So we always found, you know, we have a similar amount of weapons in Monster Dash.

580
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:31,325
We really felt like around six or maybe seven was the sweet spot.

581
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:34,968
Where, you know, when you get your favorite one, so the favorite one for me is always

582
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:35,748
Little Stomper.

583
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,370
When I get him I'm excited and I'm like, yeah, Little Stomper time.

584
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:57,364
So yeah, it was really important. There's some other interesting things to do with the way that, you know, we had to mess around with the probability of the vehicles in the missions, because when you have a mission that's like, you know, you need little stomper for something, it kind of dramatically changes your perception of how often it comes up.

585
00:31:57,865 --> 00:32:01,828
because you go, you collect like four vehicles and not get the stomper and in your mind you're

586
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:05,952
saying god damn it the stomper never ever spawns even though it's well within the realms

587
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,933
of like you know standard probability.

588
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:12,778
So we actually kind of game it at that point and override the probability if you haven't

589
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:15,760
gotten the vehicle you need to complete a mission in a long time.

590
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,962
A long time, it's like three pickups.

591
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,472
So the next thing we were attacking was stickiness.

592
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,954
So I apologize.

593
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,616
This is the worst slide in my presentation, for sure.

594
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:31,460
I was like, what image am I going to put for foundation?

595
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,260
And this came up.

596
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,382
And at the time, when I had to submit this talk back

597
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:36,844
in November, I was like, ha ha, that's kind of a funny joke.

598
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,146
And then I was going back through my slides this morning,

599
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,447
and I'm like, I'm so embarrassed.

600
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:42,850
So let's skip past that.

601
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:46,600
So the game at this point is feeling like quite solid.

602
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,460
And you know, the thing that kind of becomes obvious to us

603
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,921
is this is, this game, the base of this is really solid.

604
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,702
And it means it's kind of this good playground now

605
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,942
for half-brick experimenting with some things,

606
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,223
trying some things that we haven't really done before.

607
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:01,863
The first thing we really wanted to do

608
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,564
is make an ultra sticky game.

609
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:05,524
So you know, like Fruit Ninja or Monster Dash,

610
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,644
those games, people play them and they like them

611
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:09,125
and it's received well,

612
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,265
but people never spend that long with it.

613
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,846
So we wanted to try changing that.

614
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,866
We wanted to make something that.

615
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,267
even though it was simple, people would spend a long time in.

616
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,170
We also wanted to try out a bit of, you know, in-app purchase economy stuff.

617
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,212
We didn't want to, like, we weren't looking to make money off it or anything,

618
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:24,973
or gouge players, or piss anyone off.

619
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:28,195
We just wanted to try it out and get an understanding for how the system works,

620
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:31,076
and, you know, everyone who's smartphone developers

621
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,078
will be seeing that trend kind of shifting that way.

622
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,199
And, you know, we just wanted to learn stuff,

623
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,641
do stuff that we hadn't done before, and, you know, see what we can get,

624
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:41,463
rather than doing something so similar to what we'd done previously.

625
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,245
So this is when the shop came in.

626
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:49,507
So the shop, the idea was to provide an incentive

627
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,548
for the player other than beat my friends.

628
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:54,710
Because previously, you only had that social pressure

629
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,310
to beat your friends.

630
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,551
And when you're playing Fruit Ninja

631
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:57,931
and you don't get your high score,

632
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,592
you almost get this sense of you've

633
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:00,833
wasted your time a little bit.

634
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,694
So we wanted to use the shop to change that.

635
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,535
We really wanted to allow players to express themselves,

636
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:05,735
too.

637
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,291
just seemed like a neat thing to do.

638
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:14,453
I mean, this whole game is like a whole exercise in scope control gone terribly wrong.

639
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:17,074
We just come up with these ideas, and like, yeah, cool, we'll add that in.

640
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:18,775
Customization, why not?

641
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,955
They've already blown way past the four-week limit anyway.

642
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,416
So this is the very, very first

643
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:27,957
mock-up for the shop. It was basically

644
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:30,658
exactly the same as that, except flipped.

645
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,392
And you know, so this was our first sort of stab at doing it, and

646
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:41,417
problem is, is again, you know, talking about the character of Barry Steakfries, it feels quite dry.

647
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:45,501
Really wanted to get some flavour text in there where, you know, we could write some, you know,

648
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:50,325
semi-witty jokes and, you know, add a bit of extra character into the game, a bit more personality.

649
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,103
Here's another version, and you can see we've now got flavor text down the bottom.

650
00:34:57,044 --> 00:35:00,346
The big trouble we were having was, you know, how are we going to get all this stuff on screen,

651
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,867
make it easy to navigate and kind of intuitive to get around.

652
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:06,790
Clearly this isn't it. This wasn't implemented, this is just a dodgy Photoshop mockup.

653
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:12,293
So this time we tried putting the categories into tabs, kind of like a folder.

654
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,143
Um, you know, we had our items, we had the flavor text down the bottom, we've made the bars bigger

655
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:22,705
to try to minimize how much text is on the screen and make it a little bit less visually noisy.

656
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:25,706
Even then we kind of felt like that's a bit too visually noisy,

657
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:29,828
so we pushed the flavor text out into a pop-up, so when you click the, uh, the...

658
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:34,340
item, it actually comes up in a pop-up. And you know this design seemed

659
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:38,323
alright on paper. We actually implemented it. We spent a couple weeks implementing it

660
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:39,384
and trying it out and

661
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:44,347
this was, if there's any press guys here, this was the shop as it was in the

662
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:49,131
GDC build last year. But you know it still just wasn't feeling quite right. We

663
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:50,472
really weren't happy with it.

664
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:53,374
It felt a bit clunky to get around. So we were like, right, okay,

665
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:57,957
almost out of ideas. Where can we get some good inspiration from for how to do a shop front?

666
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:04,752
So, it is time for us to, you know, borrow some concepts.

667
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:09,756
Obviously, if you're playing on the iPhone, you're probably fairly familiar with the App

668
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:10,396
Store on there.

669
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,239
You most likely got the game by navigating through the App Store.

670
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:17,561
So we thought, right, okay, these guys seem to know what they're doing, let's, you know,

671
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,842
take a few cues from them.

672
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:24,029
So you can see it sort of started to become horizontalified.

673
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:27,750
Those are light pink boxes on the left there are the icons.

674
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,170
So you know, you got the icons on the left,

675
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,110
the price on the right.

676
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:34,032
You can see you've got like the little sideways arrow,

677
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,512
just like the app store as well.

678
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,373
We still got the kind of categories down the side

679
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,113
for categorizing things.

680
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,294
And you'll notice at the top, there's two major categories,

681
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:44,695
which is like the for sale and my gear.

682
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:47,920
We weren't really sure whether we should be pushing out

683
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,781
things that you had already bought into an inventory screen

684
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:55,184
or whether it should all stay within the same shop area.

685
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,466
So again, yeah, it's looking alright, but still not quite happy with it.

686
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:02,888
There's a lot of text on that screen, right? There's a lot going on.

687
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,949
So we tried kind of...

688
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:09,859
horizontalifying the whole thing, like getting rid of the noise down the sides.

689
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:14,380
So you can see it's kind of been stretched out and you can kind of see this is starting to get close to the

690
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,121
current shop implementation.

691
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,382
We still have the two categories, the for sale and the my stuff, so you know the

692
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:23,283
inventory and stuff I haven't yet bought. We've got down the bottom

693
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,944
the uh... you know a lot of Apple apps have the

694
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,445
categories listed down that way in those black bars but

695
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,245
you know and then eventually

696
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,021
we came up with the idea that we would pull all the categories out to the top

697
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:38,903
level and that way we could have visuals and again give it a bit of character

698
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:40,405
and then finally the

699
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,826
the end result there

700
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:46,289
it obviously looks much better because at this point then an artist touched it

701
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,032
you can see that you know design-wise that was kind of the next obvious step

702
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:55,035
and you can see how similar that is to the app store right like you even got

703
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:58,258
the glossy icons and everything the biggest change more than anything

704
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:01,540
is that when you click an item rather than pushing you to a whole new page it

705
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,461
just kinda pops down

706
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:06,058
Okay, so that's the shop.

707
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,340
Next thing, mission system.

708
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,684
So the mission system was originally inspired by the little system in Tiny Wings.

709
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:18,707
I thought that was a really neat idea when I was playing it, but I had a lot of problems with it too.

710
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:22,770
I wanted to do kind of more reward structures and, you know, more interesting stuff.

711
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,593
It felt cool completing missions, but I never really felt fulfilled by doing so.

712
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:33,978
And I would often get stuck on a mission and, you know, really sit there tearing my hair out trying to get past it.

713
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:37,384
So we figured we'll budget one week to do this thing.

714
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:42,491
If you assume that like four weeks was accurate to make this game in nine months,

715
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,754
then this one week estimate is pretty close.

716
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,343
So we tried three different things in addressing these, you know, in improving this mission system.

717
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:57,185
We had the daily system, the optional system, and the progressive system.

718
00:38:57,906 --> 00:38:59,847
So the daily system was our first one.

719
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:00,727
The idea is this.

720
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:03,648
Every single day you get three new missions you can do.

721
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:06,690
There's an easy mission, a medium mission, and a hard mission.

722
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,253
That way I know I'm never going to get stuck because you know I've always got an easy mission to do there

723
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:14,976
and when you complete the easy mission it's just it's done. That's it for the day.

724
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:18,638
You don't get another one to replace it. It's just there and then I check back tomorrow.

725
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,906
and I'll have three new missions to do.

726
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,228
And that seemed like a really cool idea,

727
00:39:23,748 --> 00:39:25,450
you know, on the surface of it, because we know

728
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,651
it's going to address the problem, no one's going to get stuck,

729
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,473
clearly, like, even if you can't even complete

730
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,575
the easy mission, then you can just

731
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,616
come back the next day and, you know, maybe you'll be able to complete

732
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,538
the next one. Our goal of

733
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:37,620
making it sticky, this seemed like a cool idea

734
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,561
because, you know, you'd be able to

735
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,563
keep coming back, there'd be incentive to come back

736
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:43,405
every single day, so it seemed kind of neat.

737
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,586
And we did another

738
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:47,488
kind of company beta and one third of the

739
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:48,649
company got this system.

740
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,062
The second system we did was this optional system.

741
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:55,023
So again, really trying to address the issue

742
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:55,764
of getting stuck.

743
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,345
So this was simple.

744
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,227
At all times, you basically had two missions to complete.

745
00:40:00,307 --> 00:40:02,669
And rather than it being one and the other,

746
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,970
it was one or the other.

747
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,111
So this one, run 800 meters in a little stomper

748
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,934
in a single run, or spend a total of 2,000 coins.

749
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,096
And you'll notice the top one is a skill-based mission.

750
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:15,198
The bottom one is this kind of grind, time-based mission.

751
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:17,520
Something that anyone could do given enough time.

752
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,821
Experienced players are gonna complete it quicker.

753
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:24,245
But, you know, anyone will get there if they invest enough time into it.

754
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:28,007
So this was the second mission we tried and, you know, we put that one over there and,

755
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:30,768
you know, again it's kind of neat but

756
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:33,049
it's feeling a little bit off.

757
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:38,170
The final one is the progressive system. So this is obviously the one closest to

758
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,991
the current system as we know it in the game.

759
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,265
three missions, you know, you complete one, you get a new one.

760
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:47,389
We had experience points at this point as well.

761
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,814
And so, you know, this was the system and it was easily the favorite of our playtests.

762
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:53,577
Again, one third of the company got this.

763
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:57,942
The problem was with the daily system was the guys who started playing it, like, on a Monday

764
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,845
compared to the guys who started playing it on a Friday.

765
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:03,867
The guys on Friday felt like no matter what they did, they could never catch up, right?

766
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:07,172
Because it didn't matter how much time they put into it, they could never catch up to their friends

767
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:08,334
and they're always one step behind.

768
00:41:08,354 --> 00:41:12,841
And they felt quite disempowered by not having control over what they were able to complete

769
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:15,244
and how much time they were able to invest in the game.

770
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:20,388
The optional system worked out a bit better, it seemed okay, but you know,

771
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:26,152
it kind of delivered the missions in such a, you needed such a long string of them,

772
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:29,635
and because you were only doing one at a time, it felt really kind of steppy,

773
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,196
and this, and then this, and then this.

774
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:34,238
Progressive system was easily the favorite for the playtesters,

775
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,340
because they really enjoyed completing multiple missions at once,

776
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,721
and all that kind of stuff.

777
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:42,664
Originally, we had this rewards system,

778
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:44,926
which is literally the money-old box.

779
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:47,980
So when you leveled up, this is what happened.

780
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,821
You got this screen and you could either get the money

781
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,782
or you could have what's in this box.

782
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,204
And we had this big list of prizes you could get in the box.

783
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,705
It would unlock things in the shop.

784
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:57,406
You get random currency rewards.

785
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:00,688
You might like win $1 instead of taking the easy two grand

786
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,409
or you might win 100,000 coins.

787
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,411
We even had these collectible things that you could get.

788
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:07,952
They were, you know, we had made some crazy,

789
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:09,933
stupid large amount of them and they did nothing.

790
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,234
They had no utility value.

791
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:14,196
It was like a kind of collectible card mini game on the side.

792
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,252
The big problem here was, you know, in the progressive system, people felt like they

793
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:23,073
wanted the missions to get harder and harder and harder, and because of this reward system,

794
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:25,755
we weren't able to give bigger rewards.

795
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,317
Because you know, we would ratchet up the money on the money side, but the box is still

796
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:32,018
always this random kind of box.

797
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:36,300
And maybe we give them a bigger box, or a golden box, but even still, it was way more

798
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,262
difficult to actually ratchet up the rewards to meet, you know, the expected reward for

799
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:44,824
more difficult missions, which you would expect as you kind of progress through a system.

800
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,571
So, you know, we had experience points, you know, the bars filling up were nice.

801
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:54,312
We really wanted, you know, the utility side of things was all good.

802
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:57,253
We really wanted to make it more punchy and more visceral.

803
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:02,135
And so, you know, all of the stars that we have, you know, they slam into place.

804
00:43:02,395 --> 00:43:04,455
The whole screen kind of moves around.

805
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:07,036
I think we even have dust that comes off the stars.

806
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:08,357
We really put a bit of time into it.

807
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:13,218
It was able to simplify the experience point system as well to just one, two, and three stars.

808
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:19,629
And the mission system becomes this crazy surprise mega feature.

809
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:23,651
Like, honestly, when we started working on it, we were expecting it just to be this thing.

810
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,472
You know, again, one week on the side.

811
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:29,493
We ended up pouring, I think we spent three months on it.

812
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:31,714
It took us about a month and a half to get the system right.

813
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:35,836
And it spent a month and a half of purely just tweaking the order of the missions,

814
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:38,758
the difficulty of the missions, the variety, coming up with new ones,

815
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:40,839
cutting the ones that weren't very good.

816
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:46,069
And now, like, the game is getting crazy addictive, right?

817
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:48,470
Because we've got so many layers of goals.

818
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,332
You've got, like, the kind of social goals

819
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:51,713
of trying to beat your friends.

820
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:54,035
We've got that whole thing going on, like Fruit Ninja.

821
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,937
You've kind of got this status thing of leveling up.

822
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:57,837
You know, what level are you?

823
00:43:57,938 --> 00:44:00,560
I'm level 463 kind of thing.

824
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,941
So you've got that side of things.

825
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:05,023
You've got these personal goals of unlocking the stuff

826
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:06,784
that you like the look of in the shop.

827
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:11,904
you've got this progressive system, you're working your way through towards an end goal

828
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:17,248
you know, the game has got so many layers of feedback and reward for the player

829
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:19,991
that I really think that's what grabs people in and keeps them in

830
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,453
no matter where you are, you're always like, you know, a couple of steps away from the

831
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:25,335
next awesome thing that's going to happen to you

832
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:30,749
So we did the mission system and that seemed awesome.

833
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,832
At this point we're like, okay, what about our really hardcore players?

834
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,113
These guys are going to play it, finish it, what are we going to give to them?

835
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:39,515
So again, you know, we got a bit of inspiration from our Call of Duty.

836
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:42,357
You know, thought we'd come up with a prestiging system.

837
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:45,259
But instead of being just ten medals,

838
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,241
we would make these medals and they'd be made out of three components.

839
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:51,484
They would have five borders, five different fills and five different icons.

840
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:55,206
That gives us a hundred and twenty-five different badges we can give them instead.

841
00:44:56,177 --> 00:44:57,677
honest to God, when we were working on it,

842
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:00,778
we were expecting only the hardest of the hardcore

843
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:03,759
would get a couple of badges, you know, a couple of badges at most.

844
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,361
We put these ID tags on them and gave them all these unique games

845
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:10,302
because we thought it would give the community this kind of fun game

846
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,543
where they would all try and come together and they'd say,

847
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:14,763
like, oh, I got badge 63 and I got badge 67,

848
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:17,504
and a large number of people would come together

849
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:19,485
to build the definitive list.

850
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:21,666
So imagine my surprise.

851
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:27,188
when this gets emailed to me after only 20 days of the game being out.

852
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:32,256
all 125 medals unlocked by a single person

853
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:36,159
averaging 8 hours of play everyday, 7 days a week

854
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:37,520
uh... what do we got there?

855
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,603
I can't see the time that was on there. This is a guy off the Touch Arcade forum

856
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:42,844
it's called Microbite

857
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:45,786
and we were just blown away and the crazy thing is is

858
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:49,609
I mean you know obviously this guy is the extreme case but even casual plays

859
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,970
like even my partner who is definitely not a gamer

860
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:55,493
comes up to me and is like yeah I got my third medal. I'm like holy shit

861
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:59,254
three medals, like we were expecting that would be our hardcore players.

862
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:03,355
The level of engagement in Jetpack is just

863
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:07,617
off the chains, like you know, we did a lot, you know, that was our goal

864
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:10,778
for sure, but there's no way we could have anticipated

865
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:15,059
how high the level of engagement was. Certainly it's got a small audience, I've

866
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,900
added a little question mark there because I wrote all this pre the game going free.

867
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,260
But you know, our engagement is just

868
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,081
out of control for this game.

869
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:28,134
So, I've got a couple of quick things I'll go over pretty quickly.

870
00:46:28,174 --> 00:46:30,358
Getting this game out the door was terrible.

871
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:32,221
Terrible, horrible experience.

872
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:38,860
really, really wanted to make this game work at 60 frames per second on everything.

873
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,641
And like this iPhone made out of clay is probably about as fast as like the original 2G iPhone.

874
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:50,983
On top of that, we really wanted it to look good on retina display screens as well as iPad 2 and all of that,

875
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:52,603
which is obviously a major challenge.

876
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:56,124
But then as if that wasn't enough, we're trying to keep it under 20 megs.

877
00:46:56,964 --> 00:47:02,045
You know, we're really trying to have it all and that was an obvious source of problems for us.

878
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:06,213
Came up with this kind of neat solution where, I hope that shows up alright,

879
00:47:07,134 --> 00:47:10,995
you know, we really wanted to make it really sparkle and look good on the iPad

880
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:16,297
but there's no way we could, you know, jam in these sprites that would take up four times more room

881
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:18,158
to accommodate for Retina and iPad.

882
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:24,206
So one of the guys at Halfrick actually wrote this kind of custom, it's almost like a HQ2X

883
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:24,847
scaler.

884
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:28,750
And so what happens is if you have a retina phone and you boot up Jetpack for the first

885
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,453
time, he goes, I see that you have a retina phone and it takes a little bit longer to

886
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:36,757
load, it actually goes through and converts a big list of sprites into these, you know,

887
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:41,381
expanded sprites that aren't nearest neighbor, aren't bilinear because, you know, nearest

888
00:47:41,421 --> 00:47:43,923
neighbor makes it look pixely, which is fine, it's part of the style.

889
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:50,066
and bilinear makes it look blurry, but this way we kind of get, it looks nice and chunky and smooth and still kind of pixel-y.

890
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:53,768
So that was a really big breakthrough for us, because it could look great on everything,

891
00:47:54,488 --> 00:48:01,031
but also, you know, it could, it would still fit into 20 megs, because we only had to have these low sprites in there.

892
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:03,773
We were extremely fortunate that our artist, Sierra,

893
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:08,138
had been, you know, he's a pixel ninja kind of guy and even though there was absolutely

894
00:48:08,198 --> 00:48:12,523
no, at the time, technical reason he had to, he kept all the sprites, like either eight

895
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:16,287
or sixteen colors, just because he wanted to, just because he felt like, you know, that

896
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:17,469
was the way this game should look.

897
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,375
And thank God he did because it meant this, uh, this scaler actually worked really, really

898
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:22,615
well.

899
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:27,458
The other thing we had to do was, uh, then we had stuff for the interface that we'd made

900
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:32,659
at iPad and Retina resolution, and because that was so big, it would run really, really

901
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,860
slowly on the really slow devices, so then we used the scaler in the opposite direction

902
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,680
to make lower resolution versions of that stuff so it still runs smoothly.

903
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:45,521
So also, yeah, we changed the name.

904
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:51,062
We did this at the 11th hour, like, it was the last thing we changed about the game.

905
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:58,669
And it's not something we took lightly. It was a massive source of stress for both myself and Phil Larson, our marketing manager.

906
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,751
We spent days just being like, oh my god, have we just made the biggest mistake?

907
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,212
Have we just undone all of our long lead marketing?

908
00:49:05,932 --> 00:49:10,734
One of the big things that, you know, made us decide we changed it, it became obvious to us, you know, this game was, you know,

909
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:13,896
getting a bit more casual than the name suggested.

910
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:15,736
But also when we were doing the icon.

911
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:19,399
our artist sort of mocked up the icon into the app store

912
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:22,280
so we could see what it would look like, you know, whether it would pop when it was

913
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:23,281
presented in a list.

914
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:26,723
And you only have so many characters on the app store, so when you

915
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:30,606
look at it in there and it was mocked up, instead of saying machine gun jetpack, it

916
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:30,786
says

917
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:34,949
machine gun dot dot dot. Which sounds like really ominous.

918
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,852
So that was, you know, another reason for the name change.

919
00:49:41,393 --> 00:49:41,553
And...

920
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,223
Then the game finally came out and we had a massive critical reception.

921
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,884
Our marketing guy Phil worked overtime.

922
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:50,225
We had a lot of stuff happen there.

923
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:53,167
We had a big chart success.

924
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:56,749
And a lot of people were really happy that this was the game that followed Fruit Ninja.

925
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:59,050
Certainly it's maybe not what a lot of people were expecting,

926
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,192
a game about machine guns and explosions.

927
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:05,474
But it definitely was still appealing to largely the same audience.

928
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:10,078
And even though this had started off as a game we were going to make in four weeks,

929
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:14,522
and we ended up spending 10 months on a one-button casual iPhone game,

930
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:20,087
we really felt like it was worth it, and we still definitely think it was worth the extra

931
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:21,729
1,200% effort that it took.

932
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:25,892
And yeah, we couldn't be happier. We were absolutely thrilled with the response we got.

933
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:34,974
It was definitely very personally satisfying for myself and the guys because we poured a lot of ourselves and a lot of our own personality into the game.

934
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:40,641
By the end we were all so emotionally invested and wrecked and we were all hating on each other.

935
00:50:40,681 --> 00:50:45,347
It must have been terrible to work with us at that point but we were extremely thrilled with the response.

936
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,761
Since then we've been working on updates.

937
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:52,024
So again, gadgets update estimated to take two weeks.

938
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:53,004
This took four months.

939
00:50:53,725 --> 00:50:56,126
So pretty much my rule of thumb now for estimating

940
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:57,487
in a Jetpack Jiraiya is times it by eight or so,

941
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:58,068
and that'll be pretty close.

942
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,589
And yeah, so we just announced this recently.

943
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:00,229
We're working on more updates.

944
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:01,130
And yeah, thank you very much for coming.

945
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,970
And thanks.

946
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:02,731
Thank you.

947
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:02,931
Thank you.

948
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:03,151
Thank you.

949
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:03,512
Thank you so much.

950
00:51:03,532 --> 00:51:03,732
Thank you.

951
00:51:03,752 --> 00:51:03,992
Thank you.

952
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:04,192
Thank you.

953
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:04,412
Thank you.

954
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:04,612
Thank you.

955
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:04,812
Thank you.

956
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:05,013
Thank you.

957
00:51:05,053 --> 00:51:05,293
Thank you.

958
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:05,633
Thank you.

959
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:05,933
Thank you.

960
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:06,213
Thank you.

961
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:06,454
Thank you.

962
00:51:06,474 --> 00:51:06,654
Thank you.

963
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:07,835
Thank you.

964
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:08,075
Thank you.

965
00:51:08,095 --> 00:51:08,315
Thank you.

966
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:08,515
Thank you.

967
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:08,735
Thank you.

968
00:51:08,755 --> 00:51:09,055
Thank you.

969
00:51:09,075 --> 00:51:09,276
Thank you.

970
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:09,696
Thank you.

971
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:09,976
Thank you.

972
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:13,358
Thank you.

973
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:14,839
Thank you.

974
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,140
Thank you.

975
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:22,556
So we have a bit of time for questions. We've got about 8 minutes or so.

976
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,298
If you could use the microphones and line up at the microphones for the questions.

977
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,919
Also if you're too shy to get up there, which is fair enough,

978
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:33,141
I have my email address up on the screen. Otherwise come and catch me after the show.

979
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:36,362
I'll be happy to talk shit about jetpacks.

980
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,588
One of the things that I find a little vexing about the game is that I love playing into the high score list against my friends.

981
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:56,971
However, you guys allow some minor subversion of that high score list with being able to buy the extra bounce, being able to buy a head start, and you can even do this with real world money.

982
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:03,372
So part of it is that I feel like it undermines my effort to honestly get on that list.

983
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:07,233
And I'm curious if you get any pushback from the community about that feature.

984
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:13,281
and whether you had any second thoughts about allowing people to sort of buy their way a little bit of that feature.

985
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:18,667
Yeah, that's a really good question. So we really tried to be careful about that.

986
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,891
You know, certainly you do gain a minor advantage.

987
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:25,672
The big thing is when we did all the testing for the game

988
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:27,153
with in-app purchases and all that,

989
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:30,714
we never ever used in-app purchases ourselves

990
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:31,675
when testing the game.

991
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,035
We do everything the hard way.

992
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:34,216
We earn the coins ourselves.

993
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:37,077
We kind of made the assumption that no one was going

994
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:39,978
to want to use our in-app purchase.

995
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:42,519
So the good thing about the head start

996
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,841
is you don't actually get any real advantage from that.

997
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:47,821
Certainly, it makes the first.

998
00:52:48,562 --> 00:52:53,385
few meters easier and safer, but any good player is going to be able to get through there quick,

999
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:57,349
you know, just the same. It's just going to take a little bit more time. We also made it so, yeah,

1000
00:52:57,389 --> 00:53:02,412
the, you can buy the kind of extra meters, which I think equates to, there's a lot of stuff because

1001
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:07,356
it changes with velocity, but can buy you about an extra 300 meters. We made it so you can't

1002
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:13,001
repeat it, because obviously then we would expect people to put $10 in and just, you know, buy 100

1003
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,263
bombs and just sit there and go boom, boom, boom all the way to victory, so.

1004
00:53:17,388 --> 00:53:18,949
You know, we were certainly aware of that.

1005
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:22,130
We really liked the idea of having these expendable items in there,

1006
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,171
because early on, before we had that,

1007
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:26,592
people would play through and they'd unlock the stuff they want,

1008
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:28,953
like, oh, I want that head, that body, and that.

1009
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:32,015
And that was it. And then the coins kind of lost all meaning.

1010
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:35,596
So the expendable items kind of let those coins remain having meaning.

1011
00:53:36,036 --> 00:53:37,377
So yeah, it was something we were interested in.

1012
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,877
We get a bit of a pushback, but you know,

1013
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:41,298
we definitely feel like we're in a comfortable area with that.

1014
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:47,719
Two short questions. What did you use to prototype and what inspired the Prophet Bird?

1015
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:56,408
To prototype I just used Flash. I used Flash AS2 because I'm both a terrible programmer and it's the only thing I know.

1016
00:53:56,989 --> 00:54:00,713
If I actually had to do things like declare variables and all that I'd go mad.

1017
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,463
in in terms of the profit but I mean you know it is definitely

1018
00:54:06,184 --> 00:54:10,887
inspired by those other bird games that we're doing really well and you know we

1019
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:14,330
I don't think they have any hard feelings is just like you know a bit of a

1020
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,673
good joke and you know it all sort of fit into the crazy Barry steak fries

1021
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:18,473
community as well

1022
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:22,877
yes so you said the name change came at the 11th hour

1023
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:26,600
I'm jetpack joyride I can you share any

1024
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:32,374
other names that were uh possible considerations? I'll tell you this name we actually

1025
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:36,436
changed the app to this name because we really didn't want it to be machine gun jet pack and

1026
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:40,518
the thing we were really worried about was that by making it too drastically different we

1027
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:44,741
were gonna undermine all of the uh marketing effort that we'd done. We actually had this

1028
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,783
name for a while we were gonna call it machine fun jet pack.

1029
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:53,289
And at the time we were like, a shin-fan jetpack, that sounds alright, maybe I could live with that.

1030
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,254
And then we got in in the morning, and I walked up to Phil's desk,

1031
00:54:56,354 --> 00:54:58,978
and as we both said the same thing at the same time, which is like,

1032
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:00,921
the fuck were we thinking?

1033
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:04,666
What a terrible, I'm so glad we didn't go out with that name.

1034
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:06,615
Yes?

1035
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:11,339
Yeah, hey Luke, I just wanted to ask you about, like, the pricing that you did,

1036
00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:14,142
how it was paid to start with and then went to free.

1037
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:15,884
Was that a planned thing?

1038
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:20,768
And also, based on that, is that something you guys are going to use again going forward?

1039
00:55:21,008 --> 00:55:22,730
I'm so glad someone asked that question.

1040
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,115
I didn't want to disappoint you.

1041
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:34,630
So the funny thing is, is we'd never designed this game.

1042
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,193
Well, I mean, originally, you know, when it was a four-week game,

1043
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:38,775
we were thinking we would release it for free.

1044
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:41,137
But it became obvious to us once we spent a lot of time on it

1045
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:42,859
that it wasn't going to be a free game anymore.

1046
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,843
We set it to free right before Christmas

1047
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,785
just because we thought it'd be a cool promotion to do.

1048
00:55:48,186 --> 00:55:49,367
It was sort of starting to fall down

1049
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,989
and we thought it'd get a bit of extra attention.

1050
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:56,149
We have not, since we set the game to free, changed any of the pricing in the game.

1051
00:55:56,429 --> 00:55:58,949
We did nothing to make this a freemium game,

1052
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,690
but what this blue line is, is represents revenue.

1053
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,110
And see if you can guess where it went free.

1054
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:08,431
Yeah, and so we set it to free and we left it over Christmas,

1055
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:11,772
then we got in and we were like, okay, we'll set it back to paid in a couple of days.

1056
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:15,432
And I'm like, geez, this is pretty cool though, it's working out really good.

1057
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:17,993
And you know, we're excited because more people are playing our game.

1058
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:20,233
And you know, if people are playing the game, then I'm happy.

1059
00:56:20,702 --> 00:56:22,683
So like, ah, maybe we'll leave it for a few extra days.

1060
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:24,343
And then, you know, we left it a few extra days.

1061
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:25,624
Maybe we'll leave it for another week.

1062
00:56:26,585 --> 00:56:27,845
Maybe we'll leave it for another week.

1063
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,346
I guess now we've made a freemium game.

1064
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,568
So I guess you believe in the freemium model then?

1065
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:35,829
Ah, yeah, I definitely think it could work.

1066
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:37,070
And I've been really happy with it

1067
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,511
because we really took efforts.

1068
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:40,512
We really don't want to gouge our players.

1069
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:41,612
We treat them with respect.

1070
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,515
We do all of our testing, as I mentioned before,

1071
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:47,598
by not using in-app purchases at all.

1072
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,960
We grind it all up manually ourselves,

1073
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,181
and we set it at a price point

1074
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,943
that we feel comfortable with doing that.

1075
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:54,704
We make the assumption that no one

1076
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:55,805
is gonna use in-app purchases.

1077
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:57,487
The fact that people do, I mean...

1078
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:08,110
You know, that's great for us. I think the model's really good. I think the main thing is, is like, I really don't like people who abuse the model and, you know, use, you know, dirty tricks and, you know, bring it really in their face.

1079
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:16,572
I think it's, you know, when, this really vindicates, I think, the fact that you can treat players with respect and still have the model work for you.

1080
00:57:17,552 --> 00:57:19,832
Thanks. Thanks.

1081
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:20,072
Yeah.

1082
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:26,894
Kind of along those same lines, the counterfeiter feature, it's really dramatically changes the economy.

1083
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,510
of the whole game, it doubles your value,

1084
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,713
and it really, or halves the value of the coins in the game.

1085
00:57:33,374 --> 00:57:34,235
Any comments on that?

1086
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:36,497
And then my other question is the name Halfbrick,

1087
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:39,000
just could you talk about the name and the logo too?

1088
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,283
Sure thing, well the name Halfbrick,

1089
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:48,272
We get asked that question a lot. Honestly, like, there was all these crazy names floating around when the guys were coming up with it.

1090
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:50,253
I think there may have been drinking involved.

1091
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:54,777
And then the next day, the name was just kind of the name that stuck out the most, was the most memorable.

1092
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:59,820
In terms of the counterfeit machine, so, you know, when we started mucking around with in-app purchases,

1093
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,782
there's still very much this big stigma about in-app purchases.

1094
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:05,904
And I certainly didn't want to spend any money on in-app purchase.

1095
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,601
The counterfeit machine was kind of like, for me, it was like,

1096
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:12,182
this is something I might actually think about buying.

1097
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:14,103
Like, you know, this is worth 99 cents.

1098
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,904
To me, this costs less than, like, one-third the price of a coffee.

1099
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:19,085
The fact that it stays there and is there forever,

1100
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,446
that's something that actually appeals to me.

1101
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,126
So I thought, you know, if it appealed to me,

1102
00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:24,827
maybe it would appeal to other people as well.

1103
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,267
And again, we put it in there.

1104
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:28,388
And because all the shop stuff is, you know,

1105
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,129
you can earn it quite easily,

1106
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,130
and it's really for getting that extra staff,

1107
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,471
or, you know, really completionist people,

1108
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:35,511
we felt comfortable with that.

1109
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:38,983
Thanks, I think we've got time for one more question.

1110
00:58:39,003 --> 00:58:41,044
Yeah, my question was actually tied to the counterfeiter.

1111
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:43,245
I don't know if you can give this information, but

1112
00:58:43,685 --> 00:58:47,386
what's the ratio between all of your users and the people that bought that?

1113
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:52,887
Because it seemed like the most obvious feature to spend money on.

1114
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,108
I wouldn't know off the top of my head.

1115
00:58:55,128 --> 00:58:58,309
Well, off the top of my head, I would say it would be somewhere around...

1116
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,444
3% mark. 3 or 4% mark. Definitely not nearly as many people as you might expect.

1117
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:05,805
Wow. I was expecting higher.

1118
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:11,707
Yeah, but you know, again, it's quite cool. With the in-app purchases, certainly.

1119
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:15,048
We have tons and tons of people that play it for free and never spend a dime.

1120
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:18,028
But that's fine because they're enjoying the game and we're happy with that.

1121
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:21,427
You know, I'm definitely a believer that even if you put out a free game and you

1122
00:59:21,747 --> 00:59:23,768
don't make a dime off it, don't make a cent,

1123
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,490
there's still value there. The people who are playing your game, now they know about you.

1124
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,152
If it's a good game, they know you make good games and that's

1125
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,532
extremely valuable.
