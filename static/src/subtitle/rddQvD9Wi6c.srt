1
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:07,215
Are you alive from all last night?

2
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:08,696
No?

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:10,637
I know that feeling.

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,781
This is Governance in Free-to-Play Multiplayer

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,783
Games, which is, I have to admit, is the single most

6
00:00:19,883 --> 00:00:22,244
boring title I have ever titled a talk of.

7
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:26,547
However, the topic is actually rather exciting.

8
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:28,988
So this is me.

9
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:35,404
I'm Daniel Cook. I'm a game designer. So this is a game design focused talk. So I apologize

10
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:41,047
if that surprises anyone. The games I've worked on, I've worked on Triple Town, I've worked

11
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:46,169
on Steambirds, Realm of the Mad God. We've got a recent one coming out now called Road

12
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,850
Not Taken and All Your Planets.

13
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:53,750
And I've done a lot with trying to do original game mechanics

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,053
that have long-term retention and are evergreen and last for

15
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:01,295
a very long period of time, but still manage to have this

16
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:04,997
service-based, free-to-play component to them.

17
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:09,000
And so my perspective is a little odd, because I'm trying

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,202
to do original games, but also in this free-to-play space

19
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:15,404
that is very much about optimization and pipelines and

20
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,486
content management and that type of thing.

21
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:24,355
So this is a game we worked on called Realm of the Mad God.

22
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,036
Has anyone here played this?

23
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:27,856
Bunch of folks?

24
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:28,236
Great.

25
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:34,538
It's a free to play, basically dual stick shooter.

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,399
And it's also an MMO.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,460
And the strange thing about it.

28
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:44,126
as you build up these little pixelated characters and you run around and you shoot things together

29
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:51,527
and it's cooperative and then you die and you realize, oh, I died, where's the respawn

30
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:58,569
button? And there isn't one because there's permadeath. And it ends up being a very, very

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,890
brutal game. Yet the retention is not that bad on it. It's

32
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:12,383
It's this game that shouldn't really work as a high retention, free to play title that

33
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:16,427
monetizes well, yet people were sticking around for a relatively long term.

34
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:23,393
And the people that got invested in it ended up building these crazy sort of like societies

35
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:29,538
and governance structures and systems of interacting with each other that were much more than your

36
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:30,038
typical

37
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:36,733
your typical shooter, you know, you're basically going pew, pew, pew, pew the entire time

38
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:39,336
and suddenly you have culture emerging from that.

39
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:48,804
So this made me question some of my big assumptions about how I was designing these services.

40
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:55,190
We have traditionally been a content-driven media.

41
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,189
We tend to focus on content. We tend to say,

42
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,670
if we make new content or we make new events or we make

43
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,611
new items or we make new levels,

44
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:09,292
then we will get people to pay for that content

45
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:12,933
and we will have delivered value to them and then they will pay for us,

46
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,474
pay for that value.

47
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,295
And if you look at a lot of the gating structures that you see in

48
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,717
free-to-play games, they're often based off this fundamental philosophy.

49
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:28,055
you have a certain amount of game, you have a certain amount of puzzles

50
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,580
and then you say you make it really really difficult or you frustrate people

51
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,701
or you gate people

52
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,943
and you say you can't get to that

53
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:37,385
and then if they pay you money

54
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:40,108
they can finally get to that content that you've

55
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:41,930
you've uh... kept from them

56
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:49,282
and we use metrics and we do all these techniques to slow the decline of the game

57
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:53,423
but ultimately there's diminishing returns on this strategy

58
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:58,083
uh... people burn out on content there's a psychological phenomenon where

59
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,744
when you give people essentially more of the same

60
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,844
they start to become acclimated to it

61
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,605
this sort of this hedonic treadmill that happens

62
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:07,845
and they say oh

63
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:10,826
i've seen this before maybe i'll move on to another title

64
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,670
And so there's only so much content you can add before your

65
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:19,394
evergreen lifetime, ten year, free to play service

66
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,359
turns into a one or two year, or maybe even a few weeks

67
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,661
uh... activity for most players.

68
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:32,289
So what was interesting about Realm of the Mad God, it was a very, very

69
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,270
different dynamic.

70
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,773
the amount of content that we put into it initially was quite low.

71
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:44,058
It's almost like what we were doing was we were seeding these laws for this

72
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:44,598
universe

73
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:45,959
and then

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,203
the players ended up creating immense drama out of that.

75
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:54,887
And I have to admit that we didn't do this intentionally, it was

76
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,148
very much, you know,

77
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,730
we stumbled upon the right initial conditions.

78
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:03,566
And then all this lightning in a bottle happened.

79
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:06,327
And as a designer, I don't believe that lightning in a

80
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,588
bottle is always the reality.

81
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:12,590
I think it's that the random chance is less likely.

82
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,112
There's actually real, reproducible human dynamics at

83
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:17,672
play here.

84
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:21,373
And if we could understand those and spread those to our

85
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,495
developers and our designers, maybe we could have this sort

86
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:26,696
of dynamic where the players are.

87
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:31,420
resting on a foundation that we've created, but they create this immense explosion

88
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:34,603
of player dynamics and content.

89
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,346
If we could perhaps replicate that.

90
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,049
So that's sort of what this talk is about. It's like

91
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,974
what are the foundational elements that we can put in our games

92
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,436
that result in this strong emergence?

93
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:52,294
and these are some of the things we saw we saw like groups forming hierarchies

94
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:56,417
forming trade popped up people were creating laws there were punishments

95
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:01,002
like there were mafia-esque organizations who had like political

96
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:04,805
affiliations with each other and they would they would blacklist certain

97
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,908
people and then whitelist other certain people and then they'd fight over it

98
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,311
and then they were like spreading propaganda to each other about this

99
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,414
and this existed in the game and it existed outside of the game

100
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:22,140
Like, people would go and have entire forums dedicated to smearing other people.

101
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,925
But then the people who were being smeared would gain a, uh, people who would feel for

102
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,866
them and that would create an entirely new group.

103
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:33,050
And then that group would turn, would gather enough entities around it that they'd form

104
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,273
this sort of like policing structure within the game.

105
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:38,615
And it was...

106
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:45,904
there were orders of magnitude more interesting systems and dynamics that came out of it than

107
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:55,327
what we put into it. Very, very, very different than the content model. Now, anyone who's

108
00:06:55,547 --> 00:07:02,029
lived through this realizes that this is messy. This is extraordinarily messy. There were

109
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,770
all sorts of design challenges. Like in terms of making rules for this group,

110
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:10,494
Instead of having clear pipelines where we knew exactly,

111
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:14,454
oh, here's the pipeline, and then the person goes and experiences this event,

112
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:18,175
and then 92.3% then experience this event,

113
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:20,876
and there's little clear pipelines down through it.

114
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:25,197
The players were creating most of the rules themselves.

115
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:28,277
The players were creating these, like, crazy systems,

116
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:29,938
and they were organic and unofficial.

117
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:36,019
uh... and there was this very clear dichotomy between sort of the local

118
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,481
power of the players and the type of uh...

119
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,563
governmental systems that they were creating

120
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:45,408
and us as developers who it was a very small team and we didn't have the ability

121
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,610
to even read half the stuff that was going on

122
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:50,313
and so what could we do as official rules

123
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:53,776
versus what the players were doing as local rules was a giant

124
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:54,897
giant issue

125
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,728
And you start to get into all the fundamentals of governance at this point.

126
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,176
Like, how do you make rules? How do you revise rules? How do you enforce those rules?

127
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,740
There were of course hackers and cheaters and griefers.

128
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,317
policing, judgment of edge cases,

129
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,399
there were things that were allowed by the rules but seemed immoral

130
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,161
and so the players would become upset about them and then the unofficial norms

131
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:21,861
would try to

132
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,142
police the people who are doing like

133
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,684
oh you really shouldn't use that item in this particular way to prevent people

134
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,144
from getting into this dungeon

135
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,886
that's an immoral activity

136
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,086
even though mechanically it's allowed.

137
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:43,268
And then certain groups became extraordinarily powerful and they started doing power brokering between different players.

138
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:56,457
Really quite fascinating stuff, but all these are massive design challenges that essentially are, do not exist in the same state in these more controlled content drip style games.

139
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,403
So I call this governance, and that's the closest term that I could find to describe what was happening here.

140
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:11,255
Governance is these systems of rules that enable groups to

141
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,456
accomplish more together.

142
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:15,118
And this starts to get at the heart of why this is

143
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:15,599
happening.

144
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:20,042
These groups are in this situation, in this particular

145
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,885
type of mechanical environment, where they feel the urge to

146
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:24,705
work together.

147
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,888
There's not individuals who are empowered to conquer the

148
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:28,888
world by themselves.

149
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:32,071
They're forced to work with other people and somehow

150
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:33,692
improve their lot in life.

151
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:39,258
And in order to do that, they adopt these systems of rules,

152
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:42,240
this governance structures.

153
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,162
It's almost like you can think of it as technology.

154
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:49,505
Now, some people ask, why governance and not government?

155
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,966
The government tends to be official.

156
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:55,709
And governance is rarely 100% official.

157
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,591
A lot of this stuff is organic and coming from the player

158
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,271
base itself.

159
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:03,134
So of course.

160
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:08,106
Anyone who's been watching games knows this is not new.

161
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,467
Eve is sort of the classic service-based game

162
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:16,048
that has been doing this for years, quite successfully.

163
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:20,429
And there's all sorts of crazy, wonderful stories

164
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,230
that come out of a game like Eve,

165
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,610
where they've set up these sort of physics of the world.

166
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,631
And then the players take that on

167
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,212
and create giant corporations and scams that

168
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,412
last for months upon months.

169
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:40,539
However, we're also seeing this as the root of massive successes outside the free-to-play

170
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:40,900
world.

171
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,706
If you look at games like DayZ, also has this element of immense player dynamics that emerge

172
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,347
from a relatively simple rule set.

173
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:54,350
Rust is another one that's become quite popular recently.

174
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,372
And of course Minecraft is the one that's been doing it for a while now.

175
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,993
So, we see reproducible success over and over again.

176
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:06,194
Now, a lot of the rules are of course unofficial at this point.

177
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:09,435
People don't really know why these games are a success.

178
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:13,836
And so this is about like digging in and finding out, why is this happening?

179
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:17,177
So why do this?

180
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:18,377
This seems like a lot of work.

181
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:19,357
It is a lot of work.

182
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,853
The contents-based models, like, I love Google Trends.

183
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,055
I don't know if anyone else here uses Google Trends.

184
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,639
What tends to happen is you get a few good years out of a

185
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,000
game, and then it drops off.

186
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,343
People think they have this evergreen hit, but people burn

187
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:40,925
out on them inevitably.

188
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,007
And it's really fascinating to watch.

189
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,449
You have companies who are really, really excited about

190
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:48,251
their hit, and then you watch how it, like.

191
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:53,893
Even though they update it, even though they have all the money in the universe to go and like make the best game possible,

192
00:11:54,413 --> 00:12:02,516
the fundamental design structure of their game by relying on content means that it will die out.

193
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:10,758
That's just an elemental aspect of that architecture, that play architecture that they've built into their game.

194
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,209
And then if you look at something like Eve,

195
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,436
you see that it also has a little bit of a drop-off,

196
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,360
but the drop-off is far less steep.

197
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,394
It goes and it sort of bumps along for a very long period of time.

198
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:32,077
And you start to get that fat tail of retention and revenue for a very long time.

199
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:38,499
And that's almost entirely driven by the player dynamics that are keeping the game alive.

200
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,961
They add immense amount of content to the game, but the content isn't what is driving

201
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:43,702
that retention.

202
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:50,665
It is the fact that you've got this, I think of it as tying back into motivation theory.

203
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:55,065
You've built a game where there's high agency.

204
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:59,811
People can set up dictatorships, they can set up trade organizations,

205
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,134
they can work with their friends, they can do whatever they want.

206
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:06,780
And because of that, they feel an immense amount of ownership

207
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,784
over their lives within this environment.

208
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:15,199
Because the dynamics of politics and social organizations

209
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,160
are impossible to master,

210
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,282
there's always an immensely high mastery level for these systems.

211
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:27,063
You can spend your entire life trying to master the politics of one of these games

212
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:28,824
and never quite succeed.

213
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:33,045
You might rise up a little bit above the surface and then sink back down

214
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:36,386
and learn a bit and make some new friends, make some new relationships.

215
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,582
And so we've got agency, we've got mastery.

216
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:44,224
And because one of the big aspects that drives these

217
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:47,665
things is big group goals and working together, you also end

218
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:48,945
up getting shared purpose.

219
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:52,367
And in a lot of free-to-play games, that's an element

220
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:56,008
that's absolutely missing from them, is this idea of shared

221
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:56,948
purpose as a group.

222
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:03,166
And of course, Minecraft just seems to keep going up and up and up.

223
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:10,174
So, these are very different trend lines, these are very different evolutions of a product

224
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:13,377
than we see in the typical free-to-play space.

225
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,041
So, alright.

226
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:19,433
How the heck do we do this?

227
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,675
So what I did is I talked to a whole bunch of other designers.

228
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:24,875
I looked at our own games.

229
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,796
I also went and there's an immense amount of research

230
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:31,058
out there about how relationships form,

231
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:32,258
how governance forms.

232
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,579
And people have been studying this

233
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,380
for an extraordinarily long time.

234
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,441
And we need to bring some of that understanding

235
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,822
and knowledge into our industry so that we

236
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,223
can use it in our games.

237
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,122
the most useful perspective that I found was an economic perspective.

238
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:56,666
And there's a fellow named Ed Castronova who's done a lot of studying on

239
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:57,866
economies

240
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,569
in online games and monetary systems and

241
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,750
how they all work and fit together.

242
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:06,122
and talking to him about it

243
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:07,602
uh... he says

244
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,343
look it's really simple

245
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:10,823
it's incredibly simple

246
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:12,424
governance happens

247
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,264
when one thing occurs

248
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,005
when you if you can answer yes to this one question

249
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:18,406
you're gonna get governance

250
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,926
and it's really super simple is the group

251
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,127
more efficient than the individual

252
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:31,859
And we have this sort of like techno-utopia sort of world view of how players should be treated in our games.

253
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,584
We tend to believe that the empowered player is a happy player.

254
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,397
and the empowered player is someone who is capable of soloing the game.

255
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:43,759
They're capable of playing through the whole game by themselves.

256
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,565
And it turns out that that sort of idyllic, utopic idea of how the empowered player should be

257
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,848
is actually an antithesis to the creation of all these dynamics.

258
00:15:56,268 --> 00:16:01,973
You actually want players that are in situations where they want to work together with other people

259
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,255
and they can get more done together than they can by themselves.

260
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,820
So use this as a lens as we go through the rest of it.

261
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:16,143
Just use that as a lens to put the other things into context.

262
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:18,344
Because the other things are almost supporting details to

263
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,464
this fundamental idea.

264
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,666
Now a great example of that is, has anyone watched

265
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,086
Twitch Plays Pokemon?

266
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,039
There's the game Pokemon Red.

267
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,060
There's a chat channel.

268
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,941
In the chat channel, you can type commands, move left, go

269
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:38,182
up, go down, press the button, things like that.

270
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:42,243
The game will randomly take whoever happens to get in the

271
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,303
queue at the right time.

272
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,944
It will randomly take one of those commands and execute it

273
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:46,464
on the screen.

274
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:51,498
and thousands of people, actually millions of people,

275
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:53,539
with millions more watching,

276
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,701
ended up beating the entire game of Pokemon

277
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,823
with this absolutely crazy group control scheme.

278
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,064
And one of the interesting things about it is

279
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,827
individuals working alone end up generating pure noise.

280
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:07,388
There's almost no...

281
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:09,989
It's impossible to beat the game

282
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,471
just by entering in what you think are reasonable commands.

283
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,251
especially in the puzzle rooms and puzzle situations.

284
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:19,656
And what ended up happening is all these groups formed

285
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:22,881
outside of the game to talk strategy, to talk like how are

286
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,164
we working together, how do we want to work together.

287
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:31,537
Reddit had giant forums full of propaganda posters and it became

288
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:35,820
this like crazy almost religious phenomenon about how people were

289
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,541
desperately trying to work in this situation where the

290
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:42,583
individual was massively unempowered but as a group they

291
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,306
could accomplish stuff together. And they ended up having these

292
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:49,908
you know, anarchy versus democracy like rule systems for

293
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,710
how they ended up determining what was the right activity to

294
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,890
do.

295
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,203
And we saw this, again we saw this explosion of emergence

296
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:00,886
just because that one simple principle was at play.

297
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:06,973
Now there's foundations to all this.

298
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:10,678
Now the first one comes from economic game theory

299
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:13,922
and it's the idea that relationships are an iterated game.

300
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,643
So this is a reciprocation loop. We have them in a lot of our games already.

301
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:21,185
There's a person A and a person B.

302
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:25,549
Person A gives something of economic value to person B.

303
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,912
It's fascinating. If you ever read about friendships and the actual, like,

304
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,996
dynamics that go on when you study friendships, we often have these romantic

305
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,617
ideas about how friendships work.

306
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:39,799
two people, they meet, they see each other, they happen to have a connection,

307
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:44,561
and everything's wonderful, and then they become friends, and they play chess together,

308
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,304
and then they take their dogs for walks, right? And if you actually dig into it,

309
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:55,947
the economic model is much more predictive than sort of the romantic mutual attraction model.

310
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:04,055
Almost always, there's strong evidence that friendships are started when someone of lower

311
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:12,056
economic status or socioeconomic status goes and gives something to someone of higher socioeconomic

312
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:17,298
status and the person of higher socioeconomic status only responds to the one who's lower

313
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,538
if they see an advantage in doing so.

314
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,940
Um, so a lot, it like, it ends up being this very much this back and forth and at any point

315
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,261
that, that reciprocation loop can break down.

316
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:35,642
So Skyrim, not a multiplayer game, doesn't have that reciprocation loop.

317
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,343
NPCs do not count.

318
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,704
They have no interesting dynamics that emerge out of them in this way.

319
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,244
So that doesn't work, obviously.

320
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:46,565
Let's just for a moment, um.

321
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,488
try a little experiment.

322
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,568
Because I know it's almost lunchtime.

323
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,509
And just turn to the person next to you.

324
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,770
This is an example of dyads.

325
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,191
So two people at once.

326
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,711
So just turn to the person next to you.

327
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,473
One of you raise your hand.

328
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:06,693
One of you raise your hand.

329
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:07,993
OK.

330
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,714
I want you to look the other person deeply.

331
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:11,915
This is really important.

332
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,715
Look them deeply in the eyes.

333
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,296
And say to them.

334
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,105
I am a thunder bunny.

335
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,807
Alright, on the count of three.

336
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:22,908
One, two, three.

337
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:27,131
I am a thunder bunny.

338
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,291
Alright, now.

339
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:32,114
What you've just done is you've made an overture.

340
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,857
You may have felt a little nervous.

341
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,979
There may have been some awkwardness there.

342
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,883
What's interesting is when we talk about these economic theories of relationships.

343
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,325
It's not necessarily about money.

344
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:53,628
The costs are things like rejection, loss of social status, time.

345
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,588
Like you took a little bit of your time.

346
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,930
You risked the other person rejecting you.

347
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,352
And so when we build in these loops, we have to consider, as game designers,

348
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:05,292
we have to think about

349
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,354
what is that token that you're giving?

350
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:12,557
what social value does it have as opposed to pure economic value?

351
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,240
what is the cost if that's lost? you know things like identities

352
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:17,081
uh...

353
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,844
like relative status to one another those are important factors to consider

354
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:26,308
now since i don't want anyone to be left hanging there without the complete

355
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,108
reciprocation

356
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:29,831
now the other person

357
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,513
look your fellow dyad member in the eye

358
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:36,525
and you want to say respond back to them

359
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:37,726
I too

360
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:39,266
am a thunder bunny

361
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:41,787
alright one two three

362
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,650
what you've just done

363
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,031
is actually about

364
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:55,093
ten times more interesting and complex than what happens in most

365
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:58,114
uh... free-to-play games right there you set up

366
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:03,703
You set up a reciprocation loop between that person.

367
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:04,904
You've looked them in the eye.

368
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:09,107
You had a high bandwidth interaction with them because it was like in person and you

369
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,310
could look, you could see their facial expressions, their smiles.

370
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,054
There was actually a lot going back and forth between the two of you that started the seed

371
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:19,095
of a relationship.

372
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:24,979
And that's, that's a fundamental piece to how we start getting governance into games.

373
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,990
Now, potentially one of you was a jerk

374
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,491
and did not reciprocate.

375
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:35,953
Like, it was not worth your time or your social status in order to do so.

376
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:38,374
And spoilers are super common in this.

377
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,236
I would say that the vast majority of reciprocation loops,

378
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,056
they start with an initial overture

379
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,197
and that overture is not returned.

380
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:47,218
So...

381
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:52,499
That happens a lot. It's a fundamental part of that. You need to watch for it. And it's almost,

382
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,405
this is actually something you can build into your metrics to understand like where the

383
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:05,772
reciprocation is breaking down. Now, this is one of my favorite techniques for getting around this.

384
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,698
A lot of game design is zero-sum game design. If you've got it, I don't have it.

385
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:17,591
What instead we want to do is non-zero sum transactions.

386
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:21,554
A common issue in MMOs is loot stealing.

387
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:26,679
So I start beating on a monster.

388
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,041
I'm almost dead, but he's about to die.

389
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:32,043
And then Steve Mretzky comes along.

390
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:39,141
and he hits that last hit in and he kills the monster and he gets all the XP

391
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:43,525
and then he's playing the damned rogue and he's faster than I am and he runs over

392
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,247
and he steals all the loot from me.

393
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:49,351
And now at this point I don't want to play with anybody.

394
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:50,512
I want to play by myself.

395
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:55,016
I don't want to deal with other human beings because by working together I was actually

396
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:55,576
worse off.

397
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,319
So that's a zero-sum interaction.

398
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,207
what happened in realm of the mad god and this was a brilliant design piece that was

399
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:11,651
in the early prototype is when you kill something everyone on the screen also gets xp and that's

400
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:17,393
just that's a wonderful wonderful thing right now i actually benefit from other people being

401
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:22,555
around me and helping me out and we get this free rider problem the free rider problem

402
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,996
comes up where it's like lots of people working together and one guy's just sitting back and

403
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,217
sucking in all the rewards of everybody else

404
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:33,114
But what we found is that that was actually probably a positive.

405
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:36,916
Because people would form these huge groups, and there's just a pleasure

406
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:41,399
of having groups of people doing something with a shared purpose together.

407
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,981
And they would run around in these giant trains,

408
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,802
and there'd be a giant train running down this road together

409
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,764
for no other purpose than, like, being...

410
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:55,165
together and sucking up XP as they killed things together. And so these non-zero-sum

411
00:24:55,245 --> 00:25:00,407
interactions, these non-zero-sum transactions help avoid some of those spoiler and free

412
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:06,088
rider issues. Because it doesn't matter if there's lots of free riders if everyone's

413
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:12,390
benefiting. The other thing we see in this is escalating

414
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,850
costs.

415
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:19,376
Thunderbunny interaction was a relatively low-cost interaction.

416
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:22,938
And as relationships build up,

417
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,501
the cost of your interactions become greater.

418
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:28,462
I recently went to dinner with a friend.

419
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:30,524
He was in town for a short period of time.

420
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:34,606
And I paid $30 for a parking spot downtown.

421
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:38,124
And I was like, oh, $30, you know, that's a lot of money.

422
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:40,705
But then I thought to myself, this is a good friend,

423
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:43,105
and I've wanted to see them for ages.

424
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:48,066
And $30 is meaningless in the context of that friendship.

425
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,627
And I get so much more out of that friendship

426
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:53,788
in terms of social support, and shared language,

427
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:57,109
and understanding, and the ability to interact with each other

428
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,189
and build up our social lives.

429
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,830
That $30 is completely whatever.

430
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,930
Doesn't matter at all.

431
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:10,637
So, you start a relationship with coffee, and then you sort of go from there, right?

432
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:16,602
And it can get, so you're owning houses together, you know, it can get quite, the relationships

433
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:17,463
can go quite far.

434
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:21,726
So this escalating cost is a pattern that you can build into your games as well.

435
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:25,336
This is actually a failing of free-to-play games.

436
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:27,478
It's a huge, huge failing of free-to-play games.

437
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:34,404
In something like Candy Crush Saga, you can indeed ask a friend for a favor and you can

438
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:38,247
ask them for lives and they can return lives and there is a reciprocation loop there.

439
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:42,291
But there's no real way to escalate that reciprocation.

440
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:48,156
There's no way to invest more in the relationship and make the relationship this dense, meaningful,

441
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,098
rich item between the two of you.

442
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:56,610
So there's a huge opportunity there for these richer relationships within those reciprocation

443
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:56,870
loops.

444
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:01,191
We kind of deal with the most shallow, shallow version of it many times.

445
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:06,193
And one of the things that helps that is of course rich communication.

446
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:16,135
If you look at the factors that are involved in building relationships in games, there's

447
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:17,335
sort of four big ones.

448
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:18,975
Proximity.

449
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:19,976
Are we near each other?

450
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:20,716
You know, do we?

451
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,161
and do we, are like, is there a high likelihood that we're going

452
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,882
to bump into each other? And that sort of ties into this

453
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,963
other one which is repeated informal encounters. You don't

454
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:37,204
really need to make plans. When we look at our matchmaking

455
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:42,126
systems, do our matchmaking systems enable repeated

456
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,547
informal encounters?

457
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,679
A lot of times they don't.

458
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:50,580
There's a very limited set of friends that we interact with.

459
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,101
Or there's really, one of the things that happened in Realm of the Mad God was there

460
00:27:57,121 --> 00:28:02,342
was a hub, and you could wander through the hub and like bump into people and see them

461
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:03,183
and see their name.

462
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:07,564
And it ended up, you saw the same people over and over and over again.

463
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:10,584
And eventually some people, some of those people said hi to each other.

464
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,345
So there was a social space.

465
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:16,186
that was a architectural design decision for the game

466
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:20,827
that ended up causing these opportunities,

467
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,548
these repeat informal encounters.

468
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:27,489
Similarity.

469
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,430
This is actually a fascinating and scary one.

470
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,451
They've done a lot of studies on children

471
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:37,272
and how they make friends and who they make friends with.

472
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:43,928
Essentially it ends up being that white rich kids make friends with white rich kids

473
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,993
and poor black kids make friends with poor black kids

474
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:52,278
and the overlap between them is almost nothing.

475
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:56,423
uh... like you basically have to like force people together

476
00:28:56,803 --> 00:29:00,344
like in for college students you have to put them in the same dorm room in order

477
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:00,864
to race

478
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:02,204
some of these like

479
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:06,285
uh... tendencies for similar similar groups to work to uh... create

480
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:07,305
friendships with each other

481
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:11,426
and this is not a theoretical study this is like measuring what is and there's

482
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,447
all sorts of factors involved in that

483
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:17,148
uh... but it all ties back into some of these economic theories

484
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:23,839
So similarity is an interesting one because you want groups to cross-pollinate,

485
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:28,642
but at the same time one of the strongest ways of getting people to form groups in the first place

486
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:32,204
is to create some sort of similarity inside that group.

487
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:38,468
So I find that, you know, it's just a fascinating topic.

488
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:43,852
And then there's one last piece, one last piece that...

489
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:49,730
we tend to fail on immensely, we're just not very good at it.

490
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:53,814
And this sounds so touchy-feely, but it seems to be so important in the literature,

491
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:58,037
which is the opportunity to share ideas and feelings.

492
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:02,593
Because one of the ways that we build up relationships is we say,

493
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:06,515
here's who I am, here's what I think, here's what I believe.

494
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:09,736
And in doing so, the other person can reciprocate

495
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:13,297
and you can start building up a shared language and understanding of one another.

496
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:14,838
You start building up empathy.

497
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:18,079
A lot of our systems are incredibly mechanical

498
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:23,581
and so we never actually get to the ideas and feelings portion of the reciprocation.

499
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:27,783
Journey.

500
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:32,134
Great example of this, Journey, PlayStation 3,

501
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:35,876
two-player adventure game, essentially,

502
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:36,757
I guess you would call it.

503
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:39,758
It has reciprocation loops.

504
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,919
It is multiplayer.

505
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,640
It does a lot of this stuff right.

506
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,921
It puts people together in these opportunities

507
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:46,102
to interact with one another.

508
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:50,444
However, essentially what you can do

509
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,785
is you can beep at one another.

510
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,321
And because you can only beep at one another,

511
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:59,905
you can never really explore those, like, ideas and feelings.

512
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,966
Like, that never really comes across.

513
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:06,690
So we don't see the same level of emergence in something like Journey,

514
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,852
even though it's an extraordinarily well-designed multiplayer game

515
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:11,434
that we do in some of the other things.

516
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,463
Interestingly, like everything that I've seen when the designers talk about it,

517
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:21,226
there was a lot of these negative human emotions that they were trying to remove

518
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:24,828
from the experience because they were going for this very specific type of

519
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,750
interactive emotional experience when they built it.

520
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,413
And so a lot of the negative griefing and such was eradicated from the design

521
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:35,875
because it added a certain messiness and unpleasantness to the whole thing.

522
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:38,617
Which brings us to League of Legends.

523
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:46,513
League of Legends has extraordinarily rich feedback if you screw up.

524
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:57,377
It is a in highly competitive matches if you're doing something wrong like you step away from

525
00:31:57,397 --> 00:32:02,759
your keyboard for a bit or you're in the wrong lane or whatever it may be there is everyone

526
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,121
is immediately on your case and say no you did this wrong or this is the wrong way of

527
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:10,562
doing things and you should do this instead and what are you doing and why are you playing

528
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:10,942
that way.

529
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:17,828
And it's been a huge point of emphasis for the team to try to address that.

530
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:21,610
But it's deeply fundamental to the game structure.

531
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:26,992
Now, I have a tendency to say this sort of negativity is bad

532
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,113
and we want everyone to be peaceful and happy.

533
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:35,446
Yet, when I dig into like what makes rich strong communities,

534
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:39,587
this type of drama is actually seems to be essential.

535
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:43,609
This sort of storming that happens when groups come together

536
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:50,972
and create social norms is an essential part of creating a group that works together well.

537
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:55,853
It's almost like the individual has to give up a little something in order to become part of the group,

538
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:58,995
but the trade-off is that the group is stronger because of it.

539
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:04,809
And I look at, you know, our lovely Google Trends for League of Legends,

540
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,070
and even though it has an immense amount of this, these sort of negative emotions in it,

541
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,111
it seems to be a very strong, rich community.

542
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:14,572
And that's a fascinating thing.

543
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:17,333
Like, sometimes the drama is perhaps a good thing.

544
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,874
And it comes to this idea that

545
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,556
norms are violently negotiated social contracts.

546
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,085
Humanity interacting with humanity is this messy, ugly operation.

547
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:35,566
It is not clean.

548
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,730
However, that's how we build civilization.

549
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,650
That's how we do it.

550
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:44,854
And when you take language, when you go from the beep, which is safe and censored,

551
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:52,634
or the gift in a social game or free-to-play game which is safe and censored

552
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:56,236
and you open it up to chat or conversation

553
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,759
then people will yell at each other, they'll scream at each other, they'll insult each other

554
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,041
but they'll also negotiate, they'll share feelings, they'll share ideas

555
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:10,284
they'll share these complex things that end up making the relationships that actually survive

556
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,686
much, much stronger.

557
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:24,631
gets us into persistence. DayZ is a fascinating case study if anyone's played that. It has

558
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:29,534
so many of these elements for emergence and people really, really like it and it's explosive

559
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:36,719
because of these elements of emergence. Yet, the forms of governance that come up in it

560
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:42,303
are short-lived and fragile and they kind of break apart a lot and I was like, why is

561
00:34:42,343 --> 00:34:44,425
that so? And in DayZ,

562
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:48,474
persistence is actually pretty crappy

563
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:53,796
uh... it's a permadeath game and unlike realm of mad god where you keep the same

564
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:57,817
account and it's there's a certain element of like even though you die

565
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:01,138
like people still know your name and that type of thing there's a social

566
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:01,839
persistence

567
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,060
uh... in DayZ because you have to move so far in the game you have to

568
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,180
walk around a lot

569
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,041
You don't see people very often.

570
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,163
There's low frequency interactions.

571
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,925
And then once you die, you're spawned in another location.

572
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:17,487
So the chances of you encountering the same exact people that you

573
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:19,928
encountered last time are actually very low.

574
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:25,832
So your, your, the persistence of your relationships is actually surprisingly weak.

575
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:30,855
And as a result, it damages the emergence of, of these social structures.

576
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:34,998
This is a geeky one.

577
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,139
So.

578
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,121
once you have all these systems of building relationships that's great and all

579
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:45,624
like you still have to answer the question

580
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,667
why the heck would you work together

581
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,370
like what's it what what what in the game system

582
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,832
would make you work together

583
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:55,537
and so there's this idea of collective goods

584
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,000
they're very close to public goods

585
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:02,134
It's an economic good that increases a benefit to the community.

586
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:05,076
So it's like, it's almost a tautology, you know?

587
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:08,739
It's a good that does exactly what we're looking for it to do.

588
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,902
But these are reasonably well studied, and they're things like safety.

589
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:15,183
They're kind of a little abstract.

590
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:16,985
An unabstract one would be air.

591
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:22,028
The air in this room is a collective good.

592
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,610
Like, we all breathe it, we all benefit from it.

593
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,672
If someone starts polluting the air in this room, I don't know what you ate for lunch,

594
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:33,134
but if you start doing that, then it hurts everybody.

595
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:38,657
And we might decide maybe that person can't be part of our group anymore.

596
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,718
They're a little too much of a thunder bunny.

597
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:44,901
And we would put them outside of the group because that's not good.

598
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,442
They're harming our collective good.

599
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:53,763
Um, we can't really, it's actually difficult to exclude people from using these, these

600
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:54,103
goods.

601
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:55,504
You can create a club good.

602
00:36:55,544 --> 00:37:00,686
We can say, we are the Thunder Bunny Club here, and we own the air in this room.

603
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:02,406
We own the safety in this room.

604
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:11,159
And we can say anyone who's not in this room doesn't get to participate in our use of these items.

605
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:19,970
But that's sort of an interesting, like, again we're applying a structure in order to manipulate that collective good.

606
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:31,119
So examples of these things in uh or or of of games. Farmville is something that has strong

607
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:38,602
persistence. It has really weak collective goods. You exist in these isolated little shards. You're

608
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:42,783
basically in these pocket universes shut off from the rest of humanity.

609
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:47,026
And there's a very, very little reason to interact with the other people.

610
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:51,770
There's these very weak interaction loops between folks,

611
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,493
but in general, you've got your pocket universe,

612
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,075
and there's very few collective goods involved.

613
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:03,844
Compare that to something like Kingdoms of Kamlet, which are these MMO RTSs.

614
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:10,767
I go back to Travian and some of the games like that, where you've got an army and you're

615
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:14,969
building up this army and you're investing huge amounts of your real-time life in building

616
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,230
up these armies and cities.

617
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:21,272
And then anyone else can come along and just beat the crap out of you.

618
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:25,854
And if they're bigger and stronger than you, they're going to destroy you or knock you

619
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:26,915
down to the Stone Age.

620
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:27,555
And you're like, oh!

621
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,666
This is horrible.

622
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:34,527
So safety is this thing that ends up becoming the good that people trade in.

623
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:39,469
And how they do that is by creating coalitions or alliances with one another.

624
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,449
And by creating an alliance, I can then say,

625
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:44,330
hey look, if you hit me,

626
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,931
my alliance is going to hit you back ten times as hard.

627
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:54,614
and there becomes the safety as a good becomes the thing that people organize around.

628
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:59,736
So these type of games actually have really fascinating social structures

629
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:03,158
because of that reason to work together.

630
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,641
Minecraft, the blocks in Minecraft are a form of collective good.

631
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:12,763
If you look at some of the large scale building operations like

632
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:21,283
replicating Middle Earth in Minecraft. They have these complex rules of how you can edit,

633
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:25,606
where you can edit, because there's only so many blocks and if people start editing the

634
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:29,949
wrong thing in the wrong place, it breaks the whole aesthetic system that they're trying

635
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:35,573
to build. And they have verification systems and like timeouts, if you place the block

636
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:39,135
in the wrong spot, you get timeouts and you're not allowed to place blocks on that server

637
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:40,056
for a period of time.

638
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:43,544
the

639
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:48,249
groups that form have if you look search for uh... government

640
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:53,354
system and minecraft or communism and minecraft

641
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:55,857
or socialist minecraft

642
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:57,699
any of these systems out there

643
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:58,400
and there's these

644
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,162
dozens of servers where like this is communist Minecraft and this is our Cuba land and here's

645
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:10,164
the little voting systems that we've put in place in order to structure these worlds and it's the

646
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:15,626
this proliferation of mini villages each with their own unique form of government. Most of

647
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:23,229
them are dictatorships. Especially that Cuba one. He's like yeah it's communism and we really believe

648
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,010
in communism and I'm the leader of it all.

649
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:33,951
So what we talked about is a lot of foundational elements that

650
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:36,973
lead this. All this stuff is necessary in order to get to

651
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:40,476
governance. But we need to stress the system in order to

652
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:42,818
actually cause these dynamics to emerge.

653
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:50,430
Words with Friends, multiplayer, small groups, it has most of the attributes.

654
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,491
We don't see the level of emergence that works.

655
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:59,514
Because we tend to rely on unofficial norm building when we can.

656
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:03,335
And in Words with Friends, you go back and forth with someone, you build friendship.

657
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:06,256
There's really no need for anything more complex than that.

658
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:08,297
It's a very intimate, friendly game in that way.

659
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:15,429
But then we start hitting the limits of how many relationships we can hold in our head.

660
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,095
Robin Dunbar was a fellow who looked at apes and he said,

661
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,498
Look, our brains are only so big.

662
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:25,221
We can only hold so much stuff in our heads.

663
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,744
And these little monkeys, they can hold, you know, like...

664
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,548
50 relationships, grooming relationships in their head.

665
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,391
And if we measure the same portions of the human brain, it's like he says 150.

666
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:40,875
We can maybe, maybe keep 150 relationships in our head at once.

667
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:49,582
And this idea that like these informal reciprocation loops only scale so far is hugely important.

668
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:59,436
these group dynamics, they break down when groups get large. Below certain numbers and certain

669
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:07,784
complexity, informal norms work. Above that, we need to augment them. We need to use formal rules

670
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:14,510
and like official rules to say, look, I can't spend the time negotiating with you. I just need

671
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,571
you to do it this way.

672
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:21,409
So it tends to max out, like, if you get your group up to 150,

673
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,074
you'll start to see this stuff. This happens a lot lower. Like,

674
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:28,678
I've seen it happen with groups of, like, 15 or 20. So it

675
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:32,182
really depends on, like, how tight the interactions are and

676
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,205
how important the task is.

677
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:41,347
So as the task gets complex, the need for organization and cooperation between various

678
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:47,549
group members becomes higher, and you start to stress the group more, and those informal

679
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:49,870
relationships start breaking down.

680
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,931
So this is a key point.

681
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,073
Government is a social technology.

682
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:06,973
It is a technology that we're implementing in order to solve broken things.

683
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:11,355
We want relationships. We enjoy them. We enjoy working together.

684
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:14,017
We have these big goals that we want to accomplish.

685
00:43:14,618 --> 00:43:18,380
And we implement the techniques of government and governance.

686
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:27,970
in order to get there when the group is too big or our organization is too noisy or the

687
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,532
task is too complex.

688
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:34,456
So governance emerges as solutions to problems.

689
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:39,581
So you have to have that foundation of building relationships and people wanting to work together

690
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,843
before you can actually get governance.

691
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,245
So it's not a magical thing that this stuff happens.

692
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:52,149
You seed the relationship systems and then you stress them and then the community reacts

693
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,990
by forming, by adopting these social technologies.

694
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:04,334
So this is how government patches our broken social relationships.

695
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:11,041
When relationships start to break down, we start to create group identities.

696
00:44:11,922 --> 00:44:13,204
These are things that help us

697
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:17,809
identify better. Like, if I know that you're someone who is

698
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,454
uh... you know, someone who's into free-to-play or someone who uh... maybe you have a big

699
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,176
shirt that says Thunder Bunny on it

700
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:25,938
and I'm a Thunder Bunny as well

701
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:28,241
and I look at you and I see that label

702
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:32,905
then I know there's a certain amount of expectation in the cost of our interaction,

703
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,268
the risk of being rejected is less,

704
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:38,311
and I can actually start to remove some of those costs

705
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,753
and scale my group better, bigger.

706
00:44:41,634 --> 00:44:43,076
So you often see this at GDC.

707
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:45,958
It's amazing how many people come into GDC

708
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,881
and fracture into these smaller and smaller subgroups

709
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:51,985
in order to find their own group identity.

710
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:58,806
So, group by groups are this, official groups are this sort of way of getting around, like,

711
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:03,549
I don't know who you are, and by giving you a label I can know who you are at a low cost.

712
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,493
There's an Onion article that was, um, stereotypes make my life easier.

713
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,915
And it was a horribly funny Onion article.

714
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:15,097
And it was all about all the ways that stereotypes are beneficial.

715
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:17,378
And it was very tongue in cheek.

716
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:22,736
But at the same time, there's a reason why we adopt these labels.

717
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:29,550
They are a reaction to the messiness and complexity and the lack of intimate relationships in the world.

718
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:36,357
uh... in the twitch versus twitch plays pokemon you saw people splitting up into

719
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:40,139
uh... these near religious groups of people who supported uh...

720
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,682
anarchy versus democracy as the way to play the game and they had icons and

721
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:49,064
they would like slur the other people and they would get into these long

722
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:49,744
battles about

723
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:54,026
of their icons was more was better than the other and they were trying to

724
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:55,267
recruit each other and

725
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,688
it was it was fascinating

726
00:45:57,108 --> 00:46:03,974
But it was very much watching this group labeling and emergence in the wild.

727
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:08,278
So I want you all to label yourself at the moment.

728
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,199
This is a horrible thing.

729
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,781
And also I just want to wake you up.

730
00:46:14,283 --> 00:46:19,168
Can you just help me out here and say, like, let's feel that we're all part of the same

731
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:19,468
group.

732
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:21,470
I know we come from different places.

733
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,792
So on the count of three, we are all Thunder Bunnies.

734
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,209
One, two, three.

735
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,431
We are all Thunderbunnies.

736
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:29,813
Oh, God.

737
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:30,734
Once more.

738
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:33,717
We are all Thunderbunnies.

739
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:35,038
Do you feel it?

740
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:38,381
Do you feel like the person next to you is a Thunderbunny.

741
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:41,304
Everyone in this room is a Thunderbunny.

742
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,532
And that's something that no one else outside of this room shares.

743
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:49,814
There's boundaries that we've formed, and the boundaries that we've formed

744
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:53,997
are because we share this experience, we have a shared experience,

745
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:56,318
we have a shared expectation of like,

746
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:59,100
hey, these were all people in this free-to-play talk,

747
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,323
and they all have a common understanding of some of the terms.

748
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:07,625
And when I say Thunderbunny, you can all recall that same shared experience.

749
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:09,026
And if we were to talk about it later,

750
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:11,748
if you were to talk about this experience with a stranger...

751
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:15,958
you might be, it might be awkward, it might be strange, you might hesitate.

752
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:18,419
But if you saw the person next to you,

753
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,960
and you recognized them,

754
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,582
and you said, oh remember, wasn't that strange, this thunder bunny thing that we

755
00:47:24,602 --> 00:47:28,484
just went through, then now you've got this, now you've eased the

756
00:47:28,524 --> 00:47:31,886
communication between the two of you because of that group relationship.

757
00:47:35,308 --> 00:47:36,088
We also create

758
00:47:36,908 --> 00:47:37,809
official norms,

759
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:39,130
official rules.

760
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:40,838
so the social

761
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:42,960
the implicit stuff fails to work

762
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:46,203
so we say no no no this is how you should interact with each other

763
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:50,027
uh... a lot of games use code to enforce lawrence lessig

764
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:51,188
code is law

765
00:47:51,689 --> 00:47:52,289
we tend to

766
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:58,073
We tend to use really harsh dictatorial means of enforcing laws.

767
00:47:58,173 --> 00:48:02,957
Players don't necessarily have that, so they rely on these more like guild rules and things

768
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:03,398
like that.

769
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:08,943
The classic drag and kill points for dividing up loot and MMOs was an example of an official

770
00:48:09,004 --> 00:48:10,225
rule that the groups created.

771
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,569
We then execute rules.

772
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,131
We're really good at...

773
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:20,491
you know, making these things happen and forcing people to do stuff.

774
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:27,658
Players don't necessarily have the ability to enforce rules with law, so they tend to

775
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:32,743
create these, I think of them as protection rackets or mafias or, they're these, they're

776
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:39,730
these things that, there's these groups that exercise power in these ways that are extraordinarily

777
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,610
grass roots.

778
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:47,169
In World of Tanks they have thousands of these clans and

779
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:50,032
they participate in something called clan wars, which is a

780
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:55,676
strategic end game. And in general it works quite well.

781
00:48:55,756 --> 00:49:02,222
However, they end up doing these almost like these mafia-esque

782
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:06,045
ploys with one another where they'll say like, hey, we'll go

783
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,568
and agree to attack this person together. Or if you do that,

784
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,129
maybe you're going to get hurt.

785
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:12,715
you know that type of thing

786
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:17,743
and uh... it it actually uh... it works quite well as as a way of exercising

787
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:18,144
power

788
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:19,486
and often just the threat

789
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,711
of power in these systems is enough to enforce the rules

790
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:27,499
So what they've had to do is they've had to create a council

791
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:28,839
for people to

792
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:33,101
uh... report these things and negotiate these things ahead of time. They've had

793
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,561
this giant Skype channel

794
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:37,742
where what they do is they take one representative from every clan

795
00:49:37,963 --> 00:49:39,243
and they just have this mad

796
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:43,785
chat room of people talking about issues and comments and complaints

797
00:49:44,205 --> 00:49:48,706
and that allows the leaders of the clan to create the smaller social group on

798
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:49,366
top of this

799
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,087
thing so we've got hierarchy now.

800
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:55,965
to sort out some of these issues in a way that the little guys

801
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:58,908
can actually have some control over the bigger mafias.

802
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:01,030
Wonderful stuff.

803
00:50:04,595 --> 00:50:08,736
we can enforce official rules we can detect rule breakers we can punish them

804
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:14,118
uh... we can like as developers we often are looking for certain patterns and

805
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:15,678
then we go and change the code

806
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:22,021
uh... othering and ostracization are the are the big things that tend to happen

807
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:24,761
with unofficial groups they tend to say

808
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:29,423
uh... we're going to shun this person shunning is a very very common technique

809
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:30,904
for uh... enforcing

810
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:31,984
official rules

811
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:36,129
uh, they'll go and say you are not part of this group, I don't want you to be part of

812
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:41,836
this group, that type of thing. And these are age old techniques and we see them happening

813
00:50:42,116 --> 00:50:46,302
in, you know, you can see them happening in tribal villages, you can see them happening,

814
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:51,388
you know, in unofficial groups in modern society, you can also see them happening in our games.

815
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:54,852
uh... rebellions

816
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,436
uh... this was a game called uh... night online

817
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:02,099
and uh... the developers did something that people didn't like

818
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,080
so uh...

819
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:05,923
hundreds upon hundreds of uh...

820
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:09,367
of people found that they could turn into

821
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:15,919
a uh... this dinosaur creature and they found this super rare item

822
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:18,920
that allowed them to turn into a dinosaur

823
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,660
and uh...

824
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,121
ended up having a larger hitbox

825
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:26,722
than their normal player character so entire cities

826
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:28,283
would be filled

827
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:29,783
with these giant

828
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:32,406
30 foot tall dinosaur creatures.

829
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:35,070
And it would block everything.

830
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:40,316
And it was their pacifist protest, their peaceful

831
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:43,219
protest against the changes that were

832
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,221
happening in the game.

833
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:51,659
And so what they did is they acted like a dictator.

834
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:55,502
The developers said, look, we have absolute power over this

835
00:51:55,582 --> 00:51:58,984
world, what we're going to do is we're going to essentially

836
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:00,445
unleash the hounds.

837
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:06,229
And so they created these attackers and spawned them in

838
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:08,771
the center of these peaceful protesters.

839
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:13,346
and a stampede occurred.

840
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:18,089
So the players were desperately trying to run out of the way but they were

841
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:19,030
these giant

842
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,573
thirty foot tall dinosaurs and they couldn't fit through arches and they

843
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:24,493
couldn't do anything

844
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:28,016
and it was just a complete massacre and there was bloodshed everywhere.

845
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:29,237
Virtual blood.

846
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:31,238
uh...

847
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:32,379
and then

848
00:52:32,939 --> 00:52:35,041
what was interesting about this is uh...

849
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:36,401
everyone loved it.

850
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,082
because it meant that the gods were listening

851
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:46,365
and they actually like ended up addressing the issues

852
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,246
and everyone had a good time

853
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,308
and it was actually a reciprocation loop

854
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:53,409
between the players and the developers

855
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:57,031
even though you can put it in these very violent terms

856
00:52:57,371 --> 00:52:58,792
that's not how everyone saw it

857
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,914
so quite interesting

858
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:04,035
um

859
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:11,235
The overall thing that I want to talk, emphasize here is that this is lord of the flies.

860
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:17,400
This is unofficial governance. You notice I haven't gone into long laborious discussions

861
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,704
of voting systems or legislative structures or moderation policies.

862
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:24,826
Each of those is a talk unto itself and is super specialized.

863
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:32,222
A lot of these games get by by setting out this bare minimum and then letting the players

864
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:35,344
build this civilization and society on top of that.

865
00:53:36,826 --> 00:53:44,512
Players when we talk about social technologies, players are the grassroots adopters of social

866
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:45,332
technologies.

867
00:53:45,612 --> 00:53:51,777
This stuff comes from the players and that is that magical generative element that ends

868
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:51,997
up...

869
00:53:52,678 --> 00:53:55,180
making these games last as long as they do,

870
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,602
and becoming as engaging as they do.

871
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:02,787
So then the question for me is,

872
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:05,149
well, what the heck does that leave the designers?

873
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:07,531
Where, where, where, what's my role in all of this?

874
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:12,910
and uh... richard bartle who was the co-creator of the first online mud

875
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:13,931
uh...

876
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:18,974
he had this idea that uh... designers create this physical reality

877
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:23,276
that then players then build these complex social structures upon

878
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:27,139
and because we're operating at a level of

879
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:29,881
he had this idea of levels of physics

880
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:33,603
like the players operate within the context of the physical world of the

881
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:34,043
game

882
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:35,264
but developers

883
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:42,448
operate outside of that reality of the game and they can actually change the physical laws of the universe.

884
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:49,372
And so, we need to consider ourselves, we're not really in the business of making governments.

885
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:55,496
Like, to some degree, like that's something that's actually better left to the players because

886
00:54:56,296 --> 00:55:03,741
that gives them their agency and their mastery and this large shared purpose by building these giant social edifices.

887
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:10,658
and they do a really good job of it and it's messy and it's awkward yet it's very effective

888
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:17,667
and involving and rich and maybe our job as game designers are more to be these gods that

889
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,468
set the physics.

890
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:27,277
I am a god that likes poking things.

891
00:55:27,837 --> 00:55:29,238
I like messing with stuff.

892
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:34,302
And what I've noticed is that it's really, you see the physics and the players make the

893
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:40,467
society, but there's a relationship between the players and the gods, the developers of

894
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,128
the world that's equally important.

895
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:50,394
And what we can do is we can sort of, we can create that foundation and then poke it periodically

896
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:53,937
and adjust and garden and enhance whatever's there.

897
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:05,150
So, to summarize, this is the formula. This is

898
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:09,851
the simple formula for creating governance in your games.

899
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:13,133
For creating these emergent systems that are more than

900
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:17,054
a content treadmill that slowly declines over time as

901
00:56:17,094 --> 00:56:19,135
you try to squeeze more out of that rock.

902
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:25,741
So first, embrace and encourage the messy reality of people

903
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,044
building society with other people.

904
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:33,090
Like, it's going to be awkward and bad things are going to

905
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,771
happen, but a lot of good things are

906
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,833
going to happen as well.

907
00:56:37,475 --> 00:56:40,158
As developers, we create.

908
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,711
a foundation for human interaction.

909
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:51,838
We need to build into our games rich, fast, strong, high-frequency reciprocation.

910
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:58,784
We also need to build into our games rich communication, so that players can actually

911
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:03,849
share ideas and feelings and thoughts about themselves and build social relationships

912
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:04,610
with one another.

913
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,514
Next, we need to create a reason to work together.

914
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,616
So shared resources are hugely important.

915
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:19,378
Opportunities to be more efficient as a group.

916
00:57:20,038 --> 00:57:24,480
The utopia of the empowered individual is, in some ways,

917
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,101
a negative if you're trying to build this type of system.

918
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:32,907
It's, there's different play styles, so like, a mix is usually good.

919
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:39,151
But often we tend to, as we have this techno-libertarian bent, so we tend to focus way too much on

920
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:43,794
the empowered individual and not enough on the group that is better together.

921
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:53,140
We need to, then the last piece is even if you have all these elements in here, you need

922
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,961
to stress those social structures.

923
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:01,905
so that the players end up spawning rules and reacting to the stress social structure

924
00:58:02,185 --> 00:58:03,885
in order to form stronger groups.

925
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:11,947
This is wonderful study about what is the biggest factor in the formation of civilization

926
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:15,428
when they, they, there's these scientists and what they do is they basically take these

927
00:58:15,468 --> 00:58:20,389
little tiny bots and they add rules to the bots and then they run thousands of iterations

928
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:25,250
of the tiny little bots until civilization emerges, which I think is a wonderful way

929
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,950
to spend your time.

930
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:33,735
And they were getting these things that replicated European civilization about 20%.

931
00:58:34,036 --> 00:58:37,618
They put in all these factors and stuff and they'd say,

932
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:44,002
well, how do we, can we simulate the rise of European civilization

933
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:46,204
given all these factors in our tiny little bots?

934
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:48,225
And they'd get to the point where it replicates maybe 20% of it.

935
00:58:50,217 --> 00:58:51,918
And then they added in war.

936
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:54,260
They added in violence and war.

937
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,683
And then just that one change, the correlation between their

938
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:02,565
model and what happened in reality, rose to 80%.

939
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:07,769
And it's this idea of stressing, stressing those

940
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:11,051
social groups and bonds, stressing that iterated game

941
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:14,133
that people are playing when they create relationships in

942
00:59:14,213 --> 00:59:15,574
order to force them to.

943
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:21,116
how do we create these technologies, these social technologies to work better together.

944
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:29,022
And so, once you have all those pieces, you get this sort of explosion of dynamics.

945
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:29,942
And that's exciting.

946
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:31,283
That's something we can engineer.

947
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:34,766
That's not, it's not lightning in a bottle that you can never really capture.

948
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:37,908
It's something we can actually engineer and build our games around.

949
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:46,270
And as game developers maybe we prune, we cultivate, but ultimately the players in the

950
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:52,356
communities like are this massive generative source of value and that is what keeps our

951
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:53,518
games alive long term.

952
00:59:59,444 --> 01:00:00,125
That's all I got.

953
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:13,884
There's evaluations that are going to be emailed to you.

954
01:00:14,404 --> 01:00:15,024
Fill them out.

955
01:00:17,085 --> 01:00:21,386
I don't have a system where if you have less than a five, you just email me, but if you

956
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:22,766
want to email me, you can do that.

957
01:00:24,226 --> 01:00:30,787
If you have any questions, come up to the mic and be sure to state your question clearly.

958
01:00:33,148 --> 01:00:35,608
And I'm happy to mumble on.

959
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:57,767
connectivity, is there anything that it can do to create some form of governance?

960
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:06,977
The question is can a single player game create this sort of emergence. I have seen zero evidence

961
01:01:07,057 --> 01:01:08,499
of that. Now

962
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:12,454
that's perhaps too strong.

963
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:20,357
I have seen communities who treat, like the Spelunky community would be an example of

964
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:26,919
this, where they've treated a single player game as a shared experience and the reciprocation

965
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:29,160
loops happen outside of the game.

966
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,861
They happen either in Twitter or in small local communities.

967
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:37,663
So once you can, if you end up pushing the community outside of the game...

968
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,724
then you can get some of these dynamics.

969
01:01:41,304 --> 01:01:45,446
But you tend not to get super strong governance in the same way.

970
01:01:45,646 --> 01:01:48,767
It's a different, it's a different style of, of, of thing.

971
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:52,428
It's not, they're not reacting directly to the game.

972
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:55,749
They're sort of building their own experience outside of that.

973
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:57,609
You see this in forums actually.

974
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:00,010
So a lot of times forums are a

975
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:07,672
a system of social governance that has almost nothing to do with the actual game that you're

976
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:12,774
playing. It's a game that people are playing outside of the game. So that can happen.

977
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:13,874
Thank you.

978
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:23,376
Hi. Thanks for your talk. I just have a question about, do you think the group, the strong

979
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:29,618
groups need to be hostile and exclusive to other groups in order to have this strong

980
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:30,978
community? Or is there a way to?

981
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:34,556
I don't think groups need to be hostile.

982
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:40,020
I think throughout human civilization, there's strong evidence that we tend to be hostile.

983
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:48,986
So there is a tendency due to limited economic resources, tendency due to the way we exercise

984
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,428
power, that it is the blunt tool that is highly effective.

985
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,671
and you see it over and over and over again,

986
01:02:55,691 --> 01:03:00,617
I think there's an art to creating games that don't have that.

987
01:03:00,817 --> 01:03:04,882
I personally tend to focus on zero-sum cooperative games,

988
01:03:05,503 --> 01:03:09,807
so by doing so, you actually remove a lot of that tension

989
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:13,191
that tends to cause those hugely hostile groups.

990
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:18,035
So I think you can, I think you can tune and engineer and create social norms that prevent

991
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:23,019
some of the more egregious instances of that, but it's a lot of work and we're actually,

992
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,541
we seem to be operating against human nature.

993
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:26,602
Okay, thanks.

994
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:30,605
Yeah.

995
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:31,966
Thanks for the talk.

996
01:03:32,486 --> 01:03:37,410
At what point do you as a designer, like, would set up restrictions or rules for limiting

997
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:41,313
governance in order to maintain structure and reduce, like, a barrier to entry?

998
01:03:43,322 --> 01:03:47,845
a lot of governance. It's hard to get into the game once they've built up, because you

999
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:48,745
feel like an outsider.

1000
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:55,108
So how would you go about dealing with those issues? And how'd you come up with the thunder

1001
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:55,449
bunny?

1002
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:02,012
The thunder bunny came to me in the shower one day. I'm like, thunder bunny is the coolest

1003
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:02,572
word ever.

1004
01:04:02,732 --> 01:04:03,993
It's the best place for ideas.

1005
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:09,896
Yeah. The, so, so could you, what was the first part of the question?

1006
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:11,737
Yeah, sorry.

1007
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:18,461
So, at what point as a designer do you set up restrictions or rules for limiting governance?

1008
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,183
Yes.

1009
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,765
So, so, this is, this is a fundamental issue.

1010
01:04:23,785 --> 01:04:30,251
The big, the big question here is like, when you, when this explosion of, of, of dynamic

1011
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,834
behavior starts happening and governments start happening and people start forming these,

1012
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:38,497
these groups, groups tend to have boundaries and walls, and walls tend to keep people out.

1013
01:04:39,658 --> 01:04:39,838
So.

1014
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,594
it's actually like a big problem.

1015
01:04:44,154 --> 01:04:47,276
So what you do is you encourage groups to recruit.

1016
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:56,615
And by doing so, you can actually put the onus on the groups

1017
01:04:56,955 --> 01:04:58,216
to bring people into them.

1018
01:04:58,256 --> 01:05:00,397
Because all these groups have churn and people leave

1019
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:02,679
and they want to still stay strong.

1020
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:05,861
And you see this, like a lot of these games,

1021
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:07,502
even though they're incredibly complex,

1022
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:11,164
what ends up happening is that the way that people are brought into them

1023
01:05:11,605 --> 01:05:12,926
is through organic channels

1024
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:15,928
as opposed to something like paid advertising or so.

1025
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:19,449
because people are so invested in the game

1026
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:22,170
that they're willing to either sit down with a friend

1027
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,391
or bring them into it.

1028
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:28,572
And so the big spikes you don't necessarily always get

1029
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:31,334
or like people tend to, if they come into it

1030
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,454
without an introduction, they may bounce off of it.

1031
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:35,855
But the people who come in through those organic channels

1032
01:05:36,175 --> 01:05:40,057
end up being a very, very strong participant in the community.

1033
01:05:41,257 --> 01:05:41,477
Thanks.

1034
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:45,679
That's good.

1035
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:48,175
All right, thank you so much.
