1
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:10,867
All right, I think we can start. 3.30.

2
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,828
Let's settle down.

3
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:18,811
All right, we had some technical problems.

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,693
Hopefully, everything works now.

5
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:22,713
Thank you, computer.

6
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:28,156
So I'm David Dicutitze, sound designer at DICE.

7
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,097
I've been working on Star Wars Battlefront

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,738
for the past few years.

9
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,101
And I'm Gordy Habb, I compose the music for Battlefront.

10
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:36,401
Oh, I don't get it.

11
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:44,267
OK, so our standing on the shoulders of giants

12
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:44,847
is our session.

13
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,388
So what does that mean?

14
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:52,753
I didn't come up with the name, but I did the Photoshop.

15
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:58,938
So on the left here, we see sound designer Ben Burtt,

16
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:01,039
and on the right, composer John Williams.

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,317
And both of these are very known for their work,

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,338
especially on Star Wars.

19
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:15,739
And today we're going to talk in two parts

20
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,699
about how we took their legendary legacy

21
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:18,940
into a 2015 released game.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,240
And I'm going to start off with the sound design.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,601
So first, I'm going to give you an idea of what

24
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,741
our initial target or goals were,

25
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,842
some challenges we encountered, how we approached those,

26
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:31,282
and a conclusion.

27
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:36,464
But first off, we did go to Skywalker Sound

28
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:40,746
on the Skywalker Ranch on a few trips, which was amazing.

29
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:45,308
And through the collaboration with Skywalker Sound,

30
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:49,010
we got the film stamps from the original movies

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,312
and the prequels, which allowed us to listen to dialogue

32
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:57,454
as effects music in separation while watching the movie, which

33
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:58,334
is great for reference.

34
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:58,775
We did have a full day.

35
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:07,132
eight-hour Foley session at the Skywalker Ranch with the talent there.

36
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:11,776
And there we recorded Rebel and Stormtrooper movement sounds.

37
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:17,102
And we also received an extensive Star Wars sound effect library,

38
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,264
as many games before us.

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,188
But we also had the ability to ask for additional content

40
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,330
when we really needed something very specific.

41
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:37,915
We also had the ability to talk to legends like Ben Burtt and Matt Wood.

42
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,635
And this is here in Ben Burtt's office.

43
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:46,316
It's the only picture, it's blurry, but well, can't complain.

44
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:53,018
So it was great to hear some stories and get some insights of how things were done back

45
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:58,639
in the days, which is mostly a lot more dangerous than today, regarding electricity and so on.

46
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:05,101
But first off, what is Star Wars sound?

47
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,384
Star Wars trademark sound?

48
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:10,647
I would argue it feels like a lived in universe that has

49
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,849
many fantasy elements, but it still feels

50
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,971
relatable and tangible.

51
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:20,356
And I would say it is the movie franchise with the most

52
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:23,879
recognizable sound effects to date.

53
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,402
And here's a quick compilation of just some of those sound

54
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:26,822
effects.

55
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:54,514
And all of those were from the game, actually.

56
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:58,295
All right, so what did we try to achieve?

57
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,377
First off, we wanted to embrace the original soundscape,

58
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,718
the original style and tone.

59
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,539
And that doesn't just mean, of course, sticking to the sounds.

60
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,320
Everyone knows.

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,161
But also, when we make anything new,

62
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:13,243
we'd have to embrace the way the old sounds were made,

63
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,384
which means organic sound design and using analog synth.

64
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:23,975
as opposed to highly digital sounding, heavily processed sounds as you would often do these days.

65
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,557
And here's an example of some of those newer sounds.

66
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:51,094
So the thermo imploder effect was a combination of analog synth that we recorded out of the

67
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:56,416
modular system of audio director Ben Minto and combined with real world sounds such as

68
00:04:56,416 --> 00:05:04,699
explosions, wire twangs, metal hits, tank shell fly-bys, plane wind-ups, etc.

69
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:11,701
And the R5 Scream as I was shooting it, that was actually a barely compressed scream of

70
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:12,882
sound designer Gustav.

71
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,268
Take the picture, please.

72
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:19,810
And yeah, organic sound design.

73
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,650
There you go.

74
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,112
So from there, we wanted to extend,

75
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:26,853
thinking about that we were making a game.

76
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:30,214
Of course, we had to think about the player experience.

77
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,035
What does it mean to be inside the world

78
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,076
and not just an observer?

79
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:38,438
We had to, we knew that we had to remaster

80
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,458
a lot of the old sounds to make them.

81
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,112
well, to expectations of today's audience.

82
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:47,795
And we knew that we wanted to worldize the sounds in a sense

83
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,378
that even though they're sometimes crazy sci-fi sounds,

84
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:54,100
they have to sound like they naturally propagate

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,962
through those environments you're in.

86
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,664
And here's an example for the player experience.

87
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:02,326
So pay attention to the subtle things,

88
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:05,689
like the foley and the breathing and the ambience,

89
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,571
but then the in-your-face flashbang at the end as well.

90
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:34,986
So as a little fun fact, two days before I started working at DICE, I pierced my right

91
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:46,635
eardrum with a twig, unintentionally, and I wanted to bring that experience to the audience

92
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:51,319
through the flashbang effect. That's what it sounds like. Oh, I should mention, it has

93
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,683
healed. I'm not, like, deaf. In fact, my right ear is better than my left ear now.

94
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:06,266
Well, next we wanted to enrich beyond the visual, which mostly relates to ambiences

95
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:11,829
where we would add a lot of sounds even though we have no visual connection, so we would

96
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:16,411
take any chance we have to add more Star Warsiness into the game.

97
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:24,815
And here's an example of when you are a stormtrooper, an imperial soldier, and you go close to an

98
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,096
Ewok village on Endor.

99
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:30,230
they will start, the Ewoks will start throwing stones at you

100
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,712
and might even hit you on the helmet

101
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,735
and cause some hands, handshake.

102
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:38,282
And that whole system is basically faked through sound.

103
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:39,424
There is no visual connection to it.

104
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:09,083
So with all that in mind, here's the crossfade of Return of the Jedi, Episode 6, Endor Battle,

105
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,169
into a multiplayer recording of the game on Endor.

106
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,590
So what were some of the challenges we faced?

107
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,353
And this is a short summary of that.

108
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:56,376
So there was very variable reference audio fidelity.

109
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:59,259
If you just compare episode four to episode five,

110
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:02,661
there was a big jump in just raw frequency output.

111
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:06,404
And we obviously had to make all that content consistent,

112
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:09,807
and also consistent with everything new that we created.

113
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:15,505
There were lots of new weapons and gadgets, environments,

114
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,827
and events, such as Star Destroyer crashing

115
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:23,071
into a planet, that don't have any reference in the movies.

116
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,713
And generally, when you take something

117
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,934
from a linear environment like film

118
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,896
into a dynamic environment like games,

119
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:34,319
it's not a trivial task, because those assets were created

120
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,201
for very specific situations.

121
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,243
And in the game, you can encounter a lot more.

122
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,494
different situations for those sounds, like different distances, perspectives, angles,

123
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:45,935
environments.

124
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:51,219
And also, a sound that might appear once in all three movies might be turned into a gadget

125
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:58,204
or weapon for players to use for many hours, right, to make it their primary experience.

126
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:03,147
And of course, if it's just one sound in the movies, the quantity and variety just isn't

127
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:04,788
there to support that gameplay.

128
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,020
So there were a lot of blanks that we had to fill out,

129
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,721
but in a seamless way that does not dilute the original sound.

130
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:17,862
And also, we often had to balance

131
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,563
gameplay requirements and movie authenticity, which

132
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,863
are not always the same.

133
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:24,944
Here's an example of that.

134
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:29,705
So these are all the weapons, handheld weapons in the game,

135
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,005
or most of them.

136
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,246
And I'm just going to play a quick compilation of those.

137
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:57,206
So these are the weapons that actually do have sound reference in the movies.

138
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:01,167
And these are the weapons that have unique movie sound reference.

139
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:06,809
And what I mean by unique here is the character of the weapon never changes throughout the

140
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,251
movies and they don't reuse the sound that previously appeared for something else.

141
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:23,318
Reusing sounds like that is never a problem in the movies because there's often a lot of time that passes in between those moments and what matters more there is what works for that scene.

142
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:35,163
But in the game you can have all weapons potentially next to each other and it wouldn't be good for player information to have some of them share the same assets.

143
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:40,025
And also when you unlock a new weapon you don't really want it to sound like what you just had before.

144
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,723
So how did we approach making most sounds in the game?

145
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:50,225
First off, we would define what the sound is.

146
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,486
We would look at the reference.

147
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,508
We would see how clear is the reference,

148
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,769
and does it overlap with anything.

149
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,452
Often, if there is a reference, then we

150
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,113
would remaster the assets.

151
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:04,536
Here's a spectrogram example of a Tatooine wind.

152
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,458
So you read it bottom to top, low frequencies

153
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,479
to high frequencies.

154
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,601
And as you can hopefully see on the right side.

155
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:15,106
There's more content in the higher frequency ranges, which

156
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:20,487
is what you lose mostly through older recordings on tape.

157
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:24,889
And we do that through a variety of tools

158
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:30,471
where we bring out some of the weaker or filtered frequencies.

159
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:32,772
And we would also add content on top that

160
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,652
fits to the source underneath.

161
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,570
When we make something new, of course,

162
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,691
we have to make sure that it seamlessly

163
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:44,413
fits into the soundscape.

164
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,015
Ideally, someone new to Star Wars,

165
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,597
maybe someone like that exists, would not

166
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:53,700
be able to tell the difference between an old Star Wars

167
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,421
sound and a new one.

168
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,102
So speaking of fitting in, you don't

169
00:12:57,102 --> 00:13:04,808
want to end up with this, where clearly this person is

170
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:05,628
Photoshopped in.

171
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,231
So when we have the content, we would then

172
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:17,013
build a modular system for the runtime behavior.

173
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,955
And that helps us to make the experience very

174
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:25,637
immersive through a high amount of variation

175
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,298
and being very adaptable to the game's conditions.

176
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:32,500
So I'm going to go through an example with the classic E11

177
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,422
blaster that everyone knows.

178
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:38,203
And this is the.

179
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:40,840
This is the visual scripting.

180
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,922
This is a sound graph for the firing logic.

181
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:49,824
So here on the left, we see in these red boxes,

182
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,524
it's six layers.

183
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:54,506
Each layer represents a sound in itself.

184
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:58,968
And it can be something like the bass punch, the core laser,

185
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:02,169
and the short-term reflections and long-term reflections.

186
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:11,162
And some of those layers have sub-layers where the content changes based on environment and

187
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:13,002
distance to the listener.

188
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:17,423
And each of those sounds has a number of variations.

189
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:23,545
So if you add everything up you end up with roughly 150 unique sound files used for the

190
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:24,585
E11 blaster firing.

191
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:30,490
And 20% of those roughly are based on the movie reference

192
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,013
and based in terms of modified to fit the gameplay

193
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:35,653
perspectives.

194
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:36,454
And then if you do the math, you end up

195
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:40,296
with roughly 700,000 variations for firing

196
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,717
the weapon in first person.

197
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,079
And that sounds maybe excessive, but.

198
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,386
In practice, some layers stand out more than others.

199
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,287
And we realized that very early on,

200
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,428
especially when there was just one blaster

201
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,709
and everyone fired it.

202
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,750
You would run into synthetic sounding repetition very fast.

203
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,091
And we want to avoid that at all costs

204
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,672
because we don't want the player to think about the game

205
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:13,714
as sound files being played from a hard drive or memory.

206
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:17,936
We want the player to think the sound exists in the world.

207
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:26,960
So we add a lot of parameter randomization where we modulate individual layer amplitude,

208
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,962
pitch, and timing offsets.

209
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:34,467
And that basically keeps the weapon constantly evolving and changing

210
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,931
and it keeps it alive and organic.

211
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,172
We do some filtering, so...

212
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:43,777
Even though we change content on distance,

213
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,798
we also help it out more with filtering,

214
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:49,900
where we cut low end and high shelf.

215
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,902
We also filter based on perspective and angle.

216
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,643
So perspective being first person, third person,

217
00:15:56,643 --> 00:16:00,125
shooting from the hip, shooting when scoped.

218
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,506
And angle, well, if it's shooting towards you

219
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,167
or away from you.

220
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,328
And it's most dangerous, most sharp

221
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,449
when it's shooting towards you.

222
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:15,108
We do some further randomization through peaking filters,

223
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:19,329
where we randomly dip or boost certain frequencies

224
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,289
within a defined range.

225
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,410
And that basically makes every instance of their weapon

226
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,731
that exists on the map always unique in the sense

227
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,612
that it is a subtle, but if you have 10 players

228
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,753
shooting the same weapon at the same distance

229
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:37,233
in the same environment, still each E11

230
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,654
will have a slight unique touch to it.

231
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:47,426
here's a video that shows you uh just firing in first person in different environments. And

232
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:51,732
uh it's a demonstration of how the content basically changes based on the environment.

233
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:37,191
Right, and here's a comparison of what the E-11 sounds on different distances.

234
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:57,350
And that's different filtering and different content for each of those distances.

235
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,223
There's some further stuff going on.

236
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,485
So we help out our obstruction system

237
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,528
in combination with our area type system, where

238
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:11,830
we make assumptions based on where the player is in relation

239
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,372
to where the sound is.

240
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:18,676
We separate the pinpoint source of the content

241
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,597
with the reflection content.

242
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,959
So reflections play more surround,

243
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:27,442
and the pinpoint source plays in the 3D world.

244
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,631
We also derive a slapback echo from the laser layer.

245
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,032
And that also changes based on the environment you're in.

246
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:42,833
Here's an example of a different weapon, the RT97C.

247
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,374
Sounds like a microphone.

248
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:49,495
And it shows you how the content changes, again,

249
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:54,697
for the different environments and how the obstruction works

250
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,698
when someone moves from outside to inside.

251
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:58,218
Or, yeah.

252
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,774
And now, just to show you how basically all of this applies to, uh, the two other sounds in the

253
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:31,999
game, um, here's the AT-ST Walker and it, again, it is made up of multiple layers, uh, that are

254
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:37,442
individually randomized and modified based on game conditions. And the vel- uh, the video

255
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:42,545
shows you each layer coming in one by one and until you hear the whole thing in the end.

256
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:30,704
Right, so what did we learn?

257
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:34,927
I would say we got a pretty intuitive understanding

258
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,468
of the Star Wars soundscape.

259
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,011
We know what works and what doesn't.

260
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:44,754
We found some pretty solid ways of building systems out

261
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:48,117
of the movie assets.

262
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:51,359
We learned how to utilize the power of the next gen,

263
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,583
or now current gen, PS4, Xbox One, and PC, of course.

264
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:56,723
And

265
00:20:57,938 --> 00:21:01,100
where we were the first game to implement Dolby Atmos,

266
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,642
and that's actually a big topic in itself.

267
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:06,962
So I just have it as a note here,

268
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:11,544
but I guess you can learn more on the internet.

269
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:13,325
And I just now realize I should have

270
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:15,565
said that you should turn off your phones,

271
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:20,307
but nothing happened, so never mind.

272
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:22,708
Yeah, and then that's over to Gordy.

273
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,008
Thank you.

274
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,858
Hi again, my name is Gordy Hab, I compose music for Battlefront.

275
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:43,004
And when I was thinking about what to talk about, I decided to divide my talk into two halves.

276
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:49,169
First, more generally, I wanted to speak about composing for existing franchises,

277
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,453
not just Star Wars, because I thought this could be a good takeaway for composers in the room or sound designers alike.

278
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,294
And the approaches that I...

279
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:03,242
sort of derived for composing for existing franchises.

280
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:06,423
Application, in my case, for Battlefront.

281
00:22:06,423 --> 00:22:09,923
And then also talk specifically about composing the music

282
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:14,845
for Battlefront and some of the tasks and goals

283
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,265
that were associated with the game and the project.

284
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:20,346
My approach and production choices

285
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:23,326
I made for hopefully a successful result.

286
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:30,659
and process and results, I'll play examples as well.

287
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,342
So, composing for existing franchises.

288
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:38,305
Here's a quote from one of my favorite composers,

289
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:41,368
probably my favorite quote.

290
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:46,372
And I use this as sort of an example

291
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:50,576
and sort of extracted these two methods that I've used.

292
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,214
believe are ways to write within certain set parameters,

293
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:58,357
and one of which I believe is the better of two approaches

294
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,639
that at least allows for more creativity or originality.

295
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:01,840
Here is the first approach,

296
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,942
would be sort of a paint-by-numbers method.

297
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:18,544
Meaning, using maybe specific melodies, like for instance, in my case, if I was to take

298
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:22,768
the John Williams force theme and then re-harmonize it, that might be an example.

299
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:28,553
Or the reverse of that, taking the harmony from the force theme, but writing a new melody

300
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:34,358
over top of it to create something new.

301
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:35,660
Or using the exact structure.

302
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:39,239
or form from a piece of music as sort of a starting point

303
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,200
and then filling in blanks.

304
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,261
That's one method.

305
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:49,025
The second method, which I believe is better,

306
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,185
is using a painter's palette.

307
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:53,407
And I'll show you, here's an example of a piece of art

308
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:54,648
that we probably all know.

309
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:56,629
This is Starry Night.

310
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:59,291
And paint by numbers.

311
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,532
Here's sort of the structure and form

312
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,353
of this particular painting.

313
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:11,561
And if we were just to take the structure and form and then fill in the blanks, we might end up with something like this.

314
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:17,083
Which is good. It's certainly not offensive. It's pretty. But it's not original.

315
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:24,786
And the original is always going to be perceived as the better of the two with this particular approach.

316
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:32,028
So the second approach, the one that I firmly believe in, and had adopted for my work on Battlefront,

317
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,281
is using a similar painter's palette.

318
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:37,442
And what do I mean by that?

319
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,885
By this, I mean extracting the general language, idioms

320
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:47,247
or isms of the music or the colors,

321
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:52,749
and then adding those to my own palette, my tools to pull from.

322
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,550
And then just composing original music the way

323
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,651
I know best how to compose original music.

324
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,052
So my own.

325
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:02,074
you know, sort of method to writing,

326
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:06,236
but then just using this new palette.

327
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:08,197
So here's our painting again.

328
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:08,998
And here is an example of a painting

329
00:25:08,998 --> 00:25:13,620
that I feel is similar, but uses a painter's palette

330
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,342
approach versus the paint-by-numbers approach.

331
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,042
So here's a Dali painting.

332
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:18,962
And another example from Pollock.

333
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:31,268
similar palette, has a similar whimsical feel to it, but is very original and creative.

334
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:38,095
Or this Kandinsky painting, which I personally love and have a copy of in my house.

335
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:45,162
So the question is, how do you develop your painter's palette?

336
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:50,838
Score study is step one.

337
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:52,878
Studying and reducing scores,

338
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:56,080
and spotting patterns and reoccurring motifs,

339
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,002
and just reoccurring sort of isms, as I like to call them.

340
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:02,683
And you can spot them visually,

341
00:26:02,683 --> 00:26:05,584
and it's a good way to sort of start building your palette.

342
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:10,446
The most important probably is listening.

343
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:14,548
Listen to the source material.

344
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:22,982
know how to get this out. It's right in the middle of my notes.

345
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:35,171
There we go. Sorry, there's a window in the middle of my notes. There we go. Cool. So

346
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:45,399
listening to the source material, find things that you like about the source material. So

347
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:53,703
some things that you're attracted to because you're going to naturally latch onto those more and probably be able to bring those to your own work better.

348
00:26:53,703 --> 00:27:01,670
Collecting the, you know, isms and, you know, the patterns that you really are attracted to and then adding those to your

349
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,351
palette as well.

350
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:08,155
and then internalizing these things. So, listening to the source, internalize it, find the things

351
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:13,159
you love most, make it a part of who you are, and then just forget about all of this and

352
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,686
write what feels most naturally. You're just using a new color palette. So, here's an example

353
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:27,072
from a piece of music from Star Wars that we probably, most of us probably know. This

354
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,634
is from the asteroid field, John Williams.

355
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:05,515
I love that.

356
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,076
It's so great.

357
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:16,983
Okay, so after listening to multiple examples, that example included, and then of course

358
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:24,347
all of the original scores, I started to collect my colors and my idioms.

359
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:27,209
And a few examples here.

360
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,152
just from listening to this one example,

361
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,213
are melodies in harmonized brass,

362
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:37,376
and in particular, melodies in closed voicings at the top

363
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,937
and spread voicings at the bottom,

364
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:40,758
what I like to call a perfect voicing

365
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:43,300
because it imitates the overtone series.

366
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,823
Strings in spread voicings or in octaves

367
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:49,984
to create space or a sense of grandeur.

368
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,559
parallel triads over a pedal bass.

369
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,464
In particular, John Williams likes to write a diatonic melody,

370
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,487
but then harmonize it top-down in triads

371
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:04,670
and move that parallel over a pedal bass movement.

372
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,074
It's a really interesting approach that keeps the ear

373
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:09,495
believing it's diatonic music,

374
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,698
even though it becomes chromatic.

375
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,440
Fast moving woodwind runs to bridge transitions or to add excitement.

376
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:27,125
Woodwinds doubling brass in an octave above to kind of add a shimmer or a brightness to the sound

377
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:31,167
is a very typical John Williams orchestration trick.

378
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:39,751
Fast moving tremolo lines and strings that sort of add momentum to build into new sections

379
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:42,573
or add some excitement or some anticipation, if you will.

380
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:47,656
And then counterpoint, this is something that John Williams,

381
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:49,176
in my opinion, is a master at.

382
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:53,758
And if I studied anything more than anything else,

383
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,398
it was his use of counterpoint

384
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,219
and then started to internalize that for myself.

385
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:03,060
So here's our painting again, our reference painting.

386
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,421
And after having gone through all of this process

387
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:07,962
and adapting my own palette,

388
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,962
here's an example of what I was able to come up with.

389
00:30:49,535 --> 00:31:07,141
And as always, thanks for watching.

390
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,191
Thank you.

391
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:21,233
I appreciate it.

392
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,436
So next I'll talk a bit about specifically composing

393
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:27,078
the music for Battlefront and applying the things

394
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,379
that I learned from these methods.

395
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:33,224
So some of the tasks and goals that I had specifically

396
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,826
for Battlefront was that the music needed

397
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:38,108
to be unique and original, but it

398
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,689
needed to feel like Star Wars.

399
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:42,552
It needed to still have that nostalgia

400
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:44,854
that I think we all know so well from this music.

401
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:49,437
The music needed to serve specific functions in the game,

402
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:51,799
and I'll go into more detail in a bit about those

403
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,760
and play examples as well.

404
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,783
And then the music needed to live alongside

405
00:32:56,783 --> 00:33:01,427
of John Williams' music, musically and sonically.

406
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:03,769
And I mean this almost quite literally

407
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,211
because in some of these examples I'll play in a bit,

408
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,673
I'll show you how I was able to transition

409
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:11,015
from existing John Williams' music

410
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:12,796
seamlessly into my own music

411
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,337
and then back into John Williams' music.

412
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:20,738
So, I also had to take into consideration certain approach

413
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:24,939
and production choices to hopefully, you know,

414
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,759
have a successful end point.

415
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,400
It's kind of a tall order.

416
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,321
So, to accomplish this goal, I adapted my process

417
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:39,621
and made these particular production choices.

418
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:44,482
So, composing with a pencil and paper like John Williams would do.

419
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:50,368
I did that for every single note for this entire score I wrote by hand, which is not

420
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:51,148
common even for me.

421
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:55,711
I mean, I'd like to work that way, but it's certainly a new challenge.

422
00:33:55,711 --> 00:34:00,454
But I think it allowed me to sort of get in the same mindset as John Williams might have

423
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:02,256
been in.

424
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:06,178
I orchestrated all the music myself, and this was a conscious choice because it allowed

425
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:09,140
me to have complete control over the end result.

426
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:13,464
And rather than doing mock-ups myself,

427
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:15,905
I actually reallocated my orchestration budget

428
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:18,366
to hiring a full-time synthestrator

429
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:20,627
to create mock-ups from my manuscript sketches.

430
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:23,829
And that's how we were able to get music approved.

431
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,309
His name was Sam Smythe.

432
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:26,330
He's absolutely amazing.

433
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,191
If you want his number, I'm happy to give it to you

434
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,112
because he's just phenomenal.

435
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,513
His mock-ups are great.

436
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:40,002
production choices that were certainly important to getting a great end result. We used the

437
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:45,607
London Symphony Orchestra, a full 100-piece orchestra, which was certainly amazing, and

438
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:52,594
recorded at Abbey Road Studios, much like John Williams did, at least on the prequels.

439
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:57,759
We only used live instruments in the final product, so there's no hybrid elements, just

440
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,260
keep it completely symphonic score.

441
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,883
recording the entire orchestra at once.

442
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,405
So there was no striping, we didn't do sections at a time

443
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,428
because I believe that the sound that John Williams

444
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:12,210
is so capable of getting and the sound that we all know

445
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,632
and love so well about the Star Wars scores

446
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:16,374
is a completely symphonic performance,

447
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:19,036
which I personally believe you can only capture

448
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:22,098
having everybody play at once.

449
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:25,421
I hired John Rod to mix and master the score,

450
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:26,923
which he's somewhere, oh there he is.

451
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:29,044
This is the man.

452
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:43,104
And my reason for doing that is because he's so unbelievably gifted at creating a symphonic sound,

453
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:45,845
and he really understands the orchestra and how to get that sound.

454
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,645
But further to that, he understands me.

455
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:52,486
And we've worked together so many times that we have a shorthand at this point,

456
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,387
so it made my job that much easier.

457
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:03,244
So next I'll play some examples and talk a bit about some of the musical needs for the game.

458
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,647
One of the musical needs was to create...

459
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:08,117
planet suites, so music for each planet,

460
00:36:08,117 --> 00:36:10,558
and in some cases, there'd be a 10-minute-long

461
00:36:10,558 --> 00:36:13,278
piece of music that could then be divided

462
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:15,939
into five sections to fulfill certain needs,

463
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,339
like we needed background music,

464
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,440
we needed an introduction for every planet,

465
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,320
we needed low-level action music,

466
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,101
which we called exploratory,

467
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:26,381
and we needed long stretches of this,

468
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:29,182
because in the original scores with John Williams,

469
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:32,963
because they're written to a finite timeline,

470
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,161
you might only have action music for 20 seconds

471
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,881
before it goes into Princess Leia's theme

472
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:40,822
and then cuts to something else.

473
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:43,082
So we needed for the game's purpose

474
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:49,324
to have longer stretches of action or a specific mood.

475
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:51,685
So here's an example from Hoth.

476
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:55,986
And this also shows you how I was able to transition

477
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,526
from John Williams' music and into my own

478
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:58,427
and then back as well.

479
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:02,883
And for the composers in the room, I actually have the scores up here as well, so you can

480
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:06,245
kind of follow along, and hopefully you'll be able to see it, because it's pretty small.

481
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:06,905
Here we go.

482
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:07,606
So this is John Williams.

483
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:56,419
That's where that music comes in.

484
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,260
you

485
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:45,229
Now we're back into John Williams here.

486
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:58,298
So another music need for the planets in particular was to have background music, but background

487
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:04,463
music that specifically could sort of evoke a feeling of nostalgia, but also emotion and

488
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,684
create mood or drama.

489
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:09,346
And here's an example from the planet Sullust.

490
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:16,918
And this planet for me was probably the most fun to compose because there was no reference to Sullust in any of the films.

491
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:19,523
So John Williams never wrote music specifically for this planet.

492
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,928
So this is all completely original without any source material.

493
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:55,964
Thank you.

494
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,864
So another music need that we had in the game

495
00:40:57,864 --> 00:41:01,685
was because the player is able to play

496
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:04,346
as their favorite heroes in the game.

497
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:07,246
So we needed to have short introductions

498
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:11,287
to introduce these heroes in the game.

499
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:14,628
And in most cases, we used the original themes

500
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:16,608
that John Williams had written for these characters.

501
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,729
And in a couple cases where there was no theme,

502
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:19,509
I'd write something new.

503
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:22,470
But in all cases, even with John Williams' music,

504
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,970
it was.

505
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:29,222
me rearranging or reorchestrating it so that it was, you know, sort of the kitchen sink arrangement.

506
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:34,368
It's, you know, as full-blown as possible and had to fit with these, you know, shorter time

507
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:40,255
constraints so that it was just a quick little fanfare. So here's an example from, I think,

508
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:42,278
one of everyone's favorite characters.

509
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:02,322
And also, equally important to the planet music is,

510
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:05,525
I needed to write music that could function

511
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:08,227
depending on which side you were playing for,

512
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:12,271
whether you're rebel or imperial, light side, dark side.

513
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:16,935
And then also to write various variations on these themes.

514
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,258
So I wrote a new theme for the rebels,

515
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:21,719
and here's an example from that.

516
00:43:55,487 --> 00:44:22,748
And then one last example, and this is the theme that I wrote for the Empire.

517
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:27,365
And since we were using the original Imperial March

518
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,367
to theme Darth Vader, we wanted to come up

519
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,148
with something new that would be specific

520
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:32,248
to Battlefront for Imperial.

521
00:44:32,248 --> 00:44:34,150
So here's an example from that.

522
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,682
Thank you guys. Now we can open the floor up to questions if you have any.

523
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:26,564
Just before the questions, I would like to thank the staff who helped us out fix our technical nightmare we had right before the session.

524
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:31,745
Applause

525
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:36,507
And we should remind you that you can do the electronic evaluation afterwards.

526
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:38,087
But now we open up for questions.

527
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,154
Hi David, just a question for you.

528
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:47,315
I was wondering if you could go through your,

529
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:52,036
like the various layers that you have in your weapon tails.

530
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:53,717
Sounded like you have both like real time,

531
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:56,457
like slap back delay, and some other verb,

532
00:46:56,457 --> 00:47:00,599
and then some pre-recorded tail assets,

533
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,359
like can you go through the different categories

534
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:04,100
of assets that you have?

535
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,540
Yes, so.

536
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:08,345
There's generic reflections, which

537
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:12,766
are similar to what we would do in Battlefield for the weapons.

538
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:15,007
But since lasers are a lot smoother,

539
00:47:15,007 --> 00:47:20,368
I would have edited out all the snappy, clicky parts.

540
00:47:20,368 --> 00:47:22,289
And then that is layered together

541
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:26,430
with a slapback that's derived in engine from the laser layer.

542
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,731
But then on top, there's another stereo asset

543
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,431
with a bunch of variations that's

544
00:47:32,431 --> 00:47:32,951
based on.

545
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:41,682
well, the core, core character of the weapon. So it's kind of like three layers of reflection

546
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:41,922
tail.

547
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:46,405
And how many different sort of environmental spaces did you guys design?

548
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:54,731
We had five different general, generally five different environments that we tag everything

549
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,813
in the game with and each has their own characters.

550
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,214
Cool, thank you.

551
00:47:59,214 --> 00:48:01,635
Good question Jesse, thanks.

552
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,130
Hello, thank you for the talk.

553
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,912
My question is probably as big as the Dolby Atmos subject,

554
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:11,953
but I wanted to know what approach you had

555
00:48:11,953 --> 00:48:14,495
for mixing this kind of game.

556
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:17,536
And it's actually a question both for sound design and music

557
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:18,657
because in sound design,

558
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:24,661
uh you have that huge dynamic range between like standing here and nobody fires at you

559
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:30,044
and there is just the ambience whereas uh sometimes I guess uh there is fires and explosions

560
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:37,529
all over the place. And uh for music uh orchestral music like that also has a huge dynamic range

561
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:43,613
between uh super pianissimo stuff and very uh fortissimo stuff. So I guess it adds even

562
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:46,175
adds complexity to the mix to use music that

563
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:49,838
has already a very large dynamic range in itself.

564
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,460
So I wanted to know where you were approached about that.

565
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,481
Did you use HDR?

566
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:56,443
Anything you can share about that?

567
00:48:56,443 --> 00:48:59,545
Yes, we did use the HDR, as we always do.

568
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:04,829
And for Atmos, we didn't mix specifically differently

569
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:05,790
for Atmos.

570
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,152
Atmos inherently makes sense for games.

571
00:49:10,122 --> 00:49:14,946
projecting sounds in a 3D environment and we already have positional data on all the

572
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:19,689
individual sounds, so it just makes sense. And all we did was wanting to make sure that

573
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:27,195
Atmos sounds the same as in stereo or surround in terms of the overall mix, but Atmos is

574
00:49:27,195 --> 00:49:33,519
the, it is the most dynamic, has the most dynamic range and it gives you the most air

575
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:34,620
in the mix basically.

576
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:39,868
Yeah, I don't know how much you want to say about music dynamics.

577
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:47,991
Yeah, I mean, what I can say is the deliverables, what I delivered for in-game,

578
00:49:47,991 --> 00:49:54,874
was volume mastered so that, and literally just using volume curves to sort of even it out a bit,

579
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:59,295
but not compress it in any way that would be noticeable or create any artifacts,

580
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,238
so that at least they had a sort of a flat basis to work from so that it wouldn't compete

581
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:05,578
and you could...

582
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:09,383
essentially set the level and it would play where it should play.

583
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:13,065
And then it was still stereo assets that we delivered but it

584
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:14,045
was then folded out.

585
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:17,667
So in the end, the final dynamic range after

586
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:21,809
automation and stuff like that of the music was about

587
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:22,649
how much?

588
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,900
you know, like minus 10 I believe, somewhere in that range.

589
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,121
Yeah, I don't remember exactly, but we would also do stuff like in a multiplayer match

590
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:40,863
when a piece of music comes in, like a tension stinger, we would lower certain parts of the

591
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:45,145
mix to make it come in smoothly, and then over time we would...

592
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:50,501
release that type of lowering so you can get more game sounds again. But first give the

593
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:54,983
music some space and then over time bring back the mix.

594
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:57,784
Thank you very much.

595
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:58,104
Thank you.

596
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:06,487
Hi. My questions are in regards to, I assume that there is a bit of an approval process

597
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:10,348
through Lucas, so I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what that was like.

598
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:15,616
and how accessible their assets were to you and that kind of thing? I'm just curious.

599
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:23,602
Oh, the approval process. Well, since we started off with the original sound effects, we got

600
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:30,087
that going for us, but I mean, we had to make lots and lots of new content and the approval

601
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:36,632
was mostly done for the whole game. It wasn't specifically done for sound. So there were

602
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:40,955
certain deliverables, certain dates where we would deliver parts of the game.

603
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:47,063
and then we would get feedback on that. And actually on sound they were pretty easy on us,

604
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:53,584
like they, either they liked it or, well, yeah. I hope they liked it. I don't want to say

605
00:51:53,584 --> 00:51:59,346
anything else. Yeah, okay, um, yeah, they were pretty easy on us, Lucasfilm, and there were

606
00:51:59,346 --> 00:52:05,847
just a few notes here and there, but I guess overall they liked what we did.

607
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:08,072
Thanks.

608
00:52:08,072 --> 00:52:10,914
And for the music, approval process

609
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:12,314
was kind of interesting too.

610
00:52:12,314 --> 00:52:16,597
Because it first, of course, had to be approved from a mockup

611
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:21,960
standpoint, just a synthesized version, by Dice and EA.

612
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,444
But then further, it went to Lucasfilm for approvals,

613
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:32,827
and then Disney, and then finally to John Williams,

614
00:52:32,827 --> 00:52:34,288
who was the final say on everything music.

615
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:36,249
Yeah, well, with a franchise like this,

616
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:37,410
nothing is really easy.

617
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:44,008
you have very high up layers to approve the end result.

618
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,160
Hi, guys.

619
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,540
I'm Guido, game composer.

620
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,300
Great talk.

621
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,401
Following the question about feedback,

622
00:52:55,401 --> 00:53:01,183
I really want to focus on the composer, Gordon.

623
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:06,144
Well, I have a question that maybe it's super simple.

624
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:08,745
What did John Williams think about all this?

625
00:53:08,745 --> 00:53:14,326
And was any collaborative thing between both of you?

626
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:14,466
Yeah, so.

627
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:24,885
John Williams, it made me very nervous knowing of course that this was the final approval process.

628
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:31,548
And also because I needed to be finished with the music six weeks in advance of any recording session

629
00:53:31,548 --> 00:53:34,490
because I needed to allow time for each level of this approval.

630
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:38,832
So there was also this thing in the back of my mind of what if he hates it

631
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:44,276
and I have to rewrite this thing a week before the recording session and that would be torturous.

632
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:50,815
proud and happy to say that I didn't receive any notes. It was all just approved, which

633
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:51,235
was pretty cool.

634
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:51,995
Thanks so much.

635
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:52,156
Sure.

636
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:55,557
Hi, my question is directed towards Gordy. I just wanted to say, wow, congratulations.

637
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:58,318
The music is amazing. I think a lot of people would agree with me. You totally nailed it.

638
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:58,818
Thank you.

639
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,078
Thank you.

640
00:53:59,078 --> 00:53:59,338
Thank you.

641
00:53:59,338 --> 00:53:59,979
Thank you.

642
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:01,079
Thank you.

643
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:01,739
Thank you.

644
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,080
Thank you.

645
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,400
Thank you.

646
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,780
Thank you.

647
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,160
Thank you.

648
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,780
Thank you.

649
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,100
Thank you.

650
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,500
Thank you.

651
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,821
Thank you.

652
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:05,161
Thank you.

653
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:05,761
Thank you.

654
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:06,161
Thank you.

655
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:08,522
Thank you.

656
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:19,340
And since so much of your speech was about the influence that you had drawn from John

657
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,481
Williams' music, I was hoping that you might be able to speak about the influence that

658
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:28,922
John Williams drew, because, you know, the obvious are, you know, Gustav Holst and Stravinsky,

659
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:29,823
so.

660
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:34,144
Yeah, and actually I had a whole section about that in my presentation that I ultimately

661
00:54:34,144 --> 00:54:34,984
pulled just for time.

662
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:42,788
That was another step in my process of sort of building my color palette, as I like to call it,

663
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:46,430
of not forgetting that the source may have a source as well.

664
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:52,013
And in John Williams' case, I mean, he's certainly, you know, he's, I think he, like myself,

665
00:54:52,013 --> 00:54:55,396
and probably every composer in the room, and if it hasn't happened yet,

666
00:54:55,396 --> 00:55:01,799
it certainly will have been put in the position of writing music that is based in something else.

667
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,921
And I mean, with film, there's always a temp score.

668
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:04,161
And...

669
00:55:04,464 --> 00:55:08,207
you know, John Williams, you can hear the temp score in a lot of cases.

670
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:15,555
I mean, this Rite of Spring, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring is certainly a temp that was used on Tatooine and in The New Hope.

671
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:19,720
And the Gustav Holst Planets movement is, you know.

672
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:21,435
pretty obvious temp as well.

673
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:23,717
And then also even like some of his colleagues,

674
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:27,780
I think Jerry Goldsmith's score for Planet of the Apes

675
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,421
was temp score as well.

676
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,802
And you can hear those influences.

677
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:34,405
So I also, in addition to sort of studying

678
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:37,207
John Williams' scores and then listening to a lot of it,

679
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,809
listened and studied those scores as well

680
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:41,110
to kind of internalize that as well.

681
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,871
Cool, thank you very much.

682
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:43,072
Sure.

683
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:46,961
Hey guys, great talk.

684
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:47,881
My name's Crispin.

685
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:49,322
My question is for David.

686
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:52,743
You had all these amazing layers in your weapons.

687
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:54,403
And I've played the game, and it's phenomenal.

688
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:57,084
And you get lots of weapons on the field at the same time,

689
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:59,685
lots of vehicle sounds, lots of sounds.

690
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:02,565
And I'm just wondering, what kind of voice counts

691
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:03,485
were you guys getting?

692
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,566
And how are you managing that?

693
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:10,387
Well, we use the HDR for one, helps us out

694
00:56:10,387 --> 00:56:11,668
with culling sounds.

695
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:11,708
So.

696
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:15,831
what it does inherently is focus on the loudest sounds,

697
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:20,113
and other sounds will not play that are already inaudible.

698
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:24,695
So that it helps us focus on just a few sounds at a time.

699
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,717
But we still use a lot of scoping,

700
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,939
where we have groups like explosions have only eight

701
00:56:30,939 --> 00:56:32,540
at the same time.

702
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:37,042
And that means even if there's still the reflection tail

703
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:39,984
fading out, that still part counts as a sound.

704
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:46,401
We have these groups for all kinds of sounds where we try to keep it as minimal as possible

705
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:53,262
without being obvious that we remove sounds. And I can't really give you a voice count

706
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:58,684
number. It was a while ago when we did those optimizations, but it's a lot.

707
00:56:58,684 --> 00:56:59,464
Thank you.

708
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:02,025
This is a question for Gordy.

709
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:07,781
Hey man.

710
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:11,023
Gordy, as you know, I've always been a huge fan, especially

711
00:57:11,023 --> 00:57:13,384
of this kind of writing that you do, ever since USC.

712
00:57:13,384 --> 00:57:18,367
My question, the reason I'm asking in front of everybody,

713
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:21,049
is when I do score study, like when

714
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:23,270
I have to fake a composer like a Zimmer,

715
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,332
I have my sheet of his usual favorite chord progressions.

716
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:29,373
And he has just a few.

717
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:31,695
And then I notice a lot of times he just kind of starts

718
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:33,736
in the middle, and it's the same progression.

719
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:33,876
Right.

720
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:36,383
I was kind of curious to see, and especially trailers are

721
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:38,264
ridiculously bad like that, as far as that goes.

722
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:41,625
Did you notice a lot of repetition in the Williams

723
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,706
stuff, or was it?

724
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:47,268
No, there's very little repetition in his harmonic

725
00:57:47,268 --> 00:57:52,711
language, and the way he modulates almost, in some

726
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:57,134
cases, just very randomly, what I've always called sort

727
00:57:57,134 --> 00:58:00,635
of a plop modulation, where you're in this key, and then

728
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:02,777
suddenly, boom, you just plop into a new key.

729
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:04,547
That's something pretty common.

730
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,608
Same with meters.

731
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:08,809
And I mean, he's switching up meters constantly.

732
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:12,751
I mean, the only patterns I recognize, and I didn't recognize patterns in the sense

733
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:17,914
of like common chord progressions, but I noticed patterns and types of harmony that he used.

734
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:17,974
So.

735
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:25,576
you know, like I was speaking about using the parallel triads or, you know, either major or minor triads moving parallel over a

736
00:58:25,576 --> 00:58:28,617
pedal bass note, that kind of approach. Or

737
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:35,258
you know, in the case of the music they wrote for A New Hope, Tatooine, there was this, the use of

738
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:37,279
superimposed augmented chords

739
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:43,700
and, you know, I could find patterns in how he would transition from one augmented chord to the next, but there was no

740
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,181
necessarily rhyme or reason

741
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:49,745
for the longer scope of chord progressions.

742
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:53,908
So I think he, my opinion is he thinks very much

743
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:56,390
from a linear melodic standpoint first

744
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,632
and then kind of fills in underneath.

745
00:58:58,632 --> 00:58:59,793
If I was to get in his brain,

746
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:02,836
that's how I believe he writes a lot of his music

747
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:04,678
is sort of from line first

748
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:07,560
and then that dictates where harmony goes.

749
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,982
Kind of like Stravinsky counterpoint

750
00:59:08,982 --> 00:59:10,123
where they have the pentel.

751
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:15,891
Yeah, exactly. So cool. Anyways, awesome job. Hey, thanks man. Thanks Andrew.

752
00:59:15,891 --> 00:59:18,592
Hi, my question is for David. Could you please discuss how you went about

753
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:25,913
worldizing sounds particularly with a lot of synthetic content?

754
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:28,194
Well, we would meld real world sounds, usually

755
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:43,417
I mean, for weapons, for example, we start off with real weapons like M16 or whatever,

756
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:50,043
and then modulate that until it kind of melds well with the laser content, and then to create

757
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:59,971
a good distancing effect, we would use a variety of just tweaking the sound in like a DAW,

758
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,653
like Pro Tools, until it...

759
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:07,391
just sounds right for that distance. I mean there's no real world reference. It's kinda

760
01:00:07,391 --> 01:00:12,975
like a gut feeling type of thing. And just using reverbs and filters and so on until it

761
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:18,559
works. And yeah, basically those two things combined.

762
01:00:21,957 --> 01:00:26,943
Hi, so I'm curious, I know you guys said that you recorded the symphony all together,

763
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:31,988
you didn't break it up into stems, so I'm curious if you had trouble if you went between

764
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:36,333
like interactive music states, you know, from general ambience into combat and

765
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:44,929
Right. Yeah, I mean the way we sort of treated it was almost as though we were just pulling music from original soundtracks.

766
01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:53,513
So it was not necessarily interactive states for one particular cue, but there were just multiple cues that could function as different interactive states.

767
01:00:54,113 --> 01:01:04,147
For the planet Hoth, for example, I didn't just write one long action loop and then build it in layers so that you could have it interactive in that sense,

768
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:09,854
but I wrote five action cues. One that was just the most intense that it could possibly be.

769
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:15,856
and then everything down to just a very base level exploratory cue as we called it.

770
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:21,800
And then we also had small bumpers or transitions so that we could pull down from one level

771
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,541
and then fade into a different cue.

772
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:28,085
And because John Williams music, like I was saying before,

773
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:32,748
this style of music, and it's not even just John Williams music, but this sort of...

774
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:38,135
old school symphonic approach, harmonically is moving all over the place all the time

775
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:44,519
and rhythmically modulating and tempos changing. So it actually made it in some ways easier

776
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,322
because almost anything goes. I mean, you really don't notice just jumping from one

777
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:54,805
cue to the next because John might have done that very thing in the film and it's, you

778
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:59,747
know, it's sort of established what that sound is. So it was a little easier than doing just

779
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:01,608
a typical, you know, like a looping.

780
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:05,886
you know, 4-4 kind of thing that you would certainly notice if suddenly you just jumped

781
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:10,252
into a new key and the tempo is faster, it would call attention to itself.

782
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:12,395
But that's not as much the case with this kind of music.

783
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:17,854
Thanks a lot for the talk guys, very good.

784
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:19,315
My question was on the score.

785
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:21,616
Obviously with the orchestration,

786
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:24,217
very dense orchestration, lots of detail.

787
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:26,538
How many minutes of music did you end up writing

788
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,718
and what kind of time frame did you have to complete it?

789
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:32,020
Because obviously it was very complicated orchestrations

790
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,580
you were doing.

791
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,361
Yeah, I mean I think I ended up writing

792
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:37,482
somewhere in the ballpark of 90 minutes of music.

793
01:02:37,482 --> 01:02:39,202
We recorded a little more than that

794
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:41,603
because we recorded a few variations of things.

795
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:45,045
And all said and done, I mean I worked on the game for,

796
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:54,313
quite a while, maybe a year and a half, but I was only writing on it for about a cumulative

797
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,473
five months maybe.

798
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:56,594
Thank you.

799
01:02:56,594 --> 01:03:03,597
Well it looks like that was all and good questions and thanks for listening.
