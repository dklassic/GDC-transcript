00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:09,300
Hi, everyone. Welcome to live chat with the creators of BugSnacks.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,282
One of my favorite games that I've gotten a hold of recently.

3
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,242
So I'm super excited to be able to do this.

4
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:20,064
And we get to do Q&A from the audience later in the session.

5
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:23,746
I'm really excited about that as well.

6
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:24,866
Hi, my name is Adam Salzman.

7
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,948
I'm the co-founder and director here at Fingy.

8
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,569
I'm in our offices, which I'm the only one here

9
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:34,130
because we're all still in the middle of that thing.

10
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,791
We're a developer and publisher.

11
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:37,972
We've worked on games like Overland,

12
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:39,032
Night in the Woods, and Chicory.

13
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:40,593
And I've been on the GDC advisory board

14
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:42,734
for about 10 years or something now.

15
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:45,115
So I'm just pumped to be here and talk to these gentlemen.

16
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,076
The first of which is Kevin Zoon from Young Horses.

17
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,178
Hi, I'm Kevin Zoon.

18
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,378
Thanks for having me here.

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,480
As said, I'm the creative director at Young Horses

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,441
on Octodad Deadliest Catch and Bugsnax.

21
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,914
My primary responsibilities day to day include level design,

22
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:09,577
quest design and writing, and on rare lucky occasions, some small art.

23
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:16,501
I work pretty closely with my colleague, John, who will introduce himself now.

24
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:21,305
Hi, I'm John Murphy.

25
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:26,988
I am one of the co-founders and the studio head at Young Horses.

26
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:31,109
We're an independent studio based in Chicago.

27
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:38,653
And I'm here because for Bugsnax, I did a lot of the sort of like systems

28
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:44,275
and gameplay design, designing Bugsnax and the tools and traps

29
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:48,417
he used to capture them and feed them to your friends.

30
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:53,335
And this is great because this is,

31
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:55,817
I think what I wanted to talk about most for this game

32
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,999
is how the gameplay and the story are connected.

33
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,039
Because I think that's one of the things

34
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,921
that a lot of developers struggle with,

35
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,582
either coming from a story background,

36
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:05,903
how do we do gameplay stuff,

37
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,444
if we're coming from a gameplay background?

38
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:10,085
Oh no, how do we get a story in here?

39
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,626
And in Bugsnax, these things are married

40
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:14,528
in a way that's really beautiful and often disturbing.

41
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:14,988
So,

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,854
Also, yeah, another reminder, there's a questions tab down there in the Swapcard app in the chat section.

43
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:27,657
You can ask questions and chat moderators can help get those things queued up and we're going to save

44
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:32,241
time at the end of this to answer those questions, which I'm looking forward to very much.

45
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:38,085
So, but I wanted to start with a question kind of about the early days and about the earliest stages

46
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:41,267
of this project, which is a project that you guys have been working on for a very

47
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,152
pretty long time in game-making terms.

48
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,813
So Bugsnax in many ways, I think is a game

49
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,194
about people who are trying to solve

50
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:52,474
uncomfortable internal problems

51
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:55,055
with comfortable external solutions.

52
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,316
And it started out like most games,

53
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,376
which is a clone of Pokemon Snap,

54
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,737
but you can eat all the Pokemon.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:13,322
So I was curious if you could share some of the early turning, like early turning points for the system design, and also some of the early kind of hooks for how story might be connected to those things.

56
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,983
And whoever wants to start is totally fine with me.

57
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:31,226
Zoom, why don't you start, you have, you've been looking back through the archives you have a little bit of a better memory of the progression of these various early prototypes.

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,284
That's true. I made it my mission early on to just keep a record of every like kind of major

59
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:42,927
phase of the project and I have builds on my computer of like old versions of Bugsnax.

60
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:51,452
And you're right Adam that the very beginning it was a Pokemon Snap like it was on rails.

61
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:58,036
You threw your traps out into the world to catch Bugsnax while being in no control of yourself.

62
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,898
And you would bring them back to the town.

63
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,365
which would be later named Snacksburg, in order to feed them to these grumpuses.

64
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:14,151
And John, you can speak more on the actual systems at play when that happened, but

65
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:19,575
even like from the earliest pitches of the game, we knew bug snacks were

66
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,598
parasites and that they were very bad for you and that you should not eat them.

67
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:37,239
And if I were going to summarize kind of a lot of the development of the narrative and systems behind the game, it would be knowing that bug snacks are bad for you and everyone wants them is kind of the driving force of all the themes in the game.

68
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:53,242
Yeah, so, and we needed to figure out like, kind of like what happened after you, you fed grumpuses like early prototypes.

69
00:04:54,375 --> 00:05:00,857
We're kind of like you're in this food truck, you go back to this town, you feed bug snacks,

70
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,777
and then why what happens?

71
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:13,359
So one early prototype that didn't really answer the why, but was was fun was just you

72
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:20,661
feed a grumpus a bug snack, and their nose turns into a pickle or something.

73
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:21,941
It's like, okay, that's...

74
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:26,280
there's something fundamentally nice about that,

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,663
but we had not yet like tied that to any narrative stuff.

76
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,945
And then separate from that,

77
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:38,509
there was an early prototype where this town,

78
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,771
you're trying to get the town to sort of like,

79
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,672
the townsfolk to work together

80
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,474
and to sort of build up the town.

81
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:52,298
And so I'm kind of obsessed with both like,

82
00:05:52,945 --> 00:06:03,415
personality and human interactions, and also with building simulations.

83
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:10,962
So we tried to do an early idea of, okay, the different bug snacks will change different aspects

84
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:16,287
of the grumps' personalities, and different personalities will get

85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,436
get along differently. So it's like, oh, we're going to feed this this person a bunch of

86
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:29,522
bananas and this person a bunch of pickles, and then they will collaborate better to be able to,

87
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,125
I don't know, build the town hall.

88
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:37,071
John, I would love to chime in on the specifics of the personality system.

89
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,892
Oh, yes, please.

90
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:42,335
Yeah. Just to note that, like, at the time, we had decided that it would be best if

91
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,878
the personality traits had no bearing on the real world.

92
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:49,620
And so the personalities the grumpuses had that interacted were things like

93
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:55,965
gormless, flatulent, ticklish, just like nonsense.

94
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,388
And it's like, hey, ticklish people get along really well with gormless people.

95
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,428
That's how it works.

96
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:06,287
That sounds super fun to try to surface through UI in order to like engage the player.

97
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:09,134
That must have been a super smooth and, uh,

98
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:16,996
Oh yeah, everything was super transparent and everyone understood everything that was

99
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,939
happening in this rough prototype.

100
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,783
For anybody who's following along with the subtitles or other languages, we're being

101
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,885
profoundly sarcastic right now.

102
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,848
This is a nightmare scenario for a game developer.

103
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,412
One of those early prototypes we were talking about had a...

104
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:41,530
an indicator where if you clicked on an individual Grumpus node,

105
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,770
because they were just sort of running around as little circles,

106
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,291
it would show you their connection to every other Grumpus in town

107
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:49,311
and whether they disliked or liked them.

108
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,192
So it just opened a spider web of relationships

109
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,113
that was impossible to read.

110
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:58,174
Yeah, great, great, awesome.

111
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,235
So it sounds like, I think it's funny that you guys landed

112
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,215
on the idea of like...

113
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:11,093
the, they have snacks, they get physically transformed because I think even though the

114
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:18,239
personalities and simulations components didn't move forward for possibly in retrospect obvious

115
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,804
reasons, kind of the idea, I think it's funny that like coming from an initial idea of these

116
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:30,970
things are bad, it was the funny but kind of horrifying idea of physical transformation

117
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,030
that really stuck.

118
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,466
But then you had to compensate, I guess you had to find

119
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,087
other things to go.

120
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:39,827
And actually my original follow-up question

121
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,208
was pretty specifically like,

122
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,568
I think it's interesting that in a lot of ways,

123
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:47,889
the transformation of the bug snacks ended up being

124
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,429
something that was used narratively a lot

125
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,910
and actually isn't used in terms of giving people stats.

126
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,231
And I feel like that's the normal place

127
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,051
you would go with the design.

128
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,171
And it sounds like that is also where you started like,

129
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,931
oh, strawberries give you plus four.

130
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:03,406
gormless or something.

131
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,947
And so that's how their gameplay meaningful,

132
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,088
but in fact, it's actually,

133
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:11,170
it's really meaningful that they have a pickle for a nose.

134
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:17,894
Yeah, that is an interesting point that we had started

135
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:20,256
with a much more systematized understanding

136
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,018
of Bugsnax effect on the characters.

137
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:26,340
And one of the reasons that we moved away from it

138
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,242
in addition to it being kind of a snarl of UI

139
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,122
was also that...

140
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,951
like it felt very distant and manipulative to work on the

141
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:42,372
characters in such a statistical way. And in answering the

142
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,813
question, why you care about this, like, why do you care

143
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,875
about these creatures and what's happening to their town? It

144
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:53,176
gets harder to answer that question in a meaningful way

145
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:57,898
when you see them as objects that can be just sort of changed

146
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,978
to your liking. And so

147
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,334
almost on accident, because almost everything we do is on

148
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:11,120
accident, we find that it's more meaningful in this case, for a

149
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:17,667
narrative reason, to accept that the Bugsnax are not useful in a

150
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:21,210
mechanical way, if that makes sense, but that they have

151
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,573
meaning to them, in terms of their desires and their

152
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,354
personalities.

153
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,021
And especially as it evolves in the story that bug snacks are

154
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:34,263
not great for you. The fact that they're also useless to you is

155
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:35,063
important.

156
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:40,185
Right, right. And how early would you say that was so you've

157
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:44,487
got you've gotten from, okay, like, are you still in a food

158
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,569
truck? Are you still kind of Pokemon snapping around

159
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,169
collecting things at this point?

160
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,132
If you're talking about that version, with the like town

161
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:55,712
manipulation?

162
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,849
Yeah, or figuring out like, so there's a point where you

163
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:05,251
figured out like, oh, the player is a, this godlike scientist

164
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:08,473
who is single handedly transforming all the people in

165
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,934
the town in a cold and manipulative way. And actually,

166
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:14,296
we're not into that. I'm curious where systems are at at that

167
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,056
point, too.

168
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:24,461
So it, our idea back at the time, was that it was kind of a

169
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,321
There was a core loop where you would go out in your food truck to catch the bug

170
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:34,042
snacks in the Pokemon snap first person rails game,

171
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:37,464
and you would bring them back to the town to do your feeding

172
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,165
and your attempt to get them to cooperate.

173
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:44,306
We had also and John, feel free to chime in on this,

174
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:47,847
had a separate side system where you would peel bug snacks apart

175
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:49,608
in order to make them more edible

176
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:54,230
as like a physics toy that was deeply horrifying.

177
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:07,613
Yeah, so in addition to deciding that having the systemic manipulation be directed at the grumpuses

178
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:14,435
and how that made it harder to see them as characters that you care about, even though

179
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:21,397
we're capturing and feeding, even though the bug snacks are parasites and you're feeding them

180
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,417
to these grumpuses, the

181
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:32,037
the ripping them apart was also too far.

182
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:42,282
Yes, it definitely came off as sadistic and upsetting to do, even if that's like how

183
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:47,905
making food exists in this world. It didn't come off right.

184
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,387
Yeah, it seems like a kind of a fine line or a balancing act almost.

185
00:12:54,437 --> 00:13:00,463
I feel like if you want to, like, I think I guess this is a

186
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:03,045
tricky thing that I'm going to be poking at throughout this. But

187
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:07,729
I think it's a it's a game about things that are kind of

188
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,892
uncomfortable, but you do want people to sit and play it and

189
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:13,635
have fun. So like, how do you walk that?

190
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:19,353
tightrope, I think is a tricky question. I mean, all the time

191
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:23,115
and especially here. So yeah, like devouring bug snacks,

192
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:25,977
having your body transformed in horrible and surprising ways.

193
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:31,500
Great. But peeling apart the bug snacks. Oh, that's, that's over

194
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,882
the line. I think that's an interesting balance. Feedback.

195
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:40,384
Was that just internal guidance? Was that I'm curious, like, how

196
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,886
you guys navigated some of that balance?

197
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,233
It was definitely internal at that point.

198
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:52,655
Because to answer like the when of this, like we spent about a good year,

199
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:56,678
the first year of the project building this particular version of Bugsnax.

200
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,561
And it was about at that year mark that we kind of took stock of what it was

201
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,702
and what we were dissatisfied with

202
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,025
and like started making major changes.

203
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:11,107
Like I don't think we had necessarily shown it to very many people

204
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,128
outside of ourselves at that point.

205
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,746
Not until it had become a lot more like the game it is today.

206
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,508
But like, for sure,

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,832
like finding that line was a part of that development process.

208
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:33,294
And, you know, at the time discovered that swallowing them whole, fine.

209
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,516
No one has a problem with this.

210
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:36,956
Right, right.

211
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:43,283
But there was a very interesting result from doing that also is

212
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:48,726
that we had not allowed the bug snacks to be cute. At the time,

213
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:52,347
particularly, they were actually very scary and upsetting

214
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:55,889
looking as well, because they were much more bug like back

215
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:03,253
then. And in part, that was like a reaction to the fact that

216
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,833
they were prepared like food.

217
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,740
that the cuter they are, the worse that system becomes to

218
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,980
interact with.

219
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:16,122
Right, you've got pressure there automatically kind of from I

220
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,463
assume, like from a player, but also as someone who would have

221
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:21,204
to sit and work on the game for a long time. It's like, oh,

222
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,365
you're where this is where you do the horrible thing to the

223
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:26,346
horrible creatures. We definitely can't make these

224
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:32,788
creatures that cute. But I guess like, so now, if you don't have

225
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:35,650
to peel them apart piece by piece, and like,

226
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:42,511
uh masticate them in detail um now that's kind of maybe that's opened some doors design-wise for

227
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:48,933
like oh we can actually we can do some other stuff with these creatures now yeah and and because you

228
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:58,315
know one of our goals is to make games that are you know both accessible and like charming having

229
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:03,496
a a banana with like realistic looking grasshopper legs that you're pulling off is

230
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:12,688
is uh it's not that that's fair um but john it was i think it was you who

231
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:17,912
insisted that they all have googly eyes oh yeah that was that was definitely uh

232
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:26,540
uh yeah that that was a thing that i uh felt strongly about that it was it was a

233
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,725
there was a bit of a fight uh it was a bit of a fight but it's retroactively a great choice

234
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:35,886
I of course agree.

235
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:43,131
The finding the little dish out in one of the in the little

236
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:48,095
laboratory on the beach that's just full of extra eyes really

237
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:51,257
ended up being for all the all the upsetting things that were

238
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:55,320
removed from this game. That one in I found very, very

239
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,964
upsetting. So I was curious to I think one of the things that

240
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:05,041
One of the things that ends up being, or was very memorable for me at least, about the

241
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,802
game is the...

242
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:15,513
I guess it was this quest system of going out and finding all the people and bringing them together to make a village.

243
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,935
It's not a preexisting place that you're just tweaking.

244
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:20,557
And so you're a year into the game.

245
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,820
There's been kind of a set plan about let's get it to a certain point

246
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,002
and then we'll maybe we'll evaluate, we'll see how's this

247
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:33,346
extremely realistic, horrifying insect food peeling game

248
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,807
where you manipulate the village.

249
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:36,849
Let's check in and see how that's going.

250
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,270
And then there's kind of like, okay,

251
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,490
parts of this are really cool.

252
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,431
Parts of this aren't working quite like we hoped.

253
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,672
Is that a point where you start thinking more

254
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:51,533
about who specifically is in the village?

255
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,034
Is that a point where you start thinking about,

256
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,695
okay, are we pulling the player off of rails

257
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:58,875
or does that come later still?

258
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,283
That all, yeah, that was around that time when we when we found

259
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:09,566
that the way it was wasn't really working. We made just a

260
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:13,549
series of very drastic changes to all the designs. One of the

261
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:16,391
biggest things that we tried to accomplish back then was that

262
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,793
the there was a deep separation between the part where you're in

263
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:24,276
town and the part where you're out hunting bug snacks. And we

264
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,357
wanted those to be more connected.

265
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,263
And so that kind of brought about like, um, also that we didn't like that the

266
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:34,023
game was on rails.

267
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:36,645
So the feedback was like, all right, so take it off the rails.

268
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,666
Let us wander these environments freely.

269
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:43,910
Uh, same premise, drawing traps out in order to catch the bugs next.

270
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,594
But, uh, that was actually surprisingly easy to do, uh, that change.

271
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:56,218
Well, yeah, I mean that, that opened up a lot of possibilities because it turns

272
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,279
out if you're trying to like.

273
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:07,030
lay down traps or do like elaborate uh interacting contraptions while you're moving away from them

274
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:15,272
it doesn't that doesn't really work right like like pokemon snap works because you're kind of

275
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:24,996
just doing one thing you're pointing and clicking uh so yeah that allowed us to and and we slowly

276
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:25,196
like

277
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:37,075
developed this goal of having the pacing of the game be like relatively slow and

278
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:40,798
I don't know how successful we were at this but there was always a push to have it be

279
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:49,444
observational and planning oriented rather than sort of like reactive and action-y.

280
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,975
Yeah, I feel like it did land in a place where there's there's

281
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:58,639
kind of a kind of hunter gatherer kind of like, stop and

282
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,402
wait for this thing to happen kind of vibe to it as opposed to

283
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:06,746
like, here's arcade shooter moments. But I guess I'm curious

284
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:10,469
where that impulse came from. Because I think for for game

285
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,911
designer that that feels like another risk to take on is like,

286
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,173
Oh, what if in parts of the game, you don't do anything?

287
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,854
So I, like, did that come from,

288
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:20,295
and obviously it's worked very well.

289
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,315
So I'm curious, did that come from a,

290
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:27,557
like, was that just an innate desire

291
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,097
for kind of an interactive experience type of thing?

292
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:31,978
Or was that sort of like a story thing?

293
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,418
Like, you know, you're,

294
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:36,939
we want people to be in a mindset

295
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,580
where they're stopping and looking around them

296
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,180
and that's useful for X, Y, and Z.

297
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:49,830
I think that one was definitely something I pushed for as far as like a more contemplative pace.

298
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:58,857
Because I like I at the time was pushing us in the direction toward mystery.

299
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:08,844
As far as like exploration and mystery as far as your kind of tone and expectation going into the game.

300
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:18,303
And I thought that contrary to the on the rails game, which was very twitchy and reactive,

301
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:24,827
that if you're allowed to explore freely, it would be good to be more deliberate about

302
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:25,447
the things you do.

303
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:30,851
I, one of the, I remember now one of my biggest desires back then, and I had the same desire

304
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:35,113
with the characters too, was I wanted individual bug snacks to matter to you.

305
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:42,125
um that I didn't want it to be that you were just scooping them up in big handfuls and like

306
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:50,350
didn't notice or care what was going in your bag like you were uh net fishing right um I wanted

307
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,654
you to like have to look at and care about bug snacks because we're gonna put a lot of effort

308
00:21:55,694 --> 00:22:02,518
into these damn things so you better appreciate their designs. Yeah and there was always kind of

309
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:04,760
a uh I was

310
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:11,069
always like not intentionally pushing but I was always like kind of pushing against that as I was

311
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:16,171
designing and building the various like contraptions like there was an early

312
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:21,314
version where you you like kind of attached the different tools and traps to each other

313
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:29,498
so I was like oh you got your your strabby and it's in its hamster ball that you can control

314
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,138
and then you take like a cannon

315
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:37,146
that shoots nets and you attach it to the top and you've got this like wobbly net cannon

316
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:43,810
ball that you're rolling around and like shooting it at at bug snacks and it's like oh this is fun

317
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,834
but it it quickly makes all of the bug snacks kind of be the same and there's some of those

318
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,795
tools and traps end up being

319
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:11,680
sort of pacing. Another thing that was beneficial I think of going this route is that we're

320
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,723
coming from making Octodad which because of the sort of like weird controls it was kind

321
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:25,005
of a level playing field for people who like aren't familiar with just like standard gamer

322
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:29,407
controls. So the fact that we were coming from that to making more of like a

323
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:38,735
a real video game that like a first person has somewhat standard video game controls having it be

324
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:45,957
yeah more slower more forgiving in terms of timing and things like that hopefully

325
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,500
made it more accessible to to people who would otherwise be intimidated by the that sort of

326
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,840
that sort of game.

327
00:23:56,177 --> 00:24:09,271
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me trying to keep the keep the floor low for, you know, people who want a mystery story experience, and there's this other activity that you can do, maybe that doesn't have to be exclusionary based on like how good you are at.

328
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:14,148
Bayonetta or something like that. That makes a ton of sense

329
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:16,750
to me. I really I think it's it's really marvelous that

330
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,555
there's this. I guess like, I'm curious. I've got a bunch more

331
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,756
stuff I want to ask about, but there's something in here about

332
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:28,679
taking like deliberate steps to have

333
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,023
this kind of marriage between the tone of the gameplay and the tone of the story where

334
00:24:36,863 --> 00:24:42,506
you wanted there's like an increasing interest in telling a story that has a mystery at its heart

335
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:50,690
and having gameplay that also is a little bit more contemplative and observational.

336
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,152
and trying to deliberately have those things fit together.

337
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:57,233
And I'm curious if that was something

338
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:58,814
that kind of came about step-by-step,

339
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,274
or if that was sort of like a,

340
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:03,936
no, it's mystery story, mystery gameplay.

341
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,337
I don't want to be in a article

342
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:08,919
about ludonarrative dissonance or something.

343
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,280
Or is this, or was this really just an intuitive,

344
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,242
like, it's a game about looking for clues and, you know,

345
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:18,363
you're foraging, why not look for clues there too?

346
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:29,945
Great question, because like the gameplay story connection is hard to get right sometimes,

347
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:37,589
but I think similar to my feelings about the contemplation of the gameplay,

348
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:43,273
like my desire for the characters was I also wanted them to be small and specific.

349
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,282
where I wanted you to care deeply about individual characters.

350
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:50,063
And that was a problem I had with the more zoomed out,

351
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,345
like town management version of the game.

352
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:59,348
But and so in that sense, like kind of as I continue to ask the question,

353
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:00,649
why do you care about this?

354
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,531
Like. Kind of.

355
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:09,693
Answering it by getting deeper and deeper into the situation at hand.

356
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:17,548
But so to answer about where story and gameplay meet,

357
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:22,549
I think that a lot of my process is to write about the game

358
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,310
that you're playing.

359
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:32,412
And so like, because I think that so much of the way

360
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:35,373
the quests are designed, the way the narrative is designed

361
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,194
are ways to encourage you to go explore the island

362
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:39,755
and

363
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:44,841
to get you to look around the world by doing specific things and to go meet new characters.

364
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:51,487
And so typically, the moment to moment of the game, I am just kind of responding to what the

365
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:59,774
player wants to be doing at the time. And like, letting things unfold based on what you've just

366
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:03,237
done recently, if that makes sense.

367
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:07,882
Yeah, is that where you is that where you start to get this idea of like,

368
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:13,827
everybody who lives in the village has kind of like, been in a big tantrum, and

369
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:16,629
they've gone and locked themselves in their rooms, and you're trying to get

370
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:22,714
everybody to come down and have dinner. I, the player now suddenly is less than

371
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:28,519
like a mad scientist role and a little bit more in like, sort of a therapist

372
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:32,062
role or something. Is that when that started to come in?

373
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:36,672
It actually took a little bit longer for that.

374
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:41,035
Uh, like I think it was a couple of years later, John, let me know if that's right.

375
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:44,737
That, um, we didn't figure out until then that the player was a journalist.

376
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:49,340
Like for a long time, there was an open-ended question as to who you were

377
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,740
and why you were doing any of this.

378
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:55,443
No, I think, yeah, I think that's right.

379
00:27:55,523 --> 00:28:00,886
But the, the, the idea of, I think as soon as you have, like, here's this like

380
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,768
strange world where.

381
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:11,059
these characters um or have sort of discovered it or it's like unfamiliar and there is is um

382
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:19,861
and there is this this mystery I think like it almost sort of like naturally follows

383
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:25,463
that uh the sort of like or maybe it doesn't naturally follow and it's just because

384
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:33,705
Jurassic Park is so formative and you know probably makes up like five percent of my brain

385
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:41,962
this like oh there's like this explorer if you're not the center and I don't know why but I think

386
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:48,287
it's just more okay so if you want to have it be a mystery you can't sort of be the central

387
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:56,113
hero because and so this this idea of like oh there's this intrepid explorer who you're

388
00:28:56,193 --> 00:29:02,738
following and you're trying to figure out what happened in this in this place um I think that

389
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:10,174
that showed up pretty early. And then I think sort of connected to this is also some of those earlier

390
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:16,660
town management prototypes because one of the things that we looked at early on was

391
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:25,068
Viva Pinata, this sort of thing of like slowly building up a community and then like

392
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:34,461
new characters sort of wander in as it becomes a nicer place or more, you know,

393
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:38,623
gradually you build it up and it's more active.

394
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:42,185
And, you know, by the end, it's just like flourishing little community

395
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:44,687
that was that was there

396
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:47,908
from the beginning, even before there were like.

397
00:29:55,291 --> 00:30:00,291
of bringing a community together much more compelling.

398
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:20,458
Yeah, it's funny. I've been thinking I've been I feel like I experienced the game a lot as kind of like a, a noir Pokemon thing. But in a lot of ways, it's almost like, if, like, it's like an Animal Crossing Godzilla movie or something, where, like, there's, you know, because you

399
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:25,824
always have a, you know, there's always a monster movie trope of like, you need to, there's needs to be a reason for somebody to be there.

400
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:30,849
And they're trying to find out what's going on because the viewer wants to find out what's going on.

401
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:36,976
And so you often, you so often have, you know, a junior scientist or a journalist or something in the picture.

402
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:45,946
But I feel like they very rarely end up stepping into the role of kind of like a therapist for a monster community that then like brings everybody together.

403
00:30:47,107 --> 00:31:02,904
And I'm curious, like, how, at what point, it sounds like pretty early, there was a notion about, like, there's a goal of cooperation as opposed to, like, a goal of being, like, adversarial or, you know, kind of victorious.

404
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,526
And it was that just like a...

405
00:31:05,502 --> 00:31:07,522
Is that a personal interest? Is that something that came from

406
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,444
previous games? Is that? Because I think that's something that's

407
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:14,665
kind of rare and a little bit non obvious in terms of, you

408
00:31:14,685 --> 00:31:18,547
know, setting out to have a goal. Usually the goal is, you

409
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:24,049
know, have the most be the best, vanquish your foes, etc, etc.

410
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,311
That's fair. Because certainly, like in a creature collecting

411
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:34,673
game, especially it is about having them all and like beating

412
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,153
everyone.

413
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:41,549
But like, you know, this, uh, one of our primary desires as a studio is to, um,

414
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:47,050
make games that are unique and are not kind of relying on the existing tropes

415
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:52,592
too heavily, as far as like combat and platforming, we want to come up with.

416
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:57,813
Our own particular ways of doing things, which is a nightmare sometimes, but also.

417
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:07,236
I think produces unique results. And so like I just like as a company I think we trended away

418
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:14,797
from anything that involved fighting. And so like naturally Bugsnax was never going to involve

419
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:21,499
like a combat component with the snacks. And I think maybe that's part of it then.

420
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,360
And because like this idea that Bugsnax are

421
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:35,033
parasites and bad and you know there's also the even though we we never really

422
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:45,978
uh it took a while to to figure out the each grumpus has their own thing that their own special

423
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:55,802
void that bugsnax are trying to to fill um the like consumption isn't bad

424
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:02,762
racking up points, capturing and feeding everything being like not that I feel like that's just like a

425
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:09,388
there's some sort of intuitive understanding maybe just on our team in general that like oh yeah it's

426
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:17,516
like yeah I don't know I think it's it's like it's it's uh common knowledge enough that there's

427
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:21,199
something wrong with focusing on

428
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:30,199
just mindless consumption, that we're not going to like do something that doesn't examine that, I guess.

429
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,324
Yeah, I guess to me, it's that we.

430
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:41,255
Like just for early on, uh, looking at the premise of our own story and thinking

431
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:42,957
about the implications of it.

432
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,780
Like, even if we didn't set out necessarily with that theme in mind, we

433
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,082
looked at it and said, that's the theme of that already.

434
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:54,086
Like, and we would, you know, it would be, uh, unwise of us not to

435
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:56,428
explore that aspect of it.

436
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:02,113
The parts that are kind of dark and upsetting about needing to catch them all.

437
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:10,189
Yeah, I think I think also the moving when the emphasis is on

438
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:15,431
we can't, we're not going to treat the grumpuses like, like

439
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:19,433
robots that we're manipulating, and we don't want to make it all

440
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:24,675
about. I mean, it's still there, but the all about catching them

441
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:30,378
all, then that sort of leads us to, okay, I guess this is about

442
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,259
the grumpuses.

443
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,671
and their actual stories.

444
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:41,913
So I think it's kind of almost like a process of elimination

445
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,434
of removing some of these things that didn't work

446
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:48,636
until we ended up on the focus that did work.

447
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,857
Yeah, there's almost like a,

448
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:54,818
once you've ruled out everything that's impossible,

449
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,719
whatever's left, no matter how improbable,

450
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,200
that's what you have to go with or something.

451
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,619
That's a good process.

452
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,881
It does sound scary to me as a game developer also.

453
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,323
But I'm really glad that you guys stuck with it.

454
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:14,505
One thing I wanted to touch on before, well, a couple more

455
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:15,045
things, I guess.

456
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,006
And don't forget, for anybody who's tuning in,

457
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,828
feel free to leave questions for us

458
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:22,849
that we can hit up toward the end of this session.

459
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,271
But I was curious about also the

460
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:31,813
Because there are things, I guess we've been talking a lot about like all the ways that

461
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:37,415
Bugsnax is like kind of breaking the mold or doing something unconventional within games,

462
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,656
but there's a lot of things that I think are very conventional but are still very effective,

463
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:47,018
like the idea that you get upgrades and new equipment that help you explore the world.

464
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:53,800
But I think those things ended up also being kind of connected to the story and to the characters

465
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,961
and to especially this kind of like sort of,

466
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:03,268
a tantrum based diaspora, the characters across the island.

467
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:06,089
But I think it's, I think it kind of like ties it together.

468
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:08,650
And yeah, I was curious if there were anything

469
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,591
about this process of like, oh, we're gonna,

470
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:12,272
we're gonna sprinkle these people.

471
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,052
It's the people around the island

472
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,193
and you're gonna go find them

473
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:19,215
and they're gonna be focal to how you explore these regions.

474
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:20,475
And then we're gonna connect,

475
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,756
and then we can connect kind of like conventional

476
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,257
markers of progress to those things.

477
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:32,048
Um, it was an interesting process and I know John and I talked about this the

478
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:36,939
other day that, um, kind of the way it all shook out was that we had developed.

479
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:46,141
900 bug snacks in isolation, the 13 characters, eight biomes and like six or seven traps and tools

480
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:52,064
all just kind of on their own. And then that process was looking at the map and then just

481
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:56,826
shuffling everything around like mad. Like we had a bunch of big meetings where we're like,

482
00:36:57,026 --> 00:37:00,187
what bug snacks go on the beach? What makes the most sense?

483
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:05,654
Is it fruit? Is it all fruit? Like, what belongs in the mountain? What belongs in the desert?

484
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:11,596
What character would most want to live here? Like, what order do you want to get the tools

485
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:17,877
in by difficulty? And who makes the most sense to have it? Right? And it took us a long time

486
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:24,079
of moving things around and having very large disagreements about the kinds of foods that exist.

487
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:30,796
that we just kind of shook through this process of like,

488
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,878
all right, what kind of if we move all these pieces together

489
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:38,521
at the same time, what puzzle fits and what will kind of give

490
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,462
you the best, like sort of pathway through the game?

491
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:50,328
Yeah, we definitely didn't have any sort of like, genius game

492
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,549
designer master plan. Right.

493
00:37:54,865 --> 00:38:02,247
Because we hadn't really built a systemic sort of game like this before,

494
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:07,209
I think the only way that we could have managed to do any of this was to

495
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:17,592
build all these little building blocks. And I think, yeah, so the two games that I was most

496
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:23,833
inspired by in doing the systems, the gameplay stuff, were

497
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:33,207
And it's funny that these are both like big AAA things that are impossible to achieve anything nearly like it,

498
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:37,971
but Horizon and Breath of the Wild.

499
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:44,997
So with Breath of the Wild being like, oh, this is amazing that this thing where all these,

500
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:52,803
you can do all these amazing creative things with these like little things that were clearly like built kind of in isolation.

501
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:52,863
Um...

502
00:38:54,194 --> 00:39:18,252
So it was like both necessary and like the way that we're inspired to build things that it's like, okay, let's just build this, this, this particular bug stack, and then figure out where it goes like, oh, it's fun to have something that picks stuff up and brings it to its nest.

503
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,745
or it's like, oh, this is kind of nice to have a bug snack that burrows.

504
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:26,067
And you got to figure out how to get it out or a bug snack that's really fast

505
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,268
and you need some way to stop it.

506
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:31,409
And then back and forth between

507
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:37,973
going back and forth and sort of shaping the tools and the bug snacks and

508
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:40,434
against each other.

509
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:41,475
And then that felt like

510
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,577
a little bit separate from the character and the level design.

511
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,978
I think because that's.

512
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:54,470
I guess that because Zune was responsible for the story and the quests and the levels

513
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:58,293
and I was responsible more for the bug snacks and the tools,

514
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,576
there's like a little bit more separation between those two things.

515
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:07,642
But then within those, they were sort of cycling and influencing each other.

516
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:12,766
Yeah. And I can speak even a little bit more specifically on character placement

517
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,629
and how that kind of works dynamically that.

518
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:22,187
like oftentimes the quests were designed around the bug interactions that were going on inside

519
00:40:22,227 --> 00:40:26,969
the level. Like I create a quest to be like, hey John made a really cool thing, I want to make a

520
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:36,993
quest where you have to do it, otherwise players won't look at it. But also when we place the

521
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:44,455
characters in the world based on where we think they would go, so much then of the story was

522
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,116
written around where they had ended up.

523
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:52,787
where like there are a lot of details that could have gone very differently if we had made a

524
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:57,852
different decision about where they went. So an example like a big example is like the fact that

525
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:03,817
Wambus and Triffany were put in different levels despite being married like because Wambus made

526
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:09,242
most sense in the garden grove because he's got his farm there and I thought it would be good

527
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:13,306
to introduce him early because he can teach you about sauce.

528
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,021
And that's like, we're like, you need to know about sauce as soon as possible.

529
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:20,302
It's extremely integral to the way the game is played.

530
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:22,583
So Wampus goes there to teach you about sauce.

531
00:41:23,403 --> 00:41:26,064
Uh, Befica was there to teach you about the journal.

532
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:27,924
So they both needed to be in that level.

533
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:31,625
And we only ever wanted there to be two grumpuses introduced in a level at most.

534
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:37,107
So it's like, well, it can't be with his wife, but also Triffany cares

535
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,507
most about bones and skeletons.

536
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,248
She should be in the desert where the ruins are.

537
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:48,068
And then the story about the fact that they went to different areas because of their career differences is then written about that.

538
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,991
Right. Like the fact that we put them somewhere else.

539
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:58,675
I guess that's interesting. So there's a little bit of like, it

540
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,917
sounds like the there's a part of the process that I've heard

541
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:04,541
described as occasionally as like scatter and gather, where

542
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:07,583
it's like, okay, we're gonna go off, do a bunch of cool stuff,

543
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:09,465
and we're gonna bring it together and see what sticks,

544
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,429
see what doesn't. But also, it sounds like maybe there was a

545
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,450
certain amount of

546
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:26,819
I guess I think it's interesting because I think there's a lot of there's a lot of conventional wisdom about really digging into your story early and seriously to make sure that your story and your gameplay fit together.

547
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:31,806
But I think you ended up it sounds to me almost like you ended up in a scenario where you had like.

548
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,545
characters in story were almost like a pressure relief valve for the way that you needed to

549
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:45,749
spread out your gameplay elements in a way. You were able to have some like wiggle room, like,

550
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:51,333
oh, we've got, you know, we've left space, there's connections between the characters,

551
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:56,277
and those things are maybe malleable in a way that, you know, the systemic interactions might not be.

552
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:03,598
Yeah, I agree with that because it's my feeling right now in this moment that like,

553
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:10,063
oh, I'm confident enough in the way the characters were written that they could have been any,

554
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,946
you could have been introduced to them in any order and an interesting story would have happened.

555
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:22,993
And maybe it's my experience as like a role-playing game master that I am used to

556
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:25,295
improv-ing a story based on what the players do.

557
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:27,356
Right, right.

558
00:43:27,957 --> 00:43:31,621
But where I feel like, Oh, I think the scenario and the setup are strong and

559
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:34,103
the details of it can go any given way.

560
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:39,588
Uh, we, cause like early on, we had the outline of the story about the big beats

561
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:41,590
about what would happen to the town over time.

562
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,572
Like we know they're going to come together and have a shitty party.

563
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:46,734
Uh, cause Phil was not good at this.

564
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,377
We know they're going to get together and like, they're going

565
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,638
to, they're going to see the monster.

566
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:55,946
But how that actually played out could have been very different if we had made different choices.

567
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:58,907
And I don't think I would have been dissatisfied with that.

568
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:04,691
That's really interesting. All right, so I'm gonna ask you guys to do a different GDC talk later

569
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:12,155
about this kind of dungeon master mindset to like making these kind of

570
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:19,354
Modular is very much the wrong word, I think, but these flexible elements that can be sequenced in

571
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:24,255
different ways and kind of remain kind of potent and interesting. Because that actually happens

572
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:28,517
structurally in this game also, like I think there's a deliberate kind of opening up toward

573
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:34,098
the end of the game where you start to be able to branch out and experience the stories kind of

574
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:35,778
in different orders a little bit too.

575
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:44,283
Yeah, it's basically like once we're done teaching you new tools is when the player is allowed to

576
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:48,846
just go wherever because you're like, oh, you've got everything you need, you should be okay to

577
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:58,773
explore now. Yeah, yeah. So before I turn over and start scooping up some questions from the

578
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:04,957
audience here, which we've got a bunch, my last question, I think, is kind of like,

579
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:14,794
Oh, how do you put this exactly? It's not exactly why bother. But

580
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:18,418
it's it's sort of a little bit that right, like on some level,

581
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:22,181
like, you know, an arcade game where you

582
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:28,863
you know, shoot critters and then feed them to people and there's like a town simulation like

583
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:35,425
that still totally sounds like a game to me but it also sounds like there was like a kind of like

584
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:42,768
an intuitive dissatisfaction with that as kind of like a creative undertaking for a group of people

585
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:48,010
and I was curious if y'all had any final thoughts on that.

586
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,510
piece of the project.

587
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,551
Because to me, from the outside at least,

588
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,331
that seems like something that's fundamental

589
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,512
to digging into something that has these ambitions

590
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,813
with a team the size that you have

591
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:02,953
and exploring the subject matter that it explores.

592
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:08,495
I can answer first if you want, John.

593
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:10,936
Yeah, go for it.

594
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:14,697
My feelings are that I think it could have worked as a game

595
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,412
and that we just weren't able to make it at the time.

596
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:22,275
Like it maybe it was too high scope for us.

597
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,117
Maybe there were too many unanswered questions at the time

598
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:27,379
where it wasn't exactly going in the direction we thought.

599
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,301
But I do agree that it

600
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:32,383
it could be a viable idea.

601
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:47,653
So maybe it was too, because it's funny, because I feel like where, where the game ended up is something that strikes me as very ambitious, but maybe the, what it was shaping up to be initially was even more ambitious in some ways.

602
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:49,034
That is accurate.

603
00:46:51,536 --> 00:47:02,063
Right, because we were, you know, there, there've been these ideas floating around of like trying to make storytelling more dynamic and

604
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:07,440
uh improvisational right with like oh here's characters that maybe their personalities

605
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:14,184
aren't changed by what by what food bugs they eat but where like a character's attitude towards

606
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:19,407
or your interactions with other characters influence how they're going to

607
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:41,345
maybe haven't totally achieved yet. So like that, that like,

608
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:51,171
systemic sandboxy sort of sort of thing, like, could someday by

609
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:56,254
someone be accomplished in a way where those characters feel

610
00:47:57,134 --> 00:48:02,157
real and, and, and compelling. But

611
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,293
We couldn't do it this time.

612
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:32,423
Well, I think to me it's such a funny way to describe it because I think you did end up with a game that it has these really strong, interesting systemic elements and you have these characters that are really believable and relatable and that's done really specifically through thoughtful combination of like traditional storytelling techniques and kind of traditional scatter and gather prototyping techniques.

613
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:37,066
And I just think it worked. I think it worked really well.

614
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:38,103
Oh, thank you.

615
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,925
I'm glad you guys stuck with it, even though it sounds kind of scary to me.

616
00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:44,647
I guess that's how I always feel about games.

617
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:47,729
And I'm not going to draw any tenuous metaphors between like

618
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,852
not knowing the player's role in the game, why they were there

619
00:48:52,992 --> 00:48:55,193
or why they were doing what they were doing for a long time.

620
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,875
And us as developers often sitting with our projects,

621
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,137
also not knowing who we are or what we're doing for a long time.

622
00:49:01,597 --> 00:49:02,938
I mean, there were long periods.

623
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:15,557
of it's easy to just kind of be stuck meandering around not knowing like I definitely was lost

624
00:49:15,777 --> 00:49:22,599
in for about a year in there uh trying you know like I'm fiddling with all these toys and trying

625
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:30,360
to massage them against each other but I don't know what I'm doing at all um and I think that

626
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,082
didn't mirror like figuring out who the player is and like really solidifying

627
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:45,854
was about uh directly at some point it kind of like shifted from the gameplay and system stuff

628
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:54,702
shaping and influencing the the the story and characters and it just slowly I guess as we got

629
00:49:54,742 --> 00:50:02,108
to know and and care about the characters and like the the themes and story that we like had no idea

630
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:06,491
like it wasn't there at the beginning and as we got closer

631
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:13,988
to the end of development and things started to focus in it shifted over to to that and that made

632
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:14,509
it clearer.

633
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:22,327
Yeah, it's interesting because that's something that I feel like we see a lot on our side as as developers also is this

634
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:29,069
thinking like, because like, you're talking about this game like, oh, yeah, we knew up front, bug snacks, they're bugs,

635
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:35,571
they're snacks, secretly, they're bad. And it's all about, you know, how the characters deal with that. But like, and

636
00:50:35,591 --> 00:50:39,212
that feels like knowing all the important things in a way.

637
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:43,018
And it's like, I feel like a lot of development often is figuring out,

638
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:46,479
oh, that was any, we didn't, that's nowhere near enough.

639
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,021
That's like, that's not enough to hang a thing off of.

640
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:52,983
That's not enough to make decisions about and like digging into it,

641
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:58,866
which I think you and the whole studio just did such a wonderful job of doing.

642
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:01,347
So we're under 10 minutes left.

643
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:03,068
We're actually technically under nine minutes left.

644
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:05,449
I want to get to some of the questions that came in from the audience.

645
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:06,590
Is this a good time to do that?

646
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,661
Sure, yeah.

647
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:08,881
Right.

648
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:13,342
So top voted question is specifically about the snacks.

649
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:15,882
What was the design philosophy behind the snacks?

650
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:19,563
Did you have rules for what could or couldn't be a snacks?

651
00:51:20,504 --> 00:51:22,464
We talked about this a little tiny bit

652
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:26,385
at the start about how one thing the snacks can't be

653
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:30,246
is viscerally horrifying and then something

654
00:51:30,266 --> 00:51:31,186
that you physically.

655
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:40,367
tear apart with your hands as a player, but were there other guidelines that settled into place over the course of development?

656
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:46,229
Well, I know at one point we had a spreadsheet where we were like

657
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:57,333
trying to get, we wanted a large variety of foods. We also wanted to like represent a lot of different

658
00:51:58,134 --> 00:51:59,074
bug, you know,

659
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:09,045
very loose definition of bugs, so insects and other, you know, other arthropods, basically.

660
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:13,008
And sometimes just invertebrates.

661
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:20,066
And I feel like there's one other dimension that we are trying to balance other than food and

662
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:25,969
and snack. I mean on top of that there's like oh we need sometimes like oh we just need a care

663
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:31,572
we need a bug that flies in this level and we don't know what we know the biome and we know

664
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:34,753
the behavior like what what food what bug.

665
00:52:37,745 --> 00:52:44,906
I'll also add one of our guidelines for what doesn't count as a snack,

666
00:52:45,106 --> 00:52:47,467
because we have many things that shouldn't be snacks but are,

667
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:52,128
but the real and true limit was it cannot just be an animal carcass.

668
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:54,648
Oh, sure.

669
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:59,589
Like, well, because there were a couple times where like, oh, like a baked salmon.

670
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,970
It's like, no, don't just make it a fish.

671
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,859
Right, right. Like, like, because if it's already a different animal and you can see

672
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:10,463
that it's an animal, how is it also a bug? That was kind of the question.

673
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:16,409
Yeah, I feel like like, anytime it comes close, like I have fun

674
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,131
memories of some of the sometimes the endgame script sort

675
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:22,334
of like engaging with that, like Ribble Pete, I think has a

676
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:25,776
little bit of special dialogue about like, oh, these bones

677
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:30,560
aren't crunchy like bones at all. And which again, deeply

678
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,341
disturbing observation to me.

679
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:33,702
Soft all the way through.

680
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:34,963
Yeah, that's horrible.

681
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:42,415
I love to sprinkle the underlying horror of the world into just random dialogue.

682
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:45,317
Yeah, we we, you know, as as like

683
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:49,020
fun and accessible as we want the game to be,

684
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,503
we got to maintain that a little bit of that horror edge.

685
00:53:54,224 --> 00:53:57,146
I think it ends up being it's I think it ends up being one of the things

686
00:53:57,206 --> 00:54:01,209
that makes the the basic moment to moment gameplay feel a little bit tense

687
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:03,891
sometimes, but I think it also ended up being great building blocks

688
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:06,833
for the ending of the game, which we could do a whole separate.

689
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,218
one hour session about probably.

690
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:12,641
But I want to move on to next question.

691
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:16,004
This question is also from Megan Tankersley,

692
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:22,109
which is, was the size of the island driven by scope?

693
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,972
You have a lot of the basic biomes there.

694
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:28,954
And also, were there environments

695
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:31,796
that you really wanted to include but weren't able to?

696
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:33,217
You talked a little bit about this

697
00:54:33,257 --> 00:54:35,259
being kind of a scatter and gather, like go off

698
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:35,399
and.

699
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,961
make some environments and we'll staple them together later kind of approach. But yeah,

700
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:44,162
if you wanted to get into that a little bit more, that would be great.

701
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:51,724
Yeah, I feel like we just didn't we just sort of pick eight as the number of levels?

702
00:54:52,945 --> 00:54:55,245
You're like two levels per biome was our thought.

703
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,627
Yeah, and one thing that comes to mind is that we

704
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:08,212
tried to do like or thought about doing twists on the sort of standard biomes it's like oh we're

705
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:16,016
gonna do like a black sand beach instead of a regular beach but tried a few different versions

706
00:55:16,056 --> 00:55:21,279
of that and it's like this just it doesn't look right. Yeah it just looks like dirt. Yeah so we

707
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,582
eventually you know we're doing enough weird stuff that this is one of

708
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:39,300
let's not try to reinvent the wheel with this that goes for like UI and a bunch of other things too

709
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:45,744
but but um for the the level the biomes are like let's just stick with the classics.

710
00:55:46,585 --> 00:55:49,606
We could do lava level we can do ice level it's fine.

711
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:58,052
Uh yeah that's interesting I think the um I know uh I I'm just remembering several

712
00:55:58,072 --> 00:56:02,734
several discussions that we've had um on our design teams about like where

713
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:06,995
how, how fun is it for because you can make something different

714
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:08,895
for the sake of being different, you can make something different

715
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:11,256
because you want to because you've already seen it a lot of

716
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:15,176
times in games, but like, is it actually fun for it to be

717
00:56:15,216 --> 00:56:17,337
different? Is it actually fun for it to be stink? Like, is

718
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:20,757
that part of the fun of going to the area is? Well, I've never

719
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:25,518
seen this kind of beach before. And is that done through the

720
00:56:25,578 --> 00:56:28,279
color of the sand? Or is that done through this beach is

721
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:32,920
populated by terrifying food parasites with very cute eyes?

722
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:39,588
And the part of the question about the size of the island,

723
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:41,990
I think that kind of comes from the thing

724
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,231
that Zune was talking about earlier

725
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:45,293
about wanting to care about the bug snacks

726
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:47,415
and not just have it be you're scooping up

727
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:48,536
a ton of bug snacks.

728
00:56:49,036 --> 00:56:52,279
Like my MMO poisoned brain always wanted everything

729
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,302
to be bigger and just way more bug snacks.

730
00:56:57,763 --> 00:57:00,506
But like, there's like a cozy sort of,

731
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:06,845
familiar with this kind of comfortable, in some ways,

732
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:11,407
size place that I think ended up fitting

733
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:14,208
the tone of the game better,

734
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:18,910
as well as supporting that feeling of like,

735
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,191
oh, there's only a couple of this bug snack

736
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:23,652
in this world at any given time,

737
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,913
and they feel a little bit more special,

738
00:57:25,993 --> 00:57:27,714
and then the size of the space just...

739
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:28,934
Yeah.

740
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:41,936
And part of that related to that kind of the sizes that I tended to go with were built around the fact that Bugsnax are very small, like a big Horizon Zero Dawn giant open world makes sense when your monsters are the size that they are.

741
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:52,961
But for us, because Bugsnax is so little, and you need to be able to like watch and catch them, like if the environment is turbo huge, like they get lost in it.

742
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:58,864
And we don't have the optimization to put 100 of them in a jungle and be okay.

743
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:08,084
But yeah, so small and dense, I think, was the guiding line on that.

744
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,311
I feel like it works. One of the reasons I think it works so well, too, is you have this,

745
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:14,973
you want to...

746
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:19,044
all for all the reasons you were talking about before wanting to put the player in

747
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:24,709
a in scenarios where they can wait and watch and grab something kind of implies

748
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,213
in a lot probably not. For me, it wouldn't have been obvious. But I feel

749
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:31,415
like in retrospect, it sort of implies like, oh, you need to be able to know

750
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:35,679
where to go do that. You need to feel confident that you can like, go up here

751
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,241
up the ramp across the thing.

752
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:42,424
past this like very, what appears to me to be like a really carefully placed landmark,

753
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:51,790
over to this area because I know this is where they're going to be and I can hang out here and I can wait and watch and I can do, you know, the main thing that I do.

754
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:55,252
We've got just one minute left. So this is a bit of a.

755
00:58:56,593 --> 00:59:05,699
That is not enough time to address this very good question but did you have a favorite villager, in terms of getting to make them and find out who they were.

756
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:16,598
Yeah, that's well and also I guess just in general, how did you feel about how players reacted to the characters that live in the in the village?

757
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:30,603
The answer is, yes, I do have a favorite. Well, I guess there's a difference between favorite to write and favorite to like understand and explore. Because my favorite character to write is Chandler. Because I could just

758
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:35,985
Chandler is my favorite character just because I identify with

759
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:41,387
Maybe you borrowed some of John's personality traits.

760
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:48,809
But to explore, I feel like I had a really interesting time.

761
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,170
I don't know, I had an interesting time exploring all

762
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,011
of them. That's what I that's what I liked about that process.

763
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:00,552
So I can't really pick one of them for the exploration. But

764
01:00:00,572 --> 01:00:02,892
wait, what was the second half of that question?

765
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:07,915
It was how did you feel about players' reactions, but we're also out of time.

766
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:10,537
So if you have a one-word answer, that'll be great.

767
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:12,638
Thumbs up, thumbs down.

768
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,599
Surprised mostly.

769
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:17,201
Awesome.

770
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:19,283
Anything, John?

771
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:21,355
No, I'm good.

772
01:00:23,197 --> 01:00:25,839
Thank you both so much. I think we're gonna wrap it up here. We

773
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:28,981
went only a tiny bit over time, which for me is a effing miracle.

774
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:34,245
Thanks, y'all for tuning in and listening to us chatter about

775
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:36,087
this game. If you haven't gotten to spend time with it yet

776
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:39,729
somehow. Apologies for spoilers and I strongly encourage you to

777
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:43,072
go check it out. It's beautiful. And I think I'm gonna wrap it up

778
01:00:43,332 --> 01:00:44,293
right there. Thank you.

779
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,395
Thanks. Thank you.
