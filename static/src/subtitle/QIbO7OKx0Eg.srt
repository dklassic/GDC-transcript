1
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:09,792
My name is Patrick, and I'm here today to talk about discoverability, as you might have

2
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:12,995
guessed from the somewhat cryptic title of the talk.

3
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:19,300
I run a small studio from an even smaller town based in New Zealand, and so you might

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,661
be wondering what I'm doing here.

5
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:27,867
Our most recent title with Dry Cactus is a semi-casual bridge-building kind of simulator

6
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:28,727
titled Polybridge.

7
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,118
As we were developing Polybridge,

8
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:34,401
we very quickly realized that there was a fair amount

9
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:36,143
of competition in the indie scene.

10
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:37,745
This is a Steam title that released

11
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:39,346
in early access a few years ago.

12
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,730
So we tried to kind of implement a number of techniques

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,353
that we like to call community-driven discoverability,

14
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,156
meaning a number of kind of game design decisions

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,438
that try to kind of cater to

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,781
empower the community to help us promote our title in a very organic and socially driven

17
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,862
way without trying to fall under the marketing umbrella.

18
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:03,602
I should have clicked on this.

19
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,623
I'm very professional as you can tell.

20
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:07,663
There we go.

21
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:12,705
So, yeah, Polybridge, again, this is quite a small title.

22
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:16,686
You might have seen it a few years ago because it went viral, we might say, on Reddit and

23
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:17,386
Twitter and so on.

24
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,726
Talking about discoverability is pretty vague.

25
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,527
Of course, it's not a new topic by any means.

26
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,289
It's, you know, it's, we've kind of been dealing

27
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,690
with discoverability ever since games existed,

28
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,112
probably used to be very old school in retail and so on.

29
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:35,173
Obviously, now everything has moved digital.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,917
I guess the main issues we're facing as independent developers these days is that we've identified

31
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:46,561
a number of trends that have been very quickly solidifying in recent years, and so discoverability

32
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:49,203
as a whole has taken really center stage.

33
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:50,504
You might have noticed, in fact, that

34
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,545
throughout this GDC, in particular like in the Indie Summit,

35
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,845
but also in the general talks at GDC,

36
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:59,966
there's been significant talk around discoverability.

37
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,107
There was even discoverability day, whatever that is.

38
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:07,568
And just kind of, we're all kind of on edge thinking,

39
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,088
oh my God, how am I gonna make my game discoverable?

40
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,849
Marketing doesn't really work anymore.

41
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,409
There's so much saturation and so on.

42
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,950
So some of these trends that we don't really love,

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,391
but they have to be acknowledged

44
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,951
and we have to kind of start working with.

45
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,993
are obvious, you know, the more obvious one being platform saturation.

46
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:30,036
We've been seeing that for a long time occurring, but of course with the semi-recent changes,

47
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:35,079
particularly on Steam, with Greenlight going away and Steam Direct and new stores coming up,

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,463
they are kind of allowing a fair amount of self-publishing, kind of, and lack of curation in general.

49
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,745
So that's, you know, one thing we're battling against constantly.

50
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:49,755
The other thing which I'm not a big fan of, but it's just the way we're going,

51
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,535
is kind of algorithmic curation.

52
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,576
So we're moving away quite aggressively and quite quickly

53
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,817
from being able to reach out to establish dev relations

54
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:02,418
and to kind of hope, or to try and maneuver some degree of

55
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:05,639
hand-curated featuring when we go to release a new title

56
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,180
or a major update, or whatever it is.

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,781
And we've moved quite a lot into this kind of algorithmic curation

58
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:11,981
of recommendations and so on.

59
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:17,623
And so again, we need to kind of think a lot about these things while we think about discoverability

60
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,364
and how these things affect the games that we're making.

61
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:27,767
Also not a big fan of the lack of cross-promotion, in particular I guess this applies to the

62
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:30,988
recent launch of the Epic Store, which is very interesting.

63
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:37,631
If you notice, you go to the Epic store, and possibly also Discord, but I'm not too sure, actually off the top of my head.

64
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:41,573
But they do no attempt to do any degree of cross-promotion within their store.

65
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:48,696
So if you go to the page of Game A, it doesn't attempt to recommend any similar games that you might be interested in.

66
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:52,378
So literally, if a customer reaches Game A page...

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,481
there is no chance of game B kind of getting promoted,

68
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,962
even though there might be lots of overlap.

69
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:00,323
We're very used to seeing these things in Steam,

70
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:01,884
on the Apple Store, on Google Play.

71
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,585
It's all about cross-promotion,

72
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,087
but it seems like some models seem to be moving away

73
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,068
from that as well, so.

74
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:13,165
Basically, I guess what's happening and what we really need to be mindful about is that

75
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:19,928
we need to be driving as much traffic as possible to the stores ourselves rather than kind of

76
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:26,012
being able to rely on internal factors within the platform that can help us kind of surface

77
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,293
in that kind of discoverability queue and so on.

78
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,877
Sorry, click, there we go.

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,282
I guess discoverability as a whole is a pretty vague term.

80
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:46,088
Often it falls under the kind of marketing branch, we could say, and hopefully by now

81
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:51,013
most of us have realized that trying to tag on marketing towards the end of the development

82
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:54,195
life cycle is a way to hurt ourselves quite actively.

83
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,017
Again, hopefully we all realize that marketing,

84
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,138
whatever that means, is a thing we do from day one.

85
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,659
Marketing, the marketability of a game

86
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,320
is lots to do with the game design, game mechanics,

87
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,461
and how they appeal to certain established audiences.

88
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:13,102
And so discoverability is really no different in that sense.

89
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,163
But because of all the things we just mentioned,

90
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,624
it seems to be really that discoverability

91
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,365
has kind of branched off from marketing

92
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,545
and become its own thing.

93
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:28,052
Trying to identify what makes good discoverability is almost impossible, I would say.

94
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:31,814
I tried very hard in recent years, but it often falls flat on my face.

95
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:38,416
Although we can identify some broad areas that are obviously very valid and apply to pretty much every game.

96
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:42,879
I'm not going to talk about them because they deserve and have their own talks.

97
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:48,101
So specifically in this year's UDC, you might have noticed there is talks about how to manage

98
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:53,724
effective email lists, talks about how to start and manage a Discord community, talks

99
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:57,546
about how to do outreach to YouTubers and streamers and so on and so forth.

100
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:03,376
these are things that we all need to be doing very well, but they're not the topic of today's

101
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:08,860
talk because obviously they take up their own segment and so they deserve their own time. So

102
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,023
ideally if you have access to GDC Vault or you attended these talks you learned a lot from

103
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:18,107
these. What I was doing today and what I'm hoping to be able to kind of communicate is

104
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:26,691
what choices can we make and what things do we need to think about when we're talking about discoverability in a community sense?

105
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:36,482
And particularly we're thinking about how do social aspects of our games can impact discoverability and help us surface above the noise, basically.

106
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:41,016
Before we jump into a few examples that I've identified,

107
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,057
I just wanted to touch on a couple of topics

108
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:45,939
which I feel are kind of the foundational pillars

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,901
when we think about discoverability,

110
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,203
at least they are for us in our small studio.

111
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,605
Whenever we make game design decisions

112
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:53,966
with discoverability in mind,

113
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:56,728
we always try to think about how do these decisions

114
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,790
impact a couple of these pillars.

115
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,953
The first one which is relatively recently become

116
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,115
a huge thing is driving external traffic.

117
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:10,077
Basically what I mean is, as I was touching on before,

118
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:13,499
even just a year ago we might have been able to release a game

119
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,444
on Steam, for example, and maybe by having a developer relation or anyways by

120
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:19,844
kind of

121
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:23,146
choosing a smart launch window we would be able to get

122
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:27,269
a certain amount of visibility because there is in-platform promotion.

123
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,453
This is kind of going away over time, replaced by algorithmic recommendations

124
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,675
and so a very important metric which

125
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:41,942
is not kind of very often said, but it's become kind of a huge key factor in recent months

126
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,465
and just is external traffic.

127
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,889
And that doesn't mean that you're trying to drive external traffic to your website.

128
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,833
It means that you're trying to drive external traffic to the platform specifically.

129
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:53,395
So again, in the example of Steam.

130
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:56,637
you're trying to bring people to Steam,

131
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,898
ideally these are people who don't even have a Steam account

132
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:03,700
and so a very significant metric

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,281
by the algorithm gods, as we call them,

134
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,982
is external traffic that then translates

135
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,582
into a new account on the platform.

136
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,623
If you are somehow, obviously it's easier said than done,

137
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,444
but if you're somehow able to drive significant traffic

138
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,545
to Steam through your game,

139
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,946
you can be sure that somebody will notice

140
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,667
and your title will magically surface up on the top

141
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:27,127
of the recommendations in algorithmic curation.

142
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,348
So I guess if you're a distracted person like myself

143
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,268
and you forget most things that you hear,

144
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,829
one thing you could take away from this talk

145
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,010
is that the main thing you're trying to do

146
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,810
is drive external traffic to the store page.

147
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,437
With that said, the other goal that I always think about

148
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,422
when thinking about discoverability is how do my efforts

149
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,107
in game design and discoverability translate to community

150
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,390
and how does my community interaction

151
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,472
feed back into discoverability.

152
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,153
It's a bit of a loop, so of course,

153
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:02,054
trying to get that momentum going initially

154
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,974
isn't necessarily very straightforward,

155
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,816
but it just helps, I guess, to always think about

156
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:11,898
how can I do things in my game that will help the community

157
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,318
make my game more discoverable,

158
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,499
and how can my discoverability feed back

159
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,300
into the community in a positive sense.

160
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,473
Ultimately, I guess what we're trying to do

161
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:24,337
with games in general, I guess, particularly,

162
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,361
well, in our studio, we identify as probably

163
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:30,044
the main value that we try and promote

164
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:31,426
is healthy community.

165
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:37,002
This doesn't necessarily mean just having, you know, a Discord server where people don't insult each other,

166
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:44,588
but in general it means a long-term community is kind of the foundation of what your fan base can be for your studio,

167
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:51,213
so any further titles already have a fair critical mass that is in a positive sense and want to support your work.

168
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,650
Obviously having a healthy community also brings along many other advantages such as

169
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,272
you know they can be your advocates, they can do a bunch of customer support on forums for you so

170
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:04,493
you don't have to do it all yourself. If you're doing an early access period they might be

171
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,194
contributing really meaningful ideas into game design and so on.

172
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,424
So yeah, community is number one.

173
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:14,505
We want a healthy, happy community.

174
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,205
Did I go far too much?

175
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:16,706
No, here we go.

176
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,207
And so now I wanted to quickly look

177
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,708
at three practical examples.

178
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:24,430
So of course, as I was saying earlier,

179
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,311
trying to identify a number of things you can do

180
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:29,972
to affect discoverability is generally very inefficient

181
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:32,574
apart from the obvious, let's do a healthy Discord,

182
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:35,415
let's do email lists, let's try and drive lots of traffic

183
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,156
to our coming soon page, and so on.

184
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:37,476
Those are.

185
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:39,738
I would consider those obvious, I guess.

186
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,562
The less obvious ones, to try and kind of communicate

187
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,646
the importance of a community kind of helping

188
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,788
discoverability of your game, I try to focus

189
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:51,229
on three practical examples,

190
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,851
giving some data points around these.

191
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,736
The first example is fairly obvious, so to speak,

192
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,678
but it has been around for a very long time,

193
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,940
so it's by any means nothing new, but...

194
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:07,962
I think it's still extremely valid these days and there are lots of examples of games that

195
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:14,664
work very well in this kind of area. In fact the talk just before this one also touched briefly on

196
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:19,665
similar topics in the sense that you make small games for your community, you don't try and do

197
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:24,326
something massive. So catering to a niche or a niche depending where you're from.

198
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:33,511
To me, it means kind of thinking about game design in a relatively narrow sense and identifying

199
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,992
your audience beforehand.

200
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:40,876
This can have huge benefits, of course, because the main one is that we tap into an existing

201
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,436
community.

202
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:45,699
This obviously has more or less value depending on game genre.

203
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,482
There are certain genres that obviously cater very well to this.

204
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:55,368
If we think of, as an example, which we're going to look at just now, if we look at simulators,

205
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:01,733
particularly if we think about maybe a car engine simulator, you could tap into a community

206
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,936
of enthusiasts about car engines.

207
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:08,580
These are not people who generally play many video games, for example, so you're not competing

208
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,981
in the space of video games.

209
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:14,443
you're actually bringing something new to an established community

210
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:19,745
that has a very specific hobby and is generally quite hungry for quality content.

211
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:23,907
And so if you come along and you give them a video game of this topic,

212
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:28,548
chances are that they'll be very enthusiastic about it and kind of back you right from the start

213
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,050
and also help you shape the game design and game mechanics in a way that is meaningful

214
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,691
to this kind of community.

215
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:40,214
The other big thing I feel about working with the niche titles is kind of,

216
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:45,577
I guess if you've been doing game design for a while, you might be familiar with the fact that

217
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:52,221
when you're doing games, you try and give players a relatively constrained set of rules to work within.

218
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:56,703
If a player has too much freedom, they often find themselves confused,

219
00:12:56,783 --> 00:13:01,486
which leads to frustration, which leads to anger, which leads to one star in the refund, so to speak.

220
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,670
This same concept applies extremely well to game development, of course.

221
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,133
If as a game developer I'm just trying to do something entirely new,

222
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:13,758
that doesn't have an established design language, doesn't have an established audience...

223
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:18,215
The chances of, you know, obviously having a huge hit

224
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,696
are tiny, although of course, there are people

225
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:23,097
who work in that area and that's great for them,

226
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:24,818
but for the rest of us mortals,

227
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:27,439
helping, it's really helpful, I guess,

228
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,340
to work within an established set of constraints

229
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,801
and a language that's familiar to your players

230
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,582
so that you can kind of tap into that.

231
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:38,664
And it's more about, I guess, iteration and improving

232
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,925
rather than trying to come up with something entirely new.

233
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:46,775
And the third fairly obvious one is we're trying to avoid that market saturation as we were talking about before.

234
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,476
We don't like market saturation.

235
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,457
It's a real thing.

236
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:59,423
But if you can cater to a niche in a small community and you can add that value, you know, you're kind of avoiding at least that significant pitfall.

237
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:04,464
A couple of things worth mentioning is, of course, you need to know your subject matter

238
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:04,704
well.

239
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:09,266
There are lots of examples of independent developers trying to cater to niches, but

240
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,948
they don't actually know the niche.

241
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:18,271
It's in a sense, if you know nothing about airplanes, for example, and you try and make

242
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:23,974
an airplane simulator, chances are that you're not going to do a great job.

243
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,968
And of course you must provide value and quality above and beyond what already exists.

244
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,092
So I guess the risk here is that if you're trying to compete in a small space

245
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,354
but there's already a golden standard so to speak,

246
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:41,319
you really have to either improve or offer something that is different enough to have its own merit.

247
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,321
A practical example of that...

248
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:50,146
Okay, there we go. I can see the images all garbled but they look right over there and it's great.

249
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:54,899
And so Automation, you might have heard of Automation

250
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,781
maybe a bit more recently on Steam actually.

251
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:59,303
Automation is a relatively small game

252
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,885
made by a small team from Australia

253
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:03,547
that moved to New Zealand a number of years ago.

254
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,949
And they're a great, great example

255
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:08,631
of doing this kind of niche thing super well.

256
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,294
As I was saying, the car engine simulator example

257
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,095
works really well.

258
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:16,858
So basically they did a game where you design engines.

259
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:24,344
and nothing else. Eventually they also implemented a way to design your whole vehicle, so modifying

260
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:28,226
every parameter of the body, modifying every parameter of shocks, wheels, you name it.

261
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:32,569
Everything is fully simulated and very accurate. But they started off with engines, which was

262
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:38,173
kind of where their main audience was. The marketing they did was entirely non-game,

263
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:43,456
like they did nothing to try and push the game in a video game kind of marketing sense.

264
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,300
They reached out to a number of car magazines that were very

265
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,765
eager to cover the topic, and car enthusiasts on YouTube,

266
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,245
and so on.

267
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:53,027
And that worked really well for them.

268
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,871
They've been in development for about six years now, and

269
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,852
they're still going strong.

270
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,589
Initially they were released on their own platform,

271
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,192
eventually moved on to Steam about four years ago,

272
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,233
which did really well.

273
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,958
It's just, I guess they're a very, very good example

274
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:09,579
of catering to a niche,

275
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,161
tapping into an existing community

276
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:14,125
that isn't about video games and finding lots of success.

277
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:23,717
Another quick thing they did recently, you might not know a game called BeamNG, or Beam.ng.

278
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:33,065
BeamNG is, again, a car simulator, but it doesn't focus on the engine or building part of the car, it just focuses on the driving aspect.

279
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:38,270
So you drive a little car on your racetrack and you can select from a number of vehicles that were made by the developers.

280
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:43,154
If you think about this, automation did build your car,

281
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,975
BeamNG did drive your car.

282
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,897
Both of them did very realistic simulations

283
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,519
and specialized in different fields.

284
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,740
But as you can imagine, there's loads of overlap.

285
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,583
So what they did about eight or nine months ago,

286
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,705
they decided to kind of team up, so to speak.

287
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,847
Automation implemented an exporter,

288
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,690
so the vehicles you make in automation can be exported.

289
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,393
BeamNG implemented an importer for the automation vehicles.

290
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:13,605
So what happens is you can design your vehicle in automation and export it and drive it in BeamNG.

291
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:18,046
You can probably guess by looking at that sales graph from Steam,

292
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,487
which we're now allowed to share.

293
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,368
Thank you, Valve, for clarifying the terms of conditions.

294
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,129
Flatlining, as you can see on the left,

295
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,930
that's actually not a bad flatline.

296
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,091
That was a daily average of 20, 30 sales a day.

297
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:34,572
A $30 price point, so not bad,

298
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:39,093
but definitely not enough to support a team of 708 people as they are currently.

299
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:44,836
The little bumps you start seeing there are the announcement, both BeamNG and Automation

300
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,698
did announcements of on this day we're going to be releasing this awesome thing and obviously

301
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,419
on the day you can tell what happened.

302
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:57,642
There was a massive spike, 450% increase over the similar period of the previous year.

303
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:03,165
The tail kind of increased by five or six times currently.

304
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:09,528
Overall, I guess, again, a really good example of showing a niche, a different niche overlapping,

305
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,652
some platform support because Steam did do a loyalty coupon, so the owners of automation,

306
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:20,354
they didn't have BeamNG, got 30% off and vice versa. So basically that did really well,

307
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:27,379
as you can tell from that massive spike there. The metric on the left is units, so we're spiking

308
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,642
at about 4,000 units on that day. If you can do numbers, you can figure it out. So very good.

309
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,990
The other example I wanted to quickly look at is user generated content.

310
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,533
User generated content is a very vague term.

311
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,596
I think we're running low on time so I'm just going to slam through this.

312
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,609
User generated content can mean lots of things.

313
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,090
When I think about user generated content,

314
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,633
I primarily think about content that is made in video games

315
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,415
where the player has a lot of creative ownership over.

316
00:18:57,655 --> 00:19:00,597
So not necessarily, UGC is often talked about

317
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:02,698
like a mod or a level for a game.

318
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:06,961
I'm referring to UGC as kind of creative ownership

319
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,963
of content, so Minecraft, the obvious Mirror Maker,

320
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,445
all the same games where you get to build your city

321
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,306
or your ant colony or whatever, like they all.

322
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:16,228
fall into this category really well.

323
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:17,588
Roblox, of course, is a huge one.

324
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,591
This has lots of value, I think,

325
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,933
to kind of tie communities together,

326
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,534
enable very meaningful social interactions

327
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,416
between players that like these games.

328
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,897
And we're riding on the wave of the maker movement,

329
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,098
which was quite big a number of years ago,

330
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,239
but it's still going strong.

331
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,200
So things like the Arduino,

332
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,462
which is an open source electronics prototyping platform,

333
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,483
and the Raspberry Pi, which is a tiny computer.

334
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:43,844
All these things kind of...

335
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:49,266
strongly indicate a desire from game developers

336
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:52,568
and game audiences to kind of find a common language

337
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,169
and be able to interact and share content

338
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,229
in a very meaningful way.

339
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:59,510
I'm by no means a psychology expert,

340
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,751
but I do often find a very strong relationship between

341
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:09,755
kind of human emotion and this kind of desire to share and to some degree even kind of brag,

342
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:14,298
I guess, with your friends or wider social media circles about what you did. If we think

343
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:19,621
of paintings, for example, your tool would be a paintbrush and your canvas and your colors.

344
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,922
but that's not what you're showing people.

345
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,082
You're showing people what you made with these tools.

346
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:26,663
The tools become completely transparent

347
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,864
and almost invisible, so that's what I'm talking about here

348
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:32,125
is in an ideal world, if we can cater to this kind of

349
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:36,747
human desire to be creative and own the creativity

350
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:39,128
and then showcase it to your friends

351
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,388
in social media circles,

352
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,570
the game really just becomes, takes back stage,

353
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,571
but is inherently promoted all the time.

354
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:50,369
And this has been huge, so we're gonna look at an example

355
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,010
with Polybridge, which is a game we made.

356
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,931
You can hopefully see the animated GIF

357
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,872
playing at a very crappy frame rate,

358
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,073
but it gives you an idea.

359
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:00,795
So very simple, in Polybridge we just implemented,

360
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,257
just before releasing in Early Access,

361
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:06,338
we implemented this simple frame recorder.

362
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,059
It records at 15 frames a second,

363
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,260
and it keeps it in a buffer.

364
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,922
Whenever you fail or succeed in a level,

365
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:13,803
you get a prompt to share your replay.

366
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:16,505
You share your replay, you can upload it

367
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:18,926
without leaving the game to a bunch of social media platforms

368
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,207
that you can authenticate in game.

369
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:22,870
I had a bunch of stuff that was going to talk about tech,

370
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,751
but I do think we're running a bit low on time.

371
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,894
Anyways, you can find some open-sourcing corridors made by Zach.

372
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,997
And so just to give you an idea of the impact this had,

373
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:34,959
this is from July 2015,

374
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,161
which is when we released in early access.

375
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,296
Try and take a guess.

376
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:43,158
Guess what happened?

377
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,125
So you can see to the left we had a relatively minor launch,

378
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,247
which was still great.

379
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,030
I was just working on this myself, so I was like,

380
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,152
yeah, I can finish this game.

381
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,854
I don't have to go back and get a real job.

382
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:55,856
I'm really happy.

383
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,657
And then you can start seeing some kind of ups and downs.

384
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,878
The first little spike happening around the 10th of July

385
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:04,980
is Twitter picking up on it.

386
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,560
We had lots of Twitter activity.

387
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,002
The second major spike, the graph on the left,

388
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:12,683
or whatever you call it, the column on the left

389
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:15,444
is US dollars, so I left dollars because again,

390
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,585
we're now allowed to share monetary value

391
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:18,705
from our Steam back ends.

392
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:25,409
And so we can see, you know, for a very small, semi-casual, independent bridge-building game,

393
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:28,051
which is like, who the hell is going to even care,

394
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:33,656
because we had this mechanism where we identified that players were really...

395
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:38,821
quite strongly kind of sentimental about the bridges they built.

396
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:42,946
And so if we just said, oh, let's just empower these players

397
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,508
and give them the ability to share the content that they made

398
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:47,931
onto their social media platforms,

399
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:50,274
and that was much bigger than we thought.

400
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:55,656
And obviously you can see the spike, you can see how much significantly the tail picks up after that.

401
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:59,377
There are a number of other spikes after this, but I just wanted to focus on the first big one.

402
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:05,559
That big one in the middle is the front page on Reddit, I think, once Reddit started also sharing stuff.

403
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,320
And then, you know, Polybridge GIFs were a thing for many months on Reddit,

404
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,801
where then people started saying, you know, not again, not more Polybridge, please.

405
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,482
But it did work really well.

406
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:22,060
And the last thing I'd like to touch on before we have to bail is Twitch streamers.

407
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,783
Hopefully we all know by now that Twitch is not going away and we all love Twitch.

408
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:29,604
Hopefully Twitch is listening.

409
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:31,274
Love Twitch.

410
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:35,016
There's lots of material out there on what you can do

411
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,437
to approach Twitch streamers, so that's definitely

412
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:38,798
not what I want to talk about.

413
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:42,120
There are talks, there are forum posts, there are blogs,

414
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,241
there's so much material out there.

415
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:46,302
The general rule is you start small,

416
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,163
you don't try and reach the large audience,

417
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,704
you don't try and reach the large streamers.

418
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:52,025
There's also an article recently that was showing

419
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:54,567
kind of the crystallization, as they call it,

420
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,148
of the Twitch streamer scene, as in,

421
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:05,147
As with any kind of capitalistic model, the number of small streamers that are succeeding,

422
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:09,430
so to speak, and able to do it full-time is decreasing, and the number of large streamers

423
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,454
is becoming smaller, but they're getting most of the audience or most of the money, so to

424
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:13,694
speak.

425
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:18,398
So this is a bit of a worrying phenomenon, but nonetheless, we focus on starting with

426
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,219
small streamers.

427
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,120
We want to get them enthusiastic.

428
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,601
We want to have a good relationship with them.

429
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:26,863
And we also very strongly, hopefully, understand now

430
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,283
that attempting to involve influencers,

431
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,743
which is a word I highly dislike,

432
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,964
at the late stage of marketing is complete nonsense.

433
00:24:34,384 --> 00:24:36,765
Again, we're trying to, well, we're talking about

434
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:39,585
how do we make meaningful gameplay decisions

435
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,885
and integrate these into gameplay mechanics

436
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:44,306
to allow this to happen quite organically.

437
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:47,466
This obviously doesn't apply to every genre.

438
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,167
If you're doing a single player narrative linear story,

439
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:55,070
your appeal to Twitch streamers is already extremely low,

440
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,272
so there's not much point in thinking about it,

441
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,974
but different games work differently.

442
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,536
And again, with Twitch, we definitely noticed

443
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:06,140
a very strong kind of human connection,

444
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,701
or desire for human connection,

445
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:11,444
and so we tried to enable that as much as possible.

446
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:14,327
So again, a use case for this specific thing.

447
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:20,851
In Polybridge, we integrated a kind of a way for streamers.

448
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:23,492
A streamer is playing Polybridge and is building a little bridge,

449
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:26,294
and the viewers are screaming at them in chat saying,

450
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:29,435
no, you're stupid, you're doing it wrong, move this here, do that there.

451
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:32,397
And then there's a stream of text, and it's impossible, and everything gets lost.

452
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,698
So there was like, OK, there's an issue here.

453
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,239
So we implemented just before release.

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,421
a WebGL version, which means an in-browser version of PolyBridge, super minified, no

455
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,981
textures, nothing, everything was ripped out.

456
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:49,043
But what that means is that as a viewer, you can load up this kind of in-browser version

457
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:53,664
of PolyBridge, you get a mirror version of the bridge that the streamer's building, you

458
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:57,925
can modify the bridge, you just can't simulate it, you can only modify it, and you can submit

459
00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:00,806
it back to the streamer as a suggestion, who then gets a pop-up saying...

460
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:03,488
this person just submitted a suggestion.

461
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:06,730
So basically we created a very easy way for streamers

462
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,832
and audience to collaborate together

463
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:11,154
and play together in an asynchronous way

464
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:13,016
while the streamer stays in control,

465
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:14,597
which is obviously very important.

466
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:17,119
If you're interested a bit in the tech about this,

467
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:19,281
just email me and we can talk about it later

468
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,183
because we're running out of time, I believe.

469
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:26,846
Use case again, with a nice little graph, because we all like graphs.

470
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,709
If anyone knows who that on the left is, they get 10 points.

471
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,350
I didn't know until recently.

472
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,412
That is a Twitch streamer, or streamer in general.

473
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:39,454
His name is Faker, and he's from South Korea.

474
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:46,279
Those two big things you see behind him are the, kind of his world champion things of

475
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,159
Leagues of Legends.

476
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,261
League of Legends, rather, I should know what I'm talking about.

477
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,924
League of Legends is a relatively large game, as you might have heard.

478
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:59,508
So what Faker did, and this was completely, you know, I didn't do anything,

479
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,691
this is two years after release, the Twitch thing was going on.

480
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:06,092
So basically this Twitch integration we did made it so that...

481
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,996
Polybridge became quite a common staple within the Twitch community,

482
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,118
so small streamers would often play Polybridge

483
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:14,660
because it would allow them to interact with their audiences

484
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:16,943
in a more meaningful social way

485
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:21,967
and allow the streamer to cultivate their own community

486
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:24,109
because that's what a Twitch streamer obviously wants to do.

487
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,792
They want to have a healthy community too, just as much as we do.

488
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:26,852
So...

489
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:37,316
Poly Bridge allows them, Poly Bridge becomes a tool for them to cultivate this kind of healthy community more so than other games because other games are very passive when the audience is just kind of watching.

490
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:54,301
And so because we integrated this, Twitch kind of became a common staple and two years after release, Faker started playing, before doing his League of Legends streams that are quite huge, he started playing Poly Bridge for half an hour to an hour and he's actually still going because he's determined to finish the game.

491
00:27:55,142 --> 00:28:00,984
And so if you look at the graph, this is the graph for the steam cells in the Asia regions,

492
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:04,906
so primarily China, South Korea, Japan, and a bunch of smaller ones.

493
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,348
You can see to the left, we're kind of flat-lining there.

494
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:11,669
We're, I think, five or ten units a day, pretty negligible.

495
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,973
And you see that first little bump, that's Faker's first short stream.

496
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:21,155
You see the second bigger, but all of the spikes you see in this graph

497
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:23,597
are because Faker is playing Poly Bridge.

498
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,859
These are no longer dollar values, these are Steam units.

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,962
The Steam backend doesn't give dollar value when you're doing regional for some reason, so...

500
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:42,497
Very impactful, I guess. Obviously from the spikes, but you can see the long-term tail tends to creep up and without giving it a dollar value.

501
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,985
If I could buy something for Faker, it would probably be a gold statue of himself because he did...

502
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:53,289
do a lot to help us financially without even ever thinking about it.

503
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:58,212
We've never been in touch, but the fact that a large streamer just decided to play PolyBridge

504
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:02,594
because of this Twitch integration, because of the social value we added,

505
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:07,657
has been huge for us as a game studio and our ability to continue making games.

506
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:14,722
And I think that's us. If anyone has any questions, I think we have one minute.

507
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,583
Otherwise, I will hang out for more time later.

508
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:25,914
I'm still on the one question.

509
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,254
Sure.

510
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:27,635
Have you heard of Twitch extensions?

511
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,176
I have heard of Twitch extensions, yes.

512
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,417
I would love to see a Twitch extension for VolleyBridge.

513
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:34,338
Probably, yes.

514
00:29:34,678 --> 00:29:37,739
I think, so the question being Twitch extensions and so on.

515
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,321
I think Twitch extensions are a great tool and a clear indicator that Twitch has picked

516
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,882
up on this kind of social value.

517
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:52,147
I haven't worked with them too much to be honest, because for this thing the Twitch extensions did not cater at all.

518
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:56,312
So we had to implement our whole server back end with a REST API and so on.

519
00:29:56,692 --> 00:30:02,438
But I'm actually meeting with Twitch tomorrow and we're going to be talking about how we can do this and so on.

520
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,321
And I think that's us. Beautiful. Thank you.
