00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:05,896
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:07,678
Sorry about the heat.

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:11,763
Welcome to Practical Contract Law for Indie Developers 201

4
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:12,864
Not Scary Edition.

5
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:14,706
Or actually, Moderately Scary Edition.

6
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,249
Last year was Not Scary Edition.

7
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:19,172
So before we get started, I want to remind you this will

8
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:19,893
be in the vault.

9
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:22,416
And also, please fill out your session evaluations.

10
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,018
My name is Chris Reed, and I'm the founder of Chris Reed Law.

11
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:28,379
We're a firm that works with game developers and game

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,360
industry professionals, helping them with a wide range of

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,922
legal issues, including today's topic, which is contracts.

14
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:37,183
But before we get started, I would like, with the help of

15
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:39,604
my co-counsel, Mr. Phoenix Wright, to remind you I am not

16
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:42,186
your lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

17
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:45,067
It's legal education, and I hope it will be helpful.

18
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,168
My goal today is simple.

19
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:49,489
I want to help indie developers be less scared and

20
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,851
understand more about the common contracts that they're

21
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,551
going to encounter.

22
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,408
So, we're gonna cover some legal basics,

23
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:57,751
and then I'm gonna go over five contracts

24
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,695
that you're likely to run into as an indie developer.

25
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,399
For each contract, I'm gonna tell you when it comes up,

26
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,183
what you need to know about it, why you should care,

27
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:09,486
and how that gets scary if you don't,

28
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,248
and what terms we need to look after.

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,612
Last year for my 101 talk I estimated that we'd need

30
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:18,234
probably about this much time to go through everything you'd

31
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,275
need to know.

32
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:22,236
And it turns out that was an underestimate.

33
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:25,158
Just to get over contracts, we're probably going to need

34
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,899
about this much time.

35
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,361
So unfortunately, we still only have enough time for two

36
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:30,161
games of Hearthstone.

37
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:33,123
So consider this more of a tutorial.

38
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,351
Let's start with a couple of basics about contracts.

39
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:40,173
A contract is a voluntary agreement between two or more

40
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,815
parties to do something reasonably specific with an

41
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:47,917
exchange of value for something that isn't illegal.

42
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:48,697
Sorry, Dark Brotherhood.

43
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:52,079
So when do you need a contract?

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,199
This one is very simple.

45
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:57,681
Before you do anything with anyone, please remember this.

46
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,383
Contracts are everywhere in the game industry.

47
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:03,484
We've got the five that we're going to talk about today.

48
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:10,489
But there's also a host of other situations where you might encounter a contract and need to know about it.

49
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,994
I know that most people hate contracts.

50
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,406
You have the same opinion that Mr. Torg does.

51
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:18,766
Mostly people say they're written in legalese,

52
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,987
it's impossible to understand, what's wrong with lawyers,

53
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,227
why do they write that way?

54
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,028
There's probably a lot that's wrong with lawyers,

55
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,228
but for the programmers in the audience,

56
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,929
I'd say you wouldn't write crappy code

57
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,929
just because someone said it looked programmery.

58
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,710
The words are there for a reason, they do things.

59
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,830
Specifically, contracts help provide clarity

60
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,211
and predictability in a business relationship.

61
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,608
They also get the parties thinking and talking about things they might not have considered

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,390
just by negotiating it, which means it's less likely that there's going to be a dispute.

63
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,331
And if there is a dispute, having that contract provides for the worst case scenario, but

64
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,732
it also provides for unexpected success.

65
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:59,894
If you start making millions, if there's this runaway success, it's important what those

66
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,034
percentages are suddenly.

67
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:06,062
And finally, some things require a written signed agreement

68
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,205
to accomplish, specifically the transfer

69
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,708
of copyright interests.

70
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,711
This is incredibly important.

71
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,553
You can't do this with an email.

72
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:15,336
And if you don't have that contract,

73
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:16,658
you don't own that code.

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,664
Basically, contracts are a rule book

75
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:22,226
for a business relationship.

76
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:23,467
You may not need it very often,

77
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,510
you might not have to look at it if things are going well,

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,993
but you're gonna be really glad that it's there

79
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,595
if you have a dispute.

80
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:30,676
And on a related note,

81
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:32,158
my friends no longer play board games with me.

82
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:37,593
A word about boilerplate, the so-called boilerplate sections.

83
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,493
This is generally in the general section

84
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,353
at the end of a contract.

85
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,954
A bunch of small, boring-looking fine print.

86
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,875
I want to urge you not to skip it.

87
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,975
There's a lot of important settings in here.

88
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,336
Are you agreeing to arbitration?

89
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,996
Where do you have to go to court?

90
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,537
Does one side have to pay attorney's fees?

91
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,777
So look through this section in any contract.

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,602
And finally, some practical concerns.

93
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,805
My number one rule here is that contracts

94
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,067
don't enforce themselves.

95
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,208
They're not magical.

96
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,270
It's not Harry Potter.

97
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,792
You actually have to take action.

98
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,693
It's not going to stop someone from failing to pay you,

99
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,155
even if you have a good contract.

100
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,978
And enforcing that legally might take time and money

101
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:13,738
if there's a dispute.

102
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,821
And my second point here is please don't use what I like to

103
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:21,042
call Franken contracts where you get something off the

104
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,583
internet and then your friend sends you a contract and you

105
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,004
put a couple things in from there and then someone else

106
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,485
sends you a clause and then you say that's probably good

107
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:33,508
enough. This is often worse than having no contract

108
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,669
whatsoever because you're now effectively using code that

109
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,609
you've never read. You have no idea what it's going to do and

110
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,550
it may not even make sense if there's a dispute.

111
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:42,936
So let's get on to our first contract of the day,

112
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,897
the non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.

113
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,537
This is between someone disclosing

114
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,458
confidential information and someone receiving

115
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,158
confidential information.

116
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,598
It comes up in a couple scenarios,

117
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:56,699
perhaps if you're interviewing a contractor for a job

118
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,380
and you don't want them to be able to disclose info about it

119
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,160
if you don't hire them, and also if you

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,060
were making a confidential game pitch

121
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,121
and don't want them to reveal details about the game idea.

122
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,164
So why do we care about one of these agreements? Well, first off, it's the only way to really

123
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:16,747
protect abstract ideas and mechanics. As a note, these are things that are not protectable

124
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:22,370
under regular copyright law. It's also a good way to protect trade secrets. That's a type

125
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,513
of IP that covers things like customer lists or pricing models. And finally, it's just

126
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:32,256
a way to keep certain stuff secret. You know, maybe the launch date or some details about

127
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:35,158
the main character that you were hoping to save for a marketing splash.

128
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:41,360
And these can be scary. Just recently, Oculus lost a $500

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,742
million verdict in part because they were found to have breached

130
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:50,084
an NDA. These contracts have teeth just like the cock a

131
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:54,886
demon. So what do we want to put in one of these? First off, you

132
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:58,748
need to know if it's going to be a mutual NDA or a one way NDA.

133
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:02,230
Meaning are we both sharing information or is only one

134
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,311
person receiving that information and the other one

135
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:04,651
sharing it?

136
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,255
But the core of an NDA is going to be the definition of confidential information.

137
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:10,236
You're sharing some stuff.

138
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,377
Well, what is that stuff?

139
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,538
How broad is that definition?

140
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,759
Everything I tell you?

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,920
Or is it narrow?

142
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,502
And do I have to mark it?

143
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,825
Is it going to be saying confidential on the top of every document?

144
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,227
What happens if I tell you on Skype?

145
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,608
Do I have to email you later?

146
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,890
These are things you have to consider.

147
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,678
You then have to think about what the permitted uses are.

148
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,818
So what can they do with this information?

149
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,859
Are they signing the end age just so that they can look

150
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,980
over your stuff and decide if they want to work with you and

151
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,680
they're not allowed to use it for any other purpose?

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,741
Or is this something where you're working together and

153
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:39,881
they're going to put it into a game?

154
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:43,582
And finally, you need to know what their obligations are for

155
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,322
keeping it secret.

156
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,422
How long does it last?

157
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,683
Is it for a year or is this to their grave?

158
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,863
And who can they tell?

159
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,084
How narrowly do they have to keep this information from

160
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:51,864
their employees?

161
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,410
Finally, a couple of practical concerns.

162
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,472
First off, they can just say no.

163
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,873
Not everyone's gonna agree to sign an NDA,

164
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:02,635
so then you still have to decide if you wanna tell them.

165
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,977
And, like I said before, enforcing costs time and money.

166
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:06,678
It's not magical.

167
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,280
They're not gonna be forced to not say anything.

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,801
They could still disclose this stuff.

169
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:14,313
So let's move on to our second contract,

170
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,714
work for hire agreements.

171
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:18,515
These are incredibly important, and they're between a

172
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:22,436
developer and a contractor, or really anyone that's

173
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,377
contributing something to a game, which actually includes

174
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,617
the owners of a studio.

175
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:29,058
There's a related type of agreement called an invention

176
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,659
assignment agreement.

177
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,799
And the owners need to sign this, as well as contractors

178
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,360
signing work for hire agreements, because.

179
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:41,188
This is the agreement that allows the studio to own the IP

180
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:45,210
that's created. Brief copyright lesson. The default rule is

181
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,652
that if someone creates something, they own that

182
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:50,454
copyright. Meaning your artist owns the art, your sound person

183
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:53,616
owns their sound, coder owns the code. Unless you have this

184
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:56,718
exception, which is that it's work for hire and you need this

185
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:59,100
written signed agreement to accomplish that in most cases.

186
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,422
It also helps with some tax issues, but I would say ask

187
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,023
your accountant. I don't do tax.

188
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,544
These can absolutely lead to disasters.

189
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:11,947
I've dealt with clients who've had games pulled from Steam

190
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:14,209
and an angry former contractor with a bad

191
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,810
or non-existent contract did a DMCA.

192
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,671
I've seen very expensive fights

193
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,593
where they've had to pay people off.

194
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:22,955
You just wanna make sure that it's clean

195
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:25,217
and clear up front to avoid this.

196
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,233
So how do we make that happen?

197
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,835
Well, first off, we got to look at the IP rights section.

198
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,796
It's called work for hire agreement

199
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:34,398
because it sets up this work for hire arrangement

200
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,039
where the company is the owner of the IP.

201
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,980
You also want a little backup clause that says,

202
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,542
look, if for some reason a court doesn't agree to that,

203
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,503
then you agree to assign it.

204
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:44,564
One way or another, company owns it.

205
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:50,832
There might be an exception if an artist wants a license to display things in their portfolio,

206
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:55,713
and that's fine, but just make sure that you have some control over when they do that and what they display.

207
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:58,634
You don't want them putting art assets up before you launch the game.

208
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:01,874
Then you gotta figure out how you're gonna pay this person.

209
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:08,196
Normally, you'd pay them either hourly or maybe with milestones, maybe there's a cap,

210
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:11,497
or with rev share, which is quite popular among indies.

211
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,202
Let's take a little bit to talk about RevShare,

212
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,064
because this comes up a lot.

213
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:21,669
RevShare's fine, but you can't just say 10% of the game.

214
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,411
That doesn't mean anything.

215
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:27,595
You need to think of a couple of key details here.

216
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:28,817
First, 10% of what?

217
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,819
What is net revenue?

218
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,240
So what are you deducting from that?

219
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,682
Is this before Steam's cut, after Steam's cut?

220
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,764
What happens if a publisher's involved?

221
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:37,865
Those sorts of things.

222
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,708
Then you need to think about whether this

223
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,889
takes time to vest.

224
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,132
So are they immediately entitled to this money,

225
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:45,473
this rev share when the game comes out?

226
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:47,575
Or do they have to have earned it by working for the game

227
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,617
for a certain amount of time?

228
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,700
You need to think about which platforms are covered.

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,744
If they're working on the Steam version and you think maybe it'll be on console later

230
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:59,968
and they're not working for you, do they get console revenues as well?

231
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:02,271
And finally, which products does this cover?

232
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:06,936
Are we talking just the initial game or are we talking sequels, prequels, DLC, that kind

233
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:07,176
of thing?

234
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,338
This can massively change the scope of what you're paying.

235
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,324
Speaking of scope, you also need to have

236
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:16,566
a written statement of work that describes

237
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,667
the scope of work, what someone is delivering to you.

238
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,828
What is this contractor doing?

239
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,889
Not just a sentence, some art assets.

240
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:22,510
You need to list it,

241
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,751
because then they know how much they have to do,

242
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,212
and you know what qualities need to be delivered

243
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:27,873
for you to pay.

244
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,772
And if you're not satisfied or honestly if you need to cancel

245
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:36,315
the game, there needs to be a clear right for the developer

246
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:39,216
to terminate. You don't want to be obligated to pay people for

247
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:41,858
work you don't need. And then you're going to need to think

248
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,899
about what happens when you terminate them. Are you going

249
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,801
to pay them? Look over these things. That can lead to a big

250
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,281
dispute.

251
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,525
And next, we have a trio of very scary sounding sections

252
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,226
called Representations, Warranties, and Indemnities.

253
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:58,308
Basically, this just means, what are they promising,

254
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,288
and what happens if it's not true?

255
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:04,010
Specifically, you're gonna wanna make sure

256
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,210
that this is about intellectual property infringement.

257
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,872
They promise that they didn't steal this stuff from Disney,

258
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,692
and if they did and Disney sues you,

259
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,493
they're the one that's on the hook.

260
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:14,513
The contractor's on the hook.

261
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,782
And that's doubly important because as a developer,

262
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,123
if you do a development agreement for a third party

263
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,564
or you have a publishing agreement,

264
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:24,045
you're going to end up making this exact same promise

265
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,086
to your publisher.

266
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,286
And it needs to be true.

267
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,168
And finally, sometimes you'll see non-compete

268
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,870
and non-solicitation clauses in one of these.

269
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,231
Some people don't like them.

270
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,252
Some states won't enforce them if they're very broad.

271
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:37,673
But be aware that they could be there.

272
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:41,063
So let's move on to development agreements,

273
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:41,883
which I just mentioned.

274
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:46,147
This is often between a client

275
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:47,768
who is paying for development

276
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,770
and the development studio that they're hiring.

277
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,908
It's gonna come up sometimes when a publisher

278
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,930
foots the bill and it's more of a hybrid model,

279
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,591
but more often for indies, they might be hired

280
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,733
just to make some money by say, Cartoon Network.

281
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,614
They want you to make a game.

282
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:04,775
Okay, great, so why would you need

283
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:05,776
a development agreement?

284
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,458
Well, because this game could take you a year,

285
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,539
two years to make, and it's gonna ensure

286
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,240
that you get paid while you're doing that.

287
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,562
It's also gonna make sure that you know

288
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:17,003
exactly how much work you're signing up for.

289
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:21,734
This is one of the ways that studios go under.

290
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,634
First off, they get a project that ends up

291
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:25,415
taking twice as long and they don't get paid

292
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,856
a single cent more, which could sink you.

293
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:30,276
Or I've seen studios go down when they had

294
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,937
a project canceled right in the middle

295
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,537
and they had to fight to get paid

296
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:35,418
what they were already owed from that project

297
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,718
and they had to look for new work.

298
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,847
So we can avoid this.

299
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:43,290
First off, a familiar face, intellectual property rights.

300
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,453
In an agreement like this, probably the client

301
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,434
is hiring you to make the game for them.

302
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,536
So they're gonna end up owning the rights.

303
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,499
That's fine, but with two key exceptions.

304
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:58,082
First off, you don't assign these rights

305
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:03,365
until you get your final check. And that way you have leverage if they decide that they don't

306
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:08,707
want to pay you. Which can be very important practically. Another important thing that you

307
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:14,770
need to have in this section is what's called developer tools. This is an ownership right that

308
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:21,133
you have and what I would call your special sauce. So basically engines, code libraries,

309
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,315
know-how that you've developed while working on this game that you might use in your own games

310
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:27,276
in the future or in future projects.

311
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:31,323
you want to state that the company that you're working for

312
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:33,968
doesn't get to own this. They get a license and the developer

313
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,993
keeps ownership of this. That way they can never stop you from

314
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,457
using it in the future and in fact they can't even reverse

315
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:39,978
engineer it.

316
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,466
Next, you want to know how you're getting paid. That's why

317
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,889
you're doing this, right? So you're probably going to get

318
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:50,373
paid some flat fee for the project, but you want to make

319
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,116
sure that some of that's up front. Ideally 50 percent if you

320
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,719
can swing it. And then you're going to get paid the rest in

321
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,862
milestones as you deliver the content. So first playable

322
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,263
alpha, beta, that sort of thing.

323
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,792
Make sure that there are clear terms as to when you've

324
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:05,493
delivered.

325
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,875
They can't just sit on it for three weeks and then tell you

326
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,756
they don't like it.

327
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,437
Five days.

328
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,799
And if they don't tell you, then it's deemed accepted.

329
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,081
That's the kind of thing you want.

330
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:18,286
If there's rev share, make sure we do all the same sort of

331
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:20,849
math that we did before when we talked about rev share.

332
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,491
You've got to think about those details.

333
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,129
And you also again have to think about scope of work.

334
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,491
This could be a big project.

335
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,274
You need a game design document, tech specs,

336
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,277
that list the features you're developing.

337
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,899
Not just what the features are, but how many.

338
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,963
Are you doing five levels or 50 levels?

339
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:37,964
Two character models or 20?

340
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,107
That's a big difference.

341
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,809
And to go with this section.

342
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,132
You want a section that allows for what are called change

343
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:50,174
orders, meaning if they want more stuff outside the scope,

344
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:53,616
they have to sign an agreement that says they're going to pay

345
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:54,297
you more money.

346
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,718
You tell them how much it costs.

347
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,719
And if they don't want to sign that, you

348
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,520
don't have to do it.

349
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,701
This prevents what's called scope creep.

350
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:04,123
And that can be the death of a studio, death by 1,000 cuts.

351
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,544
Clients don't understand game development.

352
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,305
They think it takes two minutes to change something.

353
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,346
Really, it takes two weeks.

354
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,407
So this protects you.

355
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,154
And likewise, you are protected by a good termination section.

356
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,015
You need to be able to get out of a bad deal

357
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,396
if someone is not paying you.

358
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,217
So you should have an ironclad right

359
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:23,540
to get out of the agreement if you have a late payment

360
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,721
and the right to claim what you're still owed.

361
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,783
Additionally, your client is probably going to want to know

362
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:32,165
if they can have the right to terminate for convenience.

363
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,287
What this means is essentially they need to stop the project

364
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,328
because match threes aren't hot anymore,

365
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:39,130
whatever they decide.

366
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,452
That's fine, but you want to make sure that you're going to

367
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:43,932
get paid a kill fee.

368
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,754
That means they're going to pay you a flat amount that you

369
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,755
agree to, or maybe all of the next milestone.

370
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:51,337
This gives you a cushion so that you're not caught with no

371
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:52,718
money when you're looking to find a new

372
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,658
project for the studio.

373
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,959
And finally, I told you you'd see reps and warranties again.

374
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,501
They're definitely going to make sure that you promise the

375
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,184
whole game you deliver is free of infringing material.

376
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:05,506
And for that to be true, you've got to make sure that

377
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,568
you've signed all those work for hire agreements.

378
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,610
They're also going to make sure that you don't have any

379
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,092
Easter eggs hidden in the game.

380
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:15,514
They do not like hidden features ever since the GTA 3

381
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:16,775
hot coffee issue.

382
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:21,519
So make sure that you disclose this, because you could be on

383
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,860
the hook if there's liability there.

384
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:27,973
So some practical concerns about development agreements.

385
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,215
If you're not getting paid, don't wait.

386
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:31,956
Contracts don't enforce themselves.

387
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,236
You need to speak up for yourself

388
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,037
and assert the rights you have.

389
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,399
So give them notice of breach

390
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,900
as soon as they have a late payment.

391
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,461
Stop working, don't do work for free.

392
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,882
And if it's the last payment,

393
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:44,923
don't hand over the code

394
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:48,505
until they've given you that final check.

395
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:52,387
To politely paraphrase one of my fellow lawyers,

396
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,207
F you, pay me.

397
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,926
So let's move on to publishing agreements, which I'm sure

398
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:57,987
you're all familiar with.

399
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:00,949
It's between a publisher and a developer

400
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:01,749
with respect to a game.

401
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:07,173
These come up basically if the publisher's funded development,

402
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,394
which is sort of the old school AAA model.

403
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,235
You still see that.

404
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:11,696
And then it's more of a development

405
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,676
publishing agreement.

406
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:16,739
But a lot of indies end up with a mostly finished game.

407
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:19,080
And they need a publisher just for things like distribution

408
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,582
or marketing or help with QA and that sort of thing.

409
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,685
So why do we care about a publishing agreement?

410
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:28,247
Well, if you have a publishing deal,

411
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,971
you want to define how broad the publisher's license is,

412
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,573
how you're getting paid on your game,

413
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:36,134
because it's your game,

414
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:39,818
and what exactly the publisher's actually doing for you.

415
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,811
These can easily get scary.

416
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,953
Games can get stuck in limbo with a publisher

417
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:47,774
that doesn't care about them and no way to get out.

418
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,395
I have had, for example, two clients who both came to me

419
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:52,616
wanting to get out of publishing deals

420
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,177
with the same publisher.

421
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,319
One of them got out, I sent a single email, took one day.

422
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,840
The other one, it took months and they had to pay a lot.

423
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,741
And the difference was a single sentence

424
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,602
that was in the termination section.

425
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,559
So, let's make sure we know which terms to look out for.

426
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,828
By now, I think you can all guess what is coming first.

427
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:14,385
IP rights.

428
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,967
You want to make sure, A, that you're not assigning

429
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:17,868
the rights to your game.

430
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,510
So if you're assigning the copyright, that means you've

431
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,870
sold the game.

432
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,751
They own it now.

433
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,833
And also make sure there aren't any sort of gotchas

434
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,476
where if you're late, they suddenly own your game.

435
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:29,858
But if it's just a license for them to sell your game,

436
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,020
that's not good enough to say it's a license.

437
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,402
You need to know a lot of things about how broad this is.

438
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:37,484
So first, how long does that license last?

439
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,105
Forever?

440
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:38,525
One year?

441
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,669
How broad is it geographically?

442
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,831
You may not want the same publisher in China that you

443
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,712
have in the EU.

444
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:46,894
They may have different connections.

445
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:50,718
And then you need to know which platforms it covers.

446
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:53,061
Does your publisher know anything about mobile?

447
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,523
Then why are they entitled to publish you on mobile?

448
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:57,645
And finally, and this is huge.

449
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,008
Which products is it covering?

450
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,571
Is it just your game?

451
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:04,935
Or are we talking about sequels, prequels, DLC?

452
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,018
Or maybe we're even talking about games that you make

453
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,281
later that have nothing to do with this game.

454
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,065
I have seen all of that sneak its way into the IP right

455
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,827
section, so have a close look at that.

456
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:17,638
Also have a close look at how you are getting paid.

457
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,340
Normally, this is done in a publishing agreement as

458
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,001
revenue share.

459
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:25,984
You'll see 30-70 in favor of the developer as the standard.

460
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,625
I don't buy that as a standard.

461
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,067
I think that you should argue for every percentage point,

462
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,949
and that they should justify what they're doing for you.

463
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,431
But as it's going to be revenue share, you need to

464
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:38,472
think about all the things we talked about before.

465
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,473
But you also need to consider one additional key point, which

466
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,694
is recoupable expenses.

467
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:45,434
So your publisher may say, hey, we're

468
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,855
going to give you an advance to finish the game.

469
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,496
We're going to spend x thousand dollars on marketing.

470
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:51,396
Great.

471
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:54,077
But if those are listed as recoupable expenses,

472
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:57,198
it means they're going to get paid back before you see a cent.

473
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:59,578
So now your 30-70 split is as, you know.

474
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,962
is 100 zero percent split in their favor and you don't see

475
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:07,344
money for a while. You can negotiate this and you can make

476
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:12,769
sure you know which things are recoupable. Next, make sure the

477
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,071
publisher is actually promising to do specific things. I see

478
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:19,614
this all the time. It drives me nuts. The developer's

479
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:24,238
obligation section is like one sentence that says we're going

480
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:25,279
to, you know,

481
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:28,101
publish and promote the game. That doesn't tell you anything.

482
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,844
They should be telling you how much money they're going to

483
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,605
spend on marketing. And if they're not going to tell you

484
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,168
that, they should be delivering a detailed marketing plan that

485
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:38,070
you have approval rights over. They should be telling you

486
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,032
things like are they going to be flying you to GDC in packs? Are

487
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:44,035
they going to put you in the booth? Are they going to pay for

488
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,557
that? How often are they going to put you on the website? You

489
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,799
need to know these things. They should be promising specific

490
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,081
stuff. Because you're giving them your game and they're

491
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:51,382
taking a cut.

492
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,952
And finally, if they're not doing a good job,

493
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,512
you need an escape hatch.

494
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:58,533
The termination clause that I talked about before.

495
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,414
Ideally, you want the ability to walk away

496
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:01,234
with 30 days notice.

497
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,035
But if they're not okay with that,

498
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:06,536
at least limit the time that they have this license for.

499
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,738
Try them out for a year and then renegotiate.

500
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,298
Or you could ask them to guarantee

501
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:12,819
a certain amount of revenue per year.

502
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:13,979
They said they'll make it a hit.

503
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,520
If they can't do a good job, then kick them to the curb.

504
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,501
They shouldn't be your publisher.

505
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,181
Finally, some practical concerns.

506
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:21,862
It's not 1993.

507
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:24,384
You don't need a publisher.

508
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,185
But if you do have a publishing arrangement, you

509
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,527
definitely need a contract.

510
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:34,110
And you need to make sure that they earn their percentage and

511
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,871
get out if you're not happy.

512
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:38,833
Our final contract today, End User License Agreements, or

513
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,475
EULAs, this is between a developer and your players.

514
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:49,060
You need to have it in place before anyone downloads and installs or uses your game,

515
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:55,404
and that includes your beta testers. And look, I know that nobody cares about EULAs. You

516
00:21:55,404 --> 00:22:00,728
basically have the same opinion as the Doom guy has of expository dialogue. Get out of

517
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:06,132
my way, let's get going. But these are important because they're the only way you're going

518
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:10,355
to impose legal obligations on your players with respect to your game. And that's the

519
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:13,317
way that you're able to control what liability you might have.

520
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:22,270
They can easily get scary. Users can and do sue game developers and publishers, as famously happened with Linden Labs and Second Life.

521
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:26,508
So what do we put in one of these things that nobody reads?

522
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,269
Well, first off, it's a license agreement.

523
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:29,969
It's not a sale.

524
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,990
You're not selling a copy of the game.

525
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,750
You are selling a license to use it as long as they play by

526
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,050
the rules.

527
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,531
You can then set some of those rules.

528
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:40,811
You need to make sure that players aren't doing things

529
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:46,393
like uploading malicious code, hacking, impersonating the

530
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:48,713
server, doing hate speech, griefing people.

531
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,373
All of these can be laid out in your EULA.

532
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:54,859
It's also a good place to talk about IP rights.

533
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:57,740
Make sure you know and that they know

534
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,621
that the developer owns the game.

535
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:03,443
If they don't have a license to steal your stuff.

536
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:06,524
But you might want to let them use it for machinima

537
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,385
or for streaming and that's fine,

538
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,146
but you need to be able to impose rules

539
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:12,407
so that you can stop it if they're doing something

540
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:13,768
that's offensive with your game.

541
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:17,764
Likewise, if your game involves user-generated content,

542
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:20,406
as many games do, either people uploading things that are

543
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:23,848
their own or creating within the game, you've got to think

544
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:24,809
about two things.

545
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,890
One, wrap some warranties again.

546
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,631
Make sure they promise that they're not uploading

547
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,492
copyrighted material.

548
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,353
You don't want to be on the hook for that.

549
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:34,895
And two, you should have a think about whether the

550
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:37,257
company owns what they create or the player owns it.

551
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:40,139
If the player owns it, great.

552
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:40,339
But.

553
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,748
you want to make sure the developer has a right to use it,

554
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,750
because it's going to be on their servers.

555
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,873
You might want to use it for things like future development

556
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:49,515
or marketing campaigns.

557
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,017
So you should have that license in there.

558
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:55,500
Likewise, if you have virtual items or currency in your game,

559
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,242
it needs to be crystal clear

560
00:23:57,242 --> 00:24:00,164
that these are not real property.

561
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:02,847
They only exist in these people's accounts

562
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:04,748
and you can delete them

563
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:06,430
if they break the terms of the license.

564
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,251
Sorry, not sorry.

565
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:12,309
Okay. Finally, or penultimately, you might want to put age

566
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,471
restrictions in if your game has adult content or if there are

567
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,093
privacy concerns as we talked about last year in the 101. And

568
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:22,696
lastly, this is the place where you limit your liability. You

569
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:26,139
need to disclaim certain things. Limit how much you can be sued

570
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,780
for. Explain that you're not guaranteeing anything about the

571
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,362
game, that it's going to be the best game ever, that multiplayer

572
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,644
is always available, that the servers will be eternal, that

573
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:34,084
sort of thing.

574
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:39,321
And of course, you really need to address zombies, the most

575
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,422
important part of the EULA.

576
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:44,066
What happens if organized civilization collapses due to

577
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,147
a zombie infestation?

578
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:47,750
Well, I would ask that you look at the Amazon web service

579
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,072
terms for lumberyard for a good example

580
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,213
of how to handle this.

581
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:52,415
This is real.

582
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,801
So finally, some practical concerns on EULAs.

583
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:59,702
Third parties like Apple and Steam will require you

584
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:01,322
to put certain language in your EULA

585
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:04,323
and forbid you from having certain things.

586
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:08,244
And lastly, make sure that they actually click through.

587
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,424
I know, I know, crazy.

588
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,705
Some people don't read the EULA, insane.

589
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:16,046
But you need to be able to show that they clicked I accept

590
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:16,986
each time that you update it,

591
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:19,207
because that could be a barrier to enforcing it

592
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:19,947
if there's a dispute.

593
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,164
So, we've reached the end here.

594
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,205
What have we learned?

595
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,125
Well, I need a time machine so I can advise

596
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,586
my six-year-old self not to sign this contract

597
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:31,027
that my brother provided me with.

598
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:32,848
And in all seriousness though,

599
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,509
if I leave you with one thing,

600
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,510
don't cut corners on contracts.

601
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,371
I know it seems like that's something that's for later,

602
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:44,872
but it is so much cheaper to get this taken care of

603
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:48,474
in advance than to deal with a rolling dumpster fire later,

604
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:50,795
which basically might not be able to be fixed.

605
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,773
I want to thank my paralegal for all his help.

606
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:57,175
And with that, we're at the end.

607
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:58,797
I'd be happy to take some questions now

608
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,339
and in the spillover room,

609
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:02,801
and please make sure to fill out your session evaluations.

610
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,063
Thank you very much.

611
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:18,162
Really quick, on behalf of a friend of mine

612
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,503
who's starting something new,

613
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:21,764
better to have a verbal agreement

614
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,325
or to scratch things on a piece of paper

615
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:25,286
if you can't afford a lawyer?

616
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:28,328
It's definitely better, I mean,

617
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:30,889
the answer is it's better to talk to a lawyer,

618
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,291
but to the extent you can think through

619
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,692
some of the things I talked about

620
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:38,993
and try to put it in writing,

621
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:41,274
that's always gonna be better

622
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:43,976
as long as you've thought through that writing.

623
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:44,356
Because...

624
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,858
If it's an oral agreement, you're just not going to remember.

625
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,218
Both sides will think they remember,

626
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,519
and they'll remember different things.

627
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,762
But there's a lot that people don't think about.

628
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:57,925
So yeah, better to have it in writing, but much, much better

629
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,206
to have a formal contract.

630
00:26:59,206 --> 00:26:59,706
Yeah.

631
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:02,007
So if you get rid of a contractor

632
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:05,710
before you even finish signing the contract phase,

633
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,432
but they've actually done one round, which you don't use,

634
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:11,133
can they later come back and make a claim?

635
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,353
So, well first off, anyone can make a claim.

636
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:19,135
No, and that's not just a technical point,

637
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,736
because I've dealt with situations

638
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:23,178
where people who basically have no legal rights

639
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:24,078
make a stink, right?

640
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,280
And those practical problems are real.

641
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,302
They cost time and headache and money,

642
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:30,944
but you're gonna make it less likely

643
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,726
that they come back angry if there was an agreement,

644
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,727
because then they can look at it and be like,

645
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:36,408
oh right, I don't own this.

646
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:38,930
You can always try and fix it retroactively.

647
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,471
I mean, basically what's happening is

648
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:41,992
if people work without a contract.

649
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:47,535
you're taking on risk that they might become angry. If you don't use any of the stuff that

650
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:52,498
they created, you're probably fine, but there's always the chance that something else that's in

651
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:56,241
there was inspired by it and they'll make an argument that it's a derivative work, so it's

652
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,601
better just to have the contracts. Yeah.

653
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:04,045
For enforcing the EULAs, is it sufficient to just show that the code or that the process

654
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:09,349
requires them to click through the EULA or is there some kind of record that needs to be

655
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:09,889
maintained?

656
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,478
I just realized I'm supposed to repeat the question.

657
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:15,983
So the question was, for making the EULA enforceable,

658
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:18,707
is it good enough to basically just show that there's code

659
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:21,131
and that you have a flag that resets

660
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,094
when it's a new version?

661
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,377
Or do you need to really show that they clicked?

662
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:30,839
I think that, so this is mostly going to come up

663
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,801
if you're actually in litigation.

664
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:35,004
The only time it's really going to matter

665
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,226
is if a judge is deciding, is this an enforceable contract?

666
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:39,308
And the reason that there's an issue here

667
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,751
is that normal contracts, you sign between two parties,

668
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,793
so you can show they talked about it and then they signed.

669
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,936
A EULA is kind of a take it or leave it,

670
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:48,218
and so that's already on thin ice, legally speaking.

671
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,760
So you really want to make it clear that there was no way they installed this without being

672
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,443
aware of it and making it clear that you're supposed to agree. In fact, at the top of

673
00:28:57,443 --> 00:29:02,405
the EULA, there's usually really bold text just to double check to say, this is a license

674
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:06,587
you don't own the game, don't install it if you don't agree. So that you can argue that

675
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:11,549
even someone who just kind of looked at it has to have known. There was no way they could

676
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,310
have avoided that with their eyeballs. That's what you want to be able to show.

677
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,730
Thanks.

678
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:14,850
Yeah.

679
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,613
Okay, so I'm a freelancer and I sign contracts all the time,

680
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:21,415
but I never write them myself.

681
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:24,017
And the truth is I wouldn't know what to write

682
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:25,478
if I had to start one myself.

683
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:28,640
So the question is, is there any resources

684
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,522
or like any templates, any place that it's like,

685
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,224
if I had to start a contract myself, I have a guide.

686
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,934
So the question was, if you're a contractor

687
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,236
and you need resources to figure out

688
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,398
how to approach creating your own contract,

689
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,261
presumably because you don't want to go get a lawyer,

690
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:48,504
don't have time, what are those resources?

691
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,406
That's a tough question for me,

692
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:52,508
because I'm torn between wanting everyone

693
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:56,411
to do the right thing and have these contracts in place,

694
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:56,491
but

695
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,953
you can screw them up if you kind of do a hack job of them.

696
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:03,774
I'm not going to lie, of course there are people post

697
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:07,875
contracts online all the time. Some of these sites are better.

698
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:11,036
If there is something that actually has comments on it that

699
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,278
explains what's going on and it looks relatively professional,

700
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,339
that's probably less sketchy. But I don't want to tell you to

701
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,260
use stuff off the internet. It's easy to become a franking

702
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,600
contract. And a lot of my worst

703
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,943
scenarios that I've had to deal with come from,

704
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,985
oh, we've got a contract, and then I look at it,

705
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:30,348
and it's, you know, it doesn't even apply

706
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,670
to the situation they're using it in,

707
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,273
and so it actually makes both sides think

708
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:35,534
that they totally have rights that they don't.

709
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:35,574
So.

710
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,012
I don't have a clean answer for you there, unfortunately.

711
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,055
OK, so is your suggestion just a lawyer, basically?

712
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:44,357
Yeah, if you can get a lawyer.

713
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,159
Again, it's not like you're going

714
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,942
to have to have them draft it from scratch every time.

715
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:50,984
When I do a work for hire agreement for a studio,

716
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:54,548
it's not going to be like I spend two hours every time.

717
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,589
They're going to get a form.

718
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,251
you know, put the settings the way they like it,

719
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,232
and then slight tweaks depending on

720
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,893
how they're gonna pay different people.

721
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,835
But it pays, if you do a lot of work,

722
00:31:03,835 --> 00:31:06,076
it pays to get a form once,

723
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:07,437
where you've talked to a lawyer and said,

724
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,578
look, here's what I want, here's the protections I want,

725
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,879
what should I be thinking about?

726
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,980
And then you can use that going forward, right?

727
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,780
And that's sort of a tool,

728
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,241
it's like buying a copy of Photoshop

729
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,062
or something like that, right?

730
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:17,842
Okay, thank you very much.

731
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:18,403
Yeah, no worries.

732
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,357
The whole get a lawyer thing makes a ton of sense for all the contract work if we're just a small

733
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:30,944
Studio for the EULA is that something that's a lot more approachable from like a template or you know hey

734
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:33,928
This is what everyone on Steam does sure so

735
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:40,201
The chances that you're going to have a large litigation based

736
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:43,263
on your game, well, it depends on what the game is

737
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:45,845
and how big it is and what the features are, right?

738
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:49,067
If it's multiplayer and there's all this virtual currency

739
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,168
and people are putting in micropayments,

740
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:54,271
you can see there's probably a lot more risk than if it's

741
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:56,692
this couch co-op game.

742
00:31:57,472 --> 00:32:02,294
rule that applies to all of this. Obviously scale what you can do to your budget. And

743
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:08,276
EULAs, yeah, there are some fairly just cut and dry very simple EULAs. The biggest thing

744
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:14,238
is just have the limitations on liability. Make clear that it's a license. All that other

745
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:17,680
stuff I talked about, though, you should think about it if your game has those features.

746
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,981
Yeah, it's not top priority.

747
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,643
If you're a small studio, top priority is having those work

748
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:25,245
for hire agreements, making sure you own the IP, and not

749
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:28,107
signing random publishing agreements without reading

750
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:28,347
them.

751
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,229
But all of it's important.

752
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:31,150
It's just, yeah.

753
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,190
There's triage.

754
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,992
Yeah, Yule is probably not as important if

755
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:34,712
your game's simple.

756
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:35,493
Thanks.

757
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,688
The whole idea that these things are not magic

758
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,909
and you need a lawyer sounds great,

759
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:50,351
but how do I find a good lawyer who can respect

760
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:53,313
an indie's budget and actually know something about games?

761
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:56,175
Sure, so the question was, it sounds great to say

762
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,076
contracts aren't magical, get a lawyer,

763
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,258
but what do you do on an indie budget

764
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:02,939
to find a lawyer that understands that indies

765
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,161
don't just have piles of money, to paraphrase.

766
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:10,284
So two things, one I would say that

767
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:14,461
As far as them not enforcing themselves,

768
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,243
some of that advice is actually just about

769
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:17,785
once you have the contract,

770
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:21,388
remember to stick up for your rights that you have.

771
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:25,653
And as far as finding a lawyer that will respect

772
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,455
the fact that you're an Indy,

773
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,077
I would talk to them.

774
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,638
I do initial consultations.

775
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,140
I think most other attorneys do things like that.

776
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,941
I would ask them hard questions and say,

777
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,902
look, we're an indie, are you okay with this?

778
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:40,183
Are you flexible?

779
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:40,784
That sort of thing.

780
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:42,445
And make sure they understand the game industry

781
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:45,006
and they're not just like sort of a general contract lawyer.

782
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,108
So I maybe don't spend as much time with lawyers as you do.

783
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,069
Where would I find them?

784
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,801
Well, I am one.

785
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,462
So you found one.

786
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:56,983
Is it good to have someone local to where you live,

787
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:58,004
though, so you can meet in person?

788
00:33:58,004 --> 00:33:58,984
Sure.

789
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:01,585
So there are a mix of topics.

790
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:04,286
The question was, is it good to have someone local?

791
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:05,087
To what extent do you need that?

792
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:06,588
And where do you find them?

793
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:12,872
Right, so as far as finding them, I would say Google.

794
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:16,454
Most attorneys are going to put their name out there

795
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,955
and advertise what they work on

796
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,496
and what their practice area is.

797
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:22,258
As far as locality, there are some,

798
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:25,721
lawyers in the US anyway are licensed to specific states,

799
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,882
but a lot of what I talked about

800
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,264
is general principles of contract law.

801
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:32,866
There might be small differences between states,

802
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:33,326
but.

803
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,727
a work for hire agreement's gonna look the same

804
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:37,908
in almost every state.

805
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,809
And things like IP are federal law.

806
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,970
So if you're forming a business though,

807
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,290
probably get a local business lawyer.

808
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,211
You know, you don't have to,

809
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,291
you probably don't want to use someone

810
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,552
from a different state.

811
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,033
Okay, I swear this is my last one.

812
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:48,253
Yes.

813
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,894
Are there like professional organizations maybe

814
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:53,655
that specialize in games and indie game development?

815
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:54,796
Like, is there a place I can go?

816
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:58,077
Because I have tried Google and even Bing.

817
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,798
Like, I've tried many search engines.

818
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,158
What?

819
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:03,043
And I still don't have a great answer.

820
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:03,744
AltaVista perhaps?

821
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:04,185
HotBot?

822
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:04,425
Excuse me?

823
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:13,377
Ask friends in other studios. I get whatever it is all the time.

824
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,939
Yeah, and I would say that, I mean,

825
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,982
I would say, normally the answer would be

826
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,484
go to the bar association, but

827
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:22,755
They don't really know a lot of people who do what I do.

828
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:26,116
The truth is there should be more of us for the game

829
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,077
industry given its size.

830
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:30,858
But yeah, I would ask around if there's any kind of like the

831
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,578
local IGDA might have connections.

832
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,259
I know I'm involved in that.

833
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:37,060
I'm involved in an organization that Indies work

834
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,601
with called PlayCrafting that's in New York.

835
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:42,782
So like lawyers, if they're in the industry, they're going to

836
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:45,023
be enmeshed with the developer community.

837
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,043
So you can ask through that.

838
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:50,753
Sure, okay, we have time for one more

839
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:52,233
and then I'll take the rest and the spillover.

840
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:58,294
Hello, you briefly mentioned like independent contractor

841
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,835
versus employee classification issues and you've said it was

842
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:01,615
Very briefly.

843
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:04,036
And you said it was kind of outside your wheelhouse.

844
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,777
Who would you talk to in more detail about that?

845
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:08,377
What kind of person am I looking for?

846
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:08,737
Sure, so.

847
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:10,966
Easy two answers.

848
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,468
One, talk to your accountant, a tax person,

849
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:14,949
someone who understands tax.

850
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:17,291
Could be a tax attorney or just like a CPA.

851
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:19,512
And businesses definitely need a tax person.

852
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:23,916
Two, I just want to note a tiny bit more detail.

853
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:28,199
It matters, the difference for tax purposes.

854
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,531
This contract cannot magically make them

855
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,892
an independent contractor.

856
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,952
A lot of indies want to classify them

857
00:36:34,952 --> 00:36:36,093
because if they're an employee,

858
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,633
it means that there's other obligations,

859
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:38,974
paying taxes, that sort of thing.

860
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,495
The fact that you write,

861
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:42,735
this person is definitely an independent contractor,

862
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,536
doesn't naturally make it so.

863
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,556
There's a lot of things,

864
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:47,077
so basically the IRS is gonna say,

865
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:48,177
okay, that's nice to know.

866
00:36:48,177 --> 00:36:49,218
I'll take that into consideration,

867
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:51,419
but I'm gonna look at these six other things.

868
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,559
Does it look like you're treating them that way?

869
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,160
So just be aware of that

870
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,681
and definitely talk to an accountant.

871
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,601
Okay, all right, so we'll.

872
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:04,011
CPA or tax attorney. Someone who knows tax. Thank you very much.

873
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,253
I'm happy to go to the spillover room.
