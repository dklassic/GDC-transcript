00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:10,959
Hey everyone, my name is Mandy Moreland and thank you for coming to my GDC talk,

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,881
The Subtle Art of Not Making VFX.

3
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:23,968
You know, during your time here at this virtual GDC, there will be plenty of presentations you can go to about, you know, new techniques or new hardware or new software that will push the industry forward.

4
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:33,415
But during my presentation, we're going to talk a little bit about skills that you can develop, specifically as VFX artists, that will, you know, last you for years to come.

5
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:34,476
I hope this is useful.

6
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:36,990
10 years from now as they are today.

7
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,932
Before we dive into that, a little bit about myself.

8
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:43,013
As I said, my name is Mandy Moreland.

9
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,894
I use she, her pronouns.

10
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,056
And for those that don't see me or can't see me,

11
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:51,598
I'm a white woman with dark brown hair, brown eyes,

12
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:53,999
and I'm wearing a green sweater today.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,241
I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida.

14
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,661
I got my bachelor's in physics

15
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,902
from Florida State University.

16
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,277
and continued my education and got my Master's of Fine Arts

17
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,458
in Digital Production Arts from Clemson University.

18
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:10,420
I began my career as a VFX artist in animated films

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,901
before transitioning in 2015 to games,

20
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,983
where I've been working since at The Coalition.

21
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,265
During my tenure here, I've worked on Gears of War 4,

22
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,466
Gears 5, Gears Tactics,

23
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:24,268
and our recent released Hivebusters DLC.

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,791
And across all these, I've primarily worked on level VFX,

25
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,512
but I've also dabbled in multiplayer

26
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,613
and in cinematic VFX as well.

27
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:38,474
Yeah.

28
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:41,034
So what are we going to talk about today?

29
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:45,615
As I sort of preface, this talk will dig into what some people

30
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,696
call soft skills, but skills that you can kind of take

31
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,977
with you as a VFX artist that won't.

32
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,184
you know, ever be outdated or overwritten.

33
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,446
They are skills that you can, you know, continue to grow

34
00:01:57,506 --> 00:02:00,708
and that will make you as an artist and a developer,

35
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:02,630
you know, a better person as well.

36
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,533
So we're gonna talk about this in two sort of categories.

37
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,675
And the first is gonna be this idea

38
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,236
of building intention in the workplace.

39
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,640
And this is sometimes called mindfulness,

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,921
building mindfulness in the workplace.

41
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,903
But I prefer the word intention

42
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,905
and we're gonna, we'll discuss a little bit why.

43
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,897
And then we're going to talk about how to own and embrace failure.

44
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:28,719
So first, when we talk about building intention in the workplace,

45
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:32,601
what I mean by this is being conscious of the actions you make

46
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:36,423
and doing so intentionally, you know, the decisions you make, doing so with intention

47
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,424
and primarily this idea of working with empathy.

48
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:43,886
And what I mean when I say this is seeing your fellow co-worker

49
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,008
as a valuable human being also in this cycle with you.

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,410
and being cognizant of how your actions can affect them

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,131
and their actions can affect you,

52
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,171
and having empathy for them.

53
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,232
We're gonna do this by talking about

54
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,712
how to build communication within your team

55
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:00,992
and across other disciplines,

56
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,433
and also how to foster collaboration

57
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,653
between your team and other disciplines.

58
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:09,734
And then second, we're gonna dig into this idea of failure

59
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,154
and specifically how to embrace it.

60
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:15,855
We're gonna talk about why we might be afraid of failure.

61
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:22,153
And then we're going to learn how we can kind of change our mindset about it to use it to our advantage instead.

62
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:27,556
Now, you might be asking yourself, why does any of this even matter?

63
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:30,378
You know, I'm a VFX artist or I'm a game developer.

64
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:34,381
All that matters is I do my job, you know, and at the end of the day, the game gets shipped.

65
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:43,767
But I think the clearest example of why this matters is if we look at, you know, what a production pipeline actually looks like.

66
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:43,967
So.

67
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:47,189
In an ideal world, your production might look something like this.

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,312
You start out in the ideation or concept phase.

69
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,414
These sort of bounce back and forth.

70
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:53,535
You have an idea for a game.

71
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:54,556
It goes into concept.

72
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,898
You know, it gets fleshed out a little bit and shaken out.

73
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:00,941
And then when it feels like that idea has strong enough legs to stand on,

74
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:03,623
then it moves into this block-in and design phase.

75
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:08,127
This is where you will design, like, your animation,

76
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:12,271
your mechanics, your systems, your, you know, combat or your gameplay.

77
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,768
maybe block in your levels at this point in time.

78
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,510
But eventually you feel like, okay, this is good.

79
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,691
We have an idea that's working, it feels great,

80
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,192
feels like it has a lot of potential.

81
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,514
And then you move into sort of the fleshing out phase.

82
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,576
You send it to level art and environment starts building,

83
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:31,577
you know, your sets and modeling either characters

84
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:34,899
or, you know, the set pieces and the worlds

85
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,100
that you're gonna be playing in.

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,942
And then when, you know, that's all done and people love it

87
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:40,302
and you're like,

88
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,984
you know, because this is perfect in an ideal world,

89
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,084
you've hit all your deadlines.

90
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,666
It goes into sort of the art phase,

91
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,627
the meat and potatoes phase of lighting VFX and audio.

92
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,169
You know, you light your levels and they're beautiful.

93
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,030
You add VFX to the weapons or the characters

94
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,512
or the monsters, you add audio in and everything's great.

95
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:00,532
Everybody's happy.

96
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:01,553
It's a perfect game.

97
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:03,213
Everything's shaping up right on time.

98
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,852
It goes into QA, and because you did everything perfectly up to this point, QA tells you there's no bugs,

99
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:16,274
or maybe there's just a few bugs, but they're super easy to fix, and eventually, you pass your game off to cert, and then you ship.

100
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:24,516
Now, if there's any producers in the audience, or really anybody who's worked on a production ever,

101
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,937
you know that this isn't even remotely close to what happens.

102
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:32,078
This is the ideal, this is what everybody wants it to be, but it's not even close.

103
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:33,278
Because...

104
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:37,203
you know, in reality, it probably looks a little bit more like this.

105
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,684
You still started the ideation concept.

106
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:44,324
You have an idea for a game, feels strong, it feels like it has some merit

107
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:48,285
and you start digging into it and concepting it and fleshing out

108
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:51,286
maybe what the characters are going to be or what the story is going to be.

109
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:54,026
Then at some point in time, you just decide, nope,

110
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:56,367
that idea is not the one we want to go with.

111
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:59,648
Maybe it doesn't align with, you know, your studio's

112
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:04,347
culture or the IP that you're trying to flesh out,

113
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:08,070
or maybe it just doesn't really like feel strong. You know,

114
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,833
maybe it doesn't feel like it's the type of story that needs to be told right

115
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:14,557
now. So you scrap that idea, start all over with idea number two,

116
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:17,960
go through concept. Now you've sort of learned from the first idea,

117
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,984
you've learned how to build on this and you feel like, okay, this idea has.

118
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,328
has some strength behind it, I think we can really make a game for it.

119
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:28,711
So you move into the build-in, or the block-in in the design phase,

120
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,594
start building everything out, your characters, your animation, your mechanics,

121
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:36,558
all that sort of stuff. And maybe halfway through that, or some part way through that,

122
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:41,742
you realize it's still not working. You know, this idea looks great on paper or in concept,

123
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:46,447
but once it actually starts being realized in mechanics, it just isn't really working.

124
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:47,828
So you scrap it.

125
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,739
And you go back to idea number three all over again.

126
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,560
It goes back into concept.

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,421
It starts floating back and forth.

128
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,742
It starts being really built up.

129
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:59,024
And it goes into the design phase and the blocking phase.

130
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,865
And you really feel like,

131
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,367
we've learned from the last couple ideas.

132
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,008
We know what's gonna work and what doesn't.

133
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,970
This feels like the market will really enjoy this.

134
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,252
This feels good for the type of studio we wanna be

135
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,653
and the type of games we wanna make.

136
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:14,955
So let's start fleshing this out.

137
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,496
Let's approve this, we'll green light it

138
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,656
and start moving it forward.

139
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,746
So you've blocked in levels, you've designed characters,

140
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,787
you've started working on maybe vehicles and guns

141
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:28,368
or weaponry, and you start moving into the level art

142
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,148
and environment phase, and then the rest of the art phases,

143
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,349
like lighting, VFX, and audio.

144
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:36,530
But again, if anybody's been in the production cycle before,

145
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,970
you know that this doesn't happen in one chunk.

146
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,331
What's more likely is you'll have multiple passes.

147
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:49,559
You'll have a first pass where they block in all the level art and you design the levels and you start fleshing it out with lighting and audio.

148
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:59,441
And then it starts back over and level art does a second pass on it, you know, builds up and builds up until, you know, you get through maybe first, second, third pass, maybe more.

149
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:04,762
And you know, this can take years, but eventually you do get to a point where you get to QA.

150
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:09,743
And maybe QA then tells you all the things you've done wrong and all the bugs you still have to fix.

151
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:10,203
And so you.

152
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,286
some things might have to be started all over again because it just isn't working how it was

153
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:23,591
designed and has to go all the way back to the beginning. But after many years, after many,

154
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:29,056
many nights and days working on this, preferably not nights, but many days working on this,

155
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:35,061
you get to a point where your game is finished, it's functional, it runs,

156
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:38,224
it's as bug-free as you're going to get it, and you pass it off to cert.

157
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:45,797
insert certifies it says it's good to be produced and to ship out and you finally ship that game.

158
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:54,585
Now, why does the skills we're going to talk about these sort of empathy skills or these

159
00:08:54,625 --> 00:09:00,170
communication skills, why does it matter for all of this? And at the bare like bones of it is that

160
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,453
flexibility is necessary. It's not just so nice to have, you know, we saw that production cycle

161
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:05,875
and it's super complicated.

162
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:12,175
And VFX comes at a certain, like a fairly late portion of that very complicated cycle.

163
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:17,138
And so it's likely that things are going to change frequently before they ever get to you.

164
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:22,260
And so being flexible and being agile and being able to kind of pivot when something

165
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,422
changes is a necessary tool.

166
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,522
It's not just so nice to have.

167
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:30,665
And then specifically for VFX artists, I think this is even more important because.

168
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:37,772
VFX department and VFX artists are frequently what I consider catch-all artists or catch-all departments.

169
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:44,456
We come from very different backgrounds most of the time, you know, from UI or environments or programming,

170
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,117
or like me, where you come from film.

171
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:52,501
And so more often than not, you'll probably be asked to do things that are a little bit outside of your area of expertise, you know,

172
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,564
or you'll be challenged with something that, you know, because you have...

173
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,227
a variety of background experience

174
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,928
isn't what you would normally work on.

175
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,129
You know, it's not an effect that you would normally ask

176
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,330
or you're being requested to make a system

177
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,690
that you wouldn't have normally done.

178
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,312
And so I think perhaps more than other departments,

179
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,133
VFX has to be extra flexible.

180
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:16,974
We have to be extra agile to be able to handle

181
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,995
all the different requests that might come down to us

182
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:20,356
through the pipe.

183
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:25,118
And there are so many pitfalls

184
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:26,558
in that complicated production.

185
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:30,946
that to be efficient and to make sure that we release the game on time,

186
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,008
and that it's a good game that you release,

187
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,249
you have to be able to work together.

188
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:37,491
And so when we talk about these ideas of communication and collaboration,

189
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:40,433
you know, the end goal of all that is that you just work better

190
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:43,495
with your fellow peers and your other colleagues.

191
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:47,138
And so to be efficient, you have to be able to do that.

192
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,581
And then, as I said, that process is complicated enough

193
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:56,165
that your goal should be to make yourself less difficult in that process.

194
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,370
This is the idea of having empathy for the people that you're working with.

195
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,791
You know, you want their lives to be good when they're making the game

196
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,932
and you want their job to be easier because you want your job to be easier, too.

197
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:12,772
And the more you can kind of help other people and work with other people well

198
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:15,553
and efficiently, the more happy you're going to be in this job

199
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,813
and the more happy other people are going to be as well.

200
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,014
So that's the why all this matters.

201
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:26,295
So let's dig a little bit into how we're going to start figuring this out.

202
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:31,837
So there are gonna be three main points that I discussed,

203
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,657
three main sections.

204
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:33,838
The first is communication.

205
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,780
We're gonna talk about communication within the VFX team

206
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,000
with other departments.

207
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,701
And then a very specific example of communication,

208
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,082
which is this idea of giving and receiving feedback.

209
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,783
We're gonna talk about collaboration,

210
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,365
primarily with understanding when to push

211
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:51,465
and when to step aside.

212
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,727
And as well as examining what you as a developer,

213
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:57,835
bring to the table that makes you unique.

214
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,538
And finally, we're gonna talk about this idea

215
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:01,479
of embracing failure.

216
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:04,341
We're gonna look at what it teaches us,

217
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:05,902
why we might be afraid of it,

218
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,604
and how we can embrace it instead.

219
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:11,607
All with the goal of making us a more empathetic

220
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,929
and efficient artist

221
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,351
in that crazy complicated production cycle.

222
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,654
So, communication.

223
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,917
For all three of these categories,

224
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,858
communication, collaboration, and failure,

225
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:26,673
I've grabbed definitions.

226
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:28,954
And so for communication, I grabbed noun,

227
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:31,755
a process by which information is exchanged

228
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,216
between individuals through a common system

229
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,136
of symbols, signs, or behaviors.

230
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,797
Now I picked this specific definition

231
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,638
because of this word, behaviors.

232
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,318
I think most people, when they hear communication,

233
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,639
they think of talking with someone

234
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,740
or written communication like an email or a letter.

235
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,421
But I wanna dig into this idea of

236
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:57,366
communication through behaviors and the behaviors that we model as, you know, colleagues and VFX artists.

237
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,889
And as I said, we're going to talk about it in terms of

238
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,154
communication within your VFX team, communication within other departments around you,

239
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:10,518
and specifically with regards to giving and receiving feedback.

240
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,444
So let's dig into communication within the VFX team.

241
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:22,989
Now, I acknowledge that this is probably the easier of the three sections we're going to talk

242
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:27,592
about with regards to communication, mostly because you talk to these people the most.

243
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:31,355
You know, these are the colleagues that you should be working the closest with,

244
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,337
as your fellow VFX artists. So some of these skills might be some that you already have

245
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:39,560
mastered or that you are already on the way to mastering, or they just might be,

246
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,422
they might come easier to you than things that we will talk about in the, you know,

247
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,664
cross-disciplinary one, but there's still value in talking about them.

248
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,412
So first and foremost, we'll talk a little bit about this idea of learning how to yes and others ideas.

249
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:59,433
Now, if you've ever taken an improv course, this might be familiar to you.

250
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:08,235
And the concept of this is acknowledging someone else's idea and recognizing it and building on top of it.

251
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:15,897
The more common habit that people have is to yes, but and ideas or yes, but ideas.

252
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,192
And an example of this is saying like,

253
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:22,134
oh yeah, that's a good idea, but how about we do this?

254
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,916
You know, and what that does is that invalidates

255
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,157
the person's idea that you are responding to.

256
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,559
And it sort of shuts down that line of communication

257
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,860
and then diverts it into whatever you're about to say.

258
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,361
When you yes and ideas,

259
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,243
that is a collaborative building of ideas.

260
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:41,564
You know, you're saying like, oh yeah, that's great.

261
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,245
And we could do this as well.

262
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:50,234
And it's this exercise of taking someone else's idea and collaborating on it and bringing them

263
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:58,042
along into that conversation and building up of their ideas. This is not necessarily the easiest

264
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:01,806
of the skills that we're going to talk about in this section. I don't think it comes naturally

265
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:06,290
to people most of the time, and it's something that you have to be intentional with when you do.

266
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,604
Four tips that we're going to talk about will build on this that hopefully yes, anding comes more second nature to people

267
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:20,528
Next is echoing thoughts instead of stealing them

268
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:22,469
this

269
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,313
For the most part I found that this is not done intentionally this idea of stealing others ideas

270
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:33,797
But if you can be cognizant and empathetic to the people around you

271
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:40,450
and make strides to acknowledge other people's ideas when you hear them instead of just repeating

272
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:48,633
them, then you can form a better like bond between you and that person. And what I mean when I say

273
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:54,176
this is if you hear an idea in a room, then you echo that idea by acknowledging the person that

274
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:59,859
says it and then perhaps yes-and-ing after that. As an example, if say

275
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:05,397
Hey, Karen had this great idea, you know, and I think we could do this with it as well.

276
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:10,661
That gives that person, you know, acknowledgement for their idea,

277
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:15,425
but it also still allows the communication to move forward and still allows you to collaborate

278
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,826
with that person and work with them.

279
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:22,190
Most people have probably had the experience where, you know, you've been in a room

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,033
and you've set an idea and maybe you didn't say it loud enough and it wasn't heard

281
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:27,595
or it wasn't acknowledged.

282
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,380
and 10 minutes later someone else in the room

283
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,101
says your same idea and suddenly

284
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,501
they get the acknowledgement for it

285
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,502
or they get the recognition for it.

286
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,203
And that can be really frustrating and really demoralizing

287
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:41,664
because, you know, did that person steal your idea?

288
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,185
You know, are they trying to undermine you?

289
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,546
It's not likely that they are, it's probably unintentional.

290
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:50,987
But if you as a VFX artist or just as a game developer

291
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:56,009
can model this exercise of recognizing who said the idea

292
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,029
and then echoing it.

293
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:02,689
It'll really show that one, you're invested in the people you're listening to, and two,

294
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,190
that you see the people and recognize them for the work that they're doing and not just

295
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,272
sort of taking their ideas. And you can also do this even if you're not in the same room as that

296
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:18,654
person. So, and this might be more frequently how it's done, is you'll hear an idea or you'll work

297
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:21,935
through an idea with someone at their desk and then you go off to a meeting that they're not in.

298
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:27,431
And when you then present that idea, add them, you know, give them credit for that idea. Say like,

299
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:32,133
hey, I was working with Jacob and we had this idea of doing this, you know, or, you know,

300
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:36,436
Frank had this idea and I thought it was really good and I was thinking we could do this with it

301
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:40,778
as well. And that gives them recognition for the work that they're doing and for the idea that

302
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,461
they had and shows that you care enough to acknowledge them and still want to build on that.

303
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:50,744
So echoing thoughts really kind of goes hand in hand with this yes and idea as well.

304
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:58,229
Next, this is my favorite one, is this idea of saying the silly idea, saying the dumb idea.

305
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:04,650
I'm a huge proponent of this. I don't think shame is a feeling that anybody should really have all

306
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,912
that often. And more often than not, whatever you think is a dumb idea probably isn't as dumb as you

307
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:15,393
think it is. There's probably something, some nugget of value in there that makes your idea

308
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:20,014
worthwhile, you know, to say out loud and to kind of put yourself out there.

309
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:25,669
And then hand in hand of that is to make sure you're listening to those silly ideas.

310
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:33,936
Often, as I said, it's probably not as silly as you know you think it is. Maybe it's just that

311
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:39,400
it's not communicated super well or it's said in a way that doesn't really make a lot of sense or

312
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,604
that it feels sort of silly, but if you open yourself up to listening to those ideas and

313
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:48,467
stretching those yes and muscles and being willing to sort of have

314
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,798
a conversation and communicate with your teammates,

315
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:55,263
then they'll be more comfortable saying the silly ideas

316
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:57,927
and you're more likely to get like tons and tons

317
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,589
of sort of diamonds in the rough.

318
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,673
You know, when people are nervous about saying these.

319
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,161
you know, either a technique that they want to try or some feedback that they want to give, you know,

320
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:13,265
then you're never going to hear it. And there's, there's, you don't know whether something is a

321
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:20,150
good idea until it's been said out loud. And so if you are comfortable and you model this behavior

322
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,393
being open to listening to the silly ideas, then more people will be comfortable saying those silly

323
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:25,653
ideas.

324
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:28,265
And if you are more comfortable saying those ideas

325
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,286
and model that behavior, then more people around you

326
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:35,448
would also be comfortable mirroring that behavior.

327
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,470
And so these two ideas of saying a silly idea

328
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,851
and listening to the silly idea,

329
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,671
so really go hand in hand.

330
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,234
And then finally, learn how to celebrate successes

331
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:48,595
and failures.

332
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,597
I think people are much more inclined

333
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:53,938
to celebrate successes,

334
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,278
they're much more comfortable doing that.

335
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,422
And it feels sort of second nature to do that.

336
00:19:58,023 --> 00:20:01,525
But if you can start intentionally seeking out

337
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:04,907
and celebrating where people have failed,

338
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:09,589
then they'll be more comfortable owning failure, you know?

339
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,411
And what I mean by this is,

340
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,673
it really opens up this sort of safe space.

341
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,054
That's what you're gonna be trying to build

342
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:21,696
when you do this, is you want your team members

343
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,297
to feel safe communicating ideas that maybe they didn't.

344
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:29,741
see, come to full realization, or they weren't able to work through entirely,

345
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:34,845
or maybe they tried it and failed at it, you know. And if you don't celebrate those sort of things,

346
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:40,089
you won't ever learn from them. And what this does is if you're more comfortable kind of

347
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,354
celebrating when someone doesn't do something successfully, you're building this communication

348
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:50,138
channel and opening it up so that they're more likely to ask for help or collaboration on

349
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:53,360
something, you know. If they know their team has their back.

350
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:58,673
And if they know that their team is going to support them regardless of whether they succeed or they fail,

351
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:04,339
then they're more likely to try things that they might not have tried before and to ask for help with doing that.

352
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:08,183
Especially if you can do things such as like listening to silly ideas.

353
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:13,148
If you're open and you're good on collaborating and you're open to yes anding ideas,

354
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,971
people will feel more and more comfortable on the team.

355
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:24,131
you know, making themselves uncomfortable or making themselves vulnerable by saying silly ideas or trying things they might not succeed at.

356
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:34,775
And that's what the goal of all this is, is that at the end of the day, if you can start, you know, building on some of these skills, all the rest of them will come easier.

357
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:38,676
And ultimately, you'll be a stronger team for it.

358
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,609
You know, and you don't have to do it from the top down.

359
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,730
You know, yes, Andy might be the last thing you get good at.

360
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:46,432
Maybe the first thing you do is just being open

361
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:48,133
about saying silly ideas.

362
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,774
You know, maybe you're comfortable with that sort of stuff.

363
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:53,636
Or you're really good at acknowledging who said a thing.

364
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,217
And so echoing thoughts is what you get stronger at.

365
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,299
And at the end of the day, what you'll have built

366
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,840
is this very strong team that has a really strong bond

367
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,681
between them because they trust each other

368
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,222
and they feel safe with each other.

369
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,523
It's safe to try things that they might not.

370
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:11,785
do well or safe to say silly ideas, all those sorts of things.

371
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:17,249
Now that was talking or communicating within

372
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,531
your VFX department, but now let's talk about

373
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:24,114
communication outside of your VFX room with other disciplines.

374
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,918
I do want to acknowledge that this might be difficult to do,

375
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,980
especially in this environment that we're in now where most people are

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,782
working from home. It's difficult to...

377
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,520
Do this if you're in a different building or if you have a small team that's spread out very wide.

378
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:47,382
But all the things I'm going to talk about still hold value regardless of your team distribution.

379
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:52,385
Some of these things might just take a little extra effort than they would otherwise if we

380
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:59,748
were all in our studios working together like normal. First and foremost, I always recommend

381
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:05,110
people to actually just talk to each other. Ask questions, clarify things before you start

382
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,970
working on something.

383
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,230
And when I say talk to people, I literally mean talk to them.

384
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:15,776
If you're able, go and see them at their desk, call them up on Zoom or on Teams.

385
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:20,600
Literally have a human-to-human conversation with that person.

386
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:25,685
Because you will have a much faster communication channel built

387
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:29,928
when you can have an actual human conversation with someone.

388
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,242
We're in an environment right now, this digital age that we're in, where everybody's working from home,

389
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:42,024
where it's often easier just to send a Teams message or an email, because it's just faster to do that.

390
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:46,886
But there's a lot that can be lost via text communication.

391
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,706
There's a lot of nuance that can be lost.

392
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,647
There's a lot of room for misinterpretation or miscommunication.

393
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:53,568
And there's really nothing.

394
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,570
that quite beats having a human conversation,

395
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,011
you know, that you as a person are talking with another person.

396
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:04,811
And so if you can,

397
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,692
and if the person that you are talking to is able to as well,

398
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:10,952
meaning they have the time or the energy or the focus to do it,

399
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:13,413
then I always encourage you to actually

400
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:15,213
talk to the person that you need to talk to

401
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:16,954
rather than just sending them an email.

402
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,494
Next, check in with the teams coming

403
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,815
before you and after you in the pipeline.

404
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:29,536
This sounds sort of like a, yeah, duh, of course I'm going to do that,

405
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:35,258
but the more intentional you can be in this exercise and the more effort you actually put

406
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:40,080
in doing this, you'll see kind of, you'll reap rewards very quickly from this.

407
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,942
What I mean when I say this is just talk to other departments that are coming before

408
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:50,884
and after you and sort of check in with them of where you are in the pipeline, you know,

409
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,525
do they need anything from you, do you need anything from them.

410
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:56,665
And opening up this channel will really,

411
00:24:56,685 --> 00:25:00,627
it shows empathy for them because you want to, you know,

412
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:03,529
give them the time to work on something

413
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,330
or to show that you actually care about

414
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,371
what they're working on and that you're thinking ahead.

415
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,293
And it allows you to get to know these people

416
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,495
that will be influencing your work

417
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,376
or whose work you will be influencing.

418
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,424
So for example, if you're going to need, you know, animation tags to apply your footsteps to,

419
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:29,927
or, you know, muzzle flashes or something like that, check in with the animation department

420
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:34,370
before they get working on that character animation and say, hey, you know, when that,

421
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,492
when your foot hits the ground, can you add me two tags so that when it gets to me,

422
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:42,535
I can just easily hook them up. And so not only does this.

423
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:46,906
open up communication just by like, you know, getting to know the people that you're going

424
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:51,330
to be working with. But it also shows empathy because you're giving them time to work on that

425
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:57,075
request. You know, you're showing respect for their time by giving them ample time to give

426
00:25:57,136 --> 00:26:04,202
you what you need. And so they'll be much more open to the idea of helping you get what you need,

427
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,085
but because they can then factor it into their, you know, their schedule and.

428
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:10,679
They can prioritize it against their other tasks,

429
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,361
so that by the time their work gets to you,

430
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:14,541
you'll have everything you need.

431
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,902
And this goes in the other direction as well.

432
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:19,404
Check in with audio, for example,

433
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,304
which frequently comes last in most departments,

434
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:24,046
and say, hey, do you need anything from us?

435
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,206
We have this moment.

436
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:26,227
There's gonna be explosions,

437
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:27,227
there's gonna be dust falling,

438
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,328
there's gonna be rocks collapsing.

439
00:26:28,728 --> 00:26:29,628
What do you need from us?

440
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,936
And they might be, they might say like,

441
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,797
oh, I just need to know what's going to be in it.

442
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:35,338
I don't really need anything else, you know?

443
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,120
Or, yeah, can you make me event tags?

444
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,502
Because I really need to be able to trigger some audio

445
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:42,943
off of your rock that slams against the ground.

446
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:46,946
And then that will then show them that you, you know,

447
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:49,849
you're thinking of them before your work gets to them.

448
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:52,250
And then also allows you to have ample time

449
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,831
to accommodate their requests.

450
00:26:55,522 --> 00:27:07,507
So this idea of just taking a little extra time before work begins to really check in with the departments coming around you will have an immediate result of communication between you and other disciplines.

451
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:14,010
Be flexible. We've talked about this when we were looking at the example of that, you know, the crazy.

452
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:43,742
typical production pipeline. But this is especially true when talking with and communicating, I should say, with other departments. There will always come times when things change around you both before and after in the in the production pipeline. And maybe somebody in a different department has to change how they've done something or there's somebody new that's on the team and they don't communicate the same way with you. And so being flexible in your approaches and how you maybe decide how to request things or how you approach people or how you talk to people

453
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,552
All these things will make you a better artist to work around.

454
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:50,833
If you have empathy for the people around you,

455
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:54,315
then you can be flexible to accommodate last-minute requests,

456
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,877
or accommodate feedback that you weren't expecting,

457
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,179
or to accommodate changes that other people weren't expecting either,

458
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,220
but then suddenly have a trickle-down effect.

459
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,942
This idea of being flexible, like we've said before, is a necessity.

460
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:13,065
The more you can model this behavior of being agile and being patient.

461
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:17,694
the more people will really come to appreciate it.

462
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,557
On that point, the more of these skills that you can build,

463
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:22,899
the more your colleagues will trust and rely on you.

464
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,802
For example, I'm really comfortable asking people questions.

465
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:29,404
It's not something that I've ever really struggled with.

466
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,307
I don't mind talking to people I've never met before.

467
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,249
I don't mind asking for names and introducing myself to people.

468
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,767
made it really clear that if someone has an issue

469
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:41,728
and they bring it to me,

470
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,509
I'm happy to help them find an answer for it.

471
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,770
Either I might know where that answer is

472
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,691
or that solution is,

473
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:50,212
or I'll know the person that I need to talk to

474
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:50,832
to get that.

475
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:55,134
And so by modeling these skills

476
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,375
and modeling these behaviors,

477
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:57,836
your colleagues will remember that

478
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,116
and they'll come to trust on you.

479
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:01,678
And likely they'll model them in turn,

480
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,259
you know, they'll mirror the empathy

481
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:05,520
you show to them for you.

482
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:05,600
And.

483
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:13,826
Ultimately, all of this is just to make sure that your time making this game as a game dev artist

484
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:20,950
is as enjoyable as it can be, and that you are making other people's jobs as easy and efficient

485
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:28,974
as you can. So, last section we're going to talk about is feedback. And this is a very specific

486
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,455
example of communication. And

487
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:34,984
A great way to think about feedback,

488
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,484
and this is how it was explained to me

489
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,585
by one of my art directors,

490
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:41,846
is if you think about feedback as a conversation

491
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,287
between two people or multiple people,

492
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:47,748
it isn't just someone giving you a bulleted list

493
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,048
and then walking away.

494
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:51,249
You know, it should be a conversation between you

495
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,590
and the person you were either giving feedback to

496
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,050
or receiving feedback from.

497
00:29:55,831 --> 00:29:59,232
So let's talk a little bit about skills

498
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,592
that you can build to make that better.

499
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,466
Let's look first at giving feedback.

500
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,468
Now, everybody has probably met someone

501
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,649
who is not very good at either of these,

502
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:11,850
giving or receiving feedback.

503
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,493
But if you want to make yourself a better feedback giver,

504
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,234
one of the first things that you can do

505
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,416
is being mindful of where people are coming from.

506
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:25,978
Now, this includes things such as their background,

507
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,240
their native language, their experience, and their culture.

508
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,442
And what this means is taking a step back

509
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,383
before you start giving someone feedback

510
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,665
and thinking about them as a person

511
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:36,686
and having empathy for them

512
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,047
and putting yourself in their shoes.

513
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:42,049
Is their background different than yours?

514
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,712
Do they come from a programming or technical background

515
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:47,393
while you're more art focused background?

516
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,835
Is their native language different than yours?

517
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,196
Is their culture different than yours?

518
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,138
Being mindful of where a person comes from

519
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,540
in their experience can really dictate.

520
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:01,817
you know, your approaches to how you might choose to give them feedback.

521
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:10,702
And simultaneously, once you're mindful of where people are coming from, this will really inform,

522
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:15,905
you know, your approaches. It'll make you be more flexible in your approaches to giving feedback.

523
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:22,208
So, primarily, you'll probably be given verbal feedback more often than not. If you're having

524
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,630
a conversation at someone's desk or, you know,

525
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:30,026
over a video call or something where you're just talking with the other person.

526
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:36,429
And this can be a very useful means of feedback because as we've talked about,

527
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:41,591
I recommend always talking to a person as much as you can. But if you think about it from the

528
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:46,673
person that you're giving feedback to, some things might come to mind. So they are presenting work to

529
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:51,755
you that they're trying to get feedback on while simultaneously trying to listen to the feedback

530
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:52,395
you're giving them.

531
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:57,075
memorize that feedback, maybe prioritize that feedback,

532
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,242
and still converse and collaborate

533
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:03,426
within that conversation that you're having about feedback.

534
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:04,729
And so.

535
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,691
And then if you think, you know, maybe if they have a different native language than you,

536
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:15,092
then they're also trying to translate the feedback that you're giving them and still trying

537
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,953
to remember it and all this different stuff.

538
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:20,874
And so verbal feedback can be very, very important to have that conversation,

539
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:23,814
but it might not be the only type of feedback that you give to a person.

540
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,855
You might have to then follow it up with written feedback.

541
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,976
Either maybe someone is there taking notes for the group.

542
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,677
or you send an email afterwards just saying like,

543
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:35,338
hey, these were the main pieces

544
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:36,880
that I think needed to be worked on.

545
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,502
You know, everything else was pretty good,

546
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:44,646
but this is like prioritized list of what I want worked on.

547
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:48,248
And that really helps the person, you know,

548
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,710
for one, just know what is important.

549
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:57,497
to then clarify maybe if there was some misunderstanding between the communication

550
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,942
that was given or the feedback that was given. And also sort of like a hard receipt of feedback

551
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:05,866
so that they can always go back as they're working on something and go through the list

552
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:10,090
and check off things that were completed. And then

553
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,342
You might also have to then follow that up with supporting visuals.

554
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:17,987
So this might be something like taking a screen grab of a video that you're, you know, looking at.

555
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:23,032
Or if you're trying to give feedback on color or, you know, lighting in a scene,

556
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:27,477
then you might need to do a paint over where you just grab a snip and pull it into Photoshop

557
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,899
and then paint over it really quickly to give more direct feedback.

558
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:37,952
Because there's certain information that doesn't communicate super well, or that some people have trouble understanding just any verbal or written feedback.

559
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:46,456
And so having a visual feedback to help support that or having a visual element to help support that can really go a long way to making your feedback understandable.

560
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:55,560
And then finally, if all else fails, then go back and think about why they might be struggling.

561
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,442
You know, go back to step one and be mindful of where those people are coming from.

562
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:07,461
For example, I was giving feedback to someone one time and we were at their desk and I could just sort of tell they weren't, you know, getting it.

563
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:16,327
There was they would nod along and they would say that, yes, they were understanding, but it just was clear that it wasn't really, you know, translating or getting through super well.

564
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,228
And I realized it was a translation thing.

565
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:20,850
It was that their native language is French.

566
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,630
Mine is English.

567
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:27,174
And I was using words and turn of phrases that just didn't really compute for them.

568
00:34:27,294 --> 00:34:28,695
You know, it didn't translate well for them.

569
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:35,083
And on top of that, they were trying to translate my English feedback, my quick speaking English

570
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:39,910
feedback into understandable French feedback, and there was just a disconnect there.

571
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:43,507
And so I had to make sure to follow up with written feedback.

572
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,288
And I went ahead and did just a quick bulleted list.

573
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:49,470
It took me about five minutes after the, you know, after the talk,

574
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,192
or we would just confirm it there in person.

575
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:55,214
And I would give them time to sort of write notes after the fact,

576
00:34:55,774 --> 00:35:00,417
but just making sure that they had a secondary mode of feedback really helped

577
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:03,378
them understand what we were talking about. Um,

578
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:06,580
and these can be all different things. You know, you could re you could.

579
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,024
talk to people and come to find that they have cognitive differences. Or maybe there's a cultural

580
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:16,728
difference in communication. You know, people talk differently all over the world. And so,

581
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,351
or they have, you know, different experience level than you. Maybe they're really junior,

582
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:24,996
or maybe they're very senior. And so, that might change how you talk to another person.

583
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:30,380
And so, if all else fails, if this verbal, written, or supporting feedback, visual feedback

584
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:35,876
doesn't seem to be clicking, then just take a moment to, you know, have empathy for that person

585
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:40,379
that you're working with and go back and think about where they are and put yourself in their

586
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:47,245
shoes and think about how they might be getting your feedback. And then on that point, some tips

587
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:52,729
for receiving feedback. At any one time in your career, you will probably be on both ends of the

588
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:57,473
spectrum of the, you'll be giving feedback and, you know, at different times receiving feedback.

589
00:35:58,874 --> 00:35:58,994
And

590
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,553
The one piece of advice that I kind of try and hammer in,

591
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:03,855
and it's a difficult one,

592
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,458
is just to not take feedback personally.

593
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,743
If you can remove yourself and your value for yourself

594
00:36:11,364 --> 00:36:13,787
from the feedback that you're being given,

595
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:16,831
it'll really go a long way to sort of your career

596
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:18,112
and your happiness in that career.

597
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:24,476
you as an artist have been hired to do a job and you are valuable.

598
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:28,779
And when you're giving feedback on someone on something that you've done,

599
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,161
it's not because you as a person have failed or that there is something wrong

600
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,683
with you as an artist. It's just that because it's just because the work that

601
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:39,085
you have created doesn't align with the expectation or the desires of the

602
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,946
person that you're getting feedback from.

603
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,847
So there's nothing really personal there.

604
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,410
It's just a mismatch of expectations. And so if you can remove yourself from it,

605
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,271
you know, it's better in the long run.

606
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:53,260
And this is especially important because sometimes it will be personal.

607
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,663
You know, sometimes the thing that that person says will feel like a personal slight or personal dig.

608
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:01,825
It'll feel maybe rude or offensive.

609
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:08,128
And when you can remove yourself from, you know, you remove your value from the feedback that

610
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:11,730
you're being given, you can take a moment and it's a little bit easier to step back and try

611
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,292
and understand why that feedback was given to you the way it was.

612
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:16,933
So maybe the person is just having a bad day.

613
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,075
You know, that's usually what the issue is.

614
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:20,155
Because.

615
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,332
more often than not, most people aren't trying to put you down or belittle you or anything like that.

616
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:29,195
So maybe that person is having a bad day. Maybe there's someone sick in their family or they're

617
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:33,577
having trouble at home or they just, you know, haven't slept well. They're not feeling well.

618
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:41,122
Or maybe they have a cultural difference than you. You know, something that seems rude to you

619
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:46,025
or sounds rude to you might not seem rude to them, or some habit of conversation might not be rude to them.

620
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:48,805
And so having empathy for the other person

621
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,767
and trying to put yourself in their shoes

622
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:52,268
and understand where they might be coming from

623
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,691
can really help understand why feedback was given,

624
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,633
you know, why feedback was given to you the way it was.

625
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:00,875
And it can help you not take it personally.

626
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:05,618
And sometimes just c'est la vie, that's just life.

627
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,101
You know, sometimes people just want what they want

628
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,502
and it's just your job to give it to them.

629
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,713
you have a finite amount of energy, we have a finite amount of time in the day and time to

630
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:22,656
work on a game. And so there's not, not every piece of feedback has to be, you know, a long

631
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:26,319
drawn out discussion, or it doesn't have to be something you even have to agree with. Sometimes

632
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:32,542
you just have to do the job and give someone what they want. Occasionally, it might prove to them

633
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:36,285
that what they're saying isn't actually going to work. Like if you believe that their bit of feedback

634
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,342
isn't really going to look as good as they think it is,

635
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:40,682
then sometimes you just have to give it to them

636
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:42,163
and they'll see it and it doesn't work.

637
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,763
And sometimes it just kind of doesn't matter.

638
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:45,823
Like in the grand scheme of things,

639
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,664
there's probably bigger battles to fight.

640
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:49,944
And so sometimes that's just life

641
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,444
and you just have to give the people what they want.

642
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,225
Next, definitely ask for clarity.

643
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,746
As we've said before, feedback is a conversation.

644
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,947
You know, it shouldn't just be a one-way sort of thing.

645
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:08,063
And if you're unsure about some sort of feedback that you're given, in the long run, it's better if you ask for clarity.

646
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,167
At Inspire Basics, you shouldn't be afraid to get what you need from someone.

647
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:15,370
You know, they want you to do something and you want to do that something.

648
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:22,377
And so if you're left unsure of the feedback or unclear on the feedback, then you're just wasting both your time and theirs.

649
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:23,959
And...

650
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,302
at the end of the day, it might just help that other person build their skills as well,

651
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:32,344
their feedback giving skills. For example, if they're giving you feedback that's too vague

652
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:36,866
or doesn't make a lot of sense and you tell them that and you say, hey, you know, I don't understand

653
00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:41,229
what you mean when you say that this, you know, explosion is too whimsical, then they might

654
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:46,431
realize that they have to change how they're giving feedback as well. Or, you know, if you say like,

655
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:46,651
hey,

656
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:49,293
You use this terminology that I've never heard before,

657
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:51,014
or that I don't think translates correctly.

658
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:53,796
Can you elaborate or go over it again?

659
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:58,579
And it'll help them understand that there's a divide

660
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,980
between their feedback and what you are receiving.

661
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,481
And it'll help them be better feedback givers.

662
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:08,024
And then finally, don't be afraid to yes, and ideas.

663
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:09,485
We talked about this when we were talking

664
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:11,786
about communication within the VFX team.

665
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:15,428
And this is the idea of building on other people's ideas

666
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:15,968
and their feedback.

667
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:19,152
Obviously this is dependent on where you are in the project.

668
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:23,474
You know, if you're, you know, super late in the production pipeline or, um, you

669
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:26,675
know, people are behind, it might not be the best idea to start yes, Andy and

670
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:27,135
ideas.

671
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:31,116
Um, but the more you can build off of others ideas and the feedback that you're

672
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:34,858
being given, the more it shows investment and it shows initiatives, you know, it

673
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:38,819
shows that you care about what you're working on and that you care to give this

674
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,260
other person what they want to see.

675
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,742
Um, and it, like we said before, it opens up these channels of

676
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:46,242
communication and collaboration.

677
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:52,518
So that was feedback and that was communication as a whole.

678
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:54,279
So now let's dig into collaboration.

679
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,222
And we've seen a lot of these sort of overlap

680
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:57,802
with each other.

681
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:00,485
We've seen communication build collaboration

682
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:01,926
and we've talked about how collaboration

683
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:02,767
can build communication.

684
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,750
But let's dig into collaboration specifically a little bit.

685
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,662
As before, I have a definition for it.

686
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:10,983
Collaborate, which is a verb.

687
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:14,105
And I picked this one sort of to be cheeky,

688
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:19,069
but it's to cooperate with or willingly assist an enemy of one's country,

689
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,130
especially an occupying force.

690
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,212
Now, I picked this one because,

691
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,814
as anybody who's been in a full production pipeline,

692
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:29,455
there will always come a time...

693
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:35,344
where your co-workers feel like the enemy, where either you're behind on your work or

694
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:40,806
they're behind on theirs or something is changing higher up in the pipeline and people are stressed

695
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:46,307
and when someone comes and asks you for something or requests something or is looking for help,

696
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:50,608
they feel like the enemy and they feel like they're just using up your time, the time that

697
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:55,209
is already short because of, you know, being late in the production pipeline or whatever.

698
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,290
And so...

699
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,912
This idea of building skills to collaborate means that you'll be able to cooperate with these people,

700
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:05,813
even when frustrations are high, when stress is high, and everyone feels like the enemy.

701
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:10,715
So how are we going to do this? What are some things that we can start thinking about to do

702
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:16,136
intentionally to build collaboration? First, we're going to talk a little bit about knowing when to

703
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:21,298
push and when to step aside. And then we're going to talk about looking at yourself and figuring out

704
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,918
what you, as a unique individual, bring to the table.

705
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,784
beyond your ability to complete your VFX task.

706
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:32,467
So, let's look first at knowing when to push

707
00:42:32,507 --> 00:42:33,208
and when to step aside.

708
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:39,292
And primarily, if you truly believe in something,

709
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:40,633
you should make your voice heard.

710
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,595
If you have an idea and you believe in it,

711
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:44,977
or you feel strongly in a piece of feedback,

712
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:48,019
or you think you have a solution to a problem

713
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,322
that's really important, make your voice heard,

714
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:51,942
make yourself heard.

715
00:42:52,762 --> 00:42:57,083
When the things I talk about now, especially in the section of when to step aside, it isn't just

716
00:42:57,103 --> 00:43:02,685
an exercise in being a pushover, you know, that's not what I'm encouraging. But in so if you do

717
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:06,806
truly believe in something, you should make that voice heard, you should stand behind it.

718
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:10,927
What this does mean is that if you do have a strong idea, you might need to prove it first,

719
00:43:11,107 --> 00:43:13,687
you might have to do a little extra work to get people on board,

720
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:17,968
or to prove that your idea has merit or that it can stand up and it's viable.

721
00:43:19,668 --> 00:43:23,269
And this might just require like a little extra work to do that and put behind it.

722
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,111
But again, if you do, if you do feel strongly about something,

723
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:31,552
then that might require that and you might be OK and have the energy to do that.

724
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:36,613
And finally, if you do see a problem, come with a solution.

725
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:39,574
There's really nothing more frustrating than being in a meeting

726
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:42,435
where someone comes and just drops a whole bunch of problems

727
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:45,996
that they've seen on the table and kind of like wipes their hands of it and walks out.

728
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:49,740
If you do see a problem, don't be that person.

729
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:51,621
Definitely try and come with a solution.

730
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:53,422
You know, this might mean that you have to go

731
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:56,383
and talk to people that you might not know, you know,

732
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:58,824
and see if maybe they know about the problem

733
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:00,725
or if they have a solution in mind for it.

734
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:04,727
It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the one

735
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,328
to solve that problem or that you have to be the one

736
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,269
to come up with a solution, but.

737
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:13,740
If you see a problem, you should come with the mindset that you want to solve it together,

738
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,284
that you want to collaborate with people to solve that problem, as opposed to just shunting that

739
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:22,508
problem onto somebody else and letting someone else deal with it. That's not collaboration. That's

740
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:29,114
just an errand for someone else to do. And so if you do see a problem, try and come with a solution.

741
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:35,119
This also can mean encouraging or being open to solutions.

742
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,631
That means if you bring a problem to someone,

743
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:41,132
then you can ask them like,

744
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,754
hey, do you have an idea for this?

745
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:47,316
Or, you know, I think this might work.

746
00:44:47,356 --> 00:44:48,957
You know, I think I have a solution to this,

747
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:50,758
but you're more knowledgeable in this.

748
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:51,459
What do you think?

749
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,921
You know, it's encouraging other people

750
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,302
to collaborate with you as well,

751
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:58,424
not just a one-way sort of directional thing.

752
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:00,845
Now,

753
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:11,715
You can't always be pushing, you know, you can't always be, you know, forcing your ideas or defending them or, you know, fighting for them, there will be times when you have to learn how to step aside.

754
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:23,908
And first one is, is this idea of knowing when you when you're fighting a losing battle. This is also known as this idea of, is this the hill I'm going to die on?

755
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,023
Meaning is this the fight that I want to use my energy for is this the thing I really want to defend and as we

756
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:33,505
Saw before if you do truly believe in it, then yeah, maybe the answer is yes

757
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:37,747
I do really need to stand up for this and I do stand behind it and want to push for it

758
00:45:38,427 --> 00:45:43,750
But there's probably more likely most of the time it's not you're like willing to let something go, you know

759
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,272
And and willing to kind of like alright, I don't really have the energy for this, you know, and

760
00:45:48,836 --> 00:45:53,919
and recognizing when you have a finite amount of energy and recognizing when other people might

761
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,761
not need you to be the one that's always pushing for something, then you get more comfortable kind

762
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:02,664
of letting things go. This is in line with that C'est La Vie thing that we talked about with

763
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:06,426
feedback of like sometimes people just want something how they want it and you're just

764
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:09,328
there to give it to them and that's this idea is like.

765
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:14,407
You know, not every piece of feedback needs to be something you have to defend or fight against or push against.

766
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:19,328
Sometimes you can just be like, OK, and move on from it because you're going to have bigger battles to fight later on.

767
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:25,190
Understand that your voice isn't always the most important in the room.

768
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:34,793
This could be that you're in a big meeting room where, you know, other people are discussing things and your idea or your voice might just derail that conversation.

769
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:41,531
Or maybe you do have an idea and it is important, but it's better saved for a smaller group or a

770
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:47,838
more private conversation maybe with your lead or a colleague. You don't always need to be the one

771
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:51,923
that's talking in the room, you know, sometimes you just need to be there to listen and absorb

772
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:55,947
information that's being passed around or ideas that are being passed around.

773
00:46:57,578 --> 00:47:01,579
And then simultaneously, sometimes you're not there to speak for yourself.

774
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:04,040
Maybe you're there to lift others up instead.

775
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,861
This is this goes back to what we were talking about with echoing ideas

776
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:08,901
instead of stealing them.

777
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,322
You know, you might be in a room where there's underrepresented people

778
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:14,743
or new people or people that are being talked over.

779
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:20,224
And so sometimes it's your job to listen and to uplift other voices in the room

780
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:24,605
and give them a sort of platform and a chance to talk and to say their ideas.

781
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:31,426
And then finally, and this is the hill I'll die on,

782
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:34,309
is you can't always reinvent the wheel

783
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:36,470
even if that wheel is broken.

784
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:40,453
More often than not, you'll probably come across a system

785
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:44,196
or a technique or an effect that was built a certain way

786
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,817
that wasn't terribly efficient

787
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,219
or that there is a better way of doing it.

788
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,061
And you just can't always fix it.

789
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:53,483
Sometimes you just have to accept the thing as it is

790
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:55,765
and work with it as it is because

791
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,588
Maybe there's not time to fix it, or by fixing it,

792
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,149
you're gonna introduce other issues.

793
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,891
You know, there's lots and lots of reasons

794
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:07,053
as to why you might just have to accept a thing as it is

795
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:08,835
and continue to like grow with it

796
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:11,196
and learn how to work with it in the production pipeline.

797
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,478
And this is a test to ego for sure.

798
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:17,380
You know, there's, even if you do know

799
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,401
how to make something more efficient and better.

800
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,326
it just maybe isn't the place for that idea or that,

801
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,107
or there isn't time for that.

802
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,168
And so even if you do know how to make it better,

803
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:29,310
it might not be worth, you know, the energy to do it

804
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,172
or the possible knock-on side effects of doing it.

805
00:48:34,153 --> 00:48:37,255
So this is talking about when to push myself aside.

806
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:41,637
Let's talk a little bit now about what you as an artist

807
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:43,278
bring to the table.

808
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:46,820
You know, what makes you unique and what do you bring

809
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,662
that other people might not be able to?

810
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:51,090
Essentially, what makes you, you.

811
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,752
At its core, you and your experiences hold value.

812
00:48:57,272 --> 00:48:59,513
And no one is going to be exactly like you.

813
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:02,133
No one is going to have the exact same life that you've lived.

814
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:04,594
No one is going to have the same exact skills that you have.

815
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:10,817
And all these skills that have nothing to do with your ability to make a visual effect

816
00:49:11,077 --> 00:49:14,178
or to work in your industry still hold value in your job.

817
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:20,390
So think about what you can do that other people either can't do or might not be as skilled at

818
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:25,552
doing. For example, are you a great explainer? Do you stay calm under pressure? Are you good

819
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:29,934
at making people laugh? Do you have strong empathy skills? You know, all these sort of

820
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:34,736
things, if you can sort of look at yourself and what you are good at as a person, you know,

821
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:40,658
outside of your job role, when you build on those strengths, you broaden your opportunities

822
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:41,458
for collaboration.

823
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:51,872
So for example, if you're really good at making people laugh, you know, this is nothing to do with making a V-effect, you know, this is nothing to do with making an explosion or making rain drip or anything like that.

824
00:49:52,472 --> 00:50:06,383
But if you get into a room that's super tense because multiple departments are at heads with each other, and you're really good at kind of adding levity to a tense situation, you can then open doors that maybe have been previously closed because of frustrations.

825
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,445
You know, you've made collaboration easier.

826
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:13,105
If you're really good at explaining ideas, maybe you're the voice.

827
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:15,046
If you collaborate with somebody on something

828
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,909
and you're the one that explains that idea, you know, obviously giving credit

829
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:19,750
where credit is due.

830
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,372
But if you can concisely explain what you're thinking

831
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:27,375
and can convince people and get buy in from people, you know, that's a skill

832
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:30,917
that has nothing really to do with making any visual effects, but it is

833
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:33,759
it does make you a better artist and a really good dev to work.

834
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:35,856
And the same goes for all the others.

835
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:36,756
You know, it's like,

836
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:38,656
if you're good at staying calm under pressure,

837
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:40,157
or if you're good at having empathy skills,

838
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:42,737
or kind of any sort of thing that you're good at,

839
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:43,918
you know, if you're a good listener,

840
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:46,919
or if you're really awesome at puzzles, you know,

841
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:50,259
all these things can really feed into building opportunities

842
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,980
for collaboration and allow you to work with

843
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,621
not just your VFX artists or your fellow VFX artists,

844
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,101
but people in all other departments all around you.

845
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:01,422
Okay.

846
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:03,123
Failure.

847
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:06,476
We're going to pivot just a little bit from communication collaboration,

848
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,777
and we're going to talk about failure.

849
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:12,241
Like the others, I grabbed definitions for it.

850
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:14,783
For this one, I did failure as a noun,

851
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,845
a state of inability to perform a normal function,

852
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,648
a fracturing or giving way under stress.

853
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:23,950
Now, I grabbed this one specifically like I did the others,

854
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,793
because I think more often than not,

855
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:30,455
people take failure as a sense of identity,

856
00:51:30,475 --> 00:51:31,877
as a slight on their identity.

857
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,962
as a label for themselves, aka I am a failure.

858
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,265
Instead of seeing it as a noun,

859
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:40,106
like I have experienced failure,

860
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:42,308
or I am in a state of failure.

861
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:46,871
And when you can kind of invert

862
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:49,353
your sort of understanding of failure

863
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,394
and your relationship to it,

864
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:53,236
it becomes a lot easier to embrace it

865
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,717
and to be okay with it.

866
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:57,834
We're going to talk a little bit about how to do that,

867
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:00,415
this idea of changing your perspective on failure,

868
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:03,397
and we're going to do that through three different techniques.

869
00:52:03,437 --> 00:52:05,359
First, we're going to look at what failure teaches us,

870
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,800
then we're going to look about why we might be afraid of it,

871
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,702
and then we'll look at how we can embrace it instead.

872
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,845
First things first, what do we learn from failure?

873
00:52:16,476 --> 00:52:19,517
Now this is a character sheet from Monster of the Week.

874
00:52:20,777 --> 00:52:24,078
I'm not going to go too much into all the other stuff on it, but there's a

875
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:26,519
section down at the bottom called experience that I want to dig into a

876
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,060
little bit. And this experience box is the same on

877
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,860
multiple different character types in this

878
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:37,062
role-playing game, but if we zoom in, what it says is whenever you roll and get a

879
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:39,543
total of six or less or when a move tells you to

880
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:43,104
mark experience box. Now in Monster of the Week, the mechanic is

881
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:46,245
you roll two d6s and you add those numbers up.

882
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:51,865
And depending on the value, you either succeed or you fail.

883
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:54,786
You know, if you're above a certain value, you succeed.

884
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:57,708
If you even higher, you succeed with, you know,

885
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:00,188
like some special addition to it.

886
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:03,990
But in this, if you roll six or less,

887
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,390
that is considered a failure.

888
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:07,931
What's really cool about this though,

889
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:11,213
is in this section, when you roll six or less,

890
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,173
aka when you fail at something,

891
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,314
you mark an experience box here.

892
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:19,370
And then after you mark all five experience boxes,

893
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,711
that's when you level up.

894
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:26,955
So this cool mechanic basically shows you that to level up,

895
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,077
the only way to level up is to fail.

896
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:32,319
Now this is different than most kind of games,

897
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:34,761
tabletop or video games or anything like that,

898
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,244
where you defeat a monster or you fight an enemy

899
00:53:38,324 --> 00:53:40,946
and you gain XP from winning that fight.

900
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:44,348
And after a certain amount of wins, then you level up.

901
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:47,480
This one says, you don't level up until you fail.

902
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:51,724
And I think that's actually much more similar

903
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:52,945
to what real life is like,

904
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:55,147
is you learn a lot more from failing.

905
00:53:55,668 --> 00:53:58,010
First and foremost, you learn what not to do

906
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,693
and what to do, but more likely you're gonna learn

907
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:03,615
about five different things you're not supposed to do

908
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:06,358
or you shouldn't do, and then maybe five other ways

909
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:08,139
that you can succeed at what you're trying to do,

910
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,061
depending on the path that you've taken.

911
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:11,443
And then again,

912
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:17,822
even though you have failed, it doesn't mean you are a failure. You know, you are just experiencing

913
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:22,986
failure. You are experiencing a, you know, a state of failure, but that doesn't actually

914
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:30,451
mean that you as a person are a failure. Now, that's all well and good. Failure is still

915
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:35,495
really flip and scary sometimes. And so let's talk a little bit about why we might be afraid of this

916
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:42,521
and why we might be kind of against this idea of failing. So imagine this is you down at the bottom.

917
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:46,637
You know, you're very, very small and at this moment, you're very stressed.

918
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:51,601
So what is it that you are scared of with regards to failing?

919
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,183
Maybe you're about to start something and you're scared you're not going to be able

920
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:58,486
to do it, or you're in the act of failing, you know, you're actively trying something

921
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,327
and it's not working out and you start to panic.

922
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:04,190
So first and foremost, you probably are just scared that you're going to feel like

923
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,692
an idiot or that other people are going to think of you as an idiot.

924
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,460
You know, this is a universal fear.

925
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:12,081
I think everybody feels this way.

926
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:15,062
This is empathy that we're talking about is that everybody feels like this.

927
00:55:15,963 --> 00:55:19,204
But on top of that, you might also be scared that you're going to be punished

928
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:19,784
for failing.

929
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:21,485
You know, are you going to get fired?

930
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:23,025
Are you going to get demoted?

931
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,726
Are you going to get missed opportunities?

932
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:26,127
You know, are they not going to give you tasks

933
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:27,407
because they don't think you can handle it?

934
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:30,528
And then hand in hand with that, are you scared of our industry?

935
00:55:30,688 --> 00:55:33,169
You know, if you're scared of being punished or that you're going to look

936
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:36,050
like an idiot, you might be scared, because that means if you get fired,

937
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,291
you have to go back into the job pool.

938
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:43,981
You know, we're in a fairly cutthroat industry where people perceive themselves as very replaceable.

939
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:47,584
And so if you're scared that you're gonna feel like an idiot and that you might get

940
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:51,206
fired, that might be because you're really scared of having to get back into our industry

941
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,147
and find a new job.

942
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:58,212
And on top of all that, you might be scared because if you fail, it might prove that you're

943
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,072
actually a fraud.

944
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:00,754
That's what imposter syndrome is.

945
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:05,743
you know, you feel as if that you're an imposter in the role that you're playing,

946
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:09,004
and that at any point in time, someone's going to realize that, you know,

947
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:10,345
they're going to find out that you're a fake.

948
00:56:10,845 --> 00:56:15,048
And so all these things can add up to being, to making you feel like,

949
00:56:15,848 --> 00:56:18,590
Oh my gosh, if I don't do this, if I don't succeed at this,

950
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,671
they're going to see I'm not cut out for this, that I'm a fake,

951
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,073
that I got this job by mistake, and then they're going to fire me.

952
00:56:24,093 --> 00:56:27,775
And then I have to go back in the job pool, you know, and, and this sort of.

953
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:32,859
stuff really weighs on you and it becomes a sort of cycle of anxiety and at the end of the day you

954
00:56:32,879 --> 00:56:40,726
just burn yourself out by kind of being crushed under all this fear of failure. So how can we

955
00:56:40,766 --> 00:56:45,489
learn to kind of be okay with not being okay? You know, how do we switch our mentality on this

956
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:51,194
and think of it differently and be able to exist in a world where those fears still exist,

957
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:56,438
where they still happen and they still are there but we don't let them stop us for trying to do

958
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:56,818
something?

959
00:56:58,255 --> 00:57:00,715
So first, just remember what fear teaches you.

960
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,576
You know, we looked at this experience marker

961
00:57:04,636 --> 00:57:05,697
that's in Monster of the Week,

962
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:08,537
and this is actually much more aligned

963
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:10,718
with what life is like, what real life is like.

964
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:14,719
And it shows you that sometimes the only way

965
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,099
to level up is to fail.

966
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,360
You know, think of failure as a necessity,

967
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,400
not just an option.

968
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,621
You know, you're never gonna be perfectly successful

969
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:23,181
at everything.

970
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:26,202
You have to fail, and you have to fail to learn and to grow.

971
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,751
And you learn more from failing than you would just from success.

972
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:34,512
As we said, you learn what not to do and what to do, so that's already twice as much as you would

973
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:39,194
have just from being successful. But more likely than not, you're going to learn a whole bunch of

974
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:43,455
things you shouldn't have done and a whole bunch of other ways you could succeed in the future.

975
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:49,477
And then finally, just remember that just because you have failed, it doesn't mean you are a failure.

976
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:55,579
Like in this experience example, by failing, you level up. You become a better character. You grow.

977
00:57:56,992 --> 00:58:00,314
And so you aren't a failure by failing.

978
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:01,575
You are experiencing it,

979
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,156
but you as a person are not a failure.

980
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:07,479
And then challenge yourself to fail.

981
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:10,501
You know, really push yourself out of your comfort zone

982
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,822
and challenge yourself to try and fail.

983
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:15,244
Like there's that story on the internet

984
00:58:15,584 --> 00:58:18,246
of that woman who challenged herself

985
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:20,707
to get a hundred rejections in a year,

986
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:21,368
or something like that.

987
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:25,690
And she actually found she had more trouble doing that than she thought.

988
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,432
She applied to a whole bunch of jobs that she didn't really think she was fully qualified for,

989
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:35,254
and she expected to get 100 rejections easily, but it was actually more work trying to get

990
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:39,996
rejected from these jobs than it was to get interviews for them. And kind of the moral of

991
00:58:40,036 --> 00:58:45,038
that is you're probably more qualified than you think you are, than you give yourself credit for.

992
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:49,840
And so you won't ever know that until you actually challenge yourself and try to fail.

993
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:58,044
Now, if you've modeled behavior that we talked about before, where you embrace or you celebrate

994
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:04,488
successes and failures, and when you listen to silly ideas and support them, and yes, and them,

995
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:08,530
then you'll be in an environment, you'll have built an environment where challenging yourself

996
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:12,653
to fail isn't nearly as scary as it might have been otherwise. You know, if you know you have

997
00:59:12,693 --> 00:59:16,875
your team behind you, that's going to support you and celebrate you, even if you don't succeed,

998
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:19,457
then this is becomes a lot less terrifying to do.

999
00:59:22,263 --> 00:59:25,145
And then understand that everyone else feels this way as well.

1000
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:27,807
You know, we've talked about this before is this idea that, you know,

1001
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,308
other people are also scared of this.

1002
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:33,411
Other people are also really nervous and that you aren't alone in this, that you

1003
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:36,173
aren't the only one afraid of our industry.

1004
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:38,315
You're the only one afraid of feeling like an idiot.

1005
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:39,916
This is what empathy is.

1006
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:41,417
You know, everybody feels this way.

1007
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:46,081
And then finally, if all else fails, just fake it till you make it.

1008
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:49,443
As we said before, you're probably not faking it as much as you think you are.

1009
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:52,725
But the more you tell yourself that you can succeed at something,

1010
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:53,725
that you can do something,

1011
00:59:53,765 --> 00:59:56,225
the more likely you are to convince yourself that you can do it.

1012
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:57,026
You know,

1013
00:59:57,046 --> 01:00:00,666
it's that like psychology experiment or exercise where if you're sitting in

1014
01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:03,907
front of your pantry and you're looking for peanut butter and all you do is tell

1015
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:05,347
yourself that the peanut butter isn't there,

1016
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,148
that you don't see it,

1017
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:07,088
it must be misplaced.

1018
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:10,689
Your brain will actually stop seeing it because you've convinced yourself that

1019
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:11,769
it isn't actually there.

1020
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,669
And so if you can do the same in reverse and tell,

1021
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:15,790
so tell yourself.

1022
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:17,723
Yes, I am qualified for this.

1023
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,944
Yes, I can do this.

1024
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,707
You know, yes, I have the skills to do this.

1025
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,110
Then your brain will start to believe it after a while.

1026
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,054
And it's more likely that you're more qualified for it

1027
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:27,556
than you think and that you can handle

1028
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:28,817
whatever you're about to try to do.

1029
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:32,783
And then, you know, at the very, very end of this.

1030
01:00:33,626 --> 01:00:35,869
is just this fact that you've got this.

1031
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:38,111
It's okay to mess up, it's okay to fail.

1032
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:39,994
If you have a good environment around you,

1033
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,056
then it's probably safe to fail.

1034
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:44,339
It's safe, you'll get help if you need it.

1035
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:46,081
And again, at the end of the day,

1036
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,444
you aren't defined by what you can't succeed at.

1037
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,428
You are still valuable as a person and you've got this.

1038
01:00:55,614 --> 01:01:00,118
We've talked a whole lot about a whole bunch of different things. And as we are wrapping up

1039
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:04,661
pretty quickly on this talk, let's just go over kind of what we've talked about already

1040
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:10,906
and close things out. So what did we talk about? First, we talked about this idea of building

1041
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:16,390
intention in the workplace, working intentionally and specifically working with empathy for the

1042
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:23,075
people around you. We did this through discussing communication, both within your team and with

1043
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:23,635
other disciplines.

1044
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:30,245
And we talked about how to build intention and work with empathy via collaboration with other people.

1045
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:35,610
And then we just talked about how to own and embrace failure. We discussed why we might be

1046
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:41,215
afraid of failure and what we can learn from it to use it to our advantage instead.

1047
01:01:44,418 --> 01:01:47,802
Now, if you have any other questions, please feel free to pop them in the chat.

1048
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,904
If I haven't answered them already, I'd be happy to answer them after the fact.

1049
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:54,623
And feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn if you have anything else afterwards.

1050
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:58,084
I'm more than happy to talk about this stuff. I'm really passionate about it. So

1051
01:01:58,744 --> 01:02:04,907
would love to hear them. And then finally, if you are in the industry or the job market or

1052
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:09,088
looking to change, the coalition is hiring. We have plenty of jobs available.

1053
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:16,411
They change possibly every day. So just pop onto our website or hit up this coalition careers

1054
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:20,613

1055
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:27,302
Thank you for your attention and thank you for your time, and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your GDC.

1056
01:02:28,646 --> 01:02:28,766
Bye!
