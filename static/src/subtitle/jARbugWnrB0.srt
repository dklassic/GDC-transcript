1
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:09,015
Thank you all for coming. My name is Jonathan Ackley and I work at Walt Disney Imagineering

2
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:16,418
Research and Development and I produce and I'm the creative director of various interactive

3
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:23,921
theme park attractions but I'm a very, very old game developer with games dating back to the 19

4
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,343
LucasArts adventure games including The Curse of Monkey Island.

5
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:29,985
Thank you all for coming.

6
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:33,007
Let me introduce you, my partner in this talk, Chris Purvis.

7
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:34,208
Hi, I'm Chris Purvis.

8
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,710
I also am with Walt Disney Imagineering.

9
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:44,276
I am very much like Jonathan in that I date back to the early 90s

10
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:45,737
from the game industry originally,

11
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,200
and we both somehow ended up at Disney together

12
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,543
and have partnered on a lot of the attractions we're going to talk to you about today.

13
00:00:56,374 --> 00:01:02,497
So what we're going to talk today is we're going to talk about how we are using the storytelling

14
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:08,320
devices that have made Disney Imagineering the most popular theme park company for the

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,863
last 50 years and how we are taking the lessons learned from video games, applying it to the

16
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:21,967
development of those interactive theme park attractions and I apologize, when you fill

17
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:24,008
out your little surveys, totally forget this part.

18
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:27,556
So we're going to talk about storytelling in themed environments,

19
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:31,939
how we can apply the lessons learned in video games to gaming in the real world.

20
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,101
So we're going to start off talking about Mickey's Ten Commandments,

21
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,642
and you'll learn about what that is.

22
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,524
We'll talk about some of our projects moving forward,

23
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:43,267
and we'll talk about what lessons you can take from the video game industry

24
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:46,389
and bring into the physical world, and which ones are best left behind,

25
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,551
and what the differences are, and how to apply them.

26
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:50,252
So at Imagineering...

27
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:53,858
We're all about storytelling through new technology.

28
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:57,721
That is really how Walt founded his theme park group.

29
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:01,765
He wanted to take the worlds of his movies,

30
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:03,527
bring them into the real world,

31
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:06,249
and let our guests travel through those worlds.

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,433
And clearly, that turned out to be a very popular idea.

33
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:15,338
But what we are doing is we are taking that same Disney storytelling...

34
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:18,216
just like Walt had it, but we're turning on its head.

35
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:22,059
So now, our guests are becoming the main characters

36
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,580
in the Disney stories.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,422
So I'd like to start off by some of the principles

38
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:29,104
which ground storytelling at Walt Disney Imagineering.

39
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:32,647
Tell you about a famous Imagineer named Marty Sklar.

40
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,128
Marty Sklar is a Disney legend.

41
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,070
He was with the company and he ran the creative

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,451
for Walt Disney Imagineering for many, many years.

43
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:44,035
He was also Walt's writer back in the 1950s and 60s,

44
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,696
ever since the Disneyland days.

45
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,909
And one day he was talking with Mickey Mouse.

46
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:53,352
And Mickey Mouse dictated to Marty some rules

47
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,194
behind storytelling in a dimensional world.

48
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,715
So I'll quickly go over them.

49
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:02,277
Obviously, you can probably read them faster than I can talk them.

50
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,458
But talk a little bit about them.

51
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:04,458
Give them some context.

52
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:08,481
Because these absolutely apply, I believe, to the products

53
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,922
that you guys make every day.

54
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:11,863
So know your audience.

55
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,538
Don't bore them.

56
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,141
Obviously, you want to know who you're making your art for.

57
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:21,245
You're going to tailor it to things that interest them, to the technologies that they use and

58
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:25,468
understand, to things that are going to intrigue them, little bits of magic that are going

59
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,289
to make them wonder.

60
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,131
You don't talk down to them.

61
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,873
You don't say, well, this is for kids, so I don't have to try as hard.

62
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,535
You try and make it as great as possible.

63
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,096
Wear your guest's shoes.

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,761
Anybody who's worked in testing knows this is very important.

65
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,923
You could create the most fabulous attraction,

66
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,944
but it requires you to walk a marathon.

67
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,645
That's not going to be very popular.

68
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:48,926
You need to understand who your guests are

69
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:52,227
and really design for them.

70
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,829
Organize the flow of good people and ideas.

71
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,210
This is just basic, good storytelling.

72
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,110
You want to be clear.

73
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,011
You want them to know your intention.

74
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,572
And you want to show them where they're going

75
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:03,593
and why they're going there.

76
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,126
Now create a weenie. A weenie is Walt's word.

77
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:13,109
A weenie is a large visual object that draws your focus, that really grounds and sets the

78
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:18,532
stage for an area. So at Disneyland, the castle is the first weenie that you see when you

79
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,253
enter the park. It draws you. You know you're there.

80
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:25,695
When you turn right towards Tomorrowland, what do you see?

81
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,397
You see the weenie down there. It's Space Mountain.

82
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:33,554
So these things give people focus, things to look at.

83
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,055
It's not a huge clutter.

84
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:37,177
Communicate with visual literacy.

85
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,100
So this is just good artwork.

86
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,121
Don't just throw it up there.

87
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:41,861
Think about it.

88
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:42,722
Plan it out.

89
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,504
Avoid overload.

90
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,627
If you fill everything with tremendous detail, people are

91
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:49,348
going to get tired.

92
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,411
You can't look at everything and focus on every detail.

93
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:53,932
Be sparing.

94
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:55,994
Choose important visuals.

95
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,713
This is a very important one. Tell one story at a time.

96
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:05,777
So, again as I said, at Imagineering it all begins with a story.

97
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,820
So everything in a land has to make sense.

98
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:18,427
You know, you wouldn't have Fantasyland and place NASCAR Days of Thunder racing simulator in it.

99
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,371
You'd be telling two different stories, the two stories don't match, the guests feel that.

100
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:25,826
and they know something's wrong.

101
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,868
So your storytelling needs to make sense.

102
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:29,850
Avoid contradiction.

103
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,092
It's very similar to the last point.

104
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,234
Now for every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of fun.

105
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,177
This is sweat the details.

106
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:43,782
This means it's not just good enough to tell a clear story.

107
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:46,584
You wanna give them as much value as possible.

108
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,426
And that really is baked into Imagineering,

109
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:53,230
back from the original Imagineers, as told by Walt Disney.

110
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:54,513
and keep it up.

111
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,456
Now this may be something that's less important

112
00:05:57,476 --> 00:06:00,018
in a photonic world, but in a physical world,

113
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:03,101
as we're gonna be talking about, this is really important.

114
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:07,124
In the real world, you can't run at nine meters a second

115
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,545
for three hours straight.

116
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,927
You can't jump down 15 feet.

117
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,750
And things break, right?

118
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,613
In a video game, you can put 50 pounds of dynamite

119
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,335
against a wall, blow it up, and that wall still looks great.

120
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,802
Sun, rain, wind, five-year-olds,

121
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:27,763
they have more power than you think.

122
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:31,665
And so you have to focus on designing for maintainability

123
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,926
and also putting resources to keeping things up

124
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:36,166
and working well.

125
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:40,848
So I'll talk about Agent P's World Showcase Adventure.

126
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,729
And this was my first attraction

127
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,810
that I designed and produced at Walt Disney.

128
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,735
It wasn't really designed to be an attraction.

129
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,476
I was working in research and development

130
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,919
and had been working in a lot of mobile stuff.

131
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
And my boss came to me one day and said,

132
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,201
eh, you know, you used to make adventure games.

133
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:03,522
Why don't you make an adventure game

134
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,504
with Kim Possible in Epcot?

135
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,666
Because there was a perception at the time

136
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,667
that there wasn't much for kids to do in Epcot.

137
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:11,628
So maybe we could do a test.

138
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,669
And so I went into it thinking, all right,

139
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:15,951
I can translate some of what I did

140
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:17,372
back at the LucasArts Adventure Games.

141
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:24,019
bring it to the physical world, and maybe make WDI smart about how we might use cell

142
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,882
phones, mobile devices, which were really just emerging at the time, make us a little

143
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,503
smarter and maybe someday somebody will do an attraction about it.

144
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:36,847
So eventually Kim Possible became Agent P's World Showcase Adventure.

145
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,449
So forgive me if I get confused and use them interchangeably.

146
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,372
So the guest's role, which is very important, it all begins with a story, is a secret agent

147
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,255
EPCOT World Showcase, if you've never been there,

148
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,656
is designed like a world's fair,

149
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,117
with a whole bunch of different pavilions,

150
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,038
each pavilion representing a different country.

151
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,620
So for our story, as a secret agent,

152
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,822
the secret agent would go from country to country,

153
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:02,885
solving, foiling the crimes of the evil villains

154
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:04,706
from the Kim Possible TV show.

155
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,229
And because it was a high-tech story,

156
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,751
I could use mobile devices.

157
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,072
Secret agents would use mobile devices.

158
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,934
So it was a consistent story.

159
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,310
World Showcase, modern day world, secret agents,

160
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,192
electronic devices, the interface and the story

161
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,373
and the locations all work together holistically.

162
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:28,575
So this is the drawing of the UK Pavilion.

163
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,617
It celebrates a different culture of the world.

164
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:31,937
So our design goals.

165
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,759
We wanted to make our guests the main character

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,041
without disturbing the park experience

167
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,382
for non-participating guests.

168
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:43,364
So imagine if you were working on a massively multiplayer

169
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:52,348
RPG, maybe it was set in a fantasy world, and space men kept walking through it.

170
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:56,191
This would not be appropriate, this wouldn't be good storytelling, you wouldn't be telling

171
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,451
one story at a time.

172
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,535
And also, we have guests who would not be participating in the experience, they're just

173
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:07,338
enjoying the environment of World Showcase, which by the way, is my favorite theme park.

174
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,160
Great food, great adult beverages, you'd love it.

175
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,653
Story and interface.

176
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,155
Agent P is a classic, non-linear, puzzle-based adventure game.

177
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:21,459
Lucas, Sierra, it's just that, but brought to the real world.

178
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,341
So many of the design principles that, you know,

179
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,103
the people who predated me in that, Ron Gilbert and company,

180
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:29,344
just brought those forward.

181
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:30,345
They applied directly.

182
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,307
The secret agent story was great because, again,

183
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:36,690
we didn't want to spoil the existing feel of World Showcase

184
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,731
by adding a whole bunch of Ms. Pac-Man machines,

185
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,113
but spies hide their equipment.

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,701
And that made it possible for us to tell our story

187
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,284
without impacting the story of the rest of the guests

188
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,284
in World Showcase.

189
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,168
Now I'm going to show you a little video here.

190
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,310
This is just an example of how Agent P works.

191
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:59,054
Agent P works, the guests get a communicator, or now

192
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:03,797
a mobile phone, which I believe is

193
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,400
field operative notification equipment, or phone.

194
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:15,204
treasure hunt. And the phone tells you the plot, it tells you where to go, exactly where

195
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:19,485
to go. And when you reach a location, there is a story point that can only be solved by

196
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:25,686
you, the guest, and by pressing the communicator or the phone button, it triggers the secret

197
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:30,867
agent device and amazing things happen and you are the hero. So, I'm about to show you

198
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:36,848
a video. This is part of Agent P's World Showcase Adventure. In it, you've discovered the evil

199
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:39,068
lair of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.

200
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:43,246
And it has a secret underwater opening.

201
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,688
And so you need to trigger Perry the platypus.

202
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,389
Perry the platypus will come out in his boat.

203
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,330
He will set a depth charge,

204
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:51,072
which you will then trigger to blow open

205
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,313
Duffen Schmertz's secret lair.

206
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,254
So here's that video.

207
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,324
All right, he's set the depth charge.

208
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:21,186
Now for a kid, this is huge.

209
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,829
For a kid or a computer game professional, this is huge.

210
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,151
Because we all would love to blow things up in the real world, but laws and physics don't

211
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:32,591
allow it.

212
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:36,353
But it's particularly important for kids, because kids in this world don't have a lot

213
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:36,913
of power.

214
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:42,335
So giving them control over a physical environment is very important.

215
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:47,957
And when I first opened the Kim Possible playtest...

216
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:52,134
there was a little girl and she triggered one of the effects

217
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:55,174
and we were watching from the background.

218
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,075
And the effect came on and she turned to a perfect stranger

219
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,395
and jumped up and down and screamed,

220
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,796
I did it, I did it, I did it, and I swear I cried.

221
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,797
Because I had made that little girl just that happy.

222
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:10,538
So it's very rewarding, I have found, working in theme parks.

223
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,099
Because when I worked in video games,

224
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,679
the best you would get was you'd hang out

225
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,880
in an electronic boutique and fish for compliments.

226
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:21,453
No one does that anymore.

227
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,455
No one does that anymore.

228
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,577
Or you'd force your parents to play and they'd say,

229
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:26,838
oh, it's wonderful beer.

230
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,241
But doing location-based entertainment,

231
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:35,105
you go out and you actually get to see real people

232
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,047
playing with the toy that you built for them.

233
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,089
It is so rewarding. It is fantastic.

234
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:44,193
I'll show you another couple of little videos. I won't show them all the way through because

235
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:48,756
they can be quite long-winded. But in this next one, you find Dr. Dufenshmirtz, who believes

236
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:57,522
that you are an informant working with him, and he's going to plot to give you a rigged

237
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:05,647
golf ball to win the evil scientists' open golf tournament. It makes sense if you do.

238
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:25,296
Alright, I'm going to skip ahead because the audio quality is bad.

239
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:30,099
In this next one, I'm not even going to describe why this is happening.

240
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,701
It's in the Germany pavilion.

241
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,808
One great thing about working at Walt Disney Imagineering is that there are people around

242
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:58,888
who can do anything.

243
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,270
You brainstorm these ideas and it's like,

244
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,431
oh, can we do that?

245
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,273
It's like, well, let's ask the laser guy.

246
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,076
Because, you know, we've got one of those.

247
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,458
And so you go talk to the laser guy

248
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,920
and he's like, oh, sure, yes, I can create you a death ray.

249
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,443
And then you don't build it,

250
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,284
but you're just happy to know that you could if you wanted.

251
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:24,448
So this next video, again, it makes complete lucid sense

252
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:26,710
when you're in the park, but in Norway,

253
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,691
Dr. Dukenschmerz is attempting to recover.

254
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:34,155
a stolen bicycle that was pilfered from his Viking neighbor as a child,

255
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:40,680
and it involves Viking reenactors, and, well, never mind, it doesn't make any sense.

256
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:04,832
So we have just a great toolbox of special effects animatronic robots.

257
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:10,495
lasers. It's just a very fun toolbox. And with that I will turn it over to Chris who

258
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,296
will talk about places.

259
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:18,700
Before we opened this attraction we mocked it up close to full scale in a couple of the

260
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,723
pavilions and ran a test for a few weeks to see how it worked with the audience because

261
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:26,825
we hadn't really tried anything like this before. Just to make sure that we weren't

262
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:32,209
being too confusing or making people march too far. And actually,

263
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:40,039
things we learned that was kind of surprising was how receptive

264
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,220
people were to walking long distances in the Florida sun in

265
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,263
the summer for extended periods of time and staying engaged with

266
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:55,044
the game and keeping their satisfaction levels up. We were

267
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:59,205
surprised at how sticky the experience was. The other thing

268
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:02,626
that was interesting was how

269
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:08,970
Well, the interactions with the human beings that we enrolled in the test, where we actually

270
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,394
had an interaction where one of the cast members, we have a tea shop in England, and one of

271
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,456
the quests, the guests go in and they ask,

272
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:23,997
somebody in the tea shop, they give them the secret password.

273
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,117
Danger is my cup of tea.

274
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:27,338
Right, the phrase.

275
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:32,459
And then they're handed a special tea bag that has a clue inside of it.

276
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,159
And that was actually one of the highest rated parts of the experience.

277
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,100
Where are we here?

278
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,201
Now, what we didn't know, because there have been very few examples

279
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,602
of location-based entertainment that lasted for...

280
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,187
you know, more than three to ten minutes.

281
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:55,129
And we proved out during this playtest, which was an exceedingly long

282
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,290
playtest that caused people to march at least a mile, probably over a mile,

283
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,030
in August in Florida.

284
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,972
And as Chris pointed out, the

285
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,313
the results of that playtest were such that we actually turned it into a

286
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:11,254
complete attraction.

287
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,215
But there are some other things that we worried about. We worried about griefing

288
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:16,915
in the park.

289
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,381
There was a lot of concern about that.

290
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,961
And it turns out, it's just not an issue.

291
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,902
Our guests to the theme parks are usually very well behaved.

292
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:32,923
And I also believe that griefing is often caused by a feeling of anonymity online.

293
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,484
You don't have that in a theme park.

294
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,544
No, it's really hard to be mean to the little girl who's waiting in line ahead of you

295
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,205
when she's actually right there.

296
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:46,826
And we also worried about guests running into each other.

297
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,540
There's a lot of concern about that.

298
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,720
Wouldn't spoil the experience.

299
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,581
Yeah, so Kim Possible, the effects, as you saw,

300
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,542
are mostly mechanical, show action equipment type effects.

301
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,684
They kind of do the same thing over and over and over.

302
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:02,365
And one of the things that we were afraid of

303
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:05,666
was that if you were sent to a location

304
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,747
and there's somebody else there and you're sort of waiting

305
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,887
around for your turn.

306
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,248
you'll see what's going to happen and it's going to be the same thing.

307
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,490
And that people would find that as dissatisfying, like,

308
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,751
oh, it's the same show that that guy just got, I already know what's going to happen.

309
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:24,174
As it turns out, that agency was more important than surprise.

310
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:28,276
The fact that they got to do it, even though they had already seen what was just about to happen,

311
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:32,458
even if it was the finale, guests didn't care.

312
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:34,639
They still wanted to do it themselves.

313
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,559
It was still just as satisfying for them.

314
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,920
And again, that was something that we were...

315
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:39,983
not expecting.

316
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:45,268
And it's always fun to talk about your brilliant game design ideas that totally failed, so

317
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,809
I'll tell you one of those right now.

318
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,573
I had a great idea which was going to solve this problem of people spoiling it before.

319
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:56,457
When two guests arrived at the same location, I can detect that with our location detection

320
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:56,738
system.

321
00:18:56,858 --> 00:19:00,761
So if one pressed the button, I was going to tell them, oh, your communicator doesn't

322
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:01,442
have enough power.

323
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:04,965
Get the other agents around you to all push your button simultaneously.

324
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,826
I thought, ah, I'm a genius.

325
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,052
They refused to do it.

326
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:11,813
Refused to do it.

327
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,814
They queued up because I don't want to do it with somebody

328
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,935
else, I want to be the one who presses the button and makes

329
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,256
it happen.

330
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,316
So we didn't expect that.

331
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:28,479
So this attraction is effectively a large

332
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,340
multiplayer game.

333
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,722
We've got up to 700 to 900 people playing it

334
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,382
simultaneously at any given time.

335
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,576
So we had to write the quests such that they could be played

336
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,498
back in any order to allow us to load balance the

337
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:47,038
attraction.

338
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,881
So it's divided up into missions.

339
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,262
There's one mission per pavilion.

340
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:56,264
Each one of the missions has a number of steps, and those

341
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,707
steps are actually somewhat non-linear as well.

342
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:04,170
So we can really route people to any location that we want

343
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,611
based on the current distribution of players and

344
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,453
the current load in a particular land.

345
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,696
We have a disadvantage over you photonic folk in that you can

346
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:15,138
always put in another shard.

347
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:18,080
We can't just make another theme park.

348
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:24,745
So we have to be very careful with our use of the shared

349
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,066
space that is the theme park.

350
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:26,246
Right.

351
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,168
And really, the only thing that we found that was a big

352
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,790
dissatisfier was that people didn't like to backtrack.

353
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,732
So if we had you going.

354
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,287
World Showcase is a fairly large area.

355
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:39,847
It's about a mile from all the way around.

356
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,888
It's sort of the circular area around this lake.

357
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,308
And the circumference of it is about a mile.

358
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:50,769
So what people really hated was when we made them feel like

359
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,190
they're over here in Germany, and then they've

360
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,010
got to go over here to the energy pavilion,

361
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,370
and then back to Germany again.

362
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,951
That kind of drove them nuts, which in retrospect,

363
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,411
we should have realized ahead of time.

364
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:04,541
We don't do that now.

365
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:05,342
No, we don't do that.

366
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:05,902
We took that out.

367
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:10,865
So the next game I'd like to talk about is a game that Chris and I launched about a year

368
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:13,426
and a half ago called Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom.

369
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:19,090
And the overall conceit behind Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom is what if all those crazy

370
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,872
trading card games came to life and actually worked?

371
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,834
So what if you had a whole bunch of spell cards?

372
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:31,210
And when confronted by a villain, all you had to do was choose the spell you wanted to cast,

373
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,073
hold it out in front of you, and it would actually cast the spell.

374
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,155
And so I pitched the idea to Chris, and Chris said,

375
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,878
that's the stupidest thing I ever heard, that's not technically feasible, there's no way we'll do it.

376
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,881
And then he thought about it some more and said, oh yeah, we can do that.

377
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:48,644
You know programmers, they do it all the time.

378
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,811
So, it's in the Magic Kingdom.

379
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:56,873
So, the theme of magic was perfect for it.

380
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:02,555
The guests search out mystic portals scattered all over the entire theme park.

381
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:05,817
Once they open a mystic portal,

382
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:09,058
they may be confronted by a friend who will tell them a bit of the story.

383
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,398
They may be confronted by a villain.

384
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:13,560
If it's a villain, the villain will instantly attack, because villains are mean.

385
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,572
and then you choose the correct card or cards that you feel you need to play to defeat the

386
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:19,852
villain.

387
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:27,715
So if Agent P is a classic adventure game, we wanted a full-on role-playing game that

388
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:30,996
lasted hours and hours and hours and hours and was replayable.

389
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:37,208
Right. Coming out of the Agent Peek Impossible project, we had a few goals of things we'd like to do better.

390
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:44,093
One of which was to add some level of replayability, because, again, Agent Peek is the same effects over and over.

391
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:47,836
And once you've done it, you've seen them all. We wanted to try and fix that.

392
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:57,083
The other thing we wanted to try and do was come up with a way of doing a game where we didn't have to give you a handset that we needed to maintain an inventory of, because that's actually...

393
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,605
really expensive operationally to do.

394
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,668
Hence the paper cards which don't have any

395
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,450
technology in them at all.

396
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:10,494
But the main point to take away is

397
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:13,576
even though we weren't using expensive handsets,

398
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,839
those cards are valuable because those cards...

399
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:18,302
We put a lot of effort in them.

400
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,624
They're actually valuable works of art that people trade for.

401
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:25,246
So even though it was less expensive to operate, the

402
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,867
guests got to walk away with something.

403
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,769
And then it added a whole depth of trading within the

404
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:35,111
experience, which we learned was more important than maybe

405
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,252
we had initially thought.

406
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:36,892
Right.

407
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:39,294
So we wanted to make this.

408
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:40,995
You're going too fast, man.

409
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:41,295
Sorry.

410
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,444
We wanted to make this accessible to people that just

411
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:47,164
show up who've never been in the park before and have it be

412
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:48,004
a fun experience.

413
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:52,885
But particularly in Walt Disney World, there's a core

414
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:56,086
group of annual pass holders that are really kind of

415
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,326
frequent repeat visitors.

416
00:23:57,346 --> 00:24:01,527
And we wanted to give them something as well, which would

417
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,507
not always be the same thing over and over again.

418
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,127
Again, that replayability angle.

419
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,368
How do we do that with an RPG without?

420
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,941
having an inventory or a series of stats or something

421
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:18,982
that's really intricate and hard to read

422
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,522
and difficult to communicate was something

423
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,164
that we had to think about as one of our

424
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,404
design considerations.

425
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:25,825
It's the whole know your audience thing.

426
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:26,966
When people are in a theme park,

427
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,827
they don't want to sit there and look at a stat screen.

428
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,728
Not to mention that thematically,

429
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,149
the art directors would have killed us

430
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:36,150
if we had tried to do that.

431
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:37,811
So.

432
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:45,437
What we've come up with for this was each one of the spell cards represents an individual spell.

433
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:50,820
The spells have, you know, n number of levels that they can increase in power with.

434
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,361
And we initially opened the thing with three different levels for each one.

435
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,544
So as you use your spell cards, they increase in power,

436
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:04,186
and the effect that is displayed when you hold it up gets more potent.

437
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,787
It evolves as you play the game.

438
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:07,268
Can I show them one of my favorites?

439
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:17,001
sure. This is an example. See it's funny because someone gets

440
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:21,424
hit in the face with a bat. That's actually my favorite

441
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:27,648
spell of all time. So we have 70 different spells in the

442
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,809
initial deck that we launched.

443
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,671
with a couple of additions for holiday special editions

444
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:36,232
that we've done over the last two years.

445
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:38,732
These are examples of the actual spell cards

446
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:39,813
that get handed out.

447
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:41,953
When you show up in the park,

448
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:45,374
you're given a deck of five of these

449
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:48,975
that are randomly selected out of using basic

450
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:54,617
tabletop playing card game.

451
00:25:56,168 --> 00:26:01,711
rarity model that we hired a consultant to explain to us because we don't really know

452
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,431
anything about that.

453
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,832
Know your audience again.

454
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:10,075
We aren't experts in trading cards so we went and we sought help from people who really

455
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,417
knew the market and that turned out to be one of the wisest decisions we made.

456
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:25,213
We ended up doing 95 minutes of new, unique animation that is the main content that the

457
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:30,476
game plays back for you when you see the villains appear and when you do battle with them.

458
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,777
It's the equivalent of an interactive animated feature.

459
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:42,441
And this, because every installation could support any story point, my game designer

460
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:45,403
was able to write this attraction linearly.

461
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,058
which made him super happy,

462
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,060
because it's just a lot easier to write,

463
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,602
and also allowed some greater depth of storytelling,

464
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:56,183
because A can lead to B, which can lead to C,

465
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,625
which was something that just really wasn't possible

466
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:01,306
in the adventure game structure of Agent P.

467
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,428
So, I'll show you one of my favorite installations.

468
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:06,009
What's fun about the Mystic Portals

469
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,812
is they don't look like Mystic Portals.

470
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:12,413
So, this is an artist's rendering.

471
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,736
of a rock wall that becomes a mystic portal

472
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:21,158
and this is what the final installation looked like.

473
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:36,238
Well, the flower girl was wonderful to cast me.

474
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:37,639
But my medicine suffered no good back at the castle. You'd better see.

475
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,520
Unfortunately, the sorcerer and witch fairies have proven a bigger inconvenience than expected.

476
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,561
Then, prepare a trap to be turned against them first.

477
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:40,661
Phew!

478
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:18,324
So Maleficent has challenged the player here to a battle.

479
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:27,870
And that's them holding up their Prince Philip's Magic Sword card, which triggers a spell effect

480
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:45,770
blows the dragon up. So the interface is simply hold the car down in front of you. On agent

481
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:52,413
P, a cell phone, even if it is a very simplified interface, is a little hard for any kid under

482
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:55,474
seven years old. We had two-year-olds.

483
00:28:56,293 --> 00:29:00,454
casting spells and defeating villains and having a fabulous time.

484
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:04,795
Just because the interface was that easy.

485
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:09,676
It took a lot of magic and technology to make the interface that easy.

486
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:15,198
But this game is appropriate for much, much younger kids.

487
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:20,855
I think the most important lesson that we learned doing this one is kind of captured on this slide

488
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:25,779
in that in Agent P when people are waiting to play the game and they're sort of lined up,

489
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:31,803
they kind of stay separated from each other and stay back and let each player kind of go through

490
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,486
the experience themselves. With Sorcerers, again,

491
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:39,731
we were afraid about what was going to happen when lines got

492
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:43,115
big. But as it turns out, the longer the lines are for a

493
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:46,280
portal, the higher the guest satisfaction rating would go up.

494
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,004
And that was because people would start trading cards with

495
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,987
each other. They would just start to turn into these

496
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:54,951
impromptu card trading parties and people would talk about

497
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:58,232
their tactics for what they were going to do next

498
00:29:58,272 --> 00:29:59,513
and where they were in the story.

499
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,734
It was really very surprising to us

500
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:05,495
because it was so different from what happened

501
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,636
with the Kim Possible attraction.

502
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:13,098
Yeah, and so our guests, there's a large selection

503
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:14,439
of guests who come to Magic Kingdom now

504
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,820
who self-identify themselves as sorcerers.

505
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,301
And because the overall story is to protect

506
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:21,602
and enhance the kingdom.

507
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,770
They go out and commit what they call random acts of kindness,

508
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,511
where they take their extra cards

509
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:28,252
and they find small, adorable children

510
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:29,673
and they just give the cards away.

511
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:34,015
They also do things like hide them in places inside the park

512
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:38,118
and then put clues on Facebook for where they've hidden them

513
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,720
and create these sort of user-generated games

514
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,982
of hide and go seek in the park without any involvement

515
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:45,562
from us.

516
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,810
And talk a little bit about stupid programmer tricks,

517
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,771
as I like to call them.

518
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:53,992
Once we had this awesome game system,

519
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:58,435
Chris and I had an idea of just how to make it wacky.

520
00:30:58,936 --> 00:31:02,979
Right, so we ended up making this line of t-shirts,

521
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,861
which if you purchase and wear,

522
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,563
because the game is based on a fairly powerful

523
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,525
image recognition package,

524
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,867
we can tell if you're wearing this t-shirt

525
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:14,527
that we sold you.

526
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:19,069
And so we use that as a shortcut.

527
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,570
This was a master sorcerer T-shirt, which turns you into

528
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,870
a master sorcerer, which automatically boosts any spell

529
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,611
you cast to the maximum power level, which actually helps

530
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:30,431
you if you're playing one of the more difficult levels of

531
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:34,732
the game, where it matters how strong your spells are in

532
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,012
terms of whether or not you're going to be able to

533
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:36,613
defeat the villain.

534
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:41,053
Which brings up a good point about

535
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,874
underestimating certain things.

536
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:43,814
So.

537
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,263
you know, I didn't necessarily buy into the fact that

538
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:53,447
our guests could only play a game for three to ten minutes, but I kinda thought,

539
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:58,191
you know, maybe a half hour, an hour at a time. That's probably how long people will

540
00:31:58,211 --> 00:31:58,811
play the game.

541
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:03,195
And so the Easy Level was designed for that, for the person who,

542
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:06,397
you know, is going to come to Walt Disney World. They want to ride all the roller

543
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,098
coasters and

544
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,420
they want to spend maybe a half hour, maybe an hour playing this, and maybe

545
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,562
there'll be some people who play the whole game all the way through.

546
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:16,588
We should make it clear that easy is really more like a walking tour than an actual game.

547
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,811
If you hold a spell up, you win instantly.

548
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,213
But the summer before we opened, Chris and I were talking like,

549
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:30,577
Well, you know, it's just numbers. We can add a medium and a hard level. We'll do that really easy.

550
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:38,022
And so it takes about four, four and a half hours to complete the easy level, going through all the things.

551
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,694
maybe eight to ten hours to get through medium.

552
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:46,715
And if you didn't have the right cards on hard, you could not win.

553
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:47,455
It's not possible.

554
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:47,855
Yeah.

555
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,456
And so, but I figured, eh, big deal.

556
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:52,717
How many people are actually going to play hard?

557
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:57,358
Everybody played hard.

558
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:04,007
to the point that we had to turn it off and reengineer hard.

559
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:06,789
Because the fact that you couldn't complete it,

560
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:09,250
and really nobody could because this was early

561
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,832
in the game's opening and you needed a full deck,

562
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,393
really, to be able to complete hard.

563
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,555
Which is very difficult to get by randomly showing up

564
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,056
every day and getting your five spells.

565
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,237
So the people would go into the attraction

566
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:20,918
and never come out.

567
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:22,499
And they loved it.

568
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,180
And they loved it.

569
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,021
But what that would mean.

570
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:24,641
They would not leave.

571
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,163
The lines, they never.

572
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:27,344
It was not designed for them.

573
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,726
The lines don't go down when they don't come out

574
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,987
the other side of the door.

575
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,490
So that became a problem.

576
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,952
Yeah, and so we actually just launched a new version

577
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:39,876
of hard which we sort of pulled back hard.

578
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:43,839
Now it's as hard as it ever was but slightly more fair,

579
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,141
a little more designed to.

580
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,143
to be a partner.

581
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:53,104
Well, we solved it by giving you an award for how well you did as opposed to how long

582
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:53,804
you got beat up.

583
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:54,804
How long you got beat up.

584
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:58,545
So that there's an incentive to keep playing and go back and do it better the next time.

585
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:05,246
So my takeaway as a game designer was if you design a location-based game with the same

586
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:12,888
long play game mechanics that you would use in a photonic game, people will play it like

587
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,208
they will play a photonic game.

588
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,824
If we designed a game that lasted 200 hours,

589
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:19,426
people would play it for 200 hours.

590
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,908
There's no difference between what you guys do

591
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:24,530
and what people do in the real environment.

592
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,154
And because it's a very social game, people took it online.

593
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:32,656
I think there are many different Facebook groups.

594
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,458
This one has over 1,600 now.

595
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,903
Story interface choice, again, tell one story.

596
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:45,588
The interface had to match the park, which also had to match the stories that we were telling.

597
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:50,931
Merlin was a great main character. He didn't ruin the storytelling because as a magic user,

598
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,893
he can travel through time, he can travel from place to place.

599
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:58,657
He was a great character to shepherd our sorcerers through the story.

600
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:00,077
And...

601
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:06,752
I'll just end with a few slides from the last game that we opened.

602
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,935
This opened at the beginning of the summer and it's a Pirates Adventure,

603
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:11,577
Treasures of the Seven Seas.

604
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:14,600
And this is just a great big pirate adventure game.

605
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,401
It all takes place in Adventureland.

606
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:22,507
And I'll just show you some of the moments within the experience.

607
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:25,650
Again, did I mention we have a laser guy?

608
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:35,632
This is a giant 13-foot-high stone idol that opens its mouth to reveal an evil, pulsing,

609
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:36,932
glowing golden skull.

610
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:44,375
In one of the story points, you trick an evil captain into hauling away some cursed treasure,

611
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:50,238
and later on he calls you to a parlay and rises from the deep to tell you that he's

612
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:51,799
really, really unhappy with you.

613
00:35:55,762 --> 00:36:00,043
Designers realize that if you can have your players shoot a cannon, you've already won.

614
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:14,706
So, in conclusion, the design principles, the Mickey's Ten Commandments, good game design practices, just as you would in a photonic game,

615
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:24,188
can result in meaningful experiences for our guests that will keep them coming back over and over and over again.

616
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,127
and creating a strong, positively oriented community

617
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,508
among our players make the game experience

618
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:32,150
better for everyone.

619
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,572
So with that, I think we have some extra time in case

620
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,753
there are any questions.

621
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,754
We can go to questions and answers.

622
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:44,958
All right.

623
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,180
Thank you.

624
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,381
Thank you.

625
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:51,563
Thank you.

626
00:36:51,603 --> 00:36:53,584
Do you guys have any papers on any of those?

627
00:36:56,927 --> 00:37:04,348
The question is do we have white papers on the tech?

628
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,069
It's magic.

629
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:10,090
That is the official company line.

630
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,550
It's all magic.

631
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:15,871
Yes, sir.

632
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:30,368
The question is the Facebook site that we showed, was that created by Disney?

633
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:34,170
No, we didn't do any community building around it.

634
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:40,633
It all grew up organically from the people who come and trade the cards in the parks.

635
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:47,136
And that community expands out to people who just came and visited, loved the game, went

636
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:52,158
back to Texas or Illinois and they now trade the cards by mail and communicate through

637
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:52,899
this Facebook page.

638
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:53,239
So no.

639
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,243
I'd say there's seven or eight web pages dedicated to the attraction.

640
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:58,684
There's the Facebook page.

641
00:37:58,844 --> 00:37:59,864
There's a couple of blogs.

642
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:02,566
There's the forums on Vinylmation.

643
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:04,808
There's a number of...

644
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:09,631
But again, yeah, we didn't have any part in setting any of that up.

645
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:12,172
So, way in the back.

646
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:16,764
How do you turn the ROI off?

647
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:19,385
Like, when you're sitting down and you're drawing,

648
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:23,027
you're making a pretty big, you spent X amount of dollars

649
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:27,548
and you think you're gonna make a wide amount of money.

650
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,509
But what if you're doing the right thing?

651
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:31,589
What happens to the revenue?

652
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,790
So the question is, theme park economics.

653
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,671
How do you justify building one of these things?

654
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:41,913
I can't really talk about that.

655
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:43,653
However...

656
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:48,092
We do have methods for judging the value of attractions,

657
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,054
but I really can't talk about it in this forum.

658
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:51,235
Sorry.

659
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:54,458
Yes, sir.

660
00:38:57,901 --> 00:38:58,241
Pardon me?

661
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:02,985
The question is, how do you become an imagineer?

662
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:08,249
And in my case, probably random luck and persistence.

663
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:13,931
I became an Imagineer, I came right out of college,

664
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:16,072
and it was the first place I sent my resume,

665
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:19,253
and they said, thank you for your resume.

666
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:21,093
And so,

667
00:39:21,713 --> 00:39:23,994
Wow, they said, they actually got back to you

668
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:24,954
with a thank you.

669
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,095
Well, yeah, with the little

670
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,455
It was the 90s, so they don't do that anymore.

671
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,575
No, no, no, no, it was, it was,

672
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:30,976
they sent me a postcard with Mickey on it,

673
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:31,636
and said, we got it.

674
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:38,387
And so something about me not having any marketable skills,

675
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:39,348
something like that.

676
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:42,530
And so then somehow I wound up in video games.

677
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:48,434
And after working in video games and then working in toy

678
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:51,096
robots when I worked at LEGO, eventually I just kept

679
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:52,076
sending in a resume.

680
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:58,180
And then somebody saw it and said, oh, OK, I have a use for

681
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,360
you.

682
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,382
And then before I worked in theme parks, I spent

683
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,635
maybe five or six years just doing corporate research

684
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:08,476
and development as a sort of technical consultant

685
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,756
within the greater Disney organization.

686
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,477
So it was just random luck that I eventually wound up

687
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,118
in theme parks.

688
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:19,159
So I think everybody has their own strange story

689
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,280
about any job they get, right?

690
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,040
Mine was easy.

691
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,641
You hired me.

692
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:28,658
Or just know me.

693
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:30,160
Yes, know him.

694
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,564
So there are Imagineers who are architects.

695
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:37,186
There are Imagineers who are landscape architects.

696
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,668
There are Imagineers who are computer programmers.

697
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,049
There are ride designers.

698
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,730
There are engineers.

699
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,091
There are art directors.

700
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,953
There are concept designers.

701
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:46,815
There are storyboard artists.

702
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,457
There are 1,500 different disciplines, actually.

703
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:51,459
So you're not going to name them all.

704
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:53,688
I was going to try.

705
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:54,808
Okay.

706
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,049
All right.

707
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:56,949
We won't name them all.

708
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:59,090
We kind of do a little of everything.

709
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,250
Yes, sir.

710
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,331
I have a question about game balance.

711
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:16,654
How did you solve the problem of making it deep or challenging enough that a hard core gamer in this room can have fun with it, but little five-year-old Susie plays her card and she loses.

712
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,235
That can't be a good experience for a five-year-old.

713
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:26,927
So the default when you go and you sign up is that you're

714
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:30,108
automatically put on the easiest difficulty level, which

715
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,710
as I said earlier, is really more like a walking tour.

716
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,251
Any spell cast will defeat any villain on a single cast.

717
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:43,113
You have to actually complete the entire game, go back and

718
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:44,713
say, OK, I want to do this again.

719
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:48,615
And they'll ask you, well, would you like to try playing

720
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:49,075
on medium?

721
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:53,578
and they explain to you that you can lose now.

722
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:58,421
So generally, the really young kids

723
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,602
don't have the ability to do that

724
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:01,743
because as Jonathan pointed out,

725
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,365
the fastest that we can get through the game

726
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,448
is about four hours if we're doing the whole thing on easy

727
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:10,369
just because there's so much walking around.

728
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:16,518
27 different encounters I think before you finish the whole thing?

729
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,759
Something like that?

730
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,100
No.

731
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,341
Actually no, it's 36.

732
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:27,928
So, um, so, most, most of the really casual players aren't going to come back and, you

733
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,810
know, sign up for another four plus hour.

734
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,394
block of time out of their day at a theme park.

735
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,456
Well, the kids will, but the parents will rebel.

736
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:39,279
Yeah, the parents will say, no, we're going to go do pirates now, because I didn't pay

737
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:40,960
for all this to play video games.

738
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:50,388
So very specifically, there is a game play style in location-based entertaining that

739
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:55,192
you actually, you find a little bit in games, but not much.

740
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:56,633
And you can't discount it.

741
00:42:57,234 --> 00:43:00,497
Which is the treasure hunt in the real world game mechanics.

742
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,412
So say you're a heavy-duty grognard and you want super hard.

743
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:10,395
We can start you off on easy level because you're not familiar with the park.

744
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:14,617
So even if the combat is not particularly challenging on easy level,

745
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:20,439
you still have to find your way to all these locations marked on the map of the entire park.

746
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,041
Secondarily, we actually have some really wonderful storytelling.

747
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:27,743
The overarching story is that...

748
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:33,049
Hades, the evil god of the undead, wants to make the Magic Kingdom his summer home.

749
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:39,350
And to this end, he is sent, pain and panic, to steal Merlin's ultimate weapon, the Crystal

750
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:45,011
of the Magic Kingdom, because once that is out of Merlin's hands, Hades can invade.

751
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:47,592
There's a scuffle over the crystal.

752
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:50,472
The crystal is shattered and spread out across the entire theme park.

753
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:53,433
So you have to prevent Hades from getting the Crystal of the Magic Kingdom.

754
00:43:54,674 --> 00:44:00,645
And Hades, being passive-aggressive, just recruits other Disney villains to try and get the shards for him.

755
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:04,897
So you go through a huge nine chapter saga.

756
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:07,518
So if you're an advanced player, even though the combat

757
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:11,999
is not difficult, there's the just treasure hunt mechanic,

758
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,399
which is fun, and the fact that you haven't seen any of

759
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:15,079
this before.

760
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,200
So you get all the storytelling and what's going

761
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,740
to happen next and what characters am I

762
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,420
going to run into.

763
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,421
So you entertain them on easy mode.

764
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:24,681
When they go back on hard mode, all bets are off and

765
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:25,661
we're going to hurt them real bad.

766
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:30,242
So that's how we handle the level load balancing.

767
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:34,638
No matter what.

768
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:46,329
We don't care, actually. You can go right ahead and do that. Our

769
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:49,991
fans have developed their own systems for making it more

770
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:53,272
convenient to carry the cards. A lot of people just have images

771
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:57,754
of them on their phone. People have made apps that have them

772
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,075
sorted where they can bring them up and hold them. This works

773
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,356
great. This actually works better than a real card because

774
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:04,158
it's more magical.

775
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:07,783
I gotta catch myself there.

776
00:45:09,245 --> 00:45:11,168
But what we also found,

777
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,532
actually I think our consultant was telling us

778
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:19,740
that if you show up at a Magic of the Gathering tournament,

779
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:23,991
with a bunch of photocopied cards, you're kind of

780
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:29,314
embarrassed, right? Nobody wants to be seen with the knockoff

781
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:35,078
versions of these things. And so people really, really enjoy the

782
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:38,061
collecting aspect of it. And what they'll do is they'll

783
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:41,303
collect the cards, put them in mylar, lock them away and use

784
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:44,745
the image on their phone once they've got it because that way

785
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:49,829
they don't have to dog ear their mama Odie's voodoo.

786
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:56,632
Yeah, I mean, our business model, which again, I can't talk about, isn't based on selling

787
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:57,072
the cards.

788
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:04,358
So if they want to print out cards and have them all, and then they can keep their good

789
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:08,382
cards at home and not expose them to damage, we're all for it.

790
00:46:16,914 --> 00:46:18,914
looking at ways to incorporate smart phones,

791
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:20,974
since everybody at the park where I go now

792
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:22,875
spends their time in queue staring at a screen

793
00:46:22,895 --> 00:46:24,655
instead of looking at all the wonderful pre-show

794
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:26,275
that you guys do for all of your attractions.

795
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,156
Your next iteration of Sorcerer's or the Treasure Hunt,

796
00:46:31,176 --> 00:46:33,457
will that incorporate smart phones?

797
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,297
So the question is, have we thought about

798
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:37,377
incorporating phones ourselves?

799
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:39,078
Take that.

800
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:39,498
Sure.

801
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:49,055
Imagineering is all about looking at new technologies and finding new ways to tell stories.

802
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:53,657
So the answer is yes, we've been looking at that because obviously it's very powerful.

803
00:46:54,357 --> 00:46:58,619
If you look at the design of Agent P slash Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure,

804
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,560
you will see that it is designed not around the cell phone.

805
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,122
The cell phone really is just what I call a remote control for controlling the park.

806
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:12,848
So what the cell phone does is it causes you to look up and focus at areas of the park

807
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,550
that you otherwise wouldn't have visited.

808
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:20,054
When we ran the playtest, a lot of annual pass holders played it, and they wrote us letters,

809
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,637
and they said, I love this experience because I'm an annual pass holder,

810
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:27,720
I've been to that park maybe a couple hundred times, I never went there, ever.

811
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,162
Never went to this part of the park.

812
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:32,865
So we actually use the mobile phone experiences.

813
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,411
to direct them away from the one and a half by two inch screen

814
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:42,293
and back out into these wonderful worlds

815
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:44,354
that the Imagineers have created over the years.

816
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:47,495
But we don't have anything to announce specifically

817
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:48,915
about smartphones at this time.

818
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,297
The gentleman in the checked shirt.

819
00:47:59,707 --> 00:48:01,708
So the question was how we considered multiplayer.

820
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:05,492
We did not touch on this source of the magic kingdom

821
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:08,234
actually can be played in a multiplayer fashion.

822
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:13,319
The system, it's fairly simplistic,

823
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:16,722
but if you have a family with a couple of kids,

824
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:17,883
and they want to all.

825
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:19,785
When he says the system, he means the magic.

826
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:23,468
The magic, right, the magical system.

827
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:30,420
tuned so that, you know, if you have a couple of kids or even

828
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,162
three or four people, they can all hold up spells and it will

829
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:39,966
detect all of them, cast them all, and that way you can have,

830
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:42,968
you know, two kids play with their parents without having to

831
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:46,631
split up and go in different directions because if they did

832
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:49,533
that, the game would physically separate them. There's no way

833
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:52,135
to pair two groups together in the ‑‑ in the ‑‑

834
00:48:53,274 --> 00:48:53,954
in the attraction.

835
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:58,157
So as far as competitive multiplayer goes,

836
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,261
so it's something that we think about.

837
00:49:06,203 --> 00:49:09,966
With the competition, we like the guests pairing up

838
00:49:10,086 --> 00:49:13,129
together, uniting to defeat the villain.

839
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:19,515
We're not so much about, you know, Brenton and me

840
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:21,596
getting in a huge sorcery battle in the middle

841
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:24,258
of the Magic Kingdom and, you know, duking it out.

842
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:25,979
Because...

843
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:28,320
I think the game would have to match the story

844
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,321
that the park is telling.

845
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:29,701
Yes.

846
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:33,043
So if there was a park or a themed environment...

847
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:34,944
Better answer.

848
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:37,466
Which led to that and a technology that made sense

849
00:49:37,486 --> 00:49:40,207
from a story point of view, we absolutely would consider it.

850
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:44,250
We just, you know, you design for location-based

851
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:44,910
entertainment.

852
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:49,482
the location you're putting it makes a big difference to the story that you're telling.

853
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:58,889
But every park has its own requirements, it has stories that are correct, it must function

854
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:05,715
as a living organism. You would not believe how complicated it is to run a theme park.

855
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:06,736
It's mind-boggling.

856
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:16,828
The answer is, I think we absolutely would look at something multiplayer, we just haven't found the right application for that yet.

857
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:18,128
Yeah.

858
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:21,610
Yes, there in the front.

859
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:31,193
I know you've probably touched on this a little bit before, but when it comes to game design, story design, and location design,

860
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:38,395
and then contrasting that between what you're doing in theme parks versus what's done in video games, what...

861
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:41,847
similarities have you found between those two mediums?

862
00:50:41,968 --> 00:50:45,329
What differences have you found between those two mediums?

863
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:48,831
And also, are there any other any other surprises as far as like,

864
00:50:48,971 --> 00:50:52,573
people queuing up and spotting games and trading cards, things like that?

865
00:50:52,713 --> 00:50:57,156
Are there any other surprises you found that you didn't initially expect

866
00:50:57,196 --> 00:51:02,478
when it came to either the way you design things or the way things kind of naturally work?

867
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:06,135
Okay, so the question is the differences,

868
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:08,155
what are some differences that we've found

869
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:12,256
between designing for regular video games and for locations?

870
00:51:12,817 --> 00:51:15,837
And what things did we find that we did not expect?

871
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:16,958
It's a very good question.

872
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:23,659
One of the, we talked a little bit about

873
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,500
the theme park as a shared resource.

874
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,981
You can't double the ride capacity of Pirates of the Caribbean

875
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:31,461
by building another Pirates of the Caribbean right next to it.

876
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,483
So you have to be very efficient in your game play.

877
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:39,804
You have to, timing is very important.

878
00:51:39,884 --> 00:51:42,125
You have to know how long things take,

879
00:51:42,545 --> 00:51:45,006
how long it takes people to get from A to B on average,

880
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:46,466
how long they stand in a place.

881
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,507
You have to move them along.

882
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:49,387
You have to know that you're not going to be

883
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:50,368
in the parade route.

884
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:55,609
These are not things that you worry about in video games.

885
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,550
Now that's the five minute signal.

886
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:01,891
You also don't have to worry about maintenance.

887
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:09,510
And we have an army of people who are out there every night and every morning on all the attractions testing and fixing things.

888
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,211
Because mechanical things in games do not break generally.

889
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:25,514
From where in an aggressive environment like Tokyo or Hong Kong or Orlando, things break all the time.

890
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:39,739
I think the one thing to note that's a difference is the level of complexity, we don't want

891
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:45,703
to dumb the experiences down, but we do have to maintain a certain level of intuitiveness

892
00:52:46,003 --> 00:52:50,046
I think that goes beyond, we have to be able to explain how to do this in like 30 seconds

893
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:52,987
to anyone and they have to be able to get it, right?

894
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:54,929
We can't spend five minutes.

895
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:59,712
telling each guest exactly how to play the game or hand them a

896
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:03,754
manual or anything like that. Or they'll just immediately

897
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:09,617
disconnect and stop playing. So you really have to try and make

898
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:13,079
the experience as really intuitive and quick to pick up

899
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,281
for anyone as possible, right?

900
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:18,623
And safety is also something you don't generally have to worry

901
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:20,564
about in a video game, particularly in video games

902
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:22,245
where so many people get shot.

903
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:28,603
When I had you know I had to oh gosh, I had these genius ideas for Kim Possible

904
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:30,583
They're just you know just brilliant

905
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:36,325
I had this idea with a golf club and the guests would come up and they hit a rigged golf ball and the golf ball

906
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:41,847
Would follow a bizarre path and would always land in the hole and I'm pitching this idea to the operations people and they're like so

907
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,488
Let me get this straight theme park

908
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:45,768
thousands of people around

909
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,930
You're gonna give a five-year-old child a big metal club

910
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,011
Thank you

911
00:53:54,623 --> 00:53:54,983
Right.

912
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:55,143
Yeah.

913
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:55,363
Yeah.

914
00:53:55,383 --> 00:53:55,543
Yeah.

915
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:55,703
Yeah.

916
00:53:55,723 --> 00:53:56,523
Yeah.

917
00:53:57,644 --> 00:53:57,804
Yeah.

918
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:00,504
So that's another thing that people don't generally

919
00:54:01,064 --> 00:54:04,385
have to deal with regular video games.

920
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:06,626
Probably time for one more question.

921
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:08,806
Sorry.

922
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:10,727
Yeah.

923
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:11,047
Yeah.

924
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,928
Have you thought about actually letting

925
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:20,309
the player alter the course of the story?

926
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:22,029
We.

927
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:26,226
We have not implemented that in any of the attractions

928
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,127
that we've done, but there are definitely groups

929
00:54:29,488 --> 00:54:32,509
within Disney and R&D in Disney

930
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,532
who are looking at things like that,

931
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:39,633
but we currently haven't rolled anything out.

932
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:41,755
I think we still have time for one more question.

933
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:43,235
Yes, in the back.

934
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:45,937
I was just curious about the difference between

935
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:49,559
Loda in Orlando versus Anaheim.

936
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,880
So the question was why Orlando and not Anaheim.

937
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,860
Because every property has its own needs and its own agendas.

938
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:03,302
As I mentioned when we put Kim Possible in World Showcase,

939
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:08,083
there was a perception that there was not enough for kids to do in World Showcase.

940
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:12,824
And so there was a need and we fill it.

941
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:17,746
It would be great to just think I could come up with any idea I want and put it in any park.

942
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,652
But those parks are living organisms and they have needs

943
00:55:23,513 --> 00:55:27,135
and sometimes those needs come before an imagineer's desire

944
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:30,296
to just put something cool in the theme park.

945
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:35,059
And we'll probably hang out afterwards if anybody has any

946
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:36,800
more questions, but I think we're out of time.

947
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,181
I want to thank everybody for coming.

948
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,101
Yes, thank you very much for coming.

949
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:39,481
Thank you so much.
