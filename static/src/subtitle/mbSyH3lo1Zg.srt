1
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:07,792
Hello and welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,192
This is Mastering Combat,

3
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:12,253
Designing Mortal Kombat 11's Empowering Tutorial Mode.

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:13,093
I'm Brian Kessinger.

5
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,594
I'm a gameplay programmer over at NetherRealm Studios.

6
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:18,214
Just a little bit of housekeeping real quick.

7
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,435
This talk was originally scheduled

8
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:21,555
for GDC 2020 in San Francisco,

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,076
but that was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

10
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:29,557
I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe out there,

11
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:32,197
but I'm really excited to be able to give this talk digitally

12
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:33,658
and still deliver this content.

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,838
So let's dig in.

14
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,169
So let's go over an outline quick.

15
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:42,612
But first, just a note, though, the content of this talk

16
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:44,934
is going to be delivered through a fighting game.

17
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:48,577
Our approach is going to be accessible to anybody who's interested in teaching

18
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:52,140
a bunch of different mechanics to a wide player base

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,002
of all kinds of different skill levels.

20
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:58,866
So first, we'll talk about why we decided to build a new tutorial for a live game,

21
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,747
and we're going to do that through Injustice 2.

22
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,244
And also in Injustice 2, we're going

23
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,385
to talk about how we built roadmaps for each player

24
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,967
segment and define the taxonomy for the tutorial mode.

25
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,728
Then in Mortal Kombat 11, we'll show

26
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,409
how that taxonomy showed us what we

27
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,610
needed to build for the players.

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,792
Then we'll go through a bunch of different mechanics.

29
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:20,452
We'll list them out.

30
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,933
We'll talk about their design problems and their solutions

31
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,734
and things like that to show how we empowered players

32
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,235
through diverse feedback in Mortal Kombat 11.

33
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,169
We'll talk about our potential future,

34
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:34,732
so the future of the Netherrealm tutorials kind of moving forward.

35
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:38,896
And finally, we'll kind of give a checklist for your game

36
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:42,619
to use as a lens to to look at your tutorial through.

37
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,262
Just a quick content warning,

38
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:49,345
we are going to use using videos today of Mortal Kombat 11.

39
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,308
That is an M for mature game, so there will be blood and gore

40
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,151
and and stuff in these videos, so just be aware of that.

41
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,748
So first off, a little bit of history.

42
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:03,990
At NetherRealm Studios, we make 1v1 fighting games.

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,092
They're usually these 2.5D graphics.

44
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:10,375
These are really highly competitive fighting games, right?

45
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,197
The one you're looking at right now is Injustice 2,

46
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,618
which is our DC Comics fighter.

47
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:20,837
and then we'll show a little bit of Mortal Kombat 11 here.

48
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:24,257
These also have large cinematic story modes,

49
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,838
they have extensive single-player content,

50
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:29,399
and though Mortal Kombat 11 and Injustice 2

51
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,699
are both fighting games,

52
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,840
they're fairly different in their metas

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,380
and their core mechanics,

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,441
but the fundamentals of the fighting game remain the same.

55
00:02:57,483 --> 00:03:01,605
That's definitely one of my favorite fatalities in the game for sure.

56
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:02,906
OK, let's go through a little bit of history.

57
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,407
So this is a talk about the tutorial for MK11.

58
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:09,889
But before we really dig in, I want to give some historical context

59
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,991
about my personal journey and also the company's journey

60
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:13,911
to get to Mortal Kombat 11.

61
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:17,513
So I didn't really play many fighting games growing up.

62
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:21,935
I did have a Super Nintendo where we did have Street Fighter II Turbo.

63
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,657
I remember kind of just mashing buttons against my brother and whatnot.

64
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:25,837
But.

65
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,683
Mostly growing up, I played a lot of competitive shooters, especially in my teen years.

66
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:33,846
I love to compete and I'm a very competitive person.

67
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,829
But I would always try to get into fighting games,

68
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,312
but I would play them for about a month before dropping them.

69
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:43,154
I just couldn't really understand the fundamentals.

70
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:49,180
I couldn't get to that competitive level that I wanted to, that I was used to playing in games.

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,763
And every game I would think this is it, right?

72
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:55,265
This is going to be the fighting game that I get into.

73
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:58,588
And, you know, this was I did this with Street Fighter four.

74
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:02,872
I did this with Marvel versus Capcom three and all of these kind of to the same fate.

75
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,974
Right. I would play them for a little while.

76
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:09,438
I would recognize how difficult they are, how how complex the systems are

77
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,841
to understand, and I would just inevitably drop them.

78
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,057
So if we fast forward a little bit to PAX East 2011,

79
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,979
that's a convention out in Boston.

80
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,359
Me and my friends go to that every year.

81
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,781
We love going out there to kind of play the unreleased games

82
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,202
and connect with the gaming community.

83
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,142
And this was about, in PAX East 2011,

84
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:31,763
this was about a month before

85
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,024
Mortal Kombat 9 was being released.

86
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,025
And I remember playing the demo

87
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,146
on the show floor at PAX East.

88
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,287
And again, right, I hit that same mentality of like,

89
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,588
this is gonna be the fighting game I get into.

90
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,388
This is it, this is finally the one.

91
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:49,259
And so we played the demo at PAX and we loved it.

92
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,501
We loved it. It was awesome.

93
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,123
It was this gory spectacle.

94
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,088
It was this ridiculous, over-the-top fighting game

95
00:04:55,088 --> 00:05:00,095
that, you know, we had nostalgia for as kids playing, you know, Mortal Kombat 2.

96
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:00,295
But.

97
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:02,574
This was in 3D now, right?

98
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:05,275
This is these graphics were incredible.

99
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,396
So we played the demo.

100
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:10,158
And I remember getting this crazy, ridiculous T-shirt from the developers

101
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,860
after completing the demo.

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,142
And, you know, as a teenager, you're stoked, right?

103
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,943
You got to talk to the developer.

104
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:20,965
You you got this amazing T-shirt and you can't wait to wear it.

105
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,687
You can't wait to play the game when it comes out.

106
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:29,850
So the game finally comes out and I buy the $150 collector's edition that came with this

107
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,513
tournament stick, which you can actually still see. I still have it's right over there.

108
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:41,055
And this was it, right? Like, how could I possibly fail? This was going to be the fighting game I

109
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:44,977
was going to get into, right? I have the stick and everything. I have to be good at this one.

110
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,696
Turns out, no.

111
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:51,919
I remember going to college and getting absolutely destroyed

112
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,479
by my roommate playing this game.

113
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,282
And sure enough, about a month later, I dropped it again.

114
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,263
So if we fast forward again to 2016,

115
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:04,026
I'm finishing my master's in Chicago.

116
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:07,167
And I get a job at NetherRealm Studios,

117
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,309
ironically working on fighting games.

118
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,369
So.

119
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,633
The irony is obvious there.

120
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,555
I had never been super into fighting games and I'd always tried,

121
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:18,976
but I just couldn't break through that barrier.

122
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,277
But I was stoked regardless. Right.

123
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,778
I'm working in video games. This is my dream.

124
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:25,559
So maybe I'd finally learn to play a fighting game.

125
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:28,681
Maybe this was finally the time that working on a fighting game

126
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:29,982
would finally get me to learn.

127
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:35,124
So during development, I tried learning to play.

128
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,646
No, again, not too much avail, though.

129
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,827
I really needed some structure, but the tutorial wasn't done yet.

130
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,947
Co-workers would try to help me.

131
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:50,414
They would try to, you know, give me some advice, but I would kind of just go into practice mode and flail around.

132
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:51,715
I didn't really know what I was doing.

133
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:58,655
So, and also the tutorial at NetherRealm is commonly kind of deprioritized in the development cycle.

134
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:03,457
It's usually built a few months out from ship, three to six months it starts being worked on.

135
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:08,879
And that's because of our two-year tight development cycle, on top of the fact that

136
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,521
the game's kind of always changing during development and it's hard to build a tutorial

137
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,362
for a game that's not fully designed yet.

138
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,001
So I needed some structure.

139
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,328
I needed some handholding in order to learn

140
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,273
because I needed to be taught from the ground up.

141
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,440
I needed to learn fighting games at their core.

142
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:28,618
So if we fast forward a little bit again,

143
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:30,239
we're just about to launch Injustice 2.

144
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:33,261
And the user and focus testing that's

145
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,623
coming back about the game is that the first time user

146
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,544
experience is in pretty rough shape.

147
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:42,687
Injustice 2 had some complicated RPG type mechanics

148
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:45,149
that weren't being understood super well.

149
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,510
And on top of that, the tutorial was just

150
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,312
in kind of a rough state.

151
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:53,194
So let's talk about that launch tutorial.

152
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,093
So this launch tutorial taught what was new in this fighting game

153
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,156
without ever teaching fighting games as a whole.

154
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:07,120
The tutorial kind of assumed that you'd already played fighting games

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,162
and you were coming in with some pre-existing knowledge.

156
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:11,503
It was completely linear too.

157
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:17,288
So if you struggled with one lesson, you wouldn't have access to the next lesson.

158
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,890
So it was kind of excluding content.

159
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:27,562
There was also no menu context for progress throughout the tutorial or how long the lesson was,

160
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,544
which kind of led to this education fatigue of like,

161
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:36,026
what am I doing, where am I going, how long is this, can I stop now type of mentality.

162
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,593
Also, in this tutorial, the difficulty ramped up way too quickly.

163
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:47,580
We have some data that shows that this one specific lesson on special move cancels

164
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,563
had about 10 times the average dropout of the other lessons.

165
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:55,969
And we'll talk about this more later, so remember that lesson specifically, the special move cancels.

166
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:08,291
And to make matters a little bit worse, there's this first time user experience pop-up that gets triggered when you click on single player for the first time.

167
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:13,554
So if a player goes to play story mode, they click single player, a pop-up comes up and it's like,

168
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,976
Hey, we noticed you haven't played the game before. Do you want to try the tutorial?

169
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:20,418
So it funnels them into the tutorial to start with.

170
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,579
And it kind of creates this broken player loop

171
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,961
from the beginning because the tutorial is not in great shape.

172
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,562
It ramps up in difficulty too quickly.

173
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:29,103
It excludes content.

174
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:32,785
All those reasons we just talked about, right?

175
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:38,028
And that user research report kind of told us this.

176
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,588
And it kind of exposed this for us.

177
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:42,190
But we didn't have enough time to fix it before launch.

178
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,651
This is something we would have to address later.

179
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,123
So here's a video of Injustice 2 at launch.

180
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:51,686
You can see here, here's the pop-up that pushes you to the tutorial.

181
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:53,948
If you select it, you'll jump right into gameplay.

182
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:57,011
If you hit yes here, you'll jump right into the tutorial immediately.

183
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:59,754
But if we select no, we can actually go to the tutorial menu

184
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:02,637
and we can show you what this menu looks like at launch.

185
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,958
So it's kind of just this linear menu.

186
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,738
You can see those red items are locked out

187
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,438
because you haven't completed basics.

188
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,799
You don't get access to environment or combos or special moves.

189
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,559
And there's no progress there, right?

190
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,119
You can't see what you've done, what you've completed, et cetera.

191
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,260
So the higher ups gave us a the go ahead

192
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,960
to fix the first time user experience with a strike team.

193
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,400
So the first thing we wanted to do was fix the tutorial.

194
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,954
Because if we can't teach players to play our game,

195
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:40,877
how do we expect to retain or grow our player base?

196
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:44,080
This right here is kind of the mission statement

197
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,842
of this whole effort, right?

198
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,844
We want players to play our game.

199
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,727
We want them to play for longer.

200
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:51,908
We have to fix this.

201
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:51,948
So.

202
00:10:56,044 --> 00:11:00,167
The Injustice 2 Legendary Edition we knew was going to launch the following year.

203
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:04,769
This was our kind of like enhanced edition, including all the DLC we'd be launching.

204
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:05,850
We knew this was coming.

205
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,933
And we knew Mortal Kombat 11 pre-production was starting soon.

206
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:16,377
So we knew this would happen again for a future game if we didn't fix it now.

207
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:25,586
And during development of a new game, the meta of that game and the design of that game is constantly changing, right?

208
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:32,731
So it's hard to design a tutorial from scratch while you're also building the game that you're trying to teach.

209
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:37,214
So our idea would be to build a new tutorial and it would be a foundation for games to come, right?

210
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,141
And we would build it for the Injustice 2 Legendary Edition.

211
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,962
We would ship it for this live game.

212
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:47,865
And we would use the existing Injustice 2 Launch Edition

213
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,345
to build this new tutorial.

214
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,367
Because the game's already designed, right?

215
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,788
So now we have that foundation to work with.

216
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,468
This was super exciting for me personally.

217
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:58,411
I didn't work on the launch tutorial,

218
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:02,614
but now being on this strike team, I would have an opportunity to build the tools I wish I had

219
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:04,636
when I was trying to learn Mortal Kombat 9,

220
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:08,600
when I was trying to learn Street Fighter 4, or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,363
All those times when I had tried to get into fighting games and failed,

222
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:16,187
I would have a chance to try and build some tools for players

223
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,068
so that they didn't have those same experiences.

224
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:27,105
So let's talk about the Injustice 2 Legendary Edition, the all-in-one package edition that would launch with our new tutorial.

225
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:31,266
This would have to solve the hard problems in an existing product, right?

226
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:34,488
And we're going to launch that with this Legendary Edition SKU.

227
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:40,178
This was kind of similar to a format that the company was already familiar with.

228
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:43,620
We had reworked our networking model

229
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,161
to become this G.G.P.O.

230
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,864
rollback networking type for Mortal Kombat XL.

231
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:52,927
So we had used Mortal Kombat X as a foundation to rework our networking model

232
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:53,988
to launch the Mortal Kombat XL.

233
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,570
Right. And you can see Mike Stallone's 2018 GDC talk,

234
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,852
eight frames and 16 milliseconds.

235
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:02,154
I think it's called rollback networking and Mortal Kombat as well.

236
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,398
Check that out if you're interested in that.

237
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:09,003
But the point is that the company was familiar with this idea of like,

238
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,907
let's use the existing products, let's leverage that,

239
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,893
and launch and kind of test this new feature that we want

240
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,897
in this legendary edition, this Mortal Kombat XL edition

241
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,399
that's coming out in the future.

242
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,951
So the Legendary Edition tutorial.

243
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:25,972
So this is kind of the constraints we were working

244
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,653
with during development.

245
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,976
We had six months, we had one designer in Michael Balapani,

246
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,497
he was the lead designer on this mode.

247
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,879
And we had one programmer in me,

248
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,681
and we also had the resources of the UI UX team.

249
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:41,283
But it's important to note here that these people

250
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,885
all had their own responsibilities as well,

251
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:46,687
outside of working on this tutorial

252
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,949
for the Injustice 2 Legendary Edition.

253
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:49,049
So,

254
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:52,041
Time was kind of of the essence, right?

255
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,952
Like we only had so many resources.

256
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,776
OK, so let's talk about our player segments.

257
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:02,437
These player segments are usually defined by your publisher

258
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,737
or your marketing teams.

259
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:08,238
Usually, usually companies have these kind of already built out for you.

260
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,459
If not, you should ask and you should try and create these.

261
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,620
These are super useful.

262
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,740
But kind of before we dive into the chart,

263
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,501
despite the fact that we're in fighting games,

264
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:21,721
we have a really wide variety of player bases

265
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,562
that engage with our product in all kinds of different ways.

266
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:30,451
So this chart here has skill going up and retention going to the right.

267
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:32,032
We have campaigners and couch players.

268
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:36,434
These are kind of lower skilled groups of players and they don't retain as well.

269
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:40,036
They kind of play the story mode and they usually kind of drop the game.

270
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,639
Then we have the Dabblers, who are kind of in the middle, right?

271
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,763
They retain fairly well in our middling skill group.

272
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,525
And then we have the Connoisseurs,

273
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,689
which are high retention, highly skilled players.

274
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,494
They kind of engage in all different types of modes after trying them as a Dabbler.

275
00:14:57,494 --> 00:15:01,419
And then, finally, we have the PvP Online group, which is...

276
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,512
Almost like your competitive multiplayer.

277
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,252
Not almost it is your competitive multiplayer group of players,

278
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:13,353
usually players who are interested in watching e-sports and that type of thing.

279
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,134
And these players retain really well, but they're incredibly skilled.

280
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:19,875
So all these different player segments,

281
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,196
they come in with different fighting game experiences,

282
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:27,437
and they all want different experiences out of our fighting game.

283
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:34,073
So if you look at the chart here, players participating in modes that require more skill

284
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:36,015
are generally retained better.

285
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:39,478
And this is completely conjecture, but it's likely because they're better at the game

286
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,720
and they just enjoy it more.

287
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,544
So the idea is to build a tutorial roadmap that would allow these players to increase

288
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:50,227
their engagement and potentially move to the next segment.

289
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,770
And we're going to do that by reducing the barriers that they run into.

290
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,892
We're going to provide them all types of feedback,

291
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:59,676
and we're going to pace out the content as much as we possibly can.

292
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:03,680
So let's take a look at our taxonomy.

293
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,862
This is kind of the structure we decided on,

294
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:08,364
and we're going to walk through how we decided on that as well.

295
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,907
So we have three sections representing

296
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:15,030
three different types of preparedness for play.

297
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,272
We have the basic section.

298
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,159
which prepares the player for story mode and couch versus.

299
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,163
We want these players to play these modes

300
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,684
without button mashing.

301
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,686
And they're gonna do that

302
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:29,190
by playing through the basics of our tutorial mode.

303
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,611
It covers all core mechanics.

304
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:33,264
And it's as easy as possible.

305
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,465
That is really crucial here.

306
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:37,987
Also, it's available before the game finishes installing.

307
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:41,129
So if you've played games on Xbox and PlayStation,

308
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:43,230
you'll notice that when you start installing it,

309
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,314
it'll have that like playable state on the progress bar on the install progress.

310
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:53,477
And this part of the tutorial mode, the basics part is in the launch chunk,

311
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,618
meaning as soon as it hits that playable mark,

312
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:58,920
the basics of the tutorial is available and ready for players.

313
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,830
The second section is the advanced section.

314
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,452
This prepares the player for extended single player modes,

315
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:07,912
so after story mode.

316
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:12,094
And it finishes covering all remaining mechanics.

317
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:15,816
So if you've completed basics and you've completed advanced,

318
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,816
you've now been exposed to and taught

319
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:19,237
every mechanic in the fighting game.

320
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,802
And lastly, is the strategy section.

321
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:26,324
The strategy section prepares the player

322
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:27,884
for online multiplayer.

323
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,485
It covers the risks and rewards

324
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:32,787
of all different type of common gameplay scenarios.

325
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,588
And this is content we've never taught before.

326
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,009
The advanced section and the basic section

327
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,971
was mostly taught in the original launch tutorial,

328
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,952
but now we're kind of spreading out that content

329
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,772
through all different types of feedback.

330
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,134
So it's kind of spread out and paste out much better

331
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,134
for the player.

332
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,495
Whereas the strategy section is all new content.

333
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:56,190
So here's a top-level menu screenshot for Injustice 2.

334
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,270
There's more granular categories inside these sections.

335
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,431
So you have the basic section, the advanced,

336
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,451
and the combat strategy.

337
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,071
There's also characters here.

338
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:08,492
That's the character-specific tutorials.

339
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:11,012
There's also a tutorial for every single character

340
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:11,772
in the game.

341
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,973
We're not going to touch on that today in this talk.

342
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:16,173
That's kind of a separate talk.

343
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,554
And that content didn't really change much

344
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:19,634
from the launch tutorial.

345
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:19,714
So.

346
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:23,516
And lastly, there's also a practice cell here as well.

347
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:26,518
So this is kind of your one stop shop for learning.

348
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:29,480
This is the learn hub, as we call it.

349
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,702
But we're going to be focusing on basics, advanced and strategy.

350
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:32,962
So the taxonomy.

351
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:40,306
It's fully a la carte.

352
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,387
This structure is fully a la carte.

353
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,728
We are eliminating as many content barriers as possible.

354
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:49,108
We're not going to say, if you can't complete this one,

355
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,829
you don't have access to this one.

356
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,229
You might understand the concept,

357
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:54,330
but it might be really difficult to perform.

358
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,131
We want you to have access to the next lesson regardless.

359
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,491
But it is, the whole tutorial is still intended

360
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:02,552
to be played linearly,

361
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,772
because we are building on previous concepts quite a bit.

362
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:10,739
This hierarchy also allows for way better content bucketing.

363
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:13,141
It also allows us to celebrate at different scales

364
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,762
and reward at different scales.

365
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,943
So the player's just going to feel better

366
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:20,106
because we've kind of structured this content more.

367
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:22,167
It's way less of a flat hierarchy.

368
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,350
We're going to celebrate them more and give them more rewards.

369
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,519
And you can see that here.

370
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,145
So at a Justice 2's launch, we rewarded the player just one time.

371
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:34,127
And that was at the end of the tutorial.

372
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:38,633
And it was only for it was for 500 Source Crystals, which is our premium currency

373
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,977
that players can use in game to buy skins and all types of other stuff.

374
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:47,322
For the Injustice 2 Legendary Edition, every lesson we reward you with a Mother Box,

375
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:51,206
and after every category we reward you with more Source Crystals.

376
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:55,871
And if you complete one of the sections, we give you an exclusive piece of Batman gear.

377
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:59,874
So these rewards create incentives for players because,

378
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:04,719
you have to remember, the tutorial, people still have to want to learn.

379
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,882
So by giving them these rewards, it incentivizes them to play.

380
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:15,200
Okay, so let's take a look at this learn hub right here in this video.

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,703
So this, you can see here, there's these progress bars.

382
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,365
It gives them a better sense of completion.

383
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:26,310
In the old tutorial, you had no idea where you were in relation to the bigger picture, right?

384
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,893
So here's the inside of the advanced section.

385
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,715
You can see we're scrolling through the categories here.

386
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:35,178
And now on the right, each category is updating its lessons in that list.

387
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,216
Yeah, these progress bars are great because players would often ask, like,

388
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:45,622
how close am I to being done, or did it even save my progress?

389
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:50,829
So it's also important to note that after a player completes a category,

390
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,351
we force them back to this menu.

391
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:57,633
We don't let them continue on to the next lesson because we want them to see their progress.

392
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,694
We want to show them that it's okay to stop playing.

393
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,635
Go play the actual game with what you've learned.

394
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:07,576
And this is kind of pacing out the content much better for players.

395
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:10,998
We don't want them to complete this all in one sitting.

396
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:14,739
There's a lot of content here's hours of content.

397
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,920
If they do complete it in one sitting, they're not really likely to retain too much.

398
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
So we want them to go play the game.

399
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,806
Okay, so remember our player segments from before?

400
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,527
We're gonna combine these player segments

401
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:28,388
with our new taxonomy.

402
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,089
So here's the taxonomy that we have,

403
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,991
basics, advanced, and strategy, right?

404
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,072
And let's combine the two.

405
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,973
So when we combine the two, here's what we get.

406
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:39,735
You have campaigners and couch players.

407
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:41,417
If they complete basics,

408
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,918
they're much more likely to become dabblers, right?

409
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,279
They're ready for that content

410
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,501
that dabblers are participating in.

411
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,143
And the same goes for completing advanced as a dabbler.

412
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,724
You're ready to become a connoisseur.

413
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,006
This is kind of our roadmap, right?

414
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,607
We need to give players options

415
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,330
and ways to engage with our product.

416
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,430
So.

417
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,204
Really the goal here is if we can graduate those bottom players to the dabblers section,

418
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:09,809
where they're equipped with enough knowledge to participate in all the modes of the game,

419
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,932
they're much more likely to continue playing for longer.

420
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:17,456
Dabblers retain three and a half times as much as campaigners and couch players do.

421
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:21,719
And the same goes for graduating a dabbler to a connoisseur.

422
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:24,620
Connoisseurs retain two and a half times as much as dabblers do.

423
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,142
Ultimately, we do want players to play what they want to play

424
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:30,083
and play what they're interested in, though.

425
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:34,305
So if a couch player who's playing, you know, mostly local versus

426
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:38,106
against their friend really only enjoys the multiplayer aspects of our game,

427
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:42,943
Well, we need to give them an avenue to get to PVP online.

428
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:45,224
We need to give them this roadmap.

429
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,425
You know, they might have to do a lot of work to get there

430
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:52,086
and play some other content along the way, but we need to give them that option.

431
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:55,127
We need to show them that path that that's possible to do.

432
00:22:57,895 --> 00:23:04,900
So here's just a little bit of data about going from Injustice 2's launch tutorial to Injustice 2's legendary edition.

433
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,164
The Injustice 2 launch tutorial had 6 lessons and 15 exercises.

434
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:15,828
Remember seeing that linear list with the red words blocked out for each lesson?

435
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:20,051
And the Injustice 2 legendary edition had this...

436
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,401
54 lessons and 80 exercises.

437
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:27,025
This is a large explosion of content to launch with the Legendary Edition.

438
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:32,209
Also, because we paste it out much better and we go into much deeper detail as well.

439
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:38,835
And so we launched the Legendary Edition tutorial and people really liked it.

440
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:43,539
Not many people really want to play a new tutorial a year after the game's launch,

441
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:46,902
but from those who did play, it was received really well.

442
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:55,549
And so, here's a video of Mortal Kombat 11, and the tutorial that we launched with Mortal Kombat 11.

443
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:02,993
This is the same structure, this taxonomy, this foundation that we built in Injustice 2's Legendary Edition,

444
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,294
this paid dividends for us in Mortal Kombat 11.

445
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:09,944
So after the legendary edition of Injustice 2,

446
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:13,126
we knew what the menu structure would look like.

447
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:15,428
We knew what content we needed to teach

448
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:16,568
to teach fighting games.

449
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,529
And then we would just layer on top

450
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,471
the content we would have to teach to teach MK11.

451
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:25,213
This allowed us to spend a ton of time building flexibly

452
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,554
from the engineering side,

453
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:30,416
while also refining and streamlining existing content

454
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,357
from the design side.

455
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:35,359
So for the rest of this talk, we're going to be using Mortal Kombat 11 as an example,

456
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,341
despite the fact that some of the features we're going to talk about were conceived for Injustice 2.

457
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:46,084
Oh, and one more thing. The most important change we made from Injustice 2's Legendary Edition

458
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:52,027
to Mortal Kombat 11's tutorial is that we changed all C's to K's because...

459
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:54,750
Well, Mortal Kombat.

460
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,731
OK, there's not all C's to K's, but there's rules to this.

461
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,232
You'd have to ask Ed Boon, though.

462
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:05,193
It's some complex rules.

463
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,954
OK, so deciding on mechanics, we're

464
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:09,655
going to walk through how we decided

465
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:11,936
on what mechanics to build.

466
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,396
We're going to go over a bunch of mechanics

467
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:15,777
individually here to show how they empower players

468
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:17,317
with diverse feedback.

469
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:20,138
And we're also going to include design problem statements

470
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,619
and our solutions for them.

471
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:28,790
So we have to solve the most common problems players encounter in a specific section.

472
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,031
We need to teach through as many forms of feedback as we can.

473
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,212
And we have to solve the problems that relate to that section's goals.

474
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,192
So let's dive into that one a little bit deeper.

475
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:43,693
So if we have basics, advanced, and strategy.

476
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:47,614
First, I should note that the granularity here isn't important.

477
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,155
It's more about the process here.

478
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:52,555
So we have basics, advanced, and strategy.

479
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:59,721
The goals of basics are to teach the player to play story mode without button mashing,

480
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:02,624
it's to cover core mechanics, and it's as easy as possible.

481
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:09,189
And so, in order to meet these goals, we have a set of concepts that we need to teach.

482
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:19,098
And those concepts are movement, blocking, throws, environment interaction, special moves, basic combos, and fatal blows.

483
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:25,257
These mechanics teach the concepts through various forms of feedback.

484
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:29,699
Or I should say rather, the mechanics that we're going to be teaching are

485
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:32,980
teaching these concepts through various forms of feedback, through visual

486
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,581
feedback, through auditory feedback, all different types of visual feedback as

487
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:39,302
well, we're going to dive into all of that.

488
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:43,263
Um, so let's look at advanced, the advanced, the goals of advanced are.

489
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,747
to teach the player to play extended single player modes.

490
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:49,790
And it's also to finish covering the remaining mechanics.

491
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,476
So in order to meet these goals, we have to teach these concepts.

492
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,339
Special move cancels, jump in attacks, et cetera, et cetera.

493
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,081
Right. There's a list of these things.

494
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:01,604
And we can do the same for strategy as well.

495
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:07,809
Here we're going to be teaching online competitive multiplayer and we want to cover the risks and

496
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:13,914
rewards of a bunch of gameplay options, right? Not what these options are, but how to use them

497
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:19,259
in battle. And so there's a list of concepts where we need to teach here as well. Again,

498
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,302
remember that the granularity here isn't as important.

499
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:27,186
So we need to find the biggest bang for our buck when teaching these mechanics.

500
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:30,535
So an example is that the basic section

501
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,037
is to prepare the player for story mode.

502
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:36,279
Combos and how to input them are fundamental for story mode

503
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,580
and the game as a whole.

504
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,921
Newcomers really struggle to understand this system,

505
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,703
the combo system, and they're intimidated by it.

506
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:47,025
So our solution was the combo windows.

507
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:47,785
Combo windows.

508
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:51,567
Let's walk through our design problem statement here.

509
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:58,204
Players have difficulty understanding the input system and when to press buttons to execute a combo.

510
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:04,375
Combos are fundamental for basic play and essential for a good experience.

511
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,038
Excuse me. So our solution...

512
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:13,594
is to expose the input system in a visual way that shows players how combos can be performed

513
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:18,755
and provides concise feedback. This module we're about to walk through is intended to

514
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:27,077
be an in-game coach. That concise feedback portion of this solution is incredibly important.

515
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:31,518
Okay, so here's our combo windows. This video is going to loop, so we're going to walk through it.

516
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,579
The input system in general works as a buffer.

517
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,523
The combo system is sometimes referred to as a dial-in system.

518
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:43,586
This means that you can buffer or dial in inputs way ahead of when they're needed.

519
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:48,088
As long as you press a button before that button's deadline,

520
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:49,628
then it will be read by the system.

521
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:55,731
This means that combos in NetherRealms games are almost never timing-based.

522
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:58,772
You don't have to wait for one punch to land

523
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:01,733
before pressing the next button in the combo.

524
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:03,889
That would be called the link.

525
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,793
That's a whole nother concept we could teach later,

526
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,336
but we don't really have many links in our game.

527
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:11,979
There are a few, but you don't have to wait

528
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,022
for the first punch to land

529
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:15,624
in order to press the second button.

530
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,326
That's what's most important.

531
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,869
And combos are essentially, for example,

532
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:23,771
press these three buttons and the character

533
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:25,333
outputs these three attacks in a row.

534
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:29,576
So we workshopped a ton of different solutions

535
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:32,478
for this module in particular.

536
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:35,480
We started mapping out these Guitar Hero-esque highways

537
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,722
where buttons were flowing down and stuff.

538
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,585
We user tested a lot of these things.

539
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:45,728
This particular format solved our initial goals,

540
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:49,070
and it also ironed out some of the kinks that we were dealing with

541
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,031
with some of the other formats.

542
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:55,934
So this solves the original set of issues, right?

543
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:58,015
It exposes the input system.

544
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:01,717
And it doesn't also say to the player that there's one timing

545
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,178
for completing a combo.

546
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,380
That's important because as long as you're before the deadline,

547
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,701
the button will be accepted.

548
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:15,138
So if you explain this to a newcomer, performing these combos becomes much, much easier.

549
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:19,319
Both anecdotally and through guerrilla testing, people were just not inputting the buttons

550
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,019
fast enough.

551
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,820
They just needed to be told that.

552
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,161
They just needed to be told you have to do it faster.

553
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,802
This is what we mean when we say this module is a type of coach.

554
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:31,924
It tells you what you're doing wrong and it gives you actionable feedback.

555
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:39,252
So this module covers a ton of potential problems different players might have through a variety of visuals.

556
00:30:39,252 --> 00:30:43,316
If you execute the combo but miss all the attacks, the windows are orange.

557
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:46,019
It's this type of like soft fail type of situation.

558
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:53,328
Whereas the green of the success state really pops off to let the player know that what they did was correct.

559
00:30:54,402 --> 00:31:00,505
In the worst case scenario here, a timeout will occur and that will point the player to the demo feature.

560
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:04,766
You can kind of see that in the top right over here in just a second.

561
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,827
That message that's popping out, it's a little bit.

562
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:08,248
Yeah, we're going to slide over.

563
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:08,788
Yep.

564
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:11,649
So press the pad button to see the correct timing.

565
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:14,530
We're going to go over the demo feature in a little bit, so don't worry about that.

566
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:20,069
So a player may not understand the windows, right?

567
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:24,393
It might be a little bit confusing on how to,

568
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:26,774
you know, just interpret the windows.

569
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:29,056
So that failure reason,

570
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,598
and the context that the failure reason is providing,

571
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,499
is super, super important.

572
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:35,321
And the failure reason, again,

573
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,822
it's contextual to your result.

574
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:38,183
So depending on what you did,

575
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,984
it will give you a different reason.

576
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:47,473
So we need to be able to catch these players at different points of failure and provide them actionable feedback.

577
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:50,755
This is why the variety of feedback here is so important.

578
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:59,048
So when we brought this system over from Injustice 2, you can see up top here, this is the Injustice 2 Legendary Edition version,

579
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,429
and on the bottom is the Mortal Kombat version.

580
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:04,771
It's kind of walking through the same combo, showing you the differences.

581
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:10,035
But I'm going to talk about the differences right now, too, to expose them to you.

582
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:12,456
So in Injustice 2, there was this two-pass system.

583
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:18,000
One was detecting the immediate feedback of the button to see if you pressed the correct button,

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,403
and then the second pass was to see if you output the correct move.

585
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:25,225
So you can see here there's green check marks but red boxes.

586
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:27,507
That's just confusing.

587
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:31,250
So it's kind of leading to this excess of information.

588
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,511
It's like, well, what did I do wrong?

589
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,433
The box was red but the check box was green.

590
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,315
I don't really understand.

591
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,056
So we got rid of that for Mortal Kombat 11.

592
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:51,287
In more combat 11 it's surrendering the feedback, the immediate feedback, in favor of more concise actionable feedback.

593
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:58,969
These windows, they happen so fast that the lack of immediate feedback is really just relative and it's not really missed by the player.

594
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:00,109
So again, this is...

595
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,790
not necessarily meant to be read and understood.

596
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,432
It's just showing here, this is the flowchart of the windows from Injustice 2 Legendary Edition

597
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,453
to the Mortal Kombat 11 version,

598
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:16,434
and showing how simple the Mortal Kombat 11 version is in comparison to the Injustice 2 version.

599
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,475
So, again.

600
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:25,439
The lack of feedback isn't really missed because it was relatively too short anyway.

601
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:31,108
And at the end of the windows, we give a single reason along with a piece of contextual feedback to that result.

602
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:32,270
That's what's most important.

603
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,435
And because the tool itself is simpler,

604
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,316
we can actually extend its functionality

605
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,337
into special move cancels.

606
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:42,418
And it doesn't add that much complexity for the player.

607
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:45,119
Remember, this is the thing I told you to remember earlier

608
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,840
when we were talking about Injustice 2's launch tutorial

609
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,682
about how this particular lesson, special move cancels,

610
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:55,844
had 10 times the average dropout of the other lessons.

611
00:33:55,844 --> 00:34:02,867
The Injustice 2 completion rate at launch for this lesson

612
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:03,127
was 51%.

613
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:03,888
51% completion rate.

614
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:10,941
In MK11, the completion rate for this specific lesson, Special Move Cancels again, was 97%.

615
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:18,267
And again, completion rate is the percentage of players that completed it after having an attempt.

616
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:24,131
So 97% of players completed this after having an attempt, whereas in Injustice 2 it was only 51%.

617
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:29,737
And that's partially because we're pacing out the content much better.

618
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:34,199
This special Move Cancels lesson is actually in the Advanced section in MK11,

619
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,521
whereas remember it was part of one of the seven lessons in the Injustice 2 launch tutorial.

620
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,642
But we're also empowering players with a tool where they get feedback,

621
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:48,444
and they get feedback through a variety of visuals,

622
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:51,205
and it's just better. It's more concise. It's actionable.

623
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:55,903
Okay, so speaking of the advanced section,

624
00:34:55,903 --> 00:34:57,404
let's move into some of the mechanics we taught there.

625
00:34:57,404 --> 00:35:00,727
So, remember that the advanced section

626
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:04,690
is to prepare the player for extended single-player modes.

627
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,172
It finishes covering the core mechanics.

628
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,154
And here's where we found two opportunities

629
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:10,575
for really high-value wins.

630
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,376
In the advanced section,

631
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,359
we're gonna teach these timing-based situational mechanics,

632
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,300
and we're also gonna teach frame data.

633
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:29,365
We continue to get a lot of value out of the mechanics we're teaching here and a lot of the tools that we built to teach these mechanics and concepts later on in the strategy section because we go into them in a much deeper format.

634
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,421
So let's go over to the situational mechanics first.

635
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:36,783
The problem statement here is that some mechanics

636
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,144
can only be performed in specific situations

637
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:43,027
and they must be executed within a timeframe.

638
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:45,948
Players really struggle to recognize these opportunities.

639
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:49,210
They struggle to recognize these windows of opportunity.

640
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,675
So our solution is we're going to put the player in that situation,

641
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:59,503
we're going to freeze the world, freeze the whole game during that window of opportunity,

642
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:04,770
and then we're going to color their character and wait for their input before unfreezing the world.

643
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,552
So here's what that looks like.

644
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:13,408
We freeze the world and then you perform the inputs and the world continues, right?

645
00:36:13,408 --> 00:36:16,209
This is a perfect case of show and tell.

646
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:20,030
We're telling you through the instructions in the text boxes prior

647
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,452
that you can roll out at the apex of your fall arc, right?

648
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,352
But then we also demonstrate it.

649
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,113
And it's much easier to understand the demonstration.

650
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:32,374
And here we're kind of going through a bunch of other mechanics that we use.

651
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,863
that we taught through this world freezing.

652
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:40,307
We used this world freezing to teach wake-up attacks, air escapes, special move cancels,

653
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:44,651
throw breaks, I know I'm saying a lot of things that are specific to fighting games,

654
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:49,095
but the point is that we got a lot of bang for our buck out of this world pausing type of feature.

655
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:55,081
So the second high value win we got in the advanced section was frame data.

656
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,355
The problem with frame data is that players have difficulty

657
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:00,876
understanding frame data, and or they

658
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,937
have trouble seeing the stages of frame data

659
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,678
take place on their character.

660
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:08,501
Our solution was to expose the frame data visually

661
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:11,082
as a highlight effect on both characters.

662
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:19,261
This is a new form of visual feedback to meet the specific need that we're teaching.

663
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:22,505
We want to keep the player focused on looking at the character.

664
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,208
We don't want to distract them with additional UI.

665
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:29,833
So again, we're building something, we're building a set of tools to meet the specific

666
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,754
needs here.

667
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:34,318
This feedback is very contextual to this specific section.

668
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:40,005
OK, so let's do a little bit of a deep dive on frame data.

669
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:44,167
This is going to be fairly technical to fighting games, but

670
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,608
you don't need to understand it and.

671
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:49,709
But it's important for players to understand

672
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,710
if they're going to compete in fighting games. OK, so

673
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,792
it's important to note that the player does get this info

674
00:37:56,792 --> 00:38:00,394
paced out over several lessons, and we're going to kind of blaze

675
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,675
through it pretty quick, so buckle up.

676
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:04,939
So frame data.

677
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:07,500
Our game is locked at 60 frames per second.

678
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,902
That means that each frame in our game takes 16.6 milliseconds.

679
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:16,085
Each character move, rather, every character move,

680
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,907
goes through three stages of frame data.

681
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:22,349
And that's what we call the anatomy of a move.

682
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,710
You go through startup, you go through active frames,

683
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,012
and then you go through recovery frames.

684
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,893
Knowing and understanding a character's frame data

685
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,574
is essential for high-level play.

686
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:36,124
So let's take a look at this anatomy of a move.

687
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:39,849
So we teach this through showing a character highlight.

688
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,252
Here's a video mock-up of the anatomy of a move.

689
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:45,356
You go through startup into active and into recovery.

690
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,938
And this again, this video is going to loop.

691
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:46,998
So.

692
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:54,627
Every move has different data in terms of the length of each of these stages,

693
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:59,150
but every move has these stages and you can see it again here with a different

694
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,294
move. First, we're going to go into startup in blue.

695
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:07,837
Then we'll go into active frames in red and quickly into recovery frames in green.

696
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:08,957
So what does this mean for the game?

697
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,432
The outcome of a move's recovery creates advantage and disadvantage for players.

698
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:26,075
The length of a move's recovery depends on its outcome.

699
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:31,839
Each move will have different recovery lengths for whether it was hit, it blocked, or it whiffed.

700
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,021
This is fighting games at their core.

701
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:36,521
This is like...

702
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:42,382
this is it, right? You're kind of doing this addition and subtraction on the fly of like,

703
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:48,448
oh, am I in advantage or am I in disadvantage? And that's all the outcome of the anatomy of a

704
00:39:48,448 --> 00:39:53,592
move. That's all the outcome of startup frames, active frames, and recovery frames. So let's

705
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:59,417
take a look at advantage and disadvantage. So when the character highlight comes off

706
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,938
is when the character can move again.

707
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:06,316
So Scorpion here has 17 frames of advantage.

708
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:09,358
And you can see the highlight comes off of him

709
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,280
17 frames faster than it comes off of Cassie.

710
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,602
So this is another great example of show and tell.

711
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:18,825
We'll tell you it takes 43 frames to recover,

712
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:22,747
but, or sorry, that you'll have 43 frames of advantage

713
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,089
on hit, sorry, because of your recovery,

714
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,291
but seeing it is so much easier.

715
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,973
It's actually digestible once you see it.

716
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:39,354
Okay, so we've talked about a bunch of, well, I should say,

717
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,516
end of fighting game technical talk.

718
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:45,739
Let's move back to some more design conceptual stuff.

719
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:49,082
Previously, we talked about some specific ways

720
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:50,763
to solve very specific problems,

721
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:54,505
but there are some mainstays that are always there

722
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,007
throughout our tutorial to help out.

723
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,973
And first, we teach through text without any VO.

724
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:03,334
Our whole tutorial is taught through text.

725
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,755
And that's for a variety of reasons.

726
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,837
Localization is really tough with VO.

727
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:13,299
Our content was really volatile during development.

728
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:16,140
So getting those re-recordings of VO

729
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,181
was going to be really tough.

730
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:21,063
It's kind of a decision we made early on to not do VO.

731
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,504
But at the same time, we would love to do VO.

732
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:26,125
And we'll talk about that in the future of our tutorial.

733
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:34,267
So we need to minimize the amount of text and pop-up boxes in a row as much as possible.

734
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:38,231
We want players playing the game. We don't want them reading clumps and clumps of text, right?

735
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:44,236
So to help with that, we highlight keywords because, well, people just skim text box.

736
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:48,019
Nobody's going to read the whole thing, right? There's certain words here that jump out at you,

737
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,881
and that's jumping attacks, blade jab, and basic attack.

738
00:41:51,482 --> 00:42:00,170
So we do have a coloring scheme where blue is a specific character move, so Cabal has a blade jab move there, which is why that's blue.

739
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,794
And then core fighting game concepts are highlighted in yellow.

740
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:10,599
So again, we need to spread out these complex concepts and highlight these keywords to make it easier for the player.

741
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:18,396
We also really need to reduce the amount of technical fighting game community terminology.

742
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:21,157
There's a lot of community-based terminology in fighting games,

743
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:24,398
and we need to reduce that whenever possible,

744
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:28,160
because it's going to confuse players who are new to the genre.

745
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
So this text box, for example, says,

746
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,641
if a character performs a jumping attack and misses,

747
00:42:32,641 --> 00:42:35,522
they'll have a brief recovery period after they land

748
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:37,983
during which they cannot move, attack, or block.

749
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:43,984
This is actually teaching a fighting game community concept known as TripGuard,

750
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:47,908
but we never use the word TripGuard, so that's just important to note.

751
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:54,737
Okay, so we teach through text and we build specific tools to meet the specific content,

752
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:57,440
but what happens if a player is still struggling?

753
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,248
Because different players have different problems.

754
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:01,928
They just do.

755
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:05,651
Some get stuck on different things in the same lessons.

756
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,212
Some get stuck on the same things,

757
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:08,873
but in different lessons.

758
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,553
And we saw this a lot in our user testing

759
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:12,975
when we were watching players go through our tutorial

760
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:13,635
for the first time.

761
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:18,858
Basically, not everyone learns in the same ways.

762
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:20,119
We need some catch-alls.

763
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:20,980
So one of our catch-alls is the AI demos.

764
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,173
And the problem statement for our AI demos

765
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:36,635
is that players sometimes don't know

766
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:39,678
what the expected outcome of a task is

767
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:41,360
or what it is they should be doing.

768
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,263
And this is after they've read the instructions, right?

769
00:43:45,263 --> 00:43:48,586
So our solution was have the AI perform the task

770
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:49,988
to show the player.

771
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:51,809
And this is an opt-in button.

772
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:54,952
This is an opt-in feature for every lesson.

773
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:56,013
So let's take a look at this.

774
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,818
Yeah, so every lesson has this feature available in this tutorial.

775
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:04,606
So you can see here, there's a View Demo button right underneath the controller.

776
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:08,943
And here you can see the orange buttons highlighting and the AI performing.

777
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:12,344
The orange buttons are the AI button presses.

778
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:14,445
That's the AI performing the move.

779
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:19,406
And here you can see some blue button presses on top of the orange button presses on that controller.

780
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:24,527
The blue button presses are the human, or the player I should say.

781
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:27,088
Sorry we use human and AI a lot in our code.

782
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,081
So the intention of that is that you

783
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:35,504
can watch the AI perform this task with the orange buttons

784
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:36,965
and watch them perform it in-game.

785
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:40,887
And then, hopefully, you can kind of play over top of it

786
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,428
with your buttons and try and get some of that muscle memory

787
00:44:43,428 --> 00:44:43,689
down.

788
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:49,212
It's kind of this Simon Says on the controller.

789
00:44:49,212 --> 00:44:50,252
And you can, this will loop.

790
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:52,794
This isn't a looping, this, well, I

791
00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:54,175
mean, this is a looping video.

792
00:44:54,175 --> 00:44:57,797
But additionally, that demo just loops until you exit.

793
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:04,386
So you can get the muscle memory down just by watching and then kind of trying to participate when you're ready.

794
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:08,007
So let's talk about audio reinforcement, another catch-all for us.

795
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:15,929
The problem is that players have difficulty understanding the cadence required for different mechanics,

796
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:19,930
including combos, punishes, defensive options, and more.

797
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,171
It's kind of the, when do I press buttons?

798
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,593
So our solution, assign a unique audio cue

799
00:45:27,593 --> 00:45:30,277
to each button on the controller and play them

800
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:32,219
during all the AI demos.

801
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:35,523
So I just showed you that the AI demos there

802
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:37,225
were pressing orange buttons.

803
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:40,669
And now we're going to assign an audio cue to each of those.

804
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:44,413
And so here's an anecdote that illustrates this.

805
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:48,732
Some of my co-workers were at a fighting game tournament,

806
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:51,193
and they were up in their hotel room,

807
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:53,854
and one of the co-workers, Danish,

808
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:57,216
he was trying to learn a particular combo.

809
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,277
He knew what buttons he needed to press,

810
00:45:59,277 --> 00:46:03,178
but he didn't know when to press those buttons, right?

811
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:07,080
So another co-worker, Mike, he drummed it out for him.

812
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,601
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

813
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,059
That was the combo.

814
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,421
And Danish, after trying it a bunch of times on his own,

815
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:16,962
not being able to get it, mic drumming it out,

816
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:19,063
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

817
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:23,626
That cadence, hearing that auditory cadence,

818
00:46:23,626 --> 00:46:26,207
Danish got it the next try or something like that.

819
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:29,569
So we can't really send a mic to every player's house

820
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:32,110
in order to drum out combos for them.

821
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,611
So we have to find a solution for this.

822
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:37,653
And our solution was this audio reinforcement in the AI demos.

823
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:44,752
So you can hear the clicks here.

824
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:47,114
I'm going to let it play one more.

825
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:50,096
So you can hear those clicks, right?

826
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:55,585
And for different combos, this is going to be really useful.

827
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:56,825
And a lot of other fighting games—

828
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:59,466
I shouldn't say a lot—other fighting games do this,

829
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:02,667
like Tekken does this, and it's really effective.

830
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:06,888
And again, this is because not all people learn effectively in the same ways.

831
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:10,429
By adding these audio cues, those who are more auditory learners,

832
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:12,589
or they're musically inclined,

833
00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:14,790
are much more likely to learn this combo faster.

834
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:21,827
For me, this is one of my personal favorite additions to MK11. It's a very simple feature,

835
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:25,270
but it really broadens the avenues for players to learn.

836
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,152
It also adds a really great accessibility option for those who are visually impaired.

837
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:35,650
So for previous games, if a player wanted to know when to press the buttons,

838
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,753
or needed to know how this cadence of this combo is supposed to be performed,

839
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:41,134
they'd have to go to YouTube.

840
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:44,877
They'd have to, you know, potentially take out a second device,

841
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:49,060
go to YouTube, watch a video, just to understand this.

842
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,282
And most players aren't going to overcome that barrier.

843
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:55,485
So by putting this in-game, we're reducing that barrier.

844
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:56,505
We're reducing that need.

845
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:59,868
We're keeping them in the game, hopefully playing the game for longer.

846
00:48:04,077 --> 00:48:06,737
So tips and hints is another one of our catch-all features.

847
00:48:06,737 --> 00:48:09,398
The problem statement here is players

848
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:11,198
who struggle in a particular task

849
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:15,940
aren't given additional context or help to get them through.

850
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,901
So our solution is that a custom message per tutorial task

851
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:23,142
after a certain amount of time appears with some extra help.

852
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:25,414
So let's take a look at that.

853
00:48:25,414 --> 00:48:28,718
If a player isn't completing a task after reading the instructions,

854
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:31,761
watching the demo, trying for a minute or two,

855
00:48:31,761 --> 00:48:33,843
we have to try to help them, right?

856
00:48:33,843 --> 00:48:36,026
We've already empowered them with a lot of different tools,

857
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:39,129
but if they're still not getting it,

858
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,270
they need some extra help.

859
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,191
So you can see here, Raiden's kind of blocking.

860
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,812
He's not completing this task.

861
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:46,733
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

862
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:48,593
And then this tip pops up and it says,

863
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,654
when performing a special move as a reversal attack,

864
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:54,336
the timing of the final button press is the most important.

865
00:48:54,336 --> 00:48:55,796
And then boom, he gets it, right?

866
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:58,778
Obviously that's an ideal scenario.

867
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:00,458
We're gonna fast forward through this one

868
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,239
and we're gonna show another example.

869
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,320
Again, the delayed timing here is super important.

870
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,981
We don't wanna overwhelm the player.

871
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:08,202
So we just fast forward through the Sub-Zero video.

872
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,623
The Raiden demo was real time.

873
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:14,695
And some of these tips would just remind you to watch the demo.

874
00:49:14,695 --> 00:49:15,716
Sometimes it's that simple.

875
00:49:15,716 --> 00:49:18,739
Like, hey, just a reminder that the demo feature's over here.

876
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:21,782
Go check that out if you're having trouble.

877
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:23,964
Some of them would ask them to pay attention

878
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:28,369
to the audio timings of specific cadences and combos.

879
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:30,831
And some are super specific to the lesson at hand.

880
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,662
Lastly, we want to make the player feel good while learning, and we need to set up their

881
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:39,583
expectations properly.

882
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,726
Having their expectations in line can really help reduce education fatigue and make sure

883
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:48,129
that they aren't overwhelmed and that they go play the game with what they've learned.

884
00:49:48,129 --> 00:49:49,310
We often have this like...

885
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:52,762
Oh, let's show this first.

886
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:55,303
So yeah, we want better celebration.

887
00:49:55,303 --> 00:49:56,683
We want to celebrate more often.

888
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:58,443
We want to celebrate bigger.

889
00:49:58,443 --> 00:50:01,044
We also have these sound cues that we added

890
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:04,124
for successful tasks and some successful subtasks.

891
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:05,425
So we kind of have this like,

892
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:08,725
hey, do this task X times, right?

893
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:10,586
Do it three times, do it five times in a row.

894
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:12,366
And there's this nice like audio cue,

895
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:14,986
this cheerful sound cue that kind of makes you feel good

896
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:16,307
after completing something.

897
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:18,747
These are little things to help celebrate the player,

898
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:19,767
right, to lift them up.

899
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:26,686
There's two more things that we can do to reduce this type of fatigue,

900
00:50:26,686 --> 00:50:29,606
this kind of education fatigue.

901
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:31,247
And we're going to do that through context and expectations.

902
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:35,928
The problem here is that players may not know what they just completed.

903
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:40,388
They did the whole tutorial, they completed everything in that lesson,

904
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:42,649
but maybe they don't remember what that was called.

905
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:44,489
And they don't know what's up next.

906
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:46,789
So at the end of a lesson, we show this pop-up box,

907
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:49,310
and we say, hey, you've completed the Special Move Cancels lesson.

908
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,290
The next lesson is Jumping Attacks.

909
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,761
So now players feel good for having completed something,

910
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,542
they know what they just completed,

911
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,783
and they can make an informed decision

912
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,444
about whether they want to continue

913
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:01,685
on to the next lesson or not.

914
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:09,475
And if the lesson you just completed is the last lesson in a category in one of those buckets,

915
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:10,896
we force you back to the menu.

916
00:51:10,896 --> 00:51:14,538
You can see there's no next lesson option on this screenshot.

917
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,020
And that's because we're trying to spread this out.

918
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,203
We're trying to spread it out, pace out the learning, reduce the education fatigue,

919
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:27,327
make sure players aren't overwhelmed, and again, make sure they go play the game.

920
00:51:28,327 --> 00:51:31,869
Because if players, again, if they just barrel through this entire tutorial in one sitting,

921
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:35,070
they're not likely to retain too much.

922
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,671
And this is kind of something we loved about Killer Instinct's tutorial.

923
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:38,871
They straight up say like,

924
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:42,333
Hey, go play the game. Come back later. Stop what you're doing.

925
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,293
Go, go play the game. That's super cool.

926
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:48,189
And by sending players back to the menu,

927
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,550
they can put their progress into context

928
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,331
with the remaining tutorial content.

929
00:51:51,331 --> 00:51:52,452
It also gives them a clean break.

930
00:51:52,452 --> 00:51:53,652
It shows them it's OK to stop playing,

931
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,174
again, just pacing it out, setting up those expectations.

932
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:58,795
So after refining the Mortal Kombat 11 version

933
00:51:58,795 --> 00:52:00,416
based on what we had learned from the Injustice 2

934
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,117
Legendary Edition launch, people really liked it.

935
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:22,159
This was great to see, I mean, obviously we had been putting a ton of work into this and a ton of thought.

936
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,964
So the fact that people liked this, this was spectacular to see, it really was.

937
00:52:26,964 --> 00:52:32,569
I mean, there was, look at the bottom here, there was even an appreciation post on Reddit.

938
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,411
I mean, doesn't get much better than that.

939
00:52:34,411 --> 00:52:39,435
Okay, so let's talk about the future of our tutorial at NetherRealm.

940
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:42,298
Again, this is all conjecture, all of it.

941
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:43,119
None of it's set in stone.

942
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,425
we need to do a better job of setting expectations of pro-level mechanics.

943
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:54,251
In MK11, there was a particular pro-level mechanic called Flawless Block Attacks,

944
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:58,695
and some players were trying that tutorial over and over and over again, really struggling with it.

945
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:04,220
And I think if there was maybe just, you know, like, some UI difficulty indicators, maybe in the menu, saying, like,

946
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:10,759
whatever, right? Like beginner, moderate, pro, or three levels of green, orange, red.

947
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:16,346
Hey, this is really hard. You shouldn't stress yourself out about this

948
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:19,369
type of thing. I think that could help alleviate some of that.

949
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:24,341
We also want to loop lessons on completion.

950
00:53:24,341 --> 00:53:28,584
A lot of players were revisiting our tutorials,

951
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,786
but the tutorial kind of brings...

952
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:33,429
After completing a lesson, it brings you to that menu of like,

953
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:35,931
hey, do you want to go to the next lesson or do you want to retry?

954
00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:38,133
And retry would put you back through a loading screen,

955
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,074
which isn't the end of the world.

956
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:42,496
Our loading screens are pretty short, relatively.

957
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:52,723
But if we can loop the lessons on completion and kind of set up like a button to advance the tutorial and we can message that properly, I think that would really help.

958
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:56,425
We'd also love to do voiceovers. We talked about this before, about how we teach through text, we don't have any VO. We'd love to do this.

959
00:53:56,425 --> 00:54:00,767
We also need to do, we've done some incentivizing of tutorials, but we need to incentivize more.

960
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,008
Right now you still have to want to learn.

961
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:15,178
right? If you're playing this tutorial you want to learn.

962
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,588
We thought about some gamification stuff.

963
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:25,794
This was mostly a resource issue and also kind of a philosophical difference at NetherRealm.

964
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:29,517
We don't want to take you out of the context of the fight.

965
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:33,601
If we gamified the tutorial through, like, minigames and things like that,

966
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:36,063
it would be taking you out of the context of the fight.

967
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:38,906
So when you go to do those things in an actual fight,

968
00:54:38,906 --> 00:54:40,667
you probably won't know what you're doing.

969
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:42,649
We want to keep you in the fight as much as possible.

970
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:47,851
We also have some secret stuff in the works, which is really exciting.

971
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,814
I wish I could share, but you'll have to stay tuned.

972
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:54,157
Okay, so a checklist for your game.

973
00:54:54,157 --> 00:55:00,002
So this is kind of your checklist, your lens to look at your game through.

974
00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:02,143
Prototype using a completed game if possible.

975
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,445
I understand this is a luxury.

976
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:07,628
Organize your players into segments of how they interact with your game.

977
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:11,651
What experience do these players want from your product?

978
00:55:14,157 --> 00:55:18,863
Decide the knowledge and skills each segment needs in order to get the experience that they desire.

979
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:21,786
This becomes your tutorial structure and roadmap.

980
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:24,850
Remember, those are those graphs where we have the player segments

981
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,653
and we mapped basics, advanced, and strategy onto it,

982
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:33,980
showing this kind of roadmap pathway of how players can graduate to these other segments.

983
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,624
Create diverse ways to teach players the necessary content.

984
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:42,469
You can do this through UI visuals, in-world visuals,

985
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:44,451
gameplay demonstrations, audio feedback,

986
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:47,134
and you need to find some catch-alls if you can.

987
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:48,816
Because if a player is struggling

988
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:51,339
and they're still not getting it,

989
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:53,001
then they're probably just gonna put your game down.

990
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,123
And lastly, pace out the content appropriately.

991
00:55:58,123 --> 00:56:00,844
Reward players along the way.

992
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,585
Create force breaks and spots for players

993
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:04,046
to see their progress.

994
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:07,948
This is going to help reduce that education fatigue

995
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,089
and pace out the content so that they actually learn.

996
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:13,030
Here's the full checklist.

997
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,151
You can take a screenshot of this if you'd like.

998
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:20,593
So if we take this checklist and we,

999
00:56:20,593 --> 00:56:22,574
let's look at how it applies to Mortal Kombat 11.

1000
00:56:22,574 --> 00:56:24,035
How did we use this checklist?

1001
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:32,219
Okay, so we used injustice to as a proving ground for prototyping this feature.

1002
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,282
And again, I mentioned before, I realize that's a luxury.

1003
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:39,646
But a lot of games are sequels these days.

1004
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:43,990
So if you do have a completed game, even if you're not going to launch it with that game,

1005
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,232
it might be worthwhile prototyping stuff in that.

1006
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:50,516
game before trying to do it in the in the new game that's already in development, right?

1007
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:54,258
Because that new game that's in development, it could change.

1008
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:56,020
It's probably changing underneath you.

1009
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,642
Maybe some systems aren't online yet.

1010
00:56:58,642 --> 00:56:59,242
You get the point.

1011
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:04,359
Organize your players into segments of how they interact with your game.

1012
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:09,144
This is our campaigners, our couch players, our dabblers, our connoisseurs and PVP.

1013
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:14,790
Again, this is something that usually your publisher has or your marketing team has.

1014
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,235
And if not, if you have an analytics department, they probably have this.

1015
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,838
Ask around. I'm sure I'm sure you have player segments.

1016
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:27,455
decide the knowledge and skills each segment needs

1017
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:29,716
in order to get the experience they desire.

1018
00:57:29,716 --> 00:57:32,197
So again, this is our basics, advanced, and strategy.

1019
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:35,179
And that correlates to story, extended single player,

1020
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:37,541
and online PVP, respectively.

1021
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,642
Mapping that basics, advanced, and strategy

1022
00:57:39,642 --> 00:57:42,463
onto our player segments gives us that roadmap.

1023
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:48,452
Create diverse ways to teach players the necessary content.

1024
00:57:48,452 --> 00:57:51,615
And again, we did this through all kinds of different stuff.

1025
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,997
Combo windows through UI, right?

1026
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:57,779
Character coloring, world pausing, AI demonstrations,

1027
00:57:57,779 --> 00:58:00,241
button audio feedback, tips and hints.

1028
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:04,563
And lastly, paste out the content appropriately.

1029
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:08,325
We rewarded players after each lesson and category.

1030
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:11,187
We spaced out the content into more sections.

1031
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:13,148
We forced a return to the menu

1032
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:15,349
after completing a category as well.

1033
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:16,770
Again, pasting out that content,

1034
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,271
reducing education fatigue.

1035
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:24,327
Thanks. Thank you for watching this talk.

1036
00:58:24,327 --> 00:58:28,428
There's also a few people I'd like to thank specifically.

1037
00:58:28,428 --> 00:58:32,368
Firstly, Mike Belponte, you were an incredible partner in this project

1038
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:36,569
and a mentor and all this to me working with you was spectacular.

1039
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:40,090
Taryn Silverstein and the entire UIUX team for their contributions.

1040
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,591
They were essential to this.

1041
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:46,012
Thank you, John Edwards, for creating space for us to do this.

1042
00:58:48,419 --> 00:58:52,362
Everyone at NetherRealm and Warner Brothers for allowing us to make video games.

1043
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,004
It really is a dream.

1044
00:58:55,004 --> 00:59:00,467
Emi Chung and GDC, Emi Chung, thank you so much for mentoring me through this GDC process,

1045
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:03,369
for helping me with this talk, giving feedback on this talk.

1046
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:05,591
This was a spectacular opportunity.

1047
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:08,072
Thank you to Emi and GDC.

1048
00:59:08,072 --> 00:59:12,576
Okay, so normally there's a Q&A session after one of these GDC talks.

1049
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:17,608
We're not in a live studio audience right now, obviously.

1050
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:21,552
So I asked on Twitter, and I said, hey,

1051
00:59:21,552 --> 00:59:24,094
like, I realize you haven't seen the talk,

1052
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,815
but if you have any questions, I'd

1053
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,296
love to include it at the end of the presentation.

1054
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:28,758
So here's some of these questions.

1055
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:30,039
We're going to go through some of these now.

1056
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:33,161
What other questions, or sorry, what other tutorials

1057
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:34,983
did you draw inspiration from?

1058
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:36,364
Any other genres?

1059
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,705
Yeah, tons.

1060
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:47,277
Fighting games, Skullgirls, Guilty Gear, Killer Instinct, Tekken, Street Fighter, all of these have good components in them.

1061
00:59:47,277 --> 00:59:50,280
We drew tons of inspiration from these tutorials.

1062
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,064
Other genres, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, for sure.

1063
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:57,229
We talked about that and how we kind of prototyped some of that Guitar Hero Highway stuff.

1064
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:02,883
The one that's maybe not so obvious would be sports games.

1065
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:07,064
In NHL, the hockey game, there's this vision trainer.

1066
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:07,504
That's excellent.

1067
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:10,484
It kind of puts like stuff on the ice for you,

1068
01:00:10,484 --> 01:00:14,365
showing you what passing lanes are available, what shot lanes are available.

1069
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:16,166
That's spectacular.

1070
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:17,526
And they'll be the show.

1071
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:21,267
The baseball game has the swing timings visualizations.

1072
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:24,067
So you can see if you were like too early or too late

1073
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:26,568
or if you were above it or below it.

1074
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:28,148
All that stuff we drew inspiration from.

1075
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:35,190
How much did accessibility factor into your planning, production, and design?

1076
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,771
A ton. It absolutely did factor in.

1077
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:43,033
I actually remember seeing a video of a blind gamer on YouTube playing Injustice 2,

1078
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:45,373
and it was spectacular to watch. It was awesome.

1079
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:48,234
I mean, this guy was kicking ass. It was very cool.

1080
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:54,336
So it absolutely did factor in, especially with the audio tones and the character coloring, the mesh coloring.

1081
01:00:54,336 --> 01:00:56,136
Initially, the character...

1082
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:02,118
highlights, the character colors, were red and green, which to my understanding is one of the

1083
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:07,419
most common forms of colorblindness. So we switched that to blue and orange to help with that.

1084
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:15,520
And the audio tones are something that obviously has accessibility baked into it and was something

1085
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,561
we were really excited about. I would love to expand that feature to the rest of the game

1086
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:25,442
in future titles. I think it's really helpful and just easy to understand.

1087
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:34,227
Did combo trial tutorials like in Injustice 2 ever get brought up again in the making of the MK11 tutorials?

1088
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:36,308
Yes, absolutely.

1089
01:01:36,308 --> 01:01:43,171
So for context here, in Injustice 2's Legendary Edition, that reworked tutorial that we launched,

1090
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:50,414
there were these trials, which was kind of like the final exam to some of the lessons, if you will.

1091
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:53,841
They were really difficult and they were really long,

1092
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:58,263
and I don't think we did a really good job of relaying the expectations there

1093
01:01:58,263 --> 01:02:00,265
about what those were.

1094
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:04,107
So we could definitely do that better in the future, but

1095
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:05,588
in reality, this was a time constraint.

1096
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:09,790
We didn't have these in Mortal Kombat 11 because of time constraints.

1097
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:10,071
Excuse me.

1098
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:16,791
These are also really prone to breaking as we update character frame data,

1099
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:19,674
character moves, character meta.

1100
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:23,599
So those are really volatile and kind of fragile.

1101
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:24,700
It's a lot of maintenance.

1102
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,483
So it was just a time constraints issue with Mortal Kombat 11,

1103
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:30,246
but it's something we'd like to revisit in the future.

1104
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:36,901
One thing that immediately got my attention in the MK11 tutorial, in comparison to MKXs

1105
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:42,467
specifically, is that plenty of characters were used throughout. Was there a conscious choice

1106
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:49,516
of specific characters for specific concepts? Yes, absolutely. Every character was handpicked.

1107
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:55,498
because they teach or display a specific concept really well, right?

1108
01:02:55,498 --> 01:02:58,438
Jade was the attacker in the Flawless Block Attacks lesson

1109
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:02,619
because she has this staff move that's easily telegraphed.

1110
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:04,979
It's easy to see.

1111
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:06,980
In creating block pressure, we use Cassie

1112
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,680
because she has really good frame traps in her frame data.

1113
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,561
Johnny Cage was taught to teach combo limitations and corner combos

1114
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:17,481
because he has an attack that launches without any meter cost.

1115
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:25,960
Mike Beloponte did a fantastic job deciding what characters are going to teach what concepts.

1116
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,401
He did an excellent job.

1117
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:31,324
And there was also some back and forth we would have where I would give some written

1118
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:36,027
feedback after he would design a tutorial or a particular lesson and we'd kind of go

1119
01:03:36,027 --> 01:03:40,710
I'd be like maybe we need to find a better gap here or maybe we need to find some better

1120
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,532
frame data or is there a better move and we'd kind of go to back to the drawing board on

1121
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:45,593
some of them.

1122
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:47,574
But every single one was deliberate.

1123
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,235
Again, shout out to Mike for that stuff.

1124
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:54,113
When designing the character specific tutorials,

1125
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:56,636
what factors made it so a specific move or string

1126
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:59,578
made the cut for a tutorial session as opposed to others?

1127
01:03:59,578 --> 01:04:02,161
So we didn't talk about character specific tutorials

1128
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:02,961
much in this talk.

1129
01:04:02,961 --> 01:04:05,003
We didn't talk about them really at all.

1130
01:04:05,003 --> 01:04:06,905
And again, that's because they didn't change much

1131
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:09,648
from Injustice 2 to Injustice 2 Legendary Edition

1132
01:04:09,648 --> 01:04:11,489
to Mortal Kombat 11.

1133
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:12,891
But remember in MK11.

1134
01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:19,937
You kind of have these character loadouts where you can choose what moves go into your character

1135
01:04:19,937 --> 01:04:24,460
loadout and you can exclude certain moves as well because of the ones that you're selecting.

1136
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,964
So the character can play very differently depending on what moves you select.

1137
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:33,727
That's kind of like the design of MK11, right?

1138
01:04:33,727 --> 01:04:35,529
Choose how you want to play.

1139
01:04:35,529 --> 01:04:37,330
That choose how you want to play in general

1140
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:40,173
makes it really difficult to teach all those permutations.

1141
01:04:40,173 --> 01:04:46,038
All the variations of a character would take ages for us to build.

1142
01:04:46,038 --> 01:04:49,721
So what we did put in the character-specific tutorials, though,

1143
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:51,943
was the base moveset.

1144
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:55,005
So the base moveset of a character is what we taught

1145
01:04:55,005 --> 01:04:56,587
because we knew that was going to be common

1146
01:04:56,587 --> 01:04:58,989
no matter what variation for a character you were choosing.

1147
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,845
Is there anything you would have liked to have included but could not fit?

1148
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:07,947
Where would you like to go next to tutorials?

1149
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:10,630
What are a few future developments to push for?

1150
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,172
We kind of talked about this in the future slide,

1151
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:15,295
but I do want to adjust this directly.

1152
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:18,578
There's tons of places we could take it with this new foundation, right?

1153
01:05:18,578 --> 01:05:21,281
We've built this very flexible structure.

1154
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:26,906
And there's kind of all this stuff we can build on top now, which is really exciting.

1155
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:29,248
We have a lot of things in the works for future titles.

1156
01:05:29,248 --> 01:05:36,114
We've already considered a lot about what we might teach next or what have you, what

1157
01:05:36,114 --> 01:05:38,296
new tools we might build.

1158
01:05:38,296 --> 01:05:40,418
So you'll have to stay tuned for that in the future.

1159
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:45,008
Again, so here's my contact information.

1160
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,551
This is actually the end of the talk now.

1161
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:49,152
Q&A session's over.

1162
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:52,494
Feel free to reach out with feedback and any ideas

1163
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:53,395
if you have them.

1164
