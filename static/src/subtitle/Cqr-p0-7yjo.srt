1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,411
Hi everyone, welcome to The Secret Lives of NPCs.

2
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:18,112
My name is Georgia Simmons.

3
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:19,973
And I'm Jason Becker.

4
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:24,774
And we are the narrative co-directors of Ghost Pattern, which is a studio that's based in

5
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,695
Narm or Melbourne in Australia.

6
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:46,408
So to start, Wayward Strand was made on the lands of the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people of the Kulin Nation, and is set on Bunurong country, and we pay our respects to Wurundjeri and Bunurong elders past and present.

7
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:53,145
We also wanted to acknowledge that we're all meeting on the unceded lands of the

8
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:59,346
Ramaytush Ohlone people, and to pay our respects to the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the

9
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:04,947
Ramaytush community, we encourage you to visit that link, ramaytush.org, where you can find out

10
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:10,068
more about the community, as well as donate, and also to form relationships with First Nation

11
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:13,529
groups in your own communities as part of your game development process.

12
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:24,316
Our talk today focuses on our studio's debut title, Wayward Strand, which we'll tell you

13
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:25,777
a bit more about in a minute.

14
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:30,159
In particular, we'll be telling you about the process of developing our game's unique

15
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:31,860
real-time narrative structure.

16
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:37,823
In Wayward Strand, no matter where the player is, all NPCs are carrying out their own narratives

17
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:38,784
in their own time.

18
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:43,627
This abundance of characters and stories creates a rich world for the players to explore.

19
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,828
Yeah, um...

20
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,532
We hear over and over again from players that Wayward Strand feels transportative.

21
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:54,493
It doesn't feel like you're playing through a narrative.

22
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,954
It feels like you've been dropped into an alternative world.

23
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:04,115
We think a big part of that is how we designed and developed our NPCs, their relationships,

24
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,156
and each of their journeys through the game.

25
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,857
And that's why we wanted to talk about our process with that.

26
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:14,860
We'll begin by giving you a bit more context about the game itself, as well as the team who made it.

27
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,244
We'll talk about the values of our studio and how they shaped the game.

28
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:22,229
We'll talk a bit about the consultation we did to flesh out our characters.

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,617
Then we'll get into some technical and design details of the tools we used for plotting the simultaneous stories of the game.

30
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:33,276
In talking through that process, we'll explore a few snags we came across in terms of finding

31
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,178
narrative interest in the game.

32
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:39,042
We'll then talk about how we brought the narrative to life through the realization and

33
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,125
implementation of all aspects of the game.

34
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:44,829
And because this is an industry event and some of you are probably on the company dime,

35
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,332
we'll make sure we finish with some lessons that we learned along the way that we hope will be

36
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:49,313
useful for you as well.

37
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:55,576
So that's what to expect in what order, and it all looks very ordered and laid out, perhaps

38
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,517
a little too much so.

39
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,278
So we wanted to show you this.

40
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,920
Some of you may recognize this, it's a page from the book We're Going on a Bear Hunt by

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,620
Michael Rosen.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,462
Now bears are living creatures and they should never be hunted, so just ignore the right-hand

43
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,343
side, focus on the left-hand side.

44
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:14,405
It says, we can't go over it, we can't go under it, oh no, we have to go through it.

45
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:20,027
If it seems like we know anything about developing a real-time narrative game now, just rest

46
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,387
assured that we didn't used to.

47
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,367
We used to know nothing.

48
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,668
This is a really challenging game to make.

49
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,008
We couldn't go over it.

50
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:29,789
There were no other games that were like it enough that we could just re-skin.

51
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,170
We couldn't go under it.

52
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,070
It's just not the kind of game that you can shortcut in any way.

53
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,613
We had to go through it to make this game.

54
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,697
We had to look way outside of games for inspiration.

55
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:45,483
We had to look to music and literature and who we were as people and our nation's history.

56
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:50,209
We had to write our dialogue like it was an immersive theater show and then record it

57
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,090
like it was a film.

58
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:55,223
And this meant that all the processes we'll talk about today were sort of

59
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:58,243
MacGyvered together with string and tape and optimism.

60
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,285
But the only way that we were able to do this was by going through it.

61
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:03,965
And we encourage you to do the same.

62
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,966
If you've got a narrative game idea and you're at the start of your dev journey,

63
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:09,127
don't wait until you know how to do it.

64
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,567
Just go through it.

65
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:12,028
Okay.

66
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:14,188
Here is the trailer for the game in question.

67
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,649
So you're excited after all?

68
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,190
As if.

69
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,590
Oh, well, my mistake.

70
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:26,254
Now, your job is to go to each of the patient's rooms and spend some time with them.

71
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:26,935
Got that?

72
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:27,435
Yep.

73
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,178
The name's Esther.

74
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:32,038
What's yours?

75
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:33,860
Um, Casey.

76
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,081
Um, Casey.

77
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:36,402
Very original.

78
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:40,945
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go solve a mystery about a goat.

79
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,447
Uh, is this you?

80
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:45,988
Oh yes, that's me.

81
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,329
And the family.

82
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,750
Would you like some company?

83
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,471
Of course.

84
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,759
Be warned, I am writing up a storm at the moment.

85
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:55,060
You weren't in the wall?

86
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,163
We escaped. Anna and myself.

87
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:01,565
I'm doing work experience.

88
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,307
Deadly. Well, working up here is an experience, alright.

89
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:08,570
Now, as you know, my room happens to be beside the nurses' station.

90
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,352
You were listening in on them. Got the picture?

91
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,613
We are to have.

92
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,334
Something's fishy, if you ask me.

93
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:21,598
I exhort you all to follow her every command as we prepare for tomorrow.

94
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:24,680
You both know the drill here. Regardless of what's going on...

95
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,861
Patience first.

96
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:28,906
Doctor Bouchard?

97
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,428
What are you here for?

98
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,390
Time to turn me sunny side up?

99
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,713
You think I'm trying to kill you?

100
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:40,957
You've been picking foxglove and slipping it down the dumbwaiter.

101
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,740
Death by a thousand slurps.

102
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:45,101
Director.

103
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,203
Mr. Pettigrew?

104
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,565
I have seen that you talk.

105
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,828
I will speak with him about your case.

106
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,976
How are you finding your time on the ship?

107
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:02,439
I hear people talk about things, but I'm not sure what they're on about.

108
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,420
That sounds a bit like the life of an older person.

109
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,362
Nobody explains to us what's going on.

110
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,784
We just have to piece it together as best we can.

111
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,751
Wow, you all are so nice, thank you.

112
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:27,012
So Wayward Strand is, as I said, our debut title.

113
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:30,173
It's a narrative game set in regional Australia in 1978.

114
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,814
And you play, as you saw, as Casey, who's a 14-year-old girl

115
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,735
whose mother is the head nurse of a hospital,

116
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:41,056
which just happens to be on an airship that's suspended in the clouds

117
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,957
above your small regional town.

118
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,097
It's the summer holidays, and your mum can't find anyone

119
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,458
to look after you for a couple of days,

120
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,258
so you go with her up to the hospital.

121
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:53,499
And she gives you the job of spending time with the patients in the aged care ward, keeping

122
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,440
them company and helping them out with anything that they need.

123
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,181
So that's the setup for our real-time narrative game.

124
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:03,722
Three days as a teenager, talking to the residents of this floating hospital, getting to know

125
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:05,642
them, getting a brief glimpse into their lives.

126
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:11,704
The game's about a four-hour round trip and is fully voiced by a cast of 15 superb actors.

127
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:16,934
Many people contributed to the making of this game and we always like to highlight this.

128
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:20,295
We find that the best ideas are found in the space between us.

129
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:25,398
And as you'll hear throughout the talk, Jason and I are definitely not the authors of this game,

130
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,879
especially not when it comes to the details of the stories.

131
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,340
We're just the people who happen to write it down.

132
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,002
Of the 33 fine people you saw on the slide before,

133
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,243
the ones on screen now formed the core team.

134
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,865
So these are the people who were along for long sections of the development journey

135
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,766
or who directed significant parts of its development.

136
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:48,227
As you may have noticed on the other slide, our team does come from outside of games.

137
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:53,812
That's both in terms of who we are as non-binary people, women, people of color, neurodiverse

138
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:58,235
people, new parents, people from working class backgrounds, and it's also in terms of our

139
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,176
professional backgrounds.

140
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:04,300
Some of us have come to video games from theater, or music, or comics, or VTubing.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,201
And what this means is that...

142
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:13,746
Although we all love to play video games, we know that video games are not made by us, about us, or for us all that often.

143
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:17,168
When people like us appear in games, it's often as NPCs.

144
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:22,619
With a few repeating lines of dialogue, a quest to give, and maybe a crush on the player character.

145
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,082
And this has a deep and conscious impact on the kinds of games that we feel compelled to make.

146
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:33,546
Wayward Strand is a game that strips back player agency and gives space and power to the NPCs.

147
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:38,409
The gameplay is geared towards listening and caring for them, rather than enacting your own

148
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,432
desires upon them. And this is deeply informed by who we are as a team and our lived experience.

149
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,133
So that's the team.

150
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:47,637
And this is us, the narrative team.

151
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:51,823
So my focus was squarely on narrative, including, uh, voiceover,

152
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,326
direction and casting.

153
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,829
And Jason does everything.

154
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,472
Except art.

155
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:03,207
So Jason comes from a lot of programming experience, but before this game had only ever really

156
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:04,068
dabbled in writing.

157
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:08,869
I come from a lot of writing experience, particularly in the theater, but had not even really dabbled

158
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:09,709
in video games.

159
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,030
I mean, I played Portal 2 on my MacBook with my trackpad, but nothing that could be considered

160
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,750
actually making a digital game.

161
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,691
Jason and I found very quickly, though, that we were a really good team.

162
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:26,472
The disparity of our professional backgrounds meant that we brought different strengths

163
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:26,992
to the team.

164
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:32,256
But we're also really deeply curious about each other's work, so we were able and open

165
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:34,237
to learn from each other throughout the process.

166
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:39,141
It's also worth saying that Russell, who was on that slide, who mainly worked on programming

167
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,203
throughout the game, was deeply involved in the ideation of the game.

168
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:46,906
So a lot of the character ideas and broad brush strokes, plots, come from him as well

169
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:47,527
as from Jason.

170
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:56,476
So our initial inspirations for Wayward Strand came from our personal relationships with

171
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,597
older people in our lives, stories that they've told or experiences that we shared with them.

172
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:07,318
And we thought that older people's lives were really interesting to explore and have players

173
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:12,419
think about, and to have represented within media, like outside of the cookie cutaway

174
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:17,079
that a lot of old people are represented as mentors or sources of knowledge.

175
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:20,652
Yeah, people that give you a sword or whatever.

176
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:24,695
Instead, we wanted to present them with full lives

177
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:26,477
in the present moment.

178
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,260
Yeah, so Wayward Strand takes place

179
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,262
across three in-game days,

180
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,904
and all characters more or less live out those three days

181
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,285
within view of the player.

182
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:40,927
This allowed us to tell stories

183
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:43,169
where the rhythms of daily life

184
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,950
are a critical element of the stories.

185
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:51,218
Unlike other media where a character has to have a cinematic moment of realization or

186
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:56,482
a moment of conflict that drives the story forward, we could represent how stories and

187
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,104
events take place more in real life.

188
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:05,009
So messily, fits and starts, woven amongst other things that are happening in your life

189
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:10,954
with important things sometimes taking place outside of the exciting cinematic moments.

190
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,602
Like a kind of funny example of this is for a long time,

191
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:18,302
we were aiming to get like toilets into the game

192
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:21,443
and have each of the characters schedules,

193
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:25,304
like bathroom schedule, interact with each of their stories.

194
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,664
So maybe a character misses hearing a critical thing

195
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:29,965
because they went to the toilet

196
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,825
or maybe somebody excuses yourself

197
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,245
when you're spending time with them

198
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,606
just because nature called.

199
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,186
But they could do that

200
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,287
without any big narrative consequence sometimes.

201
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:42,067
So it's a way to.

202
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:48,434
bring in the feel of like reality that's quite unique to this real time storytelling format.

203
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,339
Because if somebody is on the toilet in a movie, that's because maybe it's a comedy

204
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,062
or maybe they're about to be strangled by James Bond.

205
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,445
Shout out to objectively the best Bond movie, GoldenEye.

206
00:11:58,465 --> 00:11:58,785
But yeah, exactly.

207
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,107
Thank you very much.

208
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,787
Thank you.

209
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:01,128
Thank you.

210
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:01,528
Thank you.

211
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:01,829
Thank you.

212
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:02,089
Thank you.

213
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:02,429
Thank you.

214
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:02,790
Thank you.

215
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,990
Thank you.

216
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,290
Thank you.

217
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,490
Thank you.

218
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:08,814
But you're not going to have a heartfelt moment with a character happen just after they've

219
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,176
gone to the bathroom in a movie for no reason.

220
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:16,021
But we do have those heartfelt post-bathroom moments in real life.

221
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,708
And that just never gets reflected in media because you have this limited linear plane

222
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,489
on which to work and the juxtaposition.

223
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:29,734
It just has a different meaning when it's been placed there for you by a director or

224
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:37,482
a creator in a deliberate way as opposed to in this kind of semi-dynamic way that we have

225
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,365
where if that happened, it would just happen within the game.

226
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,448
It's not necessarily part of our plan.

227
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,006
So I'll talk a little now about our process of consultation for fleshing out our characters.

228
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,747
Our game has characters with a really broad range of lived experience.

229
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:58,409
So we have many aged characters, of course, many of whom are experiencing chronic illness,

230
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:03,050
as well as queer characters, a First Nations character, healthcare workers.

231
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,071
And given that the point of our game, as we've been mentioning, was to show the richness

232
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:11,312
of these characters' lives, it was important to us that we engage in consultation right

233
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,413
from the start, and that we honored these relationships through to the end of our development

234
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:15,693
journey.

235
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:20,670
One of the first teams that we started working with on consultation was the Bonorong Land Council.

236
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,855
And I'm going to focus on this consultation as a bit of a case study for how we engage in consultation.

237
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:31,841
This was a really special relationship that we maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of the development of the game.

238
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:36,447
The Bunurong Land Council, just for some context, is the traditional owner group representing

239
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:40,069
the First Peoples of the area of regional Victoria where Wayward Strand is set.

240
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,472
As soon as we agreed to make this game together, we got in touch with the Bunurong Land Council

241
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,953
and we went and had a first meeting with them.

242
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:50,675
We opened up questions about locations where the game could be set.

243
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:55,331
Any landmarks with cultural significance that we should be aware of, as well as what kinds

244
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,973
of Aboriginal characters we might be able to represent in the game.

245
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:02,257
And it was these early conversations that fueled the development of the character of

246
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:07,422
Ted, who you can see on screen, who is the much beloved teen cable car operator with

247
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,164
a secret ambition to write comic books.

248
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,639
From there we ended up consulting with a number of people from the Land Council in an ongoing

249
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,840
way, including Bunurong Elders.

250
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,483
And the bullet points that you see on screen are just some of the principles of how we

251
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:21,923
engaged in that consultation.

252
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:26,465
So the fact that we engaged from the start ensured that we never included anything in

253
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:29,006
the game without first knowing that it would be appropriate to do so.

254
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:33,448
This ongoing engagement also meant that our collaborators at the Land Council weren't

255
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:37,990
just correcting our ideas, but also conceiving of their own ideas and contributing to the

256
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,271
creative development of the game.

257
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:45,438
And they had real agency in terms of determining how their culture would be displayed on screen

258
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,880
and communicated to an audience.

259
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,605
There also never came a point where we ended that relationship or sort of said that we'd

260
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,226
kind of done enough consultation.

261
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:59,652
All the way through to voiceover casting and direction, we had input from the land council

262
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,494
about what that character should sound like.

263
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,716
And we ended up being fortunate enough to cast.

264
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:09,793
Shane Clayton, who's the son of a really well-respected Bunurong elder, and Shane himself was also

265
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:12,319
able to bring that fantastic cultural knowledge into the room.

266
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,980
And the last point on the slide says listening before Agenda.

267
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:21,145
It would be great to be able to say listening without Agenda, but in doing consultation

268
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,567
it's great to sort of be honest with your scope and there would be no point us pretending

269
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,389
that we weren't trying to develop a video game.

270
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,953
But whatever vision that we had for how it would turn out, that was always secondary

271
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:36,097
to our listening and our relationship and to hearing what the Boon Wurrung Land Council

272
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:40,040
and their various elders and representatives were saying to us and honoring that before,

273
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,182
honoring what we thought it should be like.

274
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:50,904
Yeah, the fact that we could be so responsive to the consultation over the course of development

275
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:57,853
does feel like an advantage of this unique storytelling structure, which we'll get into

276
00:15:58,153 --> 00:15:59,775
the structure a bit more soon.

277
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:05,663
We weren't relying on certain interactions between characters as pillars of a single linear storyline,

278
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:11,089
and that meant that, you know, if we were making changes to particular bits of the game,

279
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:19,438
we could do them without, yeah, kind of taking some critical bit of the arc of the game and

280
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,660
then like knocking out that pillar or whatever.

281
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:27,233
We still had to consider knock-on effects of every change because every change would

282
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:30,657
have this ripple out to all the other storylines and characters and so forth.

283
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:35,742
But yeah, nothing was load-bearing in that way.

284
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:41,110
So these are some of the other people that we consulted with throughout the game.

285
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,572
Dementia Australia, the CEO, Kate Swoffer, lives with dementia herself and she was a

286
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:47,613
fantastic consultant on the game.

287
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:53,995
We also have Goldie, our art director's mum, happened to be a nurse in hospitals in the

288
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:58,076
70s, so she was a really great source of knowledge in terms of what that experience was like.

289
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,639
And we have a lot of team members as well who had lived experience that fed into the game,

290
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,221
whether that was about being raised by a single mum, or about their lived experience of gender,

291
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:12,583
or racialized identity, or class, or chronic illness. And of course, our wonderful actors

292
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:16,625
also brought so much authenticity to their characters, and we were able to keep making

293
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:21,167
some critical script changes through the recording process. A bit of a funny story about this is,

294
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:23,168
I don't know if we have any German speakers in the room,

295
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,654
But we have our character, Mr. Pruess, who you would have seen in the slides.

296
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:35,039
And at some point, really early on in the development, his story is that he had this wife who he was so devoted to,

297
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,221
and she's sadly passed away now, but he remembers her a lot.

298
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,322
And her name used to be... Alter?

299
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:47,846
And then I can see we've got a German speaker over here giving me the look I was expecting.

300
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:52,548
We got into recording with our actor who we were recording remotely from Austria.

301
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,369
And he came to that part in the script and he said,

302
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:00,111
Alter, this is, you know, why is he saying this about his beloved wife?

303
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,071
And we were like, oh, that's her name.

304
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:01,591
And he was like,

305
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:15,940
No. So, um, you might be able to verify for me, our actor told us that the meaning of this word, which we thought was just a name is like, it's kind of like calling your wife, like the old ball and chain or like, you know, the old bag or something.

306
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,762
It's like a really disrespectful, like thing to say about your wife.

307
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:23,645
So luckily we picked that up with him in the recording studio and we were able to change her name to Anna.

308
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,823
It's a much more standard Austrian or German name.

309
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,565
That was probably the most egregious mistake that we had, but our actors brought a lot

310
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:38,388
of other cultural knowledge or knowledge from their own lived experience to those characters.

311
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:44,169
So, in terms of the simultaneous stories that we told throughout the game, in many other

312
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,712
games your NPCs might have a few looped animations to make them look like they're doing stuff,

313
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,333
but they are ultimately kind of existing to wait for you.

314
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:57,016
So we asked ourselves the question, what would the player experience be like in a game where

315
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:01,978
no one waits for you, you have to keep up with them and listen to them and play in service

316
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:02,278
of them?

317
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,421
And this idea was largely inspired by immersive theatre.

318
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:10,864
And my background, as I mentioned, is in theatre, which is why I was asked to join the team,

319
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,946
to bring that knowledge to bear on the game.

320
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:16,949
So we needed to create stories, enough of them with enough detail,

321
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,170
that would populate a fully realized world,

322
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:23,253
characterized by overlapping dialogue and confluences of action.

323
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:28,769
And this is the question that we started with and that we still often get asked about the

324
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:29,130
game.

325
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,873
How do we guarantee a satisfying narrative journey if we can't guarantee the narrative

326
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:35,294
itself?

327
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:40,797
The first thing to say about this question is that satisfaction is a rather limiting

328
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,419
goal in terms of what we want our player to experience.

329
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,440
Our game's about a teenage girl.

330
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,243
She's on her summer holidays and her mum has dragged her along to spend time in an aged

331
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:51,084
care ward with a bunch of old people.

332
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:55,337
So satisfaction is not necessarily what she would be experiencing.

333
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:59,180
And so as nerve wracking as it was, we wanted to create an experience that left

334
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,321
room for boredom or frustration, or maybe even anger.

335
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:06,544
And this was reflected back to us in a lot of the reviews we got.

336
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:10,726
Many reviews contained a similar version of this sentiment, but Emily Spindler

337
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:14,208
from Games Hub captured it in a really great way, which we were really thrilled

338
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,309
to see when she said.

339
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:19,439
This. There were some small moments where I was unsure of what to do.

340
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:23,123
And while this did leave me wandering the halls aimlessly for a brief time,

341
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:27,088
it ultimately felt like this added to the overall feeling that you really are Casey,

342
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:31,913
wanting to help, but unsure how. And that's the exact feeling that we were trying to create, is like

343
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:37,818
We don't necessarily need for this to be this action-packed, rising action kind of experience.

344
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:42,082
We wanted the player to have moments of really deep, heartfelt connection, but then also moments

345
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:48,147
of boredom, or moments of not knowing what to do, or moments of trying to figure out how to be helpful.

346
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,608
I also want to talk about the narrative shape of the game.

347
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:57,971
So this is a page from Matthew Frederick's surprisingly insightful coffee table book

348
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,892
101 Things I Learned in Architecture School.

349
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:05,995
And this page that you see here reflects how in architecture, the organizing principle

350
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,376
for a building can be expressed in a simple geometric diagram.

351
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:14,699
In many creative writing courses, some of which some of you may have attended, it's

352
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,000
taught that there is exactly one story shape.

353
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:26,645
This tedious, ugly, boring, vaguely phallic, time-tested and data-backed hump, Freytag's

354
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:27,165
Pyramid.

355
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:33,629
The action rises, there's exactly one climax, sound familiar, and then everything is wrapped

356
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:34,790
up in a neat little bow.

357
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,873
I hope that in the year of our lord 2023 it's uncontroversial to say that this is like...

358
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:46,704
Kind of played out and tired and it works in the same way that a Honda works, i.e. just fine.

359
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:52,246
Do we want to make things that are just fine? What about this? See, now it's a star and that's

360
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:57,388
more fun. Let's make something fun. I really think that Wayward Strand's organizing principle,

361
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:04,091
if it was anything, would be this hairstyle. So Wayward Strand takes place over three days

362
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:08,173
and at the start and end of each day, you have a conversation with your mom, Ruth, who's the

363
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:08,613
head nurse.

364
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,802
So the shape of Wayward Strand is all of these strands that are running parallel, and just

365
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:18,105
like a little louse, you can jump from strand to strand, but then there are these gather

366
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:23,668
points, and we use these conversations with Ruth to gather the strands together and make

367
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,309
sense of those strands for the player.

368
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:30,111
Ultimately, though, there are infinite shapes that your story in your game can and should

369
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:30,431
take.

370
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:35,773
And it's so fun and freeing and a bit freaky to consider all the myriad ways you can break

371
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:41,195
away from silly little 19th century pyramids like this loser who tried to convince you

372
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:43,376
that they've been around since the time of the pharaohs.

373
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:45,097
Anyway, rant over.

374
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:49,999
We're now going to take you on a deep dive of our process of structuring and plotting

375
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,221
the game and bringing all those values and theories and principles that we've been speaking

376
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,201
about so far to life.

377
00:22:56,122 --> 00:23:00,765
So if you unbraid that ponytail from before and stick all the strands of hair up on your wall,

378
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:04,428
I'm starting to regret this metaphor, it looks like this.

379
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:07,469
This is the wall of our Melbourne studio circa 2018.

380
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:12,458
And then if you put all of that under the microscope, it looks like this.

381
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,640
Our plotting document is a little too big to fit on one slide.

382
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,362
This is about 70% of it.

383
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:22,466
Linear time runs from left to right, and then each row is one of our characters.

384
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:26,989
And what you're looking at is all the different stuff that people are doing throughout the

385
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,230
game.

386
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:31,833
So if we zoom in further, say on this chunk, we can see the following.

387
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,754
These are all the things that are happening on or around

388
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:37,835
10.54 AM of day one of the game.

389
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:41,657
Even trying to get them all onto one slide like this, you still can't quite

390
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,478
make out all the text because there's just so much going on.

391
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,280
But if you really squint, you'll see that most of these events have a title

392
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,101
like Esther Forgotten or The Inspection.

393
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:54,764
These are the names of the different stories that run throughout the game.

394
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,666
And each story takes in a number of characters.

395
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:02,229
So Esther Forgotten centers around Esther and an experience of chronic pain that she's

396
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,391
having, but it also pulls in the nursing staff and the medical staff who are trying to treat

397
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,012
Esther's worsening condition.

398
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:13,316
Or the inspection is about the staff preparing for a visit from a VIP who's meant to be

399
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,357
arriving on day three.

400
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:19,420
You may also be able to make out in the tiny little text there that some of the scenes

401
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,541
are called incidental.

402
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,341
So as we plotted the game, we realized pretty quickly that we would need two

403
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:28,043
distinct kinds of scenes, scheduled scenes and incidental scenes.

404
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:32,605
So those scheduled scenes, they happen at the same time on the same day, regardless

405
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,026
of where you are and what you're doing.

406
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:37,588
Even if you can't like see them going on, they're happening in the background.

407
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:43,131
And incidental scenes are those scenes where if you happen to come across

408
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:46,672
someone in some downtime, you can sit with them and talk with them and

409
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:49,914
interact with them in a less time bound or plot oriented way.

410
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,903
So that was vital to situating the player within the world of the game.

411
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:58,726
You know, if all you were going to do in this game was sit around, listen to

412
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:02,509
conversations and like sort of very occasionally interject, then it felt

413
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,551
like there would be a distance between the player and their world, a distance

414
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,013
that was a little greater than what we were trying to achieve.

415
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:12,904
So we created these incidentals, these kind of hangout scenes, which mimic the fact that

416
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:16,126
in real life people have their own stuff that they're getting on with and that they need

417
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:16,486
to do.

418
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:20,628
But if you catch them in a moment of downtime, then you can kind of sit and hang out with

419
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:21,709
them and have a moment.

420
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:32,218
So yeah, creating Weird Strand and plotting it out was a very experimental process for us because

421
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:37,040
there aren't really very many narratives to draw from. Like there are games like The Last Express

422
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,862
which is helpful but feels more like the story ultimately revolves around the hero or what he

423
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:48,905
can uncover and then there's Sleep No More like an interactive theatre piece where you're wandering

424
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:51,686
around a hotel and kind of...

425
00:25:52,116 --> 00:26:05,236
All a bunch of scenes are happening and you can wander into a scene as it's halfway through going on. But those stories are told in more of like a poetic and abstract way where we were going for representing the mundanity of everyday life.

426
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:12,519
For the characters, in developing the characters, we had some initial storylines and characters,

427
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,764
but we wanted to have them interact with each other regardless of if they had a storyline

428
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:24,691
reason to. So one of the tools we built into our development process was what we

429
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:26,313
called a character relationship matrix.

430
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:40,757
Um, which looked like this, uh, where we put every character on like the column and on the road and then in the cell for each, uh, character, like kind of intersection of characters.

431
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:44,882
Uh, that's how they respond to or feel about the other character.

432
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:51,662
A lot of the process for defining the narrative of the game was like this, like trying to

433
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:57,327
find ways of identifying what we were missing in our world, whether it was certain relationships

434
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:00,950
that we hadn't thought about or considered yet, or interactions between characters that

435
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,392
could happen that weren't yet plotted out.

436
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:08,616
Kind of like filling out all of the space where stuff could be but wasn't yet.

437
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:18,209
Something handy that came out of mapping the characters' relationships like this is that we could define very specifically how each character feels about each other.

438
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:27,957
Like in this example, Mr. Avery, Neil, is a writer of self-help books who, as we say in Australia, is a bit up himself, like thinks a lot of himself.

439
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,880
While Ida, his neighbor, is a lot more reserved and polite.

440
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:39,368
So from Ida's perspective, Neil is always interrupting her and bothering her, so she has a pretty negative feeling towards him.

441
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:42,372
While from Neil's perspective,

442
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:46,376
Ida's friendly and he's friendly, so they must be friends.

443
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:49,459
And this

444
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,994
Relationship Matrix, like it was simple, but it was also actually a really good prompt to

445
00:27:56,215 --> 00:28:00,878
consider how to summarize how each character sees themselves. Whether they've got a positive

446
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:06,723
feeling towards themselves or a neutral or a negative feeling towards themselves. And all

447
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:11,206
of this stuff is like very high level and lacks a lot of the nuance that's in the game itself.

448
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:16,149
But it really helped particularly during the co-writing process, like keeping us all on the

449
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,451
same page. Yeah.

450
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,200
Uh oh, a bump in the road.

451
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,683
At one point after we developed the initial character plots and timelines,

452
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,325
we were trying to get publisher funding.

453
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:31,308
And so we wrote up some plot summaries for each of our characters to try to

454
00:28:31,328 --> 00:28:33,890
get the publishers to understand what goes on in the game.

455
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,893
And then we stood back and looked at our plot summaries and panicked.

456
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:42,356
After reading over what we'd written, we had to ask ourselves, are our plots boring?

457
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:46,952
Here's an example of a plot that we planned for the game, centering on one of the patients,

458
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,573
Ida, who Jason was just talking about.

459
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:55,518
So it says, Ida has been knitting Hugo a scarf for his birthday on Sunday, a surprise gift.

460
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,822
Knitted into the pattern of the scarf is Hugo's family crest, which Ida sometimes sneaks into

461
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,864
Hugo's room to get a better look at.

462
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,607
When Hugo dies, Ida decides she must finish off the scarf in time for his birthday on

463
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:08,608
the third day of the game.

464
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,895
On day two, Casey can figure this out and get the crest from Hugo's room and give it to Ida.

465
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:18,280
Okay, like it's maybe an interesting start for something, but is it a whole plot?

466
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:22,663
But on reflection, we realized that our plots weren't very interesting when laid out in

467
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:25,744
this way because they were never designed to be consumed in that way.

468
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:29,885
They were never designed to be interesting when read from start to finish without interruption.

469
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:35,927
So to go back to the ponytail for a second, imagine that upon your head you have just

470
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:40,189
one hair growing out of the top of your head, and it's really long and it grows all the

471
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:40,949
way down your back.

472
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:42,870
But it's just the one hair.

473
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,392
That would look very different than this ponytail.

474
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,074
And our plots are the same.

475
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:48,915
They're designed to allow the player

476
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:51,137
to discover random bits and pieces

477
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,999
and braid things together and gather more and more strands

478
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,182
both on each playthrough and in any given subsequent playthroughs.

479
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:02,025
Writing out the plots in a linear fashion felt reductive

480
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,807
and didn't help us understand how the plot and characters

481
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:07,950
would feel to the player as the player was discovering

482
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,091
random bits and pieces.

483
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12,536
Possibly out of sequence, possibly on multiple playthroughs.

484
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:14,236
Yeah.

485
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:19,338
Um, yeah, so we were feeling kind of, uh, again, more confident,

486
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:22,639
especially as we built out some like demos of the game and kind of

487
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,100
we're realizing that, oh yeah, you know, when you're actually

488
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,562
experiencing the game, these, these plots are working a lot

489
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:31,102
better than they do in that way.

490
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:34,903
Um, and then, uh, kind of, uh, another step that.

491
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:44,738
The first thing that happened in development is that we went to a workshop in early 2019 that started us on this path towards an additional lens on the game's narrative structure.

492
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:49,245
And it got us the idea to

493
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:54,721
Create what we called our dramatic narrative structures, which is up here.

494
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:58,804
Uh, these work similar to a schedule, like the schedules that

495
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,245
we've been working with so far.

496
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,948
But instead of the columns being hours of the day and the rows being like

497
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:07,530
each character, so that we could cross reference what the characters

498
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,334
are doing at whatever time we had one of these diagrams for each character.

499
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:16,237
And then, uh, we simplified the column.

500
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:19,960
So instead of them being like, you know, 10 AM, 11 AM, it was just like.

501
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,870
Morning, lunch, afternoon for each of the three days.

502
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,112
And then, yeah, we had one for each character in a bunch of rows, which I'll go through.

503
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:33,453
Oh yeah, but this is us at work on those.

504
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:42,656
And this, I guess, kind of shows how not only just coming up with all the ideas,

505
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:46,497
but building on them together was a very team approach.

506
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:53,171
Yeah, so each of the rows that were on this sheet, this is an example for Esther.

507
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,671
What about non-player characters?

508
00:31:55,712 --> 00:32:01,294
Um, so there would be, it's a bit hard to read, sorry, but, um, there's Esther's

509
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:05,776
story is the top row, so that's just this character's key scenes.

510
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:06,356
Um.

511
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:13,945
Then there's Esther and Casey, so that's in those incidental scenes what can be going on between Esther and Casey during this window of time.

512
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:19,632
And then there's Esther's attitude, so how Esther's feeling during this period of time.

513
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,764
One other thing that you can see up there is it wasn't just morning, lunch, afternoon for the columns.

514
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:36,690
We also had an overnight column for the NPCs where we described what happens overnight between the days of the game for that character.

515
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:44,755
And then the player can discover that during the next day by chatting with the NPC or overhearing things.

516
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:50,399
And this is another just little thing that we did to make the world feel bigger.

517
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:53,374
Then just what the player can see within the game.

518
00:32:56,135 --> 00:33:00,696
We had a different version of this dramatic narrative structure thing for Casey, the player character.

519
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:12,240
Because there's very little in the game that must happen for the player character, like in most of the game, you're really free to just wander around, listen into whatever, talk to whoever, like.

520
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,002
It was quite tricky, but we still found it quite handy to make one of these diagrams for the player character.

521
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:34,325
The additional columns there are like what we call bookend scenes at the start and end of each day that were like required scenes, but then within the day it's all up to the player.

522
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,907
And Casey's rows were...

523
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:45,591
Casey's attitude, so how Casey, representing the player, might be feeling during this time.

524
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:50,793
Is she curious or comfortable or frustrated? What is Casey's plot at this time?

525
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:58,116
Notes on any specific scenes that will always happen for Casey whenever that would happen,

526
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:02,138
but also generally what's happening between other characters and Casey during this window.

527
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:07,757
Is she meeting a bunch of people for the first time on day one morning?

528
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:12,319
Or is she trying to help people not being able to on day two afternoon?

529
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:18,901
And then there was the player motivations and goals.

530
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:24,042
And in this we're trying to guess at what a player would generally be trying to do

531
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:26,863
at that point in the game on their first playthrough.

532
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:34,126
And this was important because we wanted to give the player complete freedom and a sense that they're creating their own goals,

533
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:43,613
but we just wanted to make sure that generally whatever they would encounter would hopefully just feed towards whatever that goal might be at that time.

534
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,616
It was a lot of kind of like guesswork and hope.

535
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:54,110
Then there's the mechanics row. Are there limits on what the player can do in that time?

536
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,114
Is the action on the ship moving towards a particular place as well?

537
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:01,097
Like at lunchtime everybody goes to the cafeteria for lunch?

538
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:06,622
And are we going to try to build structural things into the script at this time?

539
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:16,165
Each character will recommend two other characters to talk to within the incidental scenes that you have with that character.

540
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:30,168
And then one interesting thing is that we also had colors and lighting on this, which isn't really related to the player's story exactly, but we just wanted to make sure that they wouldn't clash.

541
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:36,409
The weather on day two is really stormy, so we make sure that they're on scenes with the player.

542
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,085
that happened at that time that are really like happy or whatever.

543
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:48,768
Yeah, so with this dramatic narrative structure process, by zooming out a little and not worrying

544
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:53,670
about the specifics of every single scene, this allowed us to define for each character a more

545
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:59,853
meaningful arc or through line through the game as a team as we gathered around these like physical

546
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,094
butcher's papers or A2 prints.

547
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,791
This is an example of what Jodha was talking about earlier,

548
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,532
where a bunch of the core team are working together on this

549
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:15,713
and that it not only allowed us all to collaborate and come up with ideas and

550
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:21,095
solve problems, it also allowed us to share amongst the team

551
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:23,515
exactly what each character's storyline was

552
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:27,496
and the existing decisions and plans and thoughts.

553
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:28,537
And...

554
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:36,453
Yeah, we were also able to identify empty windows of time during this process,

555
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:41,637
or times where for a character they might have a bunch of functional scenes, but

556
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:46,280
there's nothing that really changes their attitude much during that time.

557
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:55,228
Yeah, it just really helped us expand out quite a lot what the player will come across

558
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,909
within a particular playthrough.

559
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:05,284
And also to take things that we had ideas about for a character and actually make sure that they're actually included within the game.

560
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:12,391
So Ted, our young Bunurong man, is a good example of all three of these.

561
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:24,601
He was a very well-defined character, but during this process we realized that sometimes he didn't have much to do, like he didn't have a very active role in a lot of the existing storylines.

562
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:30,173
And so we annotated on this quite a lot during this process on Ted's sheet.

563
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:34,854
And this is a zoom in on that sheet, which is semi-legible.

564
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:42,816
But yeah, a theme that came out of our discussions with the Boon Wurrung community was that members

565
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:48,998
of the community are constantly doing things for each other, helping each other. So Maize Wallen,

566
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:51,839
who's, you know, our composer and audio director,

567
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:56,384
So, we had the idea that Ted is doing something for a member of his community.

568
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:03,453
And then looking at the ideas here, I think we combined ideas 1 and 3 for what actually went into the game.

569
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:08,879
One of Ted's aunties is pregnant, and so she's looking for work, and then Ted's helping her find some work.

570
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:15,815
And then after confirming this approach with our Boon Wurrung consultation collaborators,

571
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:22,558
this turned into over a dozen additional scenes for Ted, both with Casey and with other characters.

572
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:27,580
And we also managed to bring in a bunch of other characters into this storyline that

573
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,281
were a bit bare during some of their time periods as well.

574
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:36,844
Yeah, another example is Tomie, the nonverbal patient in the hospital.

575
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:43,888
As we were trying to get into her mindset and understand her and her perspective,

576
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:47,209
Kalonica Quigley, Wayward's animation director,

577
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:55,312
brought up that it felt like we were relying too heavily on cliches about dementia from popular

578
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:59,993
culture as opposed to lived experience. And so that's where we organized the

579
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:04,315
consultation with Kate Swoffer, who Georgia mentioned before.

580
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:11,478
Yeah, with Kate, we just had this really lovely and kind of frank conversation about living

581
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,239
with dementia.

582
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:17,864
And from that, we were able to unpick some of the harmful stereotypes that we'd accidentally

583
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:23,850
built into Tomy's character, as well as getting just a really good insight into what living

584
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,054
with dementia is actually like, as opposed to what our assumptions were about it.

585
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:38,960
Yeah, just one little example of this is that Tomy is mostly non-verbal and Kate told us

586
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,101
that actually that's quite rare for somebody with dementia.

587
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:49,223
But often a person with dementia won't talk a lot or people will think they're non-verbal

588
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:54,185
because they're just fed up with communicating with people who don't take them seriously

589
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:56,746
or don't know how to communicate with them.

590
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,297
Yeah, and then we were able to express this in the game.

591
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:05,319
We were able to change it so that Tomy does eventually speak to another character

592
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:08,041
who speaks to her in her first language.

593
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:14,564
And then this is, you know, it isn't the player character that like figures this out and does it.

594
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:21,387
It's a different character because we didn't want Tomy as a character to be a puzzle to be solved for the player.

595
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:26,590
Like, because that would then take away from the feeling that Tomy is an active agent in her own life.

596
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,210
Yeah.

597
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:35,413
Yeah, and it was obviously it made the game a lot better, like it's all of this consultation,

598
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:40,258
but it also was just a really enriching process. Like having these conversations

599
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:48,146
was just really incredible and really lovely and the collaborators was super generous and

600
00:40:48,186 --> 00:40:50,769
it just felt like it made us better people. Yeah.

601
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,842
So after all that, we had to actually write it.

602
00:40:56,683 --> 00:41:01,667
Um, this is a tiny, this GIF is a tiny snapshot of our scene list document.

603
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:05,650
So this is what you get when you plot 15 fully realized non-player

604
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,972
characters across three real time days.

605
00:41:07,992 --> 00:41:11,995
Um, and whilst we'd written some test scenes before, it wasn't until we knew

606
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:16,639
that we had the funding runway to complete the game, that we actually tried to get

607
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,921
the thing written from start to finish.

608
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:20,562
Um,

609
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:37,608
It was really difficult to actually write and finish off all of it, and I often remembered a tweet while we were doing it from Jake Elliott, one of the creators of Kentucky Route Zero, who advised to avoid creating homework for yourself during game development.

610
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:44,253
And I was like, oh yeah, okay, we've accidentally created like a thousand scenes of like complicated

611
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:48,675
interwoven subtext filled scenes of homework for ourselves.

612
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:49,436
That was great.

613
00:41:49,496 --> 00:41:50,437
Yeah, good job us.

614
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:55,380
When we went to record voiceover, we printed the script physically for the first time and

615
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:55,820
it was 1500 pages.

616
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,202
So that was a moment of panic.

617
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,004
So actually writing the scenes meant that we were now testing out all of these grand

618
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,165
narrative theories that we'd been talking about earlier.

619
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:12,247
And sometimes our assumption about how a scene would work just didn't actually work when

620
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:16,569
written out in full, or it wasn't feasible from an animation perspective.

621
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:21,171
You know, for me as someone who's used to working with real flesh actors who are amazing,

622
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:25,553
I had to really get out of the habit of saying, Ida finds a piece of paper and folds up a

623
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:26,393
chatter box, or...

624
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:29,997
Esther jumps on top of her dresser and hisses like a banshee.

625
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:35,523
Sometimes getting a particular scene to work would require significant changes from our

626
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:35,923
plan.

627
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:40,488
For example, we used to have an intercom that was on the top level of the ship.

628
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:44,151
There's a chef in the game who's kind of down in the bowels of the ship.

629
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:48,634
And there are various places in the game where you can use the intercom to interact with him.

630
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:52,637
We used to have one on the top level, but most of the other characters interact with him through

631
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:57,120
this intercom that's in the mid-level of the ship. And we just couldn't guarantee,

632
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,701
either from a narrative perspective or a technical perspective,

633
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:01,923
that every time you press that button on the top floor...

634
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:06,104
He wouldn't already be interacting with someone in real time down below.

635
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:11,507
So we had to create this whole thing that, like a sort of subplot where the intercom on the top level is broken.

636
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:15,288
And then there's another scene where Devon kind of explains that to you after you've tried to use it.

637
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:17,429
So things like that would crop up all the time.

638
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:22,186
It was also during the scene writing process as well that we really ensured there was enough

639
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:28,548
Casey-specific content within each character's windows of availability so that we could ensure

640
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:32,349
the player never felt that a character had nothing to speak with them about unless that

641
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:33,529
was our explicit intention.

642
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:37,910
We do have characters in the game who actually don't want to interact with Casey or don't

643
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,571
have anything to say with Casey, but we needed to make sure every instance of that was intentional

644
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:45,372
and that Casey wouldn't ever rock up to a really friendly character's room and then

645
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:47,013
kind of like sit twiddling her thumbs.

646
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:52,835
The dramatic narrative structure diagrams that Jason mentioned earlier were super useful

647
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:56,297
throughout this time as well, because they could really determine the focus of each of

648
00:43:56,357 --> 00:44:02,222
those dynamic incidental scenes, because now each of those scenes could exist to highlight

649
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:06,485
or underscore a character's attitude at that time, as well as relating to the scheduled

650
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:06,885
scenes.

651
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,414
So once we'd finally gotten into the writing of the scenes, we had to ensure that the two

652
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:17,620
of us worked together to keep the characters' voices consistent, despite having two writers

653
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,481
working on the scripts.

654
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,743
And I think we did this in three key ways.

655
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:25,528
It says there are major and minor stake in characters, so by this I mean that there's

656
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:27,891
no character in the game that was written 50% by me and 50% by Jason.

657
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:32,395
Because I think that would have probably led to a bit of an indecisive character voice.

658
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:37,359
There's also no character in the game that was written 100% by me or 100% by Jason,

659
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:42,104
because we felt like that would probably lead to each character having quite a unique voice,

660
00:44:42,124 --> 00:44:43,986
but the tone across the game being inconsistent.

661
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:47,628
So instead, and this is actually something that we've sort of realized after the fact,

662
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:52,771
it wasn't really by design, but we sort of had each of us being kind of the majority

663
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,853
stakeholder for some of the characters, minority stakeholder for other characters.

664
00:44:56,233 --> 00:45:00,816
So for example, I reckon I probably wrote most of Ida's scenes and most of Esther's

665
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:01,276
scenes.

666
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:05,438
I reckon Jason probably wrote most of Neil's scenes, most of Lily's scenes.

667
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:10,990
And the effect that this had is that one of us was able to set the tone and the other

668
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,279
one of us was able to read through what that person had done and kind of follow that tone.

669
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,840
Second thing, and this is a bit more kind of stock standard writing advice, we used people that we

670
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,102
knew and based the character voice on them. So Neil's voice is largely based on an old friend

671
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:31,404
of Jason's. A lot of Esther's turns of phrase come from my family. You know, I think we all,

672
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:36,046
or I hope that it's not just me, that plays out hypothetical conversations in our heads

673
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:41,908
with people that we know. And when you use those voices from your mind that come from

674
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:45,429
a stock of real memories, it just adds a lot of depth and flavor to the game.

675
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:50,331
And I think the final key to the consistency of our character voices is that we had two

676
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,933
writers but only one editor.

677
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:56,717
So Jason and I both wrote on the game, and other team members wrote a few scenes here

678
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,440
or there, but only Jason edited the scenes.

679
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,123
And this meant that although we both had input throughout the process, there was just the

680
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:07,407
one person going through and making sure that each character was consistent in their use

681
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:09,569
of language and consistent in the way that they came across.

682
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,393
For me, I knew we were onto a good thing in terms of the consistency of these characters

683
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:18,076
when we were in the recording studio one day and one of our actors had a question and I

684
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:19,517
was directing the performances.

685
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,880
They said, you know, why does my character say this or what am I feeling in this?

686
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,183
I turned to Jason who was in the room and I was like, oh, what was the thinking behind

687
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:26,684
this line?

688
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,426
And Jason said, you'll have to ask yourself.

689
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:35,731
I'd sort of lost track of the characters and they were sort of taking on their own life

690
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:39,254
so I had forgotten that I had actually written that scene.

691
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:44,297
But we were still revising the script throughout the recording process, as we've mentioned a little bit,

692
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:49,940
with the input from the actors, and the voiceover process was also such a time of discovery for us.

693
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:54,023
The actors often showed us things about our characters that we didn't know yet,

694
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:59,066
and putting our trust in our actors and forming a true collaboration with them really paid off

695
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:02,448
in terms of the depth of feeling that our game was able to achieve.

696
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:04,969
Yeah.

697
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:10,843
Um, so after we completed the VO recording process, uh, and that was a whole thing and

698
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:17,573
our audio team, uh, right up there right now, um, uh, doing a talk about the VO process.

699
00:47:18,013 --> 00:47:18,073
Uh.

700
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,756
Which I think shows our team's commitment to simultaneous storytelling.

701
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:28,978
Anyway, after the VR, there was another stage of revision as we were implementing

702
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:31,639
like the scenes into Unity with the animations.

703
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:38,141
And at that point, like all of the VR was done, but we were able to still kind of

704
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:43,462
like break a scene apart or like, yeah, just change the way that the player goes

705
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:44,983
into it or all of that kind of stuff.

706
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:51,844
Make only some of it available depending on if certain options are set and that kind of thing.

707
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:56,825
And a lot of this just came out of like playtesting the game and kind of feeling out

708
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:02,526
like which scenes feel too long, which scenes would be better if Casey is like asking questions

709
00:48:02,586 --> 00:48:10,268
to go into sections of it as opposed to just being like a longer set section and that kind of thing.

710
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:17,916
Yeah, so after seven years of development, we released Wayward Strand in September last

711
00:48:17,976 --> 00:48:18,176
year.

712
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,297
How did it go?

713
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:22,458
Well it was definitely an experiment.

714
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:27,060
We were trying out a new narrative form in order to tell a story that reflected the values

715
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,581
we were trying to instill into the game.

716
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:34,183
The values of subtlety, of complicated narratives that don't fit into stereotypical structures,

717
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:38,925
and of representing characters that aren't often represented in games, especially as

718
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,046
active agents in their own lives.

719
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:45,267
And the feedback that we've heard in general has been great.

720
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:48,048
Like, yeah, very positive.

721
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:51,210
But the specific things that we're hearing about the game

722
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,731
tell us that we're going in the right direction.

723
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:57,033
That this style of storytelling allows us to present characters

724
00:48:57,314 --> 00:49:01,876
in what feels like a brand new, like realer feeling way

725
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:03,817
compared to other styles of storytelling,

726
00:49:03,997 --> 00:49:06,018
even within the medium of games.

727
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:07,499
Yeah.

728
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,381
All right, time for some takeaways.

729
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:18,451
There's some stuff that's not on this slide that I wanted to mention before I go through

730
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:19,292
these points as well.

731
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:25,196
Just shouting back to the earlier parts of the presentation, we really recommend that

732
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:31,261
your studio find some way to form some relationship with the traditional owners wherever you are.

733
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,044
That's more relevant in some parts of the world than in other parts of the world, but

734
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:37,126
it's been incredibly meaningful for us.

735
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:42,652
We've engaged in that consultation ongoing, we've paid for that consultation, and it's

736
00:49:42,972 --> 00:49:45,133
been really, really a wonderful thing.

737
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,573
So we definitely encourage you to do that.

738
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:53,755
So we created a game in which stripping back player agency allowed for more dynamic, vibrant,

739
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:58,236
and alive NPCs, and a player experience that encouraged listening and reflection, which

740
00:49:58,276 --> 00:49:59,096
is what we were going for.

741
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:01,057
We did it all by experiment.

742
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,938
We couldn't go over it, we couldn't go under it, we had to go through it, and we strongly

743
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:06,078
encourage you to do the same.

744
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,692
We started with strong values and we never compromised on those values.

745
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:15,135
This motivated us to make the game, but those values are also structural to the game.

746
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,797
They're the muscles that operate the machinery that we built.

747
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:23,261
And we proved our hypothesis that just like those individual strands of hair that would be very strange

748
00:50:23,301 --> 00:50:26,443
if they were growing alone out the top of your head, like I was talking about before,

749
00:50:26,463 --> 00:50:30,926
our simultaneous stories created an experience that was much more than the sum of its parts.

750
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:35,929
And speaking of the ponytail, ponytail is a real narrative structure that everyone now knows about.

751
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,637
Thank you so much for coming to our talk.

752
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:41,463
Thank you.

753
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:48,032
We're very proud of this game and we're very humbled by the response it's had.

754
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:52,055
We're here at GDC looking for long-term partnerships for our future projects.

755
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:55,117
So if you know anyone who you think might share our vision for

756
00:50:55,157 --> 00:50:56,538
games, please put us in touch.

757
00:50:57,279 --> 00:51:00,101
We'd love to see you to have a chat after the session, get your

758
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,702
feedback, answer any questions.

759
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:03,884
And if you see us around, say hi.

760
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:07,606
I do believe that we also have like approx five minutes

761
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:09,228
left for some questions.

762
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:11,950
So if anyone does have any questions, please feel free to step up to.

763
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:14,290
Is it these mics here, I believe?

764
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:18,223
Alright, I think you were first.

765
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:19,025
Alright.

766
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:23,054
So, amazing talk, really inspiring, really appreciated it.

767
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:24,015
Thank you.

768
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,175
I did have a question.

769
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:31,820
You mentioned how the simultaneous stories are more together than, you know, for some

770
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,821
of their parts and all that.

771
00:51:33,902 --> 00:51:39,686
How do you in the game encourage the player to follow through these distractions so that

772
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:44,589
they do not experience the stories as a single strand, taking away the value as a whole?

773
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:54,762
That's a great question. I think that my take on that would just be that it would be really hard to follow the one story the whole way through.

774
00:51:54,782 --> 00:52:04,225
And the reason that that is, is that any given character that you are speaking to, especially earlier on in the game, there'll always come a time where they have stuff that they need to do.

775
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:04,425
Like,

776
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,729
A nurse might come into the room and need to kind of assist them into their wheelchair

777
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:11,272
so they can go to lunch and they ask you to leave the room at that point.

778
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,236
A character might get tired and ask you to leave so they can have a nap.

779
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,619
They might even, you know, if you're talking to them about a specific thing, like there's

780
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,524
a thread through the game where Casey has an interest in the history of the airship.

781
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:23,285
You might be talking to someone and they'll say,

782
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:25,626
Oh, Mr. Proust knows about that. You should go talk to him.

783
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:31,228
And so both explicitly with the characters telling you to go do other stuff,

784
00:52:31,288 --> 00:52:34,370
but also implicitly with them having to get on with their own lives,

785
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:39,352
it kind of, each narrative shunts you out of it pretty quickly and into other ones.

786
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:42,773
And it would be quite difficult to linger with the one character the whole time.

787
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:43,814
Perfect. Thank you.

788
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:44,354
No worries.

789
00:52:46,193 --> 00:52:47,934
Hello, great talk, thank you.

790
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:56,340
I had a question about how in your game does the time move on and how did that imply the

791
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:03,065
way you built the narrative and the way you kept the player to engage with the narrative

792
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:07,828
and all of the edge case with a time-based narrative like you did.

793
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:11,957
Thank you. I just remembered that our facilitator said that I should repeat the questions back

794
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:16,343
before answering them for the purpose of recording. So the question was about how time moves on

795
00:53:16,383 --> 00:53:22,331
in the game and how we deal with edge cases around the functioning of time and how that

796
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:25,715
time mechanic interacts with the narrative. I reckon this is a you question.

797
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:28,740
Yeah, so it was definitely super complicated.

798
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,788
And yeah, I guess we've got like, you know, a timer that moves forward at like, I think,

799
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:39,014
eight times speed, we changed it around a bunch of 16 times, six times,

800
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:43,200
but we ended up on eight times. And then all of the scenes that

801
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,801
A meant to play will play out when they're meant to play.

802
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:50,703
All of the incidental scenes have windows where they can play or not play.

803
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:58,787
And then we eventually built in a delaying system so that if a player is halfway through a

804
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:01,948
conversation with somebody, one of those incidentals and another one is meant,

805
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:05,709
as another scene is meant to play at that time, it'll just delay so that

806
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,378
The player can finish their conversation.

807
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:12,441
We initially wanted to not do that, and then the player was always getting interrupted

808
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,224
right when they were about to ask a question and it was really annoying.

809
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:16,745
So, yeah, that's just...

810
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:19,067
It was very complicated, is the short answer.

811
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:19,407
Yeah, whatever.

812
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:19,507
Yeah.

813
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:19,607
Yeah.

814
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:19,708
Yeah.

815
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:19,808
Yeah.

816
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:20,728
Yeah.

817
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:20,828
Yeah.

818
00:54:20,848 --> 00:54:20,929
Yeah.

819
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:21,129
Yeah.

820
00:54:21,149 --> 00:54:21,229
Yeah.

821
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:21,329
Yeah.

822
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:21,449
Yeah.

823
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:21,549
Yeah.

824
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:21,649
Yeah.

825
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:21,749
Yeah.

826
00:54:21,769 --> 00:54:21,849
Yeah.

827
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:30,857
Thanks. My question piggybacks off the first one a little bit. Games that allow players to

828
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:37,782
pursue depth or breadth on a time limit often have a problem where people who dabble a little

829
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:43,867
and never go deep anywhere miss things. And I was curious to hear if you had sort of wrestled

830
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:47,390
with that question and if you had landed on an answer for how to deal with people who

831
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:51,613
got a little bit of a lot of experiences and never went super deep.

832
00:54:52,215 --> 00:55:17,903
Yeah, cool. Yeah, so the question was, like, how did we deal with the fact that often in these games, players might just dabble in various storylines and get distracted and never really get like a like a full complete storyline on a particular playthrough. One part of that I think was like, Ruth and Casey, Casey's mom, the head nurse, they have like this relationship with each other, that

833
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:22,675
changes a lot over the course of the game, especially in those bookend scenes that are

834
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:28,977
at the start and end of each day. So that has its own arc to it and that comes to a resolution.

835
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:36,118
And so you kind of, I think even on a single playthrough, you get some kind of plot. But then

836
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:42,080
we just embraced the chaos as well. And yeah, it seemed to work surprisingly.
