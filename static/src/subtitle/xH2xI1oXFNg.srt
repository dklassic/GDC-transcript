00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,811
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:05,411
My name is Brian Francis.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,553
I am, as always, the invisible voice inside your head.

4
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:13,095
I just realized that I left the audio on this clip up really high.

5
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,415
I'm going to quickly edit that.

6
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,876
I always get surprised by that.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,817
Yeah, my name's Brian.

8
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:24,419
It is 8 o'clock here in California, so it's a little early and a little tired.

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,380
Brian, isn't 8am early for most people?

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,181
Yes, or on nor- isn't that a normal start work time for most people?

11
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,002
Yes it is, but all of you still need coffee and tea.

12
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:38,242
So, uh, I, uh, see nothing wrong with that.

13
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:41,623
Anyway, um, I am here today, uh, playing Elsinore.

14
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:43,723
I should rather say I played Elsinore.

15
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,364
Um, uh, with me in the lower left-hand corner of the screen

16
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:51,485
are two fine folks from the development team behind Elsinore, Golden Glitch Studios.

17
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:54,445
Um, I have Connor and Eric. How are you guys doing?

18
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:56,966
Doing well, how are you? Thanks for having us on.

19
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:59,215
Good. Yeah, I'm doing good.

20
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:04,184
Um, uh, what, I guess I could try and describe Elsinore, but do you both

21
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,626
want to describe Elsinore?

22
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,491
It's pretty clearly, if you haven't guessed by now, there's some Shakespeare involved.

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,874
Yeah, so Elsinore is, Cliff Notes would be Groundhog Day plus Hamlet.

24
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:18,018
The idea is you're playing as Ophelia trying to find a way to stop all your friends and

25
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:19,179
family from murdering each other.

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,963
But the problem is because they're all Shakespeare characters, most of the things you do result

27
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,025
in them finding different ways to murder each other.

28
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:30,948
But every time through you learn more and more stuff that allows you to change the story

29
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,350
in more and more dramatic ways.

30
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:38,572
Mm-hmm. Yeah, as you can see so what we're seeing today folks and I fold this full disclaimer on this usually

31
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:46,521
Usually we try to play games live here due to logistical complications. We are looking at some pre-recorded footage, but that being said

32
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,583
Thankfully, because this is an interesting game, so many interesting things are going to happen and we can talk about it.

33
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,005
So actually, yeah, let's get started.

34
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:59,573
We can talk about right here, we're looking at the timeline of events, which is really empty right now because we only know about one thing.

35
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,976
But this timeline feature is really cool.

36
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:02,998
It's kind of a defining.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,782
mechanic of the game that lets the players study when things will happen, when they want to be in the game.

38
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:24,805
Would you mind breaking down, I guess, first off, how did Elsinore start development, and how did the timeline feature start to come about?

39
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,266
Sure, I'll handle the first one, and then Eric, you want to talk about the timeline?

40
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:28,486
Yeah.

41
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,527
Because that was like a huge tech problem.

42
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:31,627
So...

43
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:40,612
Elsinore started, a lot of us met each other through a club back in college called Game

44
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,492
Creation Society.

45
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:47,797
And one month, that club had a contest theme that was Shakespeare, which was like, hey,

46
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,879
make a Shakespeare-themed game in a week.

47
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,484
And our team lead, Katie, Katie Chironis, came up with this, basically the fundamentals

48
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:57,605
of this idea during that.

49
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:00,988
And I was talking to her and I'm like, this is a great idea.

50
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,150
There's no way we're making this in one week.

51
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,490
And so we foolishly were like, well, we'll make it next summer.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,872
And then we like tried to do a little bit like over the summer.

53
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:11,513
And, you know, we were still students.

54
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,915
And it was not there was not enough time to do it.

55
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:15,616
So we shelved it.

56
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,036
And we but we kept returning to it.

57
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:22,700
And eventually, you know, like I think a year or two after we all graduated,

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,822
we talked about we had done this game jam with Eric.

59
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:32,361
That was the Molly Jam, where we made a game called MechaMom that people seemed to like.

60
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:37,346
It was a ridiculous comedy controls game where you're trying to hug your daughter in a giant robot suit.

61
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,610
And we started talking about how we should work on something together longer term.

62
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:48,097
And then we recruited Kristen as well, and kind of expanded out from there.

63
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:49,758
Fal, Duncan, Wes.

64
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:54,628
And that was kind of our core team.

65
00:03:54,688 --> 00:04:01,094
And we've been working every Sunday to kind of slowly make progress on this game for the last six years.

66
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,315
And I was finally out.

67
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:04,037
Yeah, congrats!

68
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,379
Thank you.

69
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,341
Anyway, Eric, yeah, so the timeline picture.

70
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:15,608
I guess, so, before I tell you why we need the timeline, I need to say a little bit about what the game is doing mechanically with why we need a timeline.

71
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,253
So you can see right there the hourglass on people's heads.

72
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:21,414
Characters are running around and going to events.

73
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:27,057
So we put it in a virtual space where they have to actually go to rooms at certain times

74
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:27,737
and meet each other.

75
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,601
So the way the game works is there's this giant bag of different events that can all

76
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:38,463
happen predicated on different things and as Ophelia is talking to people and trying

77
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,084
to influence them, you change what they happen.

78
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,845
And so we needed just...

79
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:47,160
some way for the player to be able to tell at all what was going on and what events were

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,063
happening and that's what the necessity for the timeline came about.

81
00:04:52,083 --> 00:05:00,527
And we spent a lot of time iterating and trying to get it right, like the forms you see here,

82
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:06,210
I think I would say it was probably like the most changed UI in the game since I think

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,572
it provides like the most useful information of all the things.

84
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:19,476
We actually made a huge revision, it was the, we made a huge revision pass shortly before release because we're like, it's still not quite doing what we want it to do.

85
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:27,799
I think the big, the thing that Eric didn't mention that I think is really impressive about the timeline is like, so our game is a simulation, right?

86
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:34,042
Which means, at least in the background, like all the scenes are handwritten, but like, as Eric said, like we're choosing events based on a bunch of variables.

87
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:34,882
And.

88
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,716
What that means is that simulation can change if you input new stuff,

89
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,058
and we can't ever be 100% sure what's going to happen in the future.

90
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:44,338
And so, Eric—

91
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:45,839
The timeline shows you the future thing.

92
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,819
Yeah, it's not a printout.

93
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:50,560
Those blue events that were on it before, it was giving you hints about what would happen in the future.

94
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:55,542
Yeah, so basically we simulate the entire game every time you open the timeline

95
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:58,623
to show—to guess what will happen in the future,

96
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,604
so we can show you future events.

97
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,865
Like it! It's like, you just stand there. It is what will happen.

98
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:05,606
As soon as you start doing things.

99
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:08,687
The timeline will change next time you open it.

100
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:14,204
Right on. I'm just going to quickly let folks in chat know, we are taking questions from chat.

101
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:17,405
If you have something you specifically want to ask about making Elsinore,

102
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:22,406
quick shout out to Steel Fox, the Steel Fox, the one and only Steel Fox, I presume,

103
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:27,227
for joining us. We would love to see some other folks.

104
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:31,748
If you have questions for Connor and Eric, go ahead, ask them. I don't mind.

105
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:39,030
I guess as a follow up, so the timeline and the simulation are really important to talk about

106
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,390
because...

107
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,153
You know, you sort of have sold this game a little bit as a point-and-click adventure game,

108
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:46,054
but it's not just a point-and-click adventure game.

109
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,095
It's got that simulation element to what we talked about.

110
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,458
What is sort of the underlying structure of making that simulation function?

111
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,082
And how did you wind up making it work on a Sunday, strictly Sunday schedule?

112
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,103
I guess that's a quick way to put it.

113
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:03,285
Yeah, so what you described as a good thing is we're trying to...

114
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,939
Basically combine the choose your own adventure in the simulation.

115
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,240
And like that's I think what got me really interested in the project.

116
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,740
And that was the first major hurdle.

117
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,062
And so what we spent a lot of time on at the beginning was coming up with a good

118
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:24,584
way for Katie and Connor, the writer and designer to control this and like

119
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:29,245
thinking about this, how these events could be scripted and how, like what

120
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,205
the relationship between them was.

121
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:32,766
So we went through a lot of iterations where at first it was like.

122
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,917
You would just write in some JSON files being like,

123
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:38,538
oh, this event, if it happens, then this other event can happen,

124
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,299
kind of like a standard two-generator adventure chain,

125
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,100
and it just didn't let us get the simulation bits we needed.

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,201
And so eventually what we turned to is a model where

127
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:50,263
the game state and all the events we've built on it are built on top of

128
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,444
sort of like the mental states of the NPCs.

129
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,765
So the things that you are changing as a player

130
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,466
and the things that the events are predicated on,

131
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:58,406
the things that they change,

132
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:02,148
are like what Hamlet knows and what Hamlet wants to do.

133
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,688
So like Hamlet wants to investigate his...

134
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,680
Hamlet wants to avoid Hamlet.

135
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:16,362
What we did is we built a scripting language and a bunch of related tools to control that

136
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:21,163
in all the scenes and specify how every single event changes and what they accept and what

137
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:21,884
they don't.

138
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:25,645
I've actually spent a lot of time working on that aspect.

139
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,125
I said most of my time was spent building these tools used to control the simulation.

140
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:33,304
Yeah, and there'd be things where we thought we mostly had it down, and it's like,

141
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:37,485
oh, no, wait, we really need a way to be like, hey, if you're on a pirate ship,

142
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:42,006
you shouldn't trigger any of the events that are happening away from the ship, right?

143
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:44,846
Because then you're going to get dragged off to the castle.

144
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:48,927
Actually, I just fixed a bug where there was one that we missed.

145
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:54,168
But it's just like, you know, there's a lot of interesting spatial stuff there

146
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,969
that we kept having to iterate over the system and be like, what are we missing?

147
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:00,777
like in order to flesh it out a little bit more.

148
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,478
From a narrative and design structure,

149
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:05,439
the way we approached creating a lot of content

150
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,061
was we kind of had two terms we used for events,

151
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,702
which was spine and like plot clouds.

152
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:14,163
And the spine events was like.

153
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:19,115
The original spine was, is basically, hey, this is the play of Hamlet, right?

154
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:24,298
If you do nothing, these events are all structured to flow into each other without any input

155
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,579
from the player, right?

156
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,023
And just for, just as a clarification for my own understanding, so the spine events

157
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:34,125
happen because the behaviors were set up to trigger sort of the spine events of Hamlet.

158
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:34,446
Yes.

159
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,448
Not, there's a fix, it's not like...

160
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,453
So to say, you know, like the phrase hard-coded, like...

161
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,374
Yeah, no, no, no.

162
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:48,657
It's not hard-coded to happen, it's the core motivation to drive Hamlet.

163
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,979
Yeah, yeah, and if you can like...

164
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:50,939
Yeah, go on there.

165
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,642
I was like, you can see right here, probably in the scene, I think,

166
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:54,843
because you're about to share something,

167
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:59,587
and the last thing it's going to say something like Gertrude now knows XYZ.

168
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,008
Yeah, now wants to play Game of Thrones.

169
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,590
Or Ophelia now wants to... Yeah, those things right there.

170
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,213
What it's actually showing you is the game state that's changing.

171
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:06,513
Yeah.

172
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,147
That's then changing what the events are.

173
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:11,048
All those events are scripted in terms of those things.

174
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,569
Yeah.

175
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:20,051
We had quite a bit of discussion about how not computery we should make those.

176
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,852
Because fundamentally what they're doing is they're exposing the computer system.

177
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,613
And the more less computery we make them,

178
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:30,094
that was a convoluted sentence,

179
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:34,615
but anyway, the less obvious it is that it's actually a systematic thing that we're showing you.

180
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:40,354
So, uh, yeah, this is what we ended up here was like somewhere in the middle, right?

181
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:47,198
Where they're written out, but it's still like you can still kind of tell that like it's it's reporting a state back to you.

182
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:48,178
Um

183
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,980
Yeah, no, no, no, um

184
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:59,303
I'm watching what you're doing in the stream. You're talking to uh to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

185
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:04,105
Yeah, uh Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two really fun characters. Um, obviously

186
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,318
There's precedents for having fun with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,

187
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,440
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

188
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,802
And we definitely had our own brand of fun with them in that they're like...

189
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:18,207
They are, they get up to, you know, they're kind of disconnected from the main

190
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,891
conflict, and so they'll end up having their own weird side stories.

191
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,975
That was actually a big part of the fun of working on narrative and design for this game was like, even

192
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,358
when we're talking about those events that flow into each other, by default,

193
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:35,433
There's a bunch of them that aren't in the original play, right?

194
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:37,274
Because you had to answer the question of like...

195
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,675
We're gonna see some later in the stream, by the way.

196
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,316
We're gonna see stuff that's not in the original play.

197
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:44,618
Oh yeah, I don't know. There's a ton once you start actually changing things.

198
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,199
But even if you don't change anything,

199
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,680
there's a lot of questions like,

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,302
what does Gertrude get up to when, like,

201
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,863
she's not on stage in the original play, right?

202
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:56,486
Like, Brit and Irma are two characters who would be around the castle,

203
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:59,067
the cook and the handmaiden, but like...

204
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:04,046
You don't see them in the play, so there's stuff around them.

205
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:08,088
Oh yeah, so this is part of what we did in the first loop, which is like...

206
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,792
Originally, when we were in very early stages of this game,

207
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:18,215
you were able to immediately start changing everything.

208
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,698
And the problem we ran into very quickly with that is

209
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:25,020
players would think they were responsible for stuff from the original play.

210
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,283
And there's this thing of, if you're in a time loop trying to change something,

211
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,677
You needed to understand what you're changing.

212
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:32,238
Yes.

213
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:36,401
So we went through a lot of iteration trying to figure out what's the right amount to like...

214
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:41,324
We still want the player to get that sense of like they're able to change stuff and you are able to change stuff, right?

215
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:50,771
But like, in this first loop, getting through the main events of Hamlet and getting a sense of what the stakes are and who the main players are,

216
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:55,755
enough so the second time through you have some action items instead of being kind of directionless.

217
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:56,235
Yeah.

218
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:58,888
Yeah, I noticed that too.

219
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,589
Because like when you start up this game, you get to go through...

220
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,229
And I thought it was actually very touching.

221
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,690
It was very touching in a sense.

222
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,051
You get to see Ophelia's perspective in Hamlet.

223
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:14,314
And the sense of being locked and railroaded towards her own death is a really good thematic note to start the game on.

224
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:14,434
Yes.

225
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:19,296
Because it's a very good incentive for her to fight and scramble against that.

226
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:23,941
I would love to keep diving into my own design questions and programming questions.

227
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:25,203
I'm going to quickly go to chat.

228
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:30,028
I'm going to give a quick shout out to VtechieM.

229
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,210
I recognize Vtech from Shell Games.

230
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,231
Giving you a quick shout out.

231
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:33,892
Well, hello.

232
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:34,753
It's Mike.

233
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,295
Yeah, I was going to say, it's your own co-worker.

234
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:36,815
Yeah, Mike.

235
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:37,156
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:37,516
Yeah.

237
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:37,997
Yeah.

238
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:38,837
I am thankful.

239
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:43,646
And a quick shout out to Skylander12 would like to know,

240
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,827
why was Hamlet the source story for this?

241
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,548
As opposed to other Shakespeare stories or other literature.

242
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:55,670
I know we have to give a lot of shout outs to Katie and Koronis in general.

243
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,310
Is it Koronis or Chironis?

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,441
I've known her for a very long time, but somehow that question just scrambled my brain.

245
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,681
I, like, it's Sharonis.

246
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,402
Yeah, so, Sharonis.

247
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,742
So, Katie Sharonis, we should give her a quick shoutout.

248
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,943
We're gonna have to, like, we're gonna have to give her a shoutout for a lot of these things.

249
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:16,524
She's part of the reason we're streaming. She helped get me in touch with YouTube.

250
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,824
She has answered some questions about this on her own Twitter feed,

251
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,645
and I would strongly recommend folks check that out.

252
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,245
But Connor, maybe you'd like to tell that tale.

253
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,426
Yeah, I mean, it's basically like...

254
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,749
One, we were both, Katie and I were both humanities majors, right?

255
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:34,173
We were, we were, I think, at the moment of this reading, doing a class where we're talking about

256
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:39,517
Hamlet a lot. So it was prominent in our minds, but also for Katie personally, like, she's told,

257
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:45,242
and this is the story that she kind of told on her Twitter, like, she, um, will, she, when she

258
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:50,967
first read Hamlet, she, as a young kid, she always felt like Ophelia got the short stick, which she

259
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:55,510
did. Her role in the original play is to, like, have her heart broken and be harassed by Hamlet

260
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,912
and then die, right?

261
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:05,923
And yet there's all this literature and all these people who have studied Ophelia and

262
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,564
read into her.

263
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:16,929
And basically it just felt like a good opportunity to give her a new lease, I guess.

264
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,371
And also Hamlet is my personal favorite Shakespeare play.

265
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:23,713
So that's, I think, a reason to pick it.

266
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:24,413
It's not as...

267
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:28,936
Oh, a good reason, another reason that I think Hamlet works very well is there's two very

268
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:33,820
clear characters that drive the conflict, who in this case are not you, which works

269
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,322
very well for simulation engine style gameplay, right?

270
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,383
It's Claudius and Hamlet.

271
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:43,666
And like, and that means that like you're kind of, you're in the middle of the tug of

272
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:49,430
war between these two characters, and that lends itself very well to the game that we

273
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:49,630
made.

274
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,152
Yeah, Eric, do you have anything to add to that?

275
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:54,935
I think so.

276
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:55,555
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:59,079
Yeah, Eric, actually though, while talking, swinging back to Simulation Engine, I think

278
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,020
we can swing back to you.

279
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:06,086
We talked before about how the Simulation Engine is driven by everyone's wants and needs,

280
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,628
which is kind of appropriate.

281
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,852
This game started development, I know you weren't part of the original team, but obviously

282
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:14,575
a six year game development cycle means it's been...

283
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:18,858
A lot of other games have come out with interesting simulation engines in the interim.

284
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,021
But even before that we had Dwarf Fortress as kind of the one of the urr

285
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:29,026
Simulation engine games you've got I guess there are some way back. I'm I I just want to quickly correct that notion

286
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:33,088
Katie and I were like tinkering with vaguely Elsinore ideas

287
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:38,232
but Eric and Kristen and Val were very much part of the team from like

288
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,294
early enough to be the original team.

289
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,076
I think six years ago is when the team was formed.

290
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:45,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, yeah. Six years ago is when the team formed.

291
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,101
The initial tinkering was like eight years ago.

292
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:48,762
Right, right, right.

293
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,004
We're talking about, we're talking about Thor Fortress and simulation games.

294
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:51,705
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

295
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,927
My bad. Uh, yeah, no, that's a good thing to correct. Um, anyway, yeah.

296
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,551
So six years, so like it's been a lot of simulation games have grown and grown.

297
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:02,915
Um, Watch Dogs Legion is now like, like AAA games have decided that simulation

298
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,196
games are going to be part of their bag.

299
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:06,978
This was something I was seeing a lot of at E3 this year.

300
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:07,658
How do you feel...

301
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,219
Well, no.

302
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,021
The question was weirdly veering towards,

303
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,642
how do you feel about everyone else stealing your thunder?

304
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:13,723
That's not what I want to ask.

305
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:18,146
Eric, it's more like, what do you think is becoming more possible with simulation games?

306
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,607
And what do you think other developers should know about working in this field,

307
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,289
based on what you've learned as a programmer?

308
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,351
I'm the... I'm not quite...

309
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,793
What I feel is, I'm really happy more than we're showing up.

310
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,374
So, the... I kind of hinted at this earlier, but...

311
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:30,795
What?

312
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:38,028
The interesting problem in this space is controlling them.

313
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,928
Like, I really love Dwarf Fortress, for instance,

314
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:41,429
just like I mentioned, and a bunch of the other ones.

315
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,190
I also like a lot of the Paradox games, too,

316
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,090
which I think fall into this category of kind of like

317
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,271
these just open-ended simulations where you do stuff

318
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,312
and they will sometimes tell you interesting stories.

319
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,973
And the main challenge with those is that

320
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,415
sometimes they don't, sometimes it's just boring stuff.

321
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,276
And so the question is, as a designer, for me,

322
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,416
at least especially with this, it's like,

323
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:02,517
this kind of game is.

324
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,562
How can we make it possible to build this simulation game,

325
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:12,404
but kind of force it to constantly be showing the player

326
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:15,445
interesting or exciting stories?

327
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:15,785
Yeah.

328
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,326
Like as often as possible.

329
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:18,207
Yeah.

330
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:21,108
And this game was an exercise of how can we best balance

331
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,149
a choose your own adventure,

332
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:26,871
sense of control of the pacing and what's going on,

333
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,552
but with an open-ended simulation to like actually get

334
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,372
like a pretty rich.

335
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,604
state space of things that could possibly happen.

336
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,146
The fact that one of our objectives was to constantly skew towards tragedy helped a lot.

337
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:40,827
Yeah, I actually...

338
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,608
What, what, what am I initially...

339
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,349
This is not, this is not what this game is at all.

340
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,150
One of the initial ideas I said it about, like,

341
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,512
between what we'll make some other day, is a game that just sort of like

342
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:53,493
maliciously makes the outcome as bad as possible,

343
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,055
no matter what you do, in a way that's like technically compatible with what you know so far.

344
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:01,963
Maybe that's just the Richard III simulation.

345
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:06,945
You use the same engine to make a Richard III play and everything ends with people getting cooked into pies.

346
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:13,867
Yeah, there's a lot of actual work. Both Kristen and myself come from academic backgrounds.

347
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,508
I just finished a doctoral degree.

348
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:20,855
There's a lot of work in that space on these kind of...

349
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,155
I have to give a shout-out to her advisor for example.

350
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:27,476
He wasn't involved in this project, but he's in that kind of space of intelligent narratives.

351
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,556
Trying to get the computers to be a little more...

352
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:35,878
A little smarter about how they're presenting a narrative to you,

353
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,958
so you can try to do these things like intentionally keep the story exciting,

354
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:43,659
or try to make up stuff that's compatible with the facts that you've been given so far.

355
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:45,988
try to lead to particular outcomes.

356
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,613
And so there's a lot of people working on this at very different levels,

357
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,757
not just in game development proper.

358
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:54,062
Which, I'm excited for a lot of the stuff that's going to come up in the future.

359
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:59,668
Um, uh, one thing, one thing that we're about to, that we're, I don't know if we're sort

360
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:04,673
of experiencing right now in this playback, but, um, you just mentioned something interesting,

361
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,675
which is like keeping interesting things happening.

362
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:11,400
Uh, I think, I think something interesting about the, the simulation engine kind of game

363
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,145
is the concept of, I guess you would call it dead air, which is what is happening when

364
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:17,586
essentially nothing is happening.

365
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:23,012
I'm sure during development you were getting a lot of feedback saying nothing interesting

366
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,275
is happening right now, how can I make the interesting things happen.

367
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,536
What was your...

368
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:47,213
After you designed the engine, what did you guys learn about teaching players to find

369
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:48,775
and instigate the interesting things?

370
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:52,619
Because one half of the game is the stuff playing out, the other half is walking up

371
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:56,603
to someone and telling, I saw Claudius confess that he killed Hamlet's dad, like we're seeing

372
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:56,903
right now.

373
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:59,806
And Bernardo's just like, nothing I can do about that.

374
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,732
Yeah, so part of that is presentational.

375
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:09,394
Like a lot of the things you see in the map, there's nothing on it right now, but sometimes

376
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:14,156
the rooms are blue on the map, and they try to surface very strongly where the things

377
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:14,576
were happening.

378
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:15,856
Because that was a really big problem.

379
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,457
Like when I would be playing the earlier prototypes, it's like, what do I do?

380
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:20,098
I guess I'll just follow Hamlet around all day.

381
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,100
Which will sometimes do interesting stuff, but a lot of it you're just following Hamlet

382
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,840
wandering around all day.

383
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:30,465
So we try to like, there's like hourglasses on people's heads if you see them walking places,

384
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:34,507
there's the events on the map, there's the timeline for the things you know about.

385
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:40,090
So we tried to present this very strongly to give you a sense of where can I go right now to find stuff.

386
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:47,133
There's also, I think, a lot of just trying to create little things.

387
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:51,395
When I was talking about plot clouds, we also had like flavor events, right, which are like...

388
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,299
Little things that aren't important to the overall story but develop characters, right?

389
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,960
Like, just the little- that they get up to when they're not doing something else.

390
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,841
And those are kind of designed to fill in gaps in the schedule and be shifted around freely.

391
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,542
Um, so like, we tried to lean into those a little bit, and that like,

392
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:13,863
there's usually, if you're waiting for the next big thing, there's something to do.

393
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:19,024
Whether it's characters to talk to, or things to look at in the environment, um, to like-

394
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:21,076
to occupy your time.

395
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:23,538
And then of course, once you're in the later loops,

396
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,979
at that point you have a very strong mental model

397
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,321
of like, you've learned how to kind of manipulate the system.

398
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:32,003
And then we see people using the fast forward feature more,

399
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:35,725
right, like going to specific events they want to go to.

400
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,607
But a lot of those things I just talked about

401
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:40,809
help bridge that gap early on in the game.

402
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,511
Like you can see here, you're just talking to everybody

403
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,752
and like, yes, a lot of those things don't have results,

404
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:48,794
but it's better than you just standing around, right?

405
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:49,474
Like.

406
00:22:51,219 --> 00:23:00,785
And like, even then, like, if they don't have simulation results, you're getting pieces of information that inform, like, your mental model of the character, that could help you—a lot of those give you, like—

407
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:05,689
Hints on like how you'll solve future things or how you'll deal with future scenarios.

408
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:09,030
Yeah, this Brit moment is actually about to be very telling about that.

409
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,532
I'm going to go to chat for the app named Marcus Loralius.

410
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:15,853
They have a question.

411
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:19,295
They've played a few hours and they've been enjoying the romance subplots and options

412
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,616
that are showing up and they wanted to know if that was something you knew you wanted

413
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,237
to include early on or if it came later.

414
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,978
We knew fairly early on, yeah.

415
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,720
If you're going through a loop over and over again.

416
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,776
One of the questions you're going to ask yourself is who can you smooch?

417
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:38,017
And like, so we let you smooch a bunch of people.

418
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:39,997
And other people smooch each other.

419
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:40,858
Yes.

420
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:41,538
Yes.

421
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:45,559
There's, there's, there's plenty of shenanigans that go on in this four day loop.

422
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:48,959
There was actually an interesting, Katie's talked about this a little bit, because

423
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:53,040
it's a four day loop though, there is sometimes we have to like fast forward

424
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,521
the romance a little bit, right?

425
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:58,082
It's like, uh, and, and that's just an interesting.

426
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:02,296
Interesting scenario that you'll write around and I think she did a pretty good job

427
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:08,318
She thinks you did a really good job, but it was a really hard writing problem. Yeah, there's a there's a it's a bit of

428
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:11,159
There's some whirlwind romances that sort of yeah kick up

429
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,401
Thank you for the good question questions from chat folks, uh, we will gladly

430
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,083
Take more throughout the hour

431
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:35,668
What I am going to ask about now is, um, so, uh, something that has interested me about

432
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,650
games like these is what happens when you sort of make outlier events that are sort

433
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,071
of like, you know, like combinations of things that are not going to statistically fire very

434
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,091
often because they require complex sets of variables.

435
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:51,755
What was sort of your guys' plan for testing and implementing those in a way that felt organic, I guess?

436
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:59,258
That like, you could implement it in a way that like, okay, when players really work themselves into this corner, it will fire, but then when it...

437
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:06,401
And it will actually fire instead of just suddenly putting a fox in the middle of the room or something or some other weird bug.

438
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,023
That's a question I think I would like to know more about.

439
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,844
Yeah, so I guess there's a lot of little tiny...

440
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:14,138
Things that we can talk about we did.

441
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:20,247
Like one thing, for example, is that the events are not static and that the events themselves

442
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:23,452
have a ton of like little variations inside of them based on the state.

443
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:26,817
So a lot of the events can accommodate vastly different...

444
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,060
Sometimes the events still work even if a bunch of the characters that are supposed to be in the mode die.

445
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,441
We did a big pass to be like hey, a character's been mentioned. Are they alive?

446
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:43,423
Writing alternate lines for like this character's dead versus this character's alive.

447
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:49,785
Another thing we did was try to intentionally make the simulation resilient to winding up in particular bad scenarios.

448
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,706
So some of it was using sort of like...

449
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:57,159
shortcuts to help control it, like for example, one of the pieces of state is that characters can become

450
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,080
upset or shattered as we call it in the game, and it's just sort of a proxy for like,

451
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,222
this character is effed up enough right now that most of their events are kind of bad, so like most

452
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:10,263
of the main events are predicated on not being upset, it's a good way to kind of like control

453
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:15,405
that at a wide level. And another interesting thing I want to mention about how we did this is

454
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,986
the simulation intentionally tries to sort of prioritize

455
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,639
important events. Like Connor mentioned, there's these background flavor ones.

456
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:27,681
There's actually a hierarchy. There's these background events, above them there's

457
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:32,884
typical events that would be for these plot clouds or these sub-arcs.

458
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:38,906
And then there's these spine ones up top. And the simulation knows that it's not supposed to start.

459
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:44,891
one of these less important events if it would conflict, like, like the characters of the

460
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,593
room with one of the spy events in the near future.

461
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:51,435
So that way, like, the mid, like, it never just, like, completely jumps off the rails.

462
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:53,477
It kind of, like, stays on track with this volume.

463
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:57,519
Before we had that, like, there were, you could get things like, oh yeah, you managed

464
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,382
to save everybody by just making it so the play never happened because you kept pushing

465
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:03,863
it back with all these little, like, small, like...

466
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,239
Oh yeah, and they needed to go for a walk.

467
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,282
We had one way back when where the entire invasion of Denmark would be delayed

468
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:17,425
because Gertrude and Horatio were talking about their lives in the grounds.

469
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:21,106
And then the invasion is like, well I'm supposed to be in the grounds, so therefore I can't happen.

470
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,467
Yep!

471
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:23,207
And like...

472
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,568
Yeah, the invasion doesn't know anything about it.

473
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:27,409
It's just like, it's a pack of events that involve characters and rooms.

474
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,751
I gotta wait for this room to be free before I can have it happen.

475
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:31,771
That's some Monty Python level comedy.

476
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:33,152
Oh no!

477
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:40,648
But when this, at this point, the game's like pretty like I've watched a lot of people play through it and it's hold it holds up pretty well.

478
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:45,590
But there are sometimes extreme edge cases where I'm like, well, that's a hot fix.

479
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:56,194
Right. And they're always at this point very entertaining because they're really out there, which is why I only see them like I've seen them, I think, in one stream out of like 50 that I've watched.

480
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:57,134
Yeah.

481
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:01,676
Avis would like to know, what are the funniest bugs you've all seen on that subject?

482
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:02,636
Let's see.

483
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:07,016
I mean, like, the ones that show up now that are fun, like, the main kinds of bugs that are...

484
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:12,899
you can still see in the live playthrough that we're patching now is where we didn't consider...

485
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,983
all the things in the... in all the possible states a scene could run in, and so you'll see some totally just nonsense things players say, referring to dead people,

486
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:25,165
I think somebody was planning their own funeral after their funeral happened.

487
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:30,768
Yeah, uh, this is... I didn't want to talk about this one because it's still in, but we're fixing it. I have the fix.

488
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,580
But whatever.

489
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,443
Uh, Gildan's turn, if, it's certain, under certain things, she'll plan her funeral.

490
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:37,964
And she'll be like, it's a great plan!

491
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:42,587
And then if she finishes that, you talk to her about one of the other things that triggers

492
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,008
that, and she'll plan her funeral again.

493
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,531
And like, you can get her to plan her funeral like three times in one loop.

494
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:48,631
And like...

495
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:49,432
Oh, and finish the loop!

496
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:50,273
So like, yeah, yeah.

497
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:51,513
But yeah.

498
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:56,377
Yeah, the way that this loop just ended, the like, one of the things we did with the structure

499
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:58,418
of this game is, Ophelia does not kill herself.

500
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:58,538
Yeah.

501
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,179
She doesn't kill herself.

502
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,593
that just doesn't...

503
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:08,116
One is it's kind of actually ambiguous in the text, whether or not that happens.

504
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:13,179
So this is like a compatible with Shakespeare's Hamlet interpretation of what's going on.

505
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:19,003
But two is it's just like really weird to have the player character forced to commit suicide for a lot of reasons.

506
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:24,467
And so what happens instead is she's murdered by a mysterious figure,

507
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,148
and kind of like the first...

508
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:32,368
like ARK challenge for players to overcome that's presented to them now is to like

509
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,793
not get murdered at this point, figure out what's going on and stop it so you can stay

510
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:40,094
alive long enough to watch everybody else kill each other instead.

511
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:48,241
Yeah, we're leaning on hundreds of years of academic conspiracy theories, which one of

512
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:51,823
the things that was great about working on this game to return to the why Shakespeare question is like

513
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:58,014
There's a like we didn't, you know, we were very much forging our own path and making our own decisions, but there's definitely like

514
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:09,984
a lot of decisions we can make we can point to like, oh, yeah, well, there was this paper if we wanted to and it's like, and they believe that Ophelia was murdered by Gertrude, which is not

515
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:14,115
But anyway, moving on.

516
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:17,517
That's kind of the interesting thing about the staging of the

517
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:20,359
text is um, yeah, now we're getting weird into like, what

518
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,780
does it mean to stage Shakespeare because you guys are

519
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,903
technically staging Shakespeare, even though you're not out in

520
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,184
Griffith Park with the light with coyotes howling in the

521
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:31,866
background and yeah, a bunch of actors pantomiming you're um,

522
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,088
but even in those interpretations, like there's a

523
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,869
lot of leeway, like I watched a production of, um,

524
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:45,975
Uh, one of the comedies last summer that ends in everyone getting married, but in the Shakespeare play, there's definitely one character who's still screwed over, um, in the middle of it, and they ended it with a...

525
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:53,598
not original dialogue, but they used a dance number, sort of, to turn the moment around and to let her get her recompense.

526
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,059
But it's a... you guys get sort of, like, permission to do that too in these ways.

527
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:58,120
Yeah.

528
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,181
To remix what's already on the page.

529
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:13,753
Yeah, the way we viewed it is if there wasn't anything, and even some things that were explicitly on the page, but like anything that details that weren't filled in, we felt we were willing to fill them in like in ways that would make the most interesting story.

530
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:21,275
Yeah, that involves like, you know, giving characters a lot of different backgrounds that come up and come into play in the story.

531
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:29,218
Had developing relationships between characters that never spoke in the play like we're about to see like Horatio will

532
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:33,986
ratio and Gertrude talked to each other a lot.

533
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:35,387
Things like that.

534
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:41,611
This uh, the Quince the Playmaster, is a strange time looping gremlin himself.

535
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,952
I don't really mean time looping, he just knows the loop is happening.

536
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:47,034
Yeah.

537
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:48,555
Let's see.

538
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:53,678
We needed a character for you to talk to about what was going on, because otherwise you're

539
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:57,760
kind of like, you've got no one to confide in.

540
00:31:58,361 --> 00:31:58,521
Yeah.

541
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:01,558
Um, uh, right on.

542
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:05,261
Uh, we are halfway through our hour and we are still taking your questions about the

543
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:06,122
making of Elsinore.

544
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:11,046
Um, thankfully also, um, thanks to my past self, uh, things in Hamlet are about to go

545
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:15,329
really off the rails during this next half hour, so I urge you to pay attention.

546
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:22,995
Um, uh, uh, moving, uh, my next question, um, Katie Chavranis has also tweeted about,

547
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:27,079
um, how, uh, your guys' Kickstarter backers are really cool and great.

548
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:27,619
Um.

549
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:34,646
Y'all went to Kickstarter, you managed to raise some funds to help you develop this game.

550
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,449
What was working with Kickstarter like for you two?

551
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:45,378
And because it's sort of a thing, I've talked to a lot of devs who talked about how it's changed their development process a lot.

552
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:48,941
I talked to one guy from Uber Entertainment a while back, and he was like,

553
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:51,244
instead of having one publisher, we now have...

554
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:53,404
5,000 publishers.

555
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,346
We don't in fact have another bigger publisher, which is nice.

556
00:32:57,646 --> 00:33:01,747
I will say, so what I like, just to give context for the Kickstarter,

557
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:05,169
I want to say that we are in the extremely fortunate privileged position

558
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:09,591
that all of the primary people on the dev team have different day jobs,

559
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:16,533
so none of us needed, like, funding to eat during the development of this game.

560
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,914
We would have needed a lot more if that wasn't the case.

561
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,755
Yes, so our Kickstarter was...

562
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:27,407
to try to help us raise money to pay for the things we had to pay for to develop it so

563
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:28,988
we could actually make it possible.

564
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:39,353
But we didn't have, like I said, there wasn't the stress of if this Kickstarter fails, I'm

565
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,514
in a lot of trouble and have to get a new job.

566
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:45,837
It's like, if this Kickstarter fails, we have to dramatically scale back or change

567
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,419
or maybe abandon the project, but that's a different level of thing.

568
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:50,739
So...

569
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:56,520
So I think that heavily influenced how I felt about it.

570
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,041
I mean, gosh, it was so long.

571
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,021
Was it 2014?

572
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:03,383
There was never any danger of us needing to tell the backers that we ran out of money,

573
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:07,785
which reduces a lot of pressure that I think a lot of Kickstarters run into.

574
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,387
Because we're like, we have our own streams of income,

575
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,968
and we spend all the money.

576
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:22,114
We're on voice acting and composers and all those things, but we could sustain ourselves for as long as we needed to finish the project.

577
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,977
But we did have to tell them what did happen. It kept slipping, obviously.

578
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:26,577
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:29,079
We were optimistically hoping to get this out three years ago.

580
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,880
It was always early next year.

581
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:39,685
Yeah. But because we were in the position of not needing to ship this game at a particular time,

582
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:44,348
we always took the approach of making it...

583
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:51,608
good enough to release, like making the thing we felt that would make players feel the best

584
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:55,290
about playing it and not just getting something out at a particular date.

585
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,792
We tried to be really communicative with the backer community about what's going on at

586
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:00,633
the whole point and show them.

587
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:06,656
We gave them a sort of like, sorry we're late beta build in 2016 or 2017, I think.

588
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:09,598
Yeah, we continue to update.

589
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:12,079
To see the current progress, and yeah.

590
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,287
The, uh, which we, and then would get great.

591
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:20,169
We actually had a feedback form in the game that people could submit notes.

592
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:23,631
And that would also help illuminate, like, what are some of the things that jump out

593
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:27,794
the most in our simulation of like, not quite working or what are the things that

594
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:29,075
are already working pretty well?

595
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:33,437
It's kind of like having an early access game, honestly, except like early, just

596
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:36,279
like with our backers, like a big early access period with our backers and they

597
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:39,401
were all like super great for like.

598
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,253
trying it out, even though it was full of a ton of bugs.

599
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,793
I remember, like, I think one of the versions we shipped,

600
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,893
just, like, didn't even start up if you didn't have a save file,

601
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:46,973
just like, it's gonna crash.

602
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:49,894
So they've been, like, really forgiving, putting up with us,

603
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:52,014
and giving us a lot of, like, really great feedback.

604
00:35:52,174 --> 00:35:55,055
That bug was specifically engineered so none of us could catch it.

605
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:56,695
It was not only if you didn't have a save file,

606
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:58,956
it's if you never had a save file ever.

607
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:02,557
Like, so we could delete our save file and not run into it.

608
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:04,997
So, in other words, a new, a brand new player.

609
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:06,137
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,918
Like, so, uh, yeah, um...

611
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:16,029
It's been wonderful. I think, yeah, we just tried to update them any time something happened, right?

612
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,572
And again, it was like, we'd tell them, like, hey, they all knew it was a nights and weekends project, right?

613
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,814
So, like, if we give them an update, it's like, hey, like...

614
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:29,618
Eric and Kristen are getting married. We're probably not going to get any work done until, like, they get over it.

615
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:31,340
Sure, I didn't get any work done.

616
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,221
No, the wedding's a game jam now, right?

617
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,803
But, yeah, like, um...

618
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:39,467
And they were always very understanding of that scenario, right?

619
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,249
Our kind of unique situation.

620
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,973
Because we were constantly transparent about it as well.

621
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,195
Yeah.

622
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:49,418
Akimba B would like to give a shout out to you two real quick and chat.

623
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:50,820
I don't know.

624
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,280
I don't know.

625
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,722
For once, I don't know who that is.

626
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:53,623
I know who that is.

627
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:55,024
That's Kwame.

628
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,446
He also worked at me at Shell.

629
00:36:56,686 --> 00:36:57,047
I think.

630
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:58,108
I could be wrong.

631
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,881
Right on. Moving on from that question, so we talked before about how this is a part-time

632
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:11,903
developed game, six years of part-time development. I think a lot of, like, I've done a lot of,

633
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:17,625
like, in my own time work, I sort of got started in doing this kind of games, interviewing devs

634
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:24,408
work as a part-time work for sure, but I'm really impressed by the commitment to one day a week of

635
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:29,169
dev work for your team. Obviously with, you know, exceptions for weddings and events and that kind

636
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:29,450
of thing.

637
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,152
Um, and for such an interesting result to kind of pop out of it.

638
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:34,832
Like, there's parts of...

639
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:38,354
This is me, like, giving feedback before answering a question, I guess.

640
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:40,235
Like, giving my feedback as a player. Sorry.

641
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:42,636
Um, uh...

642
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,477
It's interesting, like, playing it, I can, like, sort of...

643
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:46,437
Just because I'm, like, weirdly tuned to these things,

644
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:47,878
like, I can sort of, like, feel like,

645
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:50,619
Oh, like, I can sort of feel out here, like,

646
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,780
this is kind of a thing that,

647
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,521
if this was a full-time project for a team...

648
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:53,821
Yeah.

649
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:57,503
...trying to make, like, this thing here would be something that was...

650
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,684
or this thing here, would be like something that would...

651
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:05,124
like, you know, like, sort of, but at the same time...

652
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,305
what I'm playing from a part-time view, I'm like,

653
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:12,185
this is cohesive and thought out,

654
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:16,766
and the art polish alone makes it feel like it could have come out

655
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:21,007
any year in the years that you all were working on it. Like, any year it came out, it would have

656
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:21,567
looked fresh.

657
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:26,848
And any way the writing is sharp, so any year the writing came out, the writing would have

658
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:27,348
felt fresh.

659
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:41,396
But at the same time, you are sort of in a weird bubble where you're moving this project very slowly forward across six years while watching some of your peers, whether you're working with them professionally or just friends with them, shipping work.

660
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:47,980
You know, sometimes six years is either one game or two or three games, depending on who you ask, or six games.

661
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,202
Or if you're Rami in GameDev.World, it's 100 million games.

662
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:55,904
Not GameDev.World. Excuse me, I meant Meditations. Meditations is what I meant with Rami Ismail.

663
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:57,365
Shout out to Rami.

664
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:04,770
Yeah, so I guess where I'm at is, what was it like sort of sitting in that slow moving bubble, I guess,

665
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,033
like moving this forward and trying to reach an end point that you were comfortable with?

666
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:16,658
I mean, I think one of the things that's notable is like we'd frequently underestimate how much progress we made

667
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:22,682
and then go play an old build and be like, oh wow, it's way better now than it was like three months ago.

668
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:27,089
And also, because we all have day jobs, we were kind of shipping things,

669
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:32,071
which probably helped us not feel like, oh no, we're trapped working on this one thing, right?

670
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,952
We also had other things going on.

671
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:34,372
Yeah.

672
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:38,674
So it was amazing to see the rest of the industry,

673
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:40,835
like it felt like the rest of the media was moving a little faster.

674
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:43,396
There was some point where suddenly a bunch of time looping games came out.

675
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:47,098
Yeah, it was this E3, like two time looping games were announced.

676
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,320
And Outer Wilds came out and it's like, well, time loops are in now.

677
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:55,851
So, Pontac, the lead artist of Elsinore, or as you mentioned the art, he did a fantastic job.

678
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:59,312
The lead artist of Elsinore also was the lead artist for Outer Wilds.

679
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,634
So he shipped two time-looping games in a month.

680
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:08,557
Yes, and he got hired on Outer Wilds, I think, partially based on his work on Elsinore, which is...

681
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:10,919
That's how the timeline worked out.

682
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,434
Shout out to us. Yeah, I'm like, I was really happy.

683
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,976
You brought it up. I'm really happy we chose the art style we did.

684
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:17,357
Yeah.

685
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:19,879
It's less contextual paint. It's literally just hand painted,

686
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,520
which is why we used an isometric camera.

687
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,041
Yeah.

688
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:25,684
So that way it wouldn't be tied to, like, texture.

689
00:40:25,704 --> 00:40:27,145
I mean, this is like the only thing that made sense.

690
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:32,349
Like, how can we make a game that looks great with this level of polish

691
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:33,610
with a single artist?

692
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,772
And the answer is you have to do 2D paint.

693
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:36,473
Yeah, two artists.

694
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,255
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:40,256
It's, uh...

696
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:45,347
It's a whole 100% increase from what Eric was saying.

697
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:50,169
But it's a 2D painting that's projected on a 3D model,

698
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:51,129
which is kind of neat.

699
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,950
So that's how we do the real-time shadows and stuff.

700
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,050
Yeah, so like Valvo in a 3D world,

701
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,071
and then Wes painted on top of it,

702
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,111
and then we just put it all back.

703
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:00,011
Yeah.

704
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:05,180
The shadows, the shadows are really one of the, like the shadow in the Great Hall especially.

705
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,341
I don't know why, it's one of the little details that just made me go,

706
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:08,782
oh wow, that looks, this game looks great.

707
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:12,685
Yeah, and I was really happy. Yeah, I was very happy with that, that it works.

708
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:13,346
Yeah.

709
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:13,626
Yes.

710
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:17,288
Because it was like, it was a contest of like, Valorant was coming up with like,

711
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,592
what are the things that would be the like,

712
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:26,675
like manageable for its really small team to do, but like give this huge impact.

713
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:29,798
It was like finding the like handful of things to make that work.

714
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:31,083
on this full budget.

715
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:33,223
I guess that's a nice thing about working on a...

716
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:35,464
working every Sunday,

717
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:40,386
is it's like we don't have a lot of time to, like, actually build stuff

718
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:43,847
compared to full-time dev, but we have just as much time to think about it.

719
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:46,188
And so, a lot of it...

720
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:49,750
a lot of the development process was, like, a lot different than other stuff I've done,

721
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,451
in that you would think of an idea and be like,

722
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,251
well, that's great, maybe I'll get to that next weekend,

723
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:55,692
and by the time next weekend rolled around,

724
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:58,353
your idea had, like, matured enough that you realized it was...

725
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,118
You should be doing something slightly different, or it was too dumb, and you should throw it out.

726
00:42:02,238 --> 00:42:05,220
And this, like, saved us a whole bunch of time that we would have otherwise spent

727
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,241
uselessly building things and then discard them.

728
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:11,104
It's easy to point out, like, to notice, like, things that would have been, like,

729
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:14,886
uh, yeah, we might have sunk more time into polish if we were working on it full-time.

730
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:17,468
It would be a very different game if we were full-time, because, like,

731
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:21,030
there's a lot of risky things we did that would not have been, you know,

732
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:24,092
if our lives were depending on them, uh, for, uh,

733
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:26,074
might, you know, we might have avoided.

734
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:28,515
Um, but there's, as Eric was saying, like...

735
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:41,126
The design really had, there's a lot of systems that we were like, we don't need, or we iterated on, or that we got because we had the time to really reflect on and like, and just think about what we were doing.

736
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:53,588
Katie, I think had this great quote way back when where she said like, one of the things she's most proud of is because of that time, like every time we could have done the like, we had to choose between the easy thing and the interesting thing, we picked the interesting thing.

737
00:42:55,206 --> 00:43:01,109
And I think that's very much a product of our work schedule.

738
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:05,091
Yeah. What's interesting to me about that is, developers talk...

739
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:10,673
One of the shortest answers I hear a lot when talking to game developers about developing games is,

740
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,595
iteration, iteration, iteration, make things, break things, throw them out.

741
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:17,757
And this is not anti-reflective of that entirely.

742
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:19,598
You made things, you broke things, you threw them out.

743
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:21,899
It's in slow motion.

744
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:22,899
Yeah, and...

745
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,139
In slow mo...

746
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:27,800
Yeah, you did it in slow motion, but also like, there's also the phrase,

747
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,300
ideas are cheap, etc. etc.

748
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,501
Like, you have to put something on the page, but weirdly,

749
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,622
this is a more mature perspective on that idea,

750
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:41,383
which is ideas are cheap unless you invest time in them, I guess.

751
00:43:41,603 --> 00:43:44,764
Which is what you did, you invested time and ideas the same way

752
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:47,144
other developers invested time and ideas, you just did it differently.

753
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:49,305
And like you said, slower, in slow motion.

754
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:49,445
Yeah.

755
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:58,673
Yeah, I mean, I was just like, I found that like this process, the importance of thinking

756
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:03,295
about what you're doing, what you should be doing next is like really critical.

757
00:44:03,315 --> 00:44:07,197
That's the way that like it was when I was doing research where you're kind of like bumbling

758
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:07,977
about in the dark.

759
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:10,498
And it's like, you can just work as much as you want.

760
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:14,296
The important thing is to be constantly reflecting on,

761
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:17,518
is the work I'm doing right now the most important thing for me to be doing?

762
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:22,300
Is this the thing that's going to push this closer to where I think I want it to be in the future?

763
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,601
What's the question I need to answer now?

764
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:28,524
And that's the kind of approach we ended up taking because of the work schedule.

765
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:29,984
Yeah.

766
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:35,867
It's worth noting that I think a big part of why we were able to do the once a week thing...

767
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:37,448
There's two key things.

768
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:41,450
One is that's actually very much the structure that we had in Game Creation Society.

769
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,454
where we were like making games.

770
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:46,116
In that we were making them over the course of the semester.

771
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,937
But in order to get things done, when you have schoolwork,

772
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,399
you kind of had to have designated work sessions, right?

773
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:52,880
And the other one is like,

774
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,741
we, instead of just meeting and checking in,

775
00:44:55,841 --> 00:44:57,022
we actually had like,

776
00:44:57,482 --> 00:45:00,884
we're all sitting down and working over Skype together

777
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:02,385
so that we can talk to each other.

778
00:45:02,405 --> 00:45:04,606
And we all know that we're making progress.

779
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:08,108
And that was, that again,

780
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,350
was like part of why we were able to sustain this

781
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,770
for six years instead of being like.

782
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:19,927
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, even in that regard, we were very lucky, privileged in that, like, a lot of us were close friends in college.

783
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:23,229
Like, my wedding party was basically the Elsinore Dev Team, more or less.

784
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:31,673
And so, hanging out once a week was, like, a good excuse to keep up with friends I'd ever seen, you know, in all the different parts of the country.

785
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,234
And I think that was, kind of, like, really important.

786
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:40,998
Like, I don't know if this would have worked if I had just formed a group with some strangers as well, or would have to build, had to have been.

787
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:46,335
approach differently or spent much more energy trying to keep the pace up.

788
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:50,697
Because it was very important that almost every Sunday we made some amount of progress,

789
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:51,857
just like a little bit of progress.

790
00:45:52,538 --> 00:45:59,321
Yeah, Mike in chat from Shell Games also says they don't know how you hugged yourself to

791
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:00,461
only one day a week.

792
00:46:01,082 --> 00:46:04,863
Seriously that's discipline and it shows the game does not feel looker rushed at all.

793
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,133
Yeah, I mean, there were some times when we do two days a week.

794
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:11,697
Ooh, there were some times when I'm a grad student, I'm just, I'm really

795
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,158
excited about winning the scripting language.

796
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:14,860
I'm just going to do that every day of this week.

797
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,322
One day a week was the baseline.

798
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:19,304
People would sneak in time here and there.

799
00:46:19,465 --> 00:46:22,107
Like I would, I would, I bus to my day job.

800
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:24,369
I would sometimes work on it on the bus.

801
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:24,570
Right.

802
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:27,733
And that's like half an hour of like extra like scripting time.

803
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:29,615
Um, but yeah.

804
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:36,518
Right on. Moving on to the question pile. We have about 10 minutes left in the chat if folks want to get them in.

805
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:46,391
Um, uh, looking at what's happening, trying to remember if I had any interesting thoughts about the game as this was happening.

806
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:53,514
Um, uh, I guess one of, to walk back over to design and programming world a minute.

807
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:54,895
Oh yeah, this is gonna be real fun.

808
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,356
This scene.

809
00:46:57,016 --> 00:46:58,337
Um, good timing.

810
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:03,359
Um, Elsinore really succeeds as a game when the player feels...

811
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:08,192
They're really pushing the boundaries of what's going on in Hamlet.

812
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:09,533
If they're familiar with Hamlet.

813
00:47:09,554 --> 00:47:11,175
I don't know what it's like if you've never read Hamlet.

814
00:47:11,535 --> 00:47:13,117
I'm just going to be honest, don't know.

815
00:47:13,657 --> 00:47:15,039
Read Hamlet too early to test that.

816
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,162
You're going to have to interview someone else.

817
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:19,043
Or get someone else to interview you.

818
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:27,286
As designers, what was kind of your instinct for getting players to feel safe in pushing off the path,

819
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:29,486
and like they wouldn't wind up in a fail state just by doing this?

820
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:32,607
I guess it helps to like, knowing when you're gonna die, is one thing.

821
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:36,309
But like, what was kind of your impetus for getting players to like, really try messing with things?

822
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:38,549
I- I- I would reframe that slightly.

823
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,750
I don't think it was ever our goal to make players feel safe pushing off the path,

824
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,592
because pushing off the path results in like, horrible deaths.

825
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:47,512
But you feel...

826
00:47:48,446 --> 00:47:53,870
Encourage to do so because you're learning new things every time you do so yeah about these characters in the world

827
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:59,874
And so it encourages you to be to push past those boundaries into those that dangerous territory

828
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:02,656
If that makes sense yeah

829
00:48:03,777 --> 00:48:05,918
Which I guess is a way of feeling safe

830
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:13,223
Anyway, but yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's like not the safe was not really the feeling we were going for right

831
00:48:13,942 --> 00:48:17,403
Yeah, I guess that's a different way to put it. I think you're right. It's not about safe. It's about

832
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:23,245
To me it was about scratching an itch. It was like yeah, I need something. Yeah curiosity

833
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:30,027
Yeah, right like like what will happen beyond this this threshold if I if I go for it because I can just always try again

834
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,968
and that is where a little bit of safety comes from but

835
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:38,210
But what the things you're trying are often dangerous things

836
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,671
We're also like trying to sort of like

837
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,892
So I'll say I'm not

838
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:49,298
I'm not a literary theory expert, but like, uh, one of the things I think I was trying

839
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:54,800
to hit with this game is like part of what makes tragedy compelling and then like ratchet

840
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,540
it up a notch.

841
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,662
So I like what really basic way to describe it or like when I'm watching like a Greek

842
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:04,644
tragic play or whatever is I'm sitting in the audience screaming at the main character.

843
00:49:04,664 --> 00:49:07,585
Yeah, I can see exactly how their tragic flaw is going to get them killed.

844
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,066
I'd be like, if only you knew this.

845
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:12,917
Information, Oedipus, or whatever, like you could do something different.

846
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:13,478
It could be better.

847
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,720
And then so we made a game where you can go tell them that information.

848
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:15,820
Yeah.

849
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,582
And then they'll do something else stupid with it and you'll

850
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:19,443
disagree with them some more.

851
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:20,483
And then you just do this in a loop.

852
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:21,124
Yeah.

853
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:21,504
Yeah.

854
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:22,265
Over and over again.

855
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:25,767
Uh, I remember way back when, when I was in college, before I even started at

856
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:29,030
Shell Games, Jesse, I was in Jesse's game design class, Jesse Shell.

857
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:33,974
And he was talking about how tragedy is, you know, it was, uh, tragedy is

858
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,775
extremely difficult to do in games.

859
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:36,076
Right.

860
00:49:36,136 --> 00:49:36,416
Because.

861
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,701
uh... there is something bad happens you just try again

862
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:42,383
and like this game is kind of

863
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:45,125
in many ways it's a direct like

864
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:47,646
challenge to that? yeah like it's like

865
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:48,847
challenge accepted

866
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:50,768
yeah uh... because it's like

867
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:51,969
you try again

868
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:56,451
and that's kind of part of the tragedy instead of in a way to escape the

869
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:56,952
tragedy

870
00:49:56,972 --> 00:49:57,772
yeah

871
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:01,130
Uh, that's really funny, just like,

872
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,171
Oh, trying to do this really hard because the player's just gonna try again.

873
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:07,012
Oh, screw you, we're just gonna let the player try again.

874
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:11,094
I would not, no, no screw you, just that's an interesting challenge.

875
00:50:11,234 --> 00:50:13,075
Jesse Shell was watching this and just like,

876
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,896
writing and writing furiously in his notepad.

877
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:17,437
But I mean, I was at Shell Games when we did the Kickstarter,

878
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:19,638
and like, so we talked about this again at that, right?

879
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:22,859
Like, that was one of the, he's actually a gravestone in the graveyard.

880
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,281
Um, we're somewhere in here.

881
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:28,863
You're getting mad at me for saying screw you and you literally put this grave into the game.

882
00:50:28,923 --> 00:50:31,965
No, no, no. He put himself as the grave.

883
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:33,006
He paid.

884
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:34,727
Yeah, he's a backer.

885
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:35,908
He backed it.

886
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:36,829
That's what all the ones are.

887
00:50:37,169 --> 00:50:40,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of the graves are like people who backed.

888
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,072
Right on.

889
00:50:43,553 --> 00:50:44,474
We are wrapping up here.

890
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:48,570
Any last minute questions folks have for Connor and Eric, get them in now.

891
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,752
Because when we're done, at some point I'm going to go back and just play more of this game at some point.

892
00:50:54,993 --> 00:50:57,334
Let me think, do I have any more questions?

893
00:50:57,614 --> 00:51:00,896
Oh man, you said something in there about tragedy that really got me.

894
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:08,559
Like tragedy is yelling at the screen and thinking people would do what you expect them to do if only they knew what you knew.

895
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,401
That's the engine that kept us going on this project, right?

896
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,082
It's a really compelling problem.

897
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:20,706
I guess not to spoil the ending of the game, but there is kind of an ending.

898
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:21,546
There is something.

899
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:25,168
There isn't like, this game isn't sort of Dwarf Fortress, like you just keep reloading

900
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,030
the sim just to generate new interesting results.

901
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:27,830
No.

902
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,253
Thematically, where, towards the end of the game, where were you heading as far as like,

903
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,734
what happens when the player has all the information, I guess?

904
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:40,538
Like is it that Ophelia kind of gets to have a new...

905
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:41,879
Yeah.

906
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:42,899
Yeah.

907
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,741
I will say that we do not lose our theme when we get to the end.

908
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:46,342
Got it.

909
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:49,756
That's all I'm really willing to say.

910
00:51:52,038 --> 00:51:58,365
Frankly, if a player were to just play the game forever and then eventually just resign

911
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:03,851
themselves to like, ah, this is sad, and then put it down, that's a pretty good thematic

912
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:04,392
ending too.

913
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,072
Yeah.

914
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:18,792
Anyway, with no more questions in chat, I'm going to start winding this down, this stream.

915
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:23,917
With perfect information, I will prevent the tragedy of keeping you guys from your day

916
00:52:23,957 --> 00:52:24,337
jobs.

917
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,802
You've been watching the GDC Twitch channel, thank you for joining us once again, thank

918
00:52:29,822 --> 00:52:35,307
you for putting up with my slightly tired, coffee only just started kicking in shenanigans.

919
00:52:36,328 --> 00:52:42,134
We love having game developers on this channel. We love getting folks questions to game developers.

920
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:50,042
If you click the follow button on the lower left hand corner of the screen, you will get a notification when we go live, when we're talking to game developers.

921
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:55,067
We're talking to the folks, we're trying to talk to the folks behind Age of Wonders Planetfall later this month.

922
00:52:55,428 --> 00:52:57,630
I'm reaching out to a bunch of other cool folks about other cool games.

923
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:01,413
We're trying to pin those schedules down.

924
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:07,178
On top of that, if you click the follow button, you will also notice that the GDC Twitch channel

925
00:53:07,198 --> 00:53:11,622
does keep live during the day with a lot of great talks from GDC of years past.

926
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:14,705
We've started taking talks from the GDC vault and putting them on Twitch.

927
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:21,671
There's also the YouTube channel where if you go there and if you click on the YouTube

928
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:24,053
channel you can obviously get all the great talks we've uploaded over there.

929
00:53:26,194 --> 00:53:33,598
I need to update the banner that you're looking at because as you can see our logo, the logo on the top left is shiny and new, but this is 2019 GDC.

930
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:43,924
GDC 2020 is coming up. If you are a game designer, game developer watching this channel, you might want to know that the call for papers for next year is open and we do want to see your GDC talks.

931
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:53,730
Right now it is for Wednesday, Friday, which we're calling Core Concepts. So if you have a talk about the core concepts of game development, we would love to see it.

932
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,930
You can go to GDC.

933
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:55,391
the concept.

934
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:56,131
I can't write it.

935
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:15,448
I'm pretty sure it's later this month, if not, it's definitely next month.

936
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:21,449
That'll be opening up soon. That'll include the Narrative Summit, the Animation Summit,

937
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,829
all kind of that group of things.

938
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:28,590
Other than that, Eric and Connor, thank you so much for joining us.

939
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,750
Thanks for having us. Yeah, it was wonderful.

940
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,631
Congrats on shipping Elsinore. Thank you, Marcus Loralius and chat.

941
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,031
We loved having you.

942
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:40,152
And with that, I wish everyone a happy Wednesday.

943
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:41,672
It's only Wednesday, man.

944
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:45,516
But happy end of July. Happy birthday, Harry Potter. It's Harry Potter's birthday.

945
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:48,002
Bye, everyone.

946
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:48,083
Bye.
