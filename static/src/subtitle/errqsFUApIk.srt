1
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:26,807
Buried deep under these bone-dry high plains, in a covert section of a massively hardened

2
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:30,828
centrifuge facility, a team is hard at work.

3
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:37,450
They are members of a breakaway faction of the country's security forces, and they are

4
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,510
busy enriching 40 kilograms of uranium.

5
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,271
By July 3rd, they achieved their target of 90% enrichment.

6
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:51,067
and then transfer the uranium to a nearby secret lab,

7
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:56,471
where another team of technicians assembles it into a crude nuclear block.

8
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:01,050
On August 31, they finished their work.

9
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,131
They put the bomb in a packing crate labeled agricultural equipment

10
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:11,092
and transported to a nearby airfield where it is stored in a warehouse.

11
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:15,613
Two weeks later, it is removed and loaded onto an aircraft

12
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:18,094
with civilian air cargo runners.

13
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:23,115
It flies to Dubai, where the crate is transferred.

14
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:28,493
along with other goods and equipment, to a global air transport freighter.

15
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:33,296
Destination? Washington, D.C.

16
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:40,880
The plane lands at Washington's Dulles International Airport at 2 47 a.m.

17
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,042
on September the 15th. By late afternoon,

18
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:49,705
the crate is delivered to a warehouse in the southeast part of the district.

19
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:54,055
Then, before daybreak on September the 17th,

20
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,977
the bomb is removed from the crate

21
00:01:57,758 --> 00:01:59,279
and loaded onto a delivery truck.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,163
Several hours later, an American citizen

23
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,284
eases the truck out into traffic.

24
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,127
She drives it to a location on Pennsylvania Avenue,

25
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:15,491
midway between the White House and the Capitol Building.

26
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,653
At 1109 AM, she stops in the middle of traffic.

27
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:23,796
climbs down onto the street and triggers the detonator.

28
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:28,600
The bomb explodes with a power of 15 kilotons.

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,222
There are more than 80,000 instant deaths,

30
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:34,764
including the President, the Vice President,

31
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:38,386
the Speaker of the House, and the 320 members of Congress

32
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,168
present when the bomb goes off.

33
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:41,929
There are also...

34
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,313
Okay, maybe that wasn't quite what you expected.

35
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,353
I would like to tell you all a story.

36
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:59,198
This story, I think, kind of encapsulates my experience

37
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:02,240
over the past four years as a person who

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,902
spent about 25 years making commercial games

39
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,224
and then entered what we might call the games for change

40
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:09,265
or serious game world.

41
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:12,628
And what would happen is pretty often

42
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,309
I'd be called into some meeting somewhere with people

43
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,172
I've never heard of and introduced as, you know,

44
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:18,952
that game guy.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,016
And one day, a little over a year ago, I got called into just such a meeting and it was with

46
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:34,002
these folks. Some of whom I had heard of and a couple of them I hadn't. I thought, okay,

47
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:40,728
that's fine. They seemed friendly. A couple of them had interesting accents. And so let's

48
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:46,573
talk. And they introduced themselves and they were all experts in nuclear security issues.

49
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,603
And they said, can you make us a game?

50
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:56,206
And I said, actually, this problem's already solved.

51
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:56,726
There is a game.

52
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,387
It's called Defcon, right?

53
00:03:58,547 --> 00:03:59,227
Haven't you seen it?

54
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,248
This game is excellent.

55
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:02,570
And they're like, no, no, no.

56
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,290
We know that game.

57
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:03,990
Actually, yeah, you're right.

58
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:04,651
It's a really good game.

59
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,253
And it's totally, actually, not what we're looking for.

60
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,315
And in fact, Defcon's kind of an example of the problem, not

61
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:11,956
the solution.

62
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:15,838
And I thought, well, that's odd.

63
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,099
I was a child of the Cold War.

64
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,380
And I remembered what this was like.

65
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,886
missile command, right?

66
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:25,428
They said, no, no, no, it's different now.

67
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:31,972
That was scary and we honor your fear, but actually it's worse now.

68
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:36,335
Since especially the collapse of the Soviet Union,

69
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,417
there is a tremendous amount of fissionable material

70
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:43,299
kind of out there, and a lot of it we don't actually know where it is.

71
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,573
And there's a lot of people that would like to have it and might

72
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:51,176
do all kinds of really bad things with it. Did you know

73
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:56,920
that? I said I did not know that. You know, okay, let's try.

74
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,804
And so we did a little workshop and I always started these

75
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,186
workshops with some kind of a, okay, this is game design thing

76
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:08,169
in about 30 minutes so let's make it 30 seconds because game

77
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,552
design is easy, right? And it goes something like games are

78
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,773
loops, the loops have.

79
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,872
a state, and then you take an action,

80
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,032
that action has an effect.

81
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,193
I know there's a certain group of students here

82
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,273
who have seen all this before.

83
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:25,254
The systems that we implemented have affordances,

84
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,275
actions, and feedbacks, and then we have verbs

85
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,215
that affect the system.

86
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,435
Right, cool, we're done, let's go make a game.

87
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:34,156
And, except, okay, it's a little harder than that,

88
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,416
but we'll get back to that in a second.

89
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,557
We broke into a couple of groups, these experts and I,

90
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,778
and they decided to put together some game ideas.

91
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:49,995
you know, helping them through their ideas, getting the verbs, getting the loops, getting

92
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:56,018
the state. And the winning pitch, we actually had them pitch to our group at Glass Lab,

93
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:59,580
which is where I was working at the time. Winning a pitch was something called Trinity.

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,824
Okay, obviously named after the original Manhattan Project. And their pitch was, the only way

95
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:11,487
to prove a point is to prove the point. It goes a little something like this, you're

96
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,268
someone with a lot of money. Let's say you're a...

97
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:19,542
really pissed off Silicon Valley entrepreneur and you're really

98
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:23,244
upset that no one is taking the nuclear threat seriously. I know

99
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:27,127
how to solve this. I will put together a bomb and I'll explode

100
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:30,409
it but not on Pennsylvania Avenue. I'll explode it just a

101
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,750
few miles off the coast of D.C. That should get everyone's

102
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,553
attention. And it turns out you can do this if you have enough

103
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:40,015
money. Today.

104
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,012
And they pitched that to us and they walked us through the

105
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:45,893
process of how you would do it and how you could turn that into

106
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,955
sort of a, oh, I don't know, point and click adventure? It

107
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:51,138
could be really interesting, right? And we said, actually,

108
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:56,382
holy shit. And kind of nobody talked to each other for the

109
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:01,286
rest of the day. And that concluded one of the strangest

110
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:06,771
days of my life. And that story inspired me to pitch this talk.

111
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,494
Because as a person coming from the games world...

112
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,449
from the commercial games world, I was inspired.

113
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:14,909
And I obviously was already doing this.

114
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:16,910
But I was really thinking, man, more people

115
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:17,951
should get involved with this.

116
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:20,092
More people should know that there

117
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,433
are things that we are being asked to look into.

118
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,435
So let's talk more about that.

119
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,577
This was kind of what was interesting.

120
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,818
Usually when I talk to this with, let's say,

121
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:33,219
government officials or educators,

122
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,581
they kind of go like, OK, yep, games, yep, we know that.

123
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,962
There's a story, or you click on stuff,

124
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,743
or definitely you shoot people in the face.

125
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:44,843
But they didn't really have a good sense of it.

126
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,844
But this group actually had a far better sense of it.

127
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:50,845
They understood it really quickly,

128
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:51,925
and I thought that's interesting.

129
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,645
And I had to think about that much later.

130
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,586
And really, if you think about this,

131
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,806
if we define games as verbs acting on a system,

132
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:04,067
this is what it means to be an activist.

133
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:06,027
They said, right.

134
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,748
The current state is what we don't like.

135
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,487
The system is what we know affects it.

136
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,709
The verbs are the change we're trying to create.

137
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:15,890
Got it.

138
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:18,411
So I thought, that's really cool.

139
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,775
And then it makes me think, a lot of you in this room

140
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:24,516
also get that.

141
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,678
And maybe this medium is even better suited

142
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:30,920
than we would think for this kind of action.

143
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,818
Now, when they do pitch something to me,

144
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,839
it usually came down to this, engagement, right?

145
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:37,459
Engagement.

146
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:40,000
We know that people play games for hours and hours and hours.

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,501
And we want all that eyeballs.

148
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:42,721
Yeah, OK.

149
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:43,621
It's true.

150
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,182
I don't think it's the best argument.

151
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:49,264
Another is we know that we reach a very, very large proportion

152
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:50,664
of the market, especially young people.

153
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:51,545
Also true.

154
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,606
Also, in my view, not the best reason

155
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,206
that games are well-suited to this.

156
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,408
Video games can be surprisingly subversive.

157
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,825
I don't know if anyone has played any of the work of Paolo

158
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,066
Pedrucini or Mo Industria.

159
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,349
It's incredibly subversive stuff and fantastic and really

160
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:15,312
makes you think in a way that just some sort of video or

161
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:16,453
linear media kind of can't.

162
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:18,515
And there's more.

163
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,817
Generally speaking, when we communicate with each other,

164
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:22,558
we use stories.

165
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:24,759
Stories are powerful.

166
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,022
Stories are how we remember things or how we communicate

167
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:29,663
with one another.

168
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,184
But they have a problem.

169
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,348
And that is stories are reductive.

170
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,592
A narrative of a thing tells you only one way that thing can be or how it happened.

171
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:44,855
I like to think of it as the most effective form of data compression in the world.

172
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:55,241
And when you have a situation of complexity, the story can only show us one aspect of that

173
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:55,802
complexity.

174
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,530
If the story says, well, that's complicated,

175
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,851
then that's also called a bad story.

176
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,853
Games, however, are different.

177
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,395
Games operate in complexity.

178
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:13,797
It is the complexity of games that makes them special.

179
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:17,279
It's that area of complexity that

180
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:21,141
makes games a new medium that is unlike any that came before.

181
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:25,664
But it's hard.

182
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,536
Setting up these systems is hard.

183
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,439
And when people have tried to do this,

184
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,442
and we've played maybe some of these attempts,

185
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:38,783
they often go awry.

186
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,305
And this is why I was in the room that day,

187
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,707
because I'm this person who has done it before.

188
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,112
Really, game design is not a 30-minute activity.

189
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,254
It's probably not a 30-second activity.

190
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:54,495
It's a 10,000-hour activity.

191
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,191
Which means that if we're going to do this effectively, it needs to be people that have

192
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:06,732
done it for those 10,000 hours. And the smart people are learning that who they want to

193
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:15,274
talk to is you. And some of them actually are in the audience today. I know because

194
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:21,255
they've been talking to me over the last three days. So what do I think is the outcome of

195
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:26,176
all this? Well, some of us remember this. This is the consumerist...

196
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:31,322
worst company in America? This would be the year that EA actually dropped off the chart.

197
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:40,328
You got a very favorable matchup. But what was interesting about 2014 was not this corner,

198
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:47,774
actually, it was this corner. I saw that and I went, SeaWorld, that's weird. That's family

199
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:52,557
entertainment. Why would they be in the worst company of America list? Why did they almost

200
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:55,640
win? I mean, Comcast, that's not fair. But they almost won.

201
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,967
And of course, the reason they almost won was this.

202
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,088
It was a movie, a documentary film called Blackfish.

203
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,169
It was a story.

204
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:10,490
It was a story of a particular killer whale named Tilikum.

205
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:13,611
And by the way, Tilikum is dying.

206
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:18,173
For those that saw this, he's dying as of the last couple

207
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:18,393
weeks.

208
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:21,634
It was very moving.

209
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,975
And it had quite a profound effect on SeaWorld.

210
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:34,474
SeaWorld actually this morning announced that they are no longer going to have killer whales

211
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,295
in their show in San Diego.

212
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,001
I had nothing to do with that.

213
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:48,885
But this is to emphasize the power of this kind of medium.

214
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,228
This got recently exposed.

215
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:56,492
They had planted spies in the activist organizations that were protesting against them.

216
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,012
SeaWorld folks are bad people. And they got brought down by

217
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:08,334
this documentary. But it's hard. And sometimes it doesn't work.

218
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,436
I personally think that An Inconvenient Truth, the book and

219
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:18,617
the movie were both extremely well done. This is the drama

220
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:22,578
moment of the film if you've seen it. With the hockey stick

221
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:26,500
and the scissors lift. And guess what? That did not work.

222
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,899
Since that was released, more people don't believe global

223
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,620
warming is real than before.

224
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,321
And what I'd like to do also is call attention to the

225
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:38,981
picture on the right.

226
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,301
That's James Inhofe, who now chairs the Senate Committee on

227
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:50,923
Science, telling a story that if there's a snowball in his

228
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,204
hand that he got off the street in Washington, DC,

229
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:56,025
global warming must not be real.

230
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:06,381
on the floor of the Senate. Maybe that's a little complicated for such a narrative and

231
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:09,942
maybe a game could do it better. Maybe it couldn't, I don't know, but I sure think it's

232
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:17,905
worth a try. There are other issues out there too that I think of as being complex and where

233
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:21,887
understanding the complexity of the issue might be the thing that can change the way

234
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,008
people think of it. Maybe they can change their behavior. Here's one.

235
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:32,006
The majority of the growth in antibiotic resistance comes from two places.

236
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:35,887
One is the fact that antibiotics are way over prescribed.

237
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,847
It's not going to help your flu ever.

238
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:44,468
The other is people don't take the full course of their antibiotics.

239
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,789
Who knew this?

240
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,909
That you have to take the full course of your antibiotics.

241
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:49,950
Yeah, bullshit.

242
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,569
If you don't take the whole thing,

243
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:58,530
you get a new strain that's actually slightly stronger.

244
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,151
And people keep doing that, and then they

245
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,171
pass it on to someone else.

246
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,612
The next thing you know, you've got a resistant bacterium

247
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:04,052
out there.

248
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:07,133
And the only way you can really understand why this happens

249
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:12,095
is understanding how evolution works,

250
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,676
which probably James Inhofe is not the best resource for that.

251
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,198
The game could show that really nicely.

252
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,120
This is where I was spending a few years in education.

253
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:25,989
This report came out last year.

254
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,792
It was not good news in terms of the level of competence of

255
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,693
math in our schools.

256
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,655
And by the way, Common Core is not the problem.

257
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,759
If I can soapbox for just a moment, Common Core is part of

258
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,600
the solution, but we'll move on.

259
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:45,643
This is a really interesting map.

260
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,965
The EPA just released recently this new tool.

261
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,488
And this is called Data That's Political.

262
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,728
On the left, that allows you to show the correlation between

263
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,649
poverty and pollution.

264
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,271
That's Manhattan.

265
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,993
And you can pretty much go anywhere in the United States

266
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:07,194
and see this happen.

267
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:08,955
You can make that little GIF.

268
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:15,338
When we made SimCity EDU and took it into schools, and we

269
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,120
did that at Glass Lab.

270
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,480
I think I saw Stone back there.

271
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,841
Thank you, Stone, for making that happen.

272
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:28,508
Quick story, we had a teacher who used SimCityEDU in her

273
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,849
class, and it was called SimCityEDU Pollution

274
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,289
Challenge.

275
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,990
And the idea was that kids learn to balance the trade-offs

276
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,951
between pollution and energy.

277
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:41,432
But something else happened.

278
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,753
One of the students came up to this teacher and said, now,

279
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,733
when I play this game.

280
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,123
What I'm doing is zoning, right?

281
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,664
And the teacher said, yes.

282
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,646
The student says, is that how they really

283
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,506
do it in the real world?

284
00:16:58,128 --> 00:16:59,009
Yeah, that's how they do it.

285
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,911
So that means that that factory that's right by my house,

286
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,712
somebody made that zoning.

287
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,533
Yeah, that's true.

288
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,254
Oh, man.

289
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,097
This is a middle school kid who had never realized

290
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,098
that a person made that decision.

291
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:15,559
It didn't just happen.

292
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:21,737
And Sim City actually taught this kid that thing. And that's

293
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:31,620
profound. Or, back to our little starting moment, this guy, I'm

294
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,821
not sure, I think he might be ex-KGB, they're not quite sure

295
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:38,922
exactly who he is, sold a thermosized jug of real, highly

296
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,063
enriched uranium to an undercover police officer for

297
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:41,903
$330,000 last year. In November. He got caught.

298
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,806
But this is scary stuff.

299
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,927
This is just a kind of a fun game prototype

300
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,988
that I started to play around with.

301
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,990
I think it's probably stupid, and it's probably going to suck.

302
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,372
But it's based on the doomsday clock from my era,

303
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:02,353
and I wonder if there's some way of bridging that.

304
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:03,895
So what should you do?

305
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,236
Well, it's complicated.

306
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,439
I want to first warn everybody, you're

307
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,520
not going to get rich doing this.

308
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,702
If you want to get rich, knock yourself out.

309
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,382
Have fun.

310
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:17,094
There are lots of ways to do that, you're learning about

311
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:20,135
here. If you want to make art even better, please do. So this

312
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:24,557
is different. But here's a few resources. One is Games for

313
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:28,099
Change. Games for Change, this organization, has both a

314
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,200
conference, a website, they do lots of things and they are the

315
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,742
leading force in this space. And did anyone go to Colleen's talk

316
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,384
yesterday? Fantastic talk, she gave a fantastic talk. As soon

317
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,485
as it appears on the vault, if you're interested in this, go

318
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:44,847
watch her talk, it was terrific. It was also a lot of fun.

319
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:51,085
Games for Change along with N Square, which I learned was not

320
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,526
coincidence following the meeting I had with them, put up

321
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:57,287
basically a grand challenge, $10,000 for the winning game

322
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,808
design to come up with something around nuclear security. They

323
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,910
gave somebody $10,000 for that. How cool is that? They're doing

324
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,512
it again. They're doing it for financial literacy. That's the

325
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:11,852
one you see called Feed the Pig.

326
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:17,766
And just a couple days ago, Games4Change announced their

327
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,809
third grand challenge. This one's for climate. Again, $10,000

328
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:30,875
cash prize. Any and all of you can enter. Some other resources.

329
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:34,158
Mark Delora, who was, in case you don't know who Mark Delora

330
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,340
is, Mark was for several years our advocate in the White House.

331
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,802
He worked for the Obama administration as the game czar

332
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,725
after a long career including Nintendo, Sony and lots of other

333
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:44,085
places.

334
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,185
He publishes this called the Level Up Report.

335
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:47,926
It's fantastic.

336
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,331
Gamesandlearning.org is a nice resource

337
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:53,613
if you are interested in going into games for learning.

338
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:59,841
I want to give a shout out to Aaron, my colleague at UC Santa

339
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:03,265
Cruz, who runs the Beat the Dev fundraiser for the Sierra Club.

340
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:04,367
Yes.

341
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:10,742
I got another one of these funny phone calls about three weeks ago from this organization.

342
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:12,183
They're called Project Everyone.

343
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:16,846
You might know them as the people who run Comic Relief in the UK or this thing called

344
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:22,010
Red Nose Day, where people wear a red nose around to raise money for various charitable

345
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,450
causes.

346
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,072
And they would love to get into games.

347
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:27,234
And I had a long conversation with them.

348
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:29,735
And they actually shared this video with me.

349
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:33,078
I will promise you this is more uplifting than the last thing I showed you.

350
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:38,019
But it's around the 17 UN goals.

351
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,541
Who knows the 17 UN worldwide goals?

352
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:42,802
Who knows they even exist?

353
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,805
All right, we're doing better than average by far.

354
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:49,387
This is 17 goals for a sustainable planet.

355
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,768
They're a 15-year plan.

356
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:53,209
We're on our second 15 years of this, folks.

357
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,871
And nobody knows about it.

358
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:59,253
And so their goal is to spread the word.

359
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,334
The world leaders have signed on, but not the world

360
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:02,055
population.

361
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:02,635
How about that?

362
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:09,499
So here's a little film they made just to kind of get you all excited about the world

363
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:09,799
goals.

364

Video 20

385
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,569
Despite what you hear in the American media, the world doesn't suck.

386
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:09,408
Apollo, you're on course. 226 hours to the moon orbit.

387
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,594
Okay, thanks Houston. But I think we'll be heading back now.

388
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:13,135
Coming, yeah?

389
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:17,081
Yeah, it was kind of fun. But I think halfway will do. Job done.

390
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,790
Stop!

391
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,515
Good night!

392
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:25,242
I would try to face you

393
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:29,747
Thank you.

394
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,710
Alright, not all linear mean is bad. That's pretty good.

395
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:37,354
So this is a group, they work with people like Usain Bolt.

396
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:39,976
With coldplay, gets totally involved in this stuff.

397
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:43,006
and they want to work with game developers. They want to work

398
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:47,030
with you guys. And they asked me if I would ask you to work with

399
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,253
them. And we're going to talk about it. We're going to do a

400
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:57,059
webinar. April 13th. Follow this Twitter handle. We made a

401
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,502
Facebook page for it. I would love for, I don't even know how

402
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,624
we're going to figure out the technology on this, but if we

403
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:04,206
get all of you to show up.

404
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:09,443
and talk to this organization about how we can make a game

405
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:12,425
that's as cool, that's as engaging, that's as awesome as

406
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:15,448
that video that will help bring these forward. That would be an

407
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,712
awesome start. And I'm going to maintain this Twitter account

408
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,955
for a while at least to keep posting these various things

409
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:28,359
that keep coming to me that I would love to all of you. And I

410
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:31,061
would love it if you would all join me and that's it. Thanks.

411
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,795
If anybody has any questions, we've just got like two minutes.

412
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,179
It's not a big Q&A topic.

413
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,361
All right, thanks.

414
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:56,242
I would love to see you all online on the 13th.
