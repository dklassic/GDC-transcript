1
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:08,362
Hi, and thanks for coming.

2
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:12,023
Taking for granted that games can

3
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:14,423
be used as a medium of communication,

4
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,264
just like literature, film, and music, and so on,

5
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,165
is of course not a revelation for you guys.

6
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:22,885
But how we're actually dealing with it

7
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:26,906
in our development of our true story adventure game,

8
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,607
Cosmic Top Secret, might hopefully

9
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:32,308
be inspiring for you to hear about.

10
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:35,503
Anyways, that's why we're here.

11
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:40,245
And I'm director Trine Leij.

12
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,726
My parents worked for the Danish intelligence

13
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:45,986
fighting against the Red Menace.

14
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,567
This is producer Lise Saxtrup.

15
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,388
Her parents were devoted communists

16
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:54,648
and might have been under the surveillance of my parents.

17
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,009
And this is our programmer Christian Torgard,

18
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,110
who actually doesn't know whether his parents are

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,870
spies or not.

20
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:09,076
These are our findings that we want to share with you,

21
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,999
that reality is fun and inspiring,

22
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,882
that mechanics can edit reality, and vice versa,

23
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,505
and that the personal aspect can be engaging.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,743
We will try to document these points by examples

25
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,466
from Cosmic Top Secret, which is developed

26
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,889
as an autobiographical game about a woman.

27
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,651
It's actually me trying to find out

28
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:39,414
what my parents worked for at the Danish intelligence

29
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:40,776
during the Cold War.

30
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:45,685
And while on her mission, she realizes that her parents are

31
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,687
getting old and fragile, and that they're not

32
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:50,129
going to be there to protect her forever.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,033
She needs to prepare herself to manage without them.

34
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:58,417
And she thinks she needs to understand their secret lives

35
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:00,399
to continue her own life.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,523
The point is that all parents and all children

37
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,686
have secrets, Cold War spies or not.

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,863
And we ask if secrets do something to our relations.

39
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,124
Maybe just think about it.

40
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,926
As for now, we will show you the trailer,

41
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,128
so you'll get a sense of what it's all about.

42
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:24,150
Do we know each other?

43
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:27,673
PHONE RINGS

44
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:28,313
Hi, dad.

45
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,736
Hi, T. I've found something of yours.

46
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,497
A headband with a code on it, I think.

47
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:34,338
And your initials.

48
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,460
It's you, SÃ¸ren.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,221
What does YM mean?

50
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,762
Ydre's family.

51
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:45,336
No, I can't punish you for that.

52
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,457
Everyone spies on everyone.

53
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,797
Wait, dad. Were you the spy?

54
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,638
No, no. I have to run.

55
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:50,858
Dad!

56
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:54,559
Control panel.

57
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:57,920
It was about the Soviet Union going abroad.

58
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:10,515
It could be.

59
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:11,676
Yes, it could be.

60
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,037
Mom, do you know where Dad worked when he was in the police force?

61
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,259
No, I was in another department.

62
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,340
Were you also in the police force? Where were you?

63
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,240
One, two, one, two, one, two.

64
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:43,178
Do you think you actually got to defend an atomic war?

65
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,239
Do you think it was close?

66
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,821
There were situations where it was very close.

67
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,601
No doubt about it.

68
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:19,820
So the documentary is celebrated worldwide,

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,361
and never earlier have the documentary

70
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,983
experienced such development and exploration

71
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,504
of form and content.

72
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:29,586
Stories are subject to political, social,

73
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,267
and emotional discussions, giving voices

74
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:37,030
to experimenting artists, devoted, dedicated journalists,

75
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,152
and filmmakers, dramatizing and designing stories

76
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,153
to keep an audience engaged.

77
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,673
The stories arise from reality and often exceeds imagination.

78
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:48,815
And if they were made up, they would

79
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,756
seem completely unrealistic.

80
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:54,860
In Cosmic Top Secret, the protagonist

81
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,702
realizes that her dad worked for the Danish intelligence.

82
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:02,246
The A-plot of the game deals with the actual investigation

83
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:03,687
of what he did there.

84
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,451
So what is so attractive about the real?

85
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,565
To us, there's a dimension about this really happened,

86
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,467
which means that this could actually happen to me.

87
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:20,270
It's an instant and identifiable dimension.

88
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:24,934
Then there's all the free stuff that you experience.

89
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:28,757
It's a person's gesture, it's moods, it's lights,

90
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:31,299
it's accidents, it's language,

91
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,001
and stuff you could have never made up.

92
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,362
It would, it seems so right,

93
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:37,344
and we think that it's because it's real.

94
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:47,391
The way Dad's character in the game is animated is actually the real Dad's gestures.

95
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:58,816
We took up the sound so you can really experience his gestures.

96
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:00,957
Like this.

97
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:06,879
And of course what I just mentioned, that reality exceeds imagination.

98
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:12,120
In our A-plot, the protagonist investigates her dad's work for the Danish intelligence, as I said,

99
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,663
and she also finds out that mom worked there too.

100
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:25,609
And she even worked in a more classified position, so that's kind of a surprise.

101
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:34,835
Also, Bom trained the Danish queen, Margaret, in mastering judo, fencing, and other military disciplines.

102
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:40,496
So in that sense, the real never ceases to surprise and inspire us.

103
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,681
And maybe you remember the last time you were telling friends about what you did

104
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,463
last night or your summer holidays.

105
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:53,486
You're most likely trying not to be too boring, and

106
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:57,649
you passed on your experiences with a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

107
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:03,280
Or imagine that you are a director or a journalist and your attention is caught by something

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,721
that could turn into be an amazing story.

109
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:11,326
You begin your research by talking to people, reading, and searching in ways you know.

110
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:17,370
And in the beginning you may not be that structured, but your preferences, whatever they are, lead

111
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,811
you from one point to another.

112
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:23,275
And while some things support your interest, others don't.

113
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:27,778
You pick and you choose, and a selection of reality has already begun.

114
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:34,356
So during the research, and especially when telling people about what you're doing,

115
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,996
the structure of reality begins.

116
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:42,958
By passing on your work, you do at the same time try to make sense to yourself,

117
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,518
always in retrospect about what you're doing.

118
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:51,459
You might choose to let out what research went nowhere,

119
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,640
and highlighting what actually ended up uncovering the truth.

120
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:03,999
In films, editing, sound, visual, research are all examples of tools you use for your

121
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:04,799
design process.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,483
You want to engage your audience and tell a story the best way you can.

123
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:14,628
You have a design that helps you pass on the story and it becomes your reality.

124
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,211
So understood this way, documentaries are designed realities.

125
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,712
And in this perspective, the real story

126
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:26,794
is just as suitable as any other story when designing games.

127
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,296
I probably do not have to defend our wish

128
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,417
to work with games here.

129
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:37,758
But frequently, we've been asked why we're not also

130
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,239
doing a documentary film about Tia and her dad.

131
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,860
But from the very beginning, we have

132
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,282
been interested in our audience doing the story

133
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,162
and not having it told as a film.

134
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,963
And apart from the potential in the story of developing interesting mechanics and vice versa,

135
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,446
we'll get back to that,

136
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:03,992
we want our players to emotionally feel the experience as they do the story.

137
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:08,656
And merging the game and the documentary have been our base since we met in 2011

138
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:11,219
and began working on Cosmic Sub-Secret.

139
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:17,495
In the beginning it was just an experiment, how to merge the uncontrolled and real with

140
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,336
the very controlled.

141
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:24,901
And as you now have heard, we argue that the dramatized story, real or fiction, is just

142
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:29,584
as designed as any game and therefore could be just as suitable to be played.

143
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,794
And while we have been working with real sound footage

144
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,176
and visuals and designing a story and levels simultaneously

145
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:44,218
with developing our mechanics, we've been confirmed

146
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,480
from tests that an X-Factor in Cosmic Top Secret

147
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,601
is the real.

148
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,422
It's a dimension that attracts our audience

149
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,724
and evoke emotions when revealing the relations

150
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,264
of the characters in the game.

151
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:58,225
So to conclude.

152
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,178
The real is just as designed as a game.

153
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,721
Of course, not all stories are suitable for game development,

154
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,863
and that being fictional fact.

155
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,946
But a suitable story might as well arise from reality.

156
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:16,111
And to us, the real continuously challenge and inspires.

157
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,021
Developing a documentary game offers some unique challenges

158
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:34,084
in terms of game mechanics, beyond just having a story that's

159
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:34,985
based on true events.

160
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:39,489
And since this game is not just about Skine's family secrets,

161
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,710
it's also about a quest to uncover them,

162
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,133
the game is partly documenting its own development.

163
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,157
But more importantly, it has meant that the game

164
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,878
had had to be developed incrementally,

165
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:54,661
story and mechanics changing along with the real world

166
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,081
events.

167
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:02,616
Because of this, we've come to think of the development of the game as having two legs.

168
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,438
There's the story and there's the mechanics.

169
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:10,822
They're both moving forwards in steps, each step dependent and influenced by the other.

170
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:16,145
So a new development, for example, in the story could mean that the existing game mechanics

171
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:19,327
would have to be changed or completely removed.

172
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,750
And as we're working with a story that takes place while we're developing the game,

173
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,513
this meant that real-world events could influence the story completely.

174
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:32,058
and lead to fundamental changes, not only in the story we're

175
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,822
telling, but in the mechanics in the game.

176
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,666
And the other way around, but we'll

177
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:38,647
come to that in a minute.

178
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:44,175
In the first demo for the game, the player avatar, T.

179
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,240
looked very different from the other characters,

180
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,781
and especially from Dad.

181
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,542
He was constantly running ahead.

182
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,445
He was a fast character, just powering through the game.

183
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,307
And the player,

184
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,248
controlling T, would run after him

185
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,530
and tilt the world to keep him

186
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,172
from falling over the edge.

187
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:03,794
And in addition to this,

188
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:05,155
in direct control,

189
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:06,957
the game was controlled with a

190
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,018
smartphone, and the game

191
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:10,420
itself was running on a computer.

192
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,840
And ultimately, a lot of these novel mechanics were scrapped.

193
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,502
And the game we have now is a more traditional adventure

194
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,663
game, collecting items and solving puzzles.

195
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:25,465
And this way of controlling the game with the smartphone,

196
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,347
it gave a poor feeling of immersion in the story.

197
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:30,488
And the whole wireless setup was very fragile.

198
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:34,750
And as we were about to discover,

199
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,030
so was Trine's father.

200
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,833
But at this point in the development.

201
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:44,436
Trine's dad fell and hurt himself during hand grenade throwing.

202
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,177
And he has had difficulties walking ever since.

203
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:51,258
And Trine says she began thinking about him getting old and fragile,

204
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,220
and says she found herself for the first time confronted with the fact

205
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,961
that he will die someday, something she wasn't quite sure she was ready to deal

206
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:04,923
with, and not a theme that was supposed to be part of the game's story at all.

207
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:12,590
And if this process of prototyping mechanics together with the story elements

208
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,352
was not already going on at this point,

209
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:21,314
we likely wouldn't identify the importance of this discovery, of this event.

210
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:25,076
But by including the physics of Dad's body,

211
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:27,637
together with the already existing paper world,

212
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:30,939
the emotional and the mechanical core of the game appeared.

213
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,621
So Dad's injuries, as there would be more than one,

214
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,002
are shown in the game as pieces falling off the paper doll.

215
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:42,634
The player, as T, will then find these and return them to him

216
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:44,735
as she learns more about her family

217
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,456
and tries to come to grip with her father growing older.

218
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,159
But paper is not only fragile, it's also versatile.

219
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,680
And what was at first mainly the visual aesthetic of the game,

220
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,841
photos, cut out, everything made out

221
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,183
of paper, cardboard, old documents, punched tape,

222
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,804
suddenly this became the basis for the mechanical core

223
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:08,525
of the game as well.

224
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,934
And after we moved away from the problematic smartphone controls,

225
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,036
the team came up with the idea of T rolling into a paper ball,

226
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:20,978
the player rolling and flicking her through the game world.

227
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:25,040
It's not only a novel mechanic, but it also serves to symbolize

228
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,562
that T needs the player's help to move through the story.

229
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,384
She cannot move on herself as a paper doll.

230
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:33,025
And gradually, as the story progresses,

231
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,707
she gains more abilities and more mobility.

232
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:43,737
For example, midway through the game,

233
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,138
as T is learning more about her mother's involvement

234
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,399
with the military intelligence,

235
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:50,460
specifically her work for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force,

236
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:51,961
T learns to fly.

237
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:55,203
She folds herself into a paper plane and glides in the air,

238
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:58,224
flying over Poland to secretly take photos

239
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,405
of Soviet installations.

240
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,666
This mission is mimicking the real-life exploits

241
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,347
of Danish spies during the Cold War.

242
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,469
This part of the game is significant

243
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:10,130
because it brings us back to the two legs concept.

244
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:16,319
This story of the Danish bias in Poland

245
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,761
was chosen over a number of other possible branches

246
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,482
at this point, exactly because it fits so perfectly

247
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,604
into the paper world and our decision

248
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:25,165
to focus on these paper mechanics.

249
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,367
So the story we end up with now is substantially different

250
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,428
because of this decision.

251
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,150
The subjects that would be researched, the people

252
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,931
that Schiene would go to interview, all these things

253
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,854
are concrete elements that were affected by a mechanics

254
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:40,214
decision.

255
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,001
So not only did the real world events lead to changes in the game mechanics,

256
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:48,564
but these in turn changed the story we are telling,

257
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:52,107
including the people involved, the places, so on.

258
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:57,131
So as Lisa was talking about, we've not just been designing mechanics

259
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:00,934
to fit into the true story narrative, but the mechanics

260
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:02,054
were developed along the way.

261
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:05,557
They have also had an impact on the reality of the story.

262
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,339
Thank you, Christian.

263
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:19,273
And now to the third and last point, the C plot, that the

264
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,038
personal is engaging.

265
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:27,863
I wanted to combine the best we know from video games, the controlling of the action,

266
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:33,849
the physical playing and the joy of succeeding with the sincerity and honesty we know from

267
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:37,012
books, films, graphic novels and documentaries.

268
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:43,699
I was in particular in love with the auto fiction genre as expressed by the Norwegian

269
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,060
author Knausgaard.

270
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:53,373
being existentially touched by his very detailed descriptions of how he feels connected with the world,

271
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,294
its people, its nature, its history,

272
00:16:56,714 --> 00:17:02,457
and at the same time feels like taking care of himself instead of his kids and wife.

273
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,083
And this kind of embarrassing personal revelation

274
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:08,925
could be the nerve in a game, why not,

275
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,368
and provide us, the players, with a better understanding

276
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,050
of our life situation and maybe another view

277
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,592
on how to endure our own faults and limitations.

278
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,256
To achieve that kind of emotional engagement,

279
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:29,179
we need to make the player identify with the main character.

280
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,717
In our case, it's T, who is the connector

281
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,898
between this specific story and the player's own story.

282
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:39,559
We want the player to imagine secrets in his own,

283
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,601
or her own family, and reflect on their personal relations.

284
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,982
And this is the first drawing, born from that wish.

285
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,463
We pretty soon realized that it had,

286
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,324
we had a solid, good story right at hand

287
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,045
about my parents' work for the Danish intelligence.

288
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:02,910
No matter the outcome, how much I would be able to reveal,

289
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,531
it would be a story about the process of finding out.

290
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:10,393
And it's easy to say now that it's a fantastic story.

291
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:15,895
Wow, having spy parents, of course, that's super appealing.

292
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,516
But the point is that I did not know,

293
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:23,118
and I knew parts of it, and somehow I didn't know

294
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,458
because it was a secret.

295
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,880
And finally, I did not realize the potential of it.

296
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,123
Our point is that we might all have those fantastic material

297
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,505
within our personal lives that could

298
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,727
be used for all kinds of stories and games

299
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,908
and before unseen combinations.

300
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,595
In our case, we started structuring the game

301
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,156
as an adventure game.

302
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:51,318
And with tools stolen from screenwriting,

303
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,439
we built up the dramatic arch.

304
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,582
The idea is that the A-plot is the bone of the whole thing.

305
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,624
That's where we set up the basic question

306
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,345
that wakes up our curiosity.

307
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,907
What exactly did that work with?

308
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:12,507
The B-plot is the meat, that's the little details in the authentic conversations between

309
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:14,669
people that makes us laugh.

310
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,712
Not because we are ridiculous, but because we recognize it from ourselves.

311
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:23,114
How is it to drive the car with your dad, for instance?

312
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:27,176
But in the end, it's another question that is being answered.

313
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,598
It's the one that is expressed by the C-plot.

314
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:36,715
Will T be able to manage on her own without her father?

315
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,577
And will she come to terms with him and herself growing old?

316
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,339
Those questions is reflected in what we

317
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:45,240
might call emotional mechanics.

318
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:52,308
During the development process, we prototyped the mechanics

319
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,630
and features of the game simultaneously,

320
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,731
as Christian mentioned earlier.

321
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:00,673
And we discovered the strong concept of the paper aspect

322
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,835
and the fragility of Dad going into pieces,

323
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,116
but also T, the main character, going into pieces

324
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,058
caused by the sheer thought of losing her dad.

325
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:14,840
And for the player to use that negative reaction positively

326
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:18,122
to solve the puzzle by the end of the first level.

327
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:23,313
We will not reveal how, of course, but just mention

328
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:24,837
there is a shredder involved.

329
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:36,060
Working with storytelling is a very straightforward,

330
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,903
no matter the format, and at the same time, totally complex.

331
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:42,024
The most difficult thing is probably

332
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,226
to get to the core of what you want to tell.

333
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:48,549
What is it you want to tell the world, and how can you do it,

334
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,671
and how can you share that with your team?

335
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:57,818
I knew from the beginning that there was something in my upbringing, something about being isolated

336
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:01,761
and extremely shy that was very hurtful to think about.

337
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:07,084
It was strongly connected to my relation with my parents, the feeling of being dependent

338
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:10,066
on them as well as wanting to keep them on a distance.

339
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,349
It's not a story about abuse or lack of being loved.

340
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,950
On the contrary, it's very much about love

341
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,950
and feeling connected.

342
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,771
Yet being alone and being afraid of being left alone,

343
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,412
which ultimately happens to all of us

344
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:25,732
when our parents dies.

345
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,793
Cosmic Top Secret tries to deal

346
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,853
with those difficult feelings.

347
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:34,834
This is where the shredding mechanic

348
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,555
became a core element of the game.

349
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:40,401
when the main character, T, literally goes into pieces

350
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,303
by the thought of her dad dying.

351
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:47,066
And even though I set out to reveal those family secrets

352
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,608
that might explain why I still, as a grown up,

353
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:52,070
feel like a protected child, I'm not

354
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,552
able to state that as a true fact.

355
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:58,095
I simply no longer believe it is possible to conclude

356
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,997
that I've turned out the way I am because of my parents.

357
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,862
And I've decided to let it be a question for the player

358
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,343
to decide on their own.

359
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:09,485
In that sense, it's no longer my personal story,

360
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:12,747
but hopefully a shared story that can be played as a game.

361
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,709
And now for the happy ending, we will end our talk

362
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:23,190
with this sweet couple, father and daughter,

363
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,811
who volunteered for testing.

364
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,452
And they are the first to have succeeded

365
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,554
without any box or guidance.

366
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,835
Though without his daughter's help,

367
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:35,377
he would not have solved the shredder puzzle.

368
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:40,620
The game will be released for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC

369
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,521
in May, and please support our existence

370
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:45,502
by buying it and liking it.

371
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:47,163
Thanks.

372
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,336
Is there time for any questions?

373
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,117
I think there is, yeah.

374
00:22:58,137 --> 00:23:00,899
I think we have time for one or two questions, yeah.

375
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,500
Just come up to the microphone if you have any questions

376
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,121
for any of the speakers.

377
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:07,804
Also, make sure you fill out the evaluations for this talk.

378
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,684
It means a lot, thanks.

379
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:10,125
Is there any questions?

380
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,072
There's one there, I think.

381
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:30,150
Hi, do you consider this close to a serious game?

382
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,771
Do you know the serious gaming?

383
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:33,411
Yeah.

384
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:35,672
Because it's a documentary gaming.

385
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:39,393
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

386
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:40,853
Question again?

387
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,954
Well, the question is, do you consider your game

388
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,154
a serious game?

389
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,595
Do you put it in that category?

390
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,162
We know it's close to being in that category, but it was not the way we worked with it.

391
00:23:54,282 --> 00:24:02,264
We worked with more like an adventure game, telling a story, but with real and important

392
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:03,184
issues you may say.

393
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:06,905
But not as a serious game in that sense.

394
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:12,227
And so since it's a documentary game, so do we get out of there with more information

395
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,287
about this situation?

396
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:15,829
Yes, yeah, you will.

397
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:16,970
Good.

398
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,630
Well.

399
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:22,451
Any more questions?

400
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:28,792
There's one coming up.

401
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,413
How has your family reacted to the game?

402
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,774
Oh, that's a good question.

403
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,074
Yeah.

404
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,314
It's really weird to see yourself

405
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:40,535
as a video game character.

406
00:24:41,407 --> 00:24:44,770
especially when you don't play that much games yourself.

407
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:48,053
So that's been, yeah, but it's also,

408
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:51,055
they think it's fun as well and interesting.

409
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,320
More questions?

410
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:05,767
All right then.

411
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:07,809
Thank you very much.

412
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:09,670
Let's give them one more round of applause.
