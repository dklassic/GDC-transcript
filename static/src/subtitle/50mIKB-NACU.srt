1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:07,850
Thanks for that.

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,493
Well, good morning everybody. It's so nice that you guys all showed up.

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:15,674
It's crazy how many people are here. I wasn't expecting this many people.

4
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,656
Thanks Alana and Mike for hosting this.

5
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:20,717
I mean, you guys have an amazing lineup and it's going to be an awesome day.

6
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,038
So it's such a pleasure to be here and actually kicking this thing off.

7
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,480
For those of you who don't know me, I'm Richard Audin.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,382
I'm the lead animator at Guerrilla Games, and the talk will be about

9
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:31,743
the animation process of the machines in Horizon Zero Dawn.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,101
A little bit about myself, I studied at the Utrecht School of Arts for animation and my

11
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,162
main goal was always to become a feature film animator.

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,805
So in my third year I was actually very lucky to have an animation internship at DNA Productions

13
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,626
during their feature film The End Bullion.

14
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,528
That was such an amazing experience.

15
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:53,249
I mean, I learned so much about the animation industry,

16
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,209
animation itself, the workflow,

17
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,430
and I got to meet a lot of cool animators

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,910
that eventually just sort of like spread out

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,631
through the entire industry after DNA got closed down.

20
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,532
So getting back to the Netherlands and graduating,

21
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,633
I knew I wanted to be a feature film animator,

22
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,293
but I knew my reel wasn't strong enough.

23
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:13,615
So I figured, okay, let me just work on my own and hopefully see from there what will happen.

24
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:19,817
But I still wanted to get some of that industry experience and the only studio that was actually doing something was Guerrilla Games in Amsterdam back then.

25
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:26,020
And it was like ten minutes away from my house, so I figured, okay, let me just at least send in my review and we'll see what happens.

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,341
And luckily enough, they called me up and said, yeah, you have an interview.

27
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,342
And a couple of days later, I actually got hired as a junior animator on Killzone.

28
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:39,040
The crazy thing is as soon as I started to work in-game, I just fell in love with that process so much

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,967
that I knew I never wanted to do anything else and like 10 years later I'm still with Guerrilla Games.

30
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:54,620
Did a little bit of finishing off on Killzone 2, but got to really get my hands on in Killzone 3 doing the first person weapons, the new ones, and the Brutal Melee system that they had.

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,144
I skipped Killzone Shadowfall because I was already working on the R&D team for Horizon Zero Dawn.

32
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:05,990
The only thing that I actually helped them out with, just because the schedule was so tight at the end of Shadowfall, that I had to help them out with some of the cinematics.

33
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,434
But basically the last five years of my life have been all around Horizon Zero Dawn.

34
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:14,258
Recently, we just finished the expansion, the Frozen Wild.

35
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,761
So that's sort of me in a very short period.

36
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:21,165
I'm going to start a little bit with how the project

37
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,588
actually evolved on Horizon Zero Dawn and the initial idea

38
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,288
and the back story.

39
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,131
And I'll shortly discuss some of the prototyping phase that

40
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,893
we went through, where we started exploring how these

41
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,436
machines would actually move and how do it look.

42
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:37,023
But then I'll just cover a lot of in-depth production of the machines with multiple topics

43
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:40,988
like the team structure, reference, movement, and the tech behind it.

44
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:44,873
And I'll finally end up with some of the polish pass that we did.

45
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:49,218
But if you're not that familiar with the project or you just need a refresher, here are some

46
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:49,979
snippets of the machine.

47
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:16,399
I mean, how did this whole thing actually came about, right?

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,282
Back in 2011, we just finished Guilds on 3 and Guerrilla really wanted to change the

49
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:25,845
direction so we basically just went to Sony and said, hey, can we just explore something

50
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,947
new and they just said, yeah, go for it, which was amazing.

51
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,192
Basically what the studio did was they sent out a mail and they said okay if you have

52
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:38,874
an idea just pitch it to us and you can actually pitch a whole game, you can just pitch a game

53
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:43,035
mechanic and then eventually we'll just pick the top three that we like and we'll start

54
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:43,775
exploring those.

55
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:45,476
So roughly around...

56
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,958
45, 50 ideas got pitched in a week,

57
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:51,761
and Horizon was already the one that actually

58
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,482
was standing out from the crowd from the beginning.

59
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,103
It was just like such a cool setting,

60
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,725
and the theme in Majestic was amazing,

61
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,727
but it was also the scariest one to develop

62
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:01,709
because it was already a third person open world game

63
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,791
from the get go, and we were just this first person studio.

64
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,872
Like, what do we know, right?

65
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:14,053
We explored a little bit of the other two, so there were three, but then eventually we just ended up with Horizon because everybody was just drawn to that thing.

66
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:24,440
And basically the pitch itself was nothing more than Earth being reclaimed by nature and it's now inhabited by these robotic machines that are now the dominant life species.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,563
And the gameplay itself was still a mystery at this point, it was just that backstory that everybody just was drawn to.

68
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:34,365
Guerrilla put together a small R&D team of roughly around 25 people,

69
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,846
and just a couple from every department,

70
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,988
and we just needed to figure out what the gameplay was going to be about.

71
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:44,330
I was already the one from the beginning to actually start working on the robots.

72
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:50,141
Since it was such a new genre for us, we knew we needed to get some new insights.

73
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,124
And for me personally, I actually never animated a quadruped before this game.

74
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:56,627
So I had to become an expert really quickly.

75
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,990
And luckily enough, Animation Mental was doing this Animals and Creatures course back then.

76
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,894
where I learned tons about actually the approach of animating quadrupeds,

77
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,637
the workflow, the rigs, all the different gates.

78
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:09,479
So that was really nice.

79
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,621
And then next to that, Guerrilla also hired a bunch of industry experts

80
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,483
to start educating the studios.

81
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:16,705
To give you some examples, we had Stuart Zimida over.

82
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,486
who was a very famous paleontologist,

83
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:22,448
to give us a class on animal anatomy.

84
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:25,089
We had Matthew Lund from Pixar do a story class.

85
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,950
We had Scott Eaton do a human anatomy course, for example.

86
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,652
So those were really nice educational moments.

87
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,793
And also what happened is we had to get a lot of hires

88
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,934
in a lot of departments.

89
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:37,354
So it was either for capacity reasons,

90
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,495
just because we were understaffed.

91
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,395
but also just because we had no knowledge of this game, right?

92
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:45,697
So we hired a bunch of industry experts that had done these games already,

93
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,838
so they could just start filling us up in the gaps that we were missing.

94
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:53,339
And last but not least, study as much nature as possible.

95
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:56,840
I think I've watched every BBC Nature Planet documentary out there,

96
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,200
like 50 times already.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,261
And it was also like, it was just getting to know the behavior,

98
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,622
but also the movement, etc.

99
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,382
And you learn so much from this thing.

100
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,363
And there's so many cool nature footage out there that...

101
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:11,186
Yeah, that's something that we just did a lot during the course of this whole thing.

102
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,428
So like I mentioned, we had no idea what the gameplay was, right?

103
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:19,091
So we started with a small R&D team just to explore the possibilities in our prototyping

104
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:19,391
phase.

105
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,858
Basically the prototyping phase was all the search,

106
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,259
okay, what is this gameplay?

107
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,581
And the idea behind it was to go as fast as possible

108
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,102
with a limited amount of development time

109
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,603
and see what works and what doesn't work.

110
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,865
And if it doesn't work, instantly throw it out.

111
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,466
If it does work, just keep iterating on it

112
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,587
until we actually have something

113
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:38,689
that's sort of like a nice gameplay feature.

114
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,830
And since our resources were so limited,

115
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,492
we basically had to work with what we had

116
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,373
or just create some super basic assets.

117
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:46,754
So.

118
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,956
We actually started out with this Lego Thunderjaw.

119
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,758
And the player character is actually Jammer from Killzone 3,

120
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,821
which was the only female character that we did up

121
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:57,342
until that point.

122
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,864
But we already knew from the first pitch that we wanted

123
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:00,905
to have a female protagonist.

124
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,547
So that was actually something that we were very much

125
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,648
pushing to, to get this in.

126
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,670
And looking back at this, it's actually crazy how many

127
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,612
of the initial mechanics made it into the final game.

128
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,994
I mean, there's charges there, there's close combats,

129
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,396
and it's all super basic, but I still like to see it.

130
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,204
Even in this movie, we actually already put in the option to shoot off the weapon of the

131
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,847
Thunderjaw and then use it against himself with this awesome physics.

132
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,288
Look at that.

133
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,976
So after playing around with this.

134
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:35,969
So after playing around with a lot of the ideas that we had, this just took a couple of months,

135
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:41,531
we finally created our first proof of concept that we showed to the higher peeps of Sony, and it looked like this.

136
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,373
And as you can see, the environment is a little bit more fleshed out,

137
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,914
and we actually have a first proper Thunderjaw model, but everything is still very basic,

138
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,996
and it's basically just a full playthrough of this boss battle,

139
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:53,777
using all the mechanics that we developed up until that point.

140
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:55,898
As you can see, there's actually traps there.

141
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,640
The play is already setting tripwires as well.

142
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,243
But then all the other stuff that you saw, like the charges, close combats, etc. etc. is actually in this.

143
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:10,487
I showed this to Sony and they really liked where this was heading.

144
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,068
So they said, yeah, just keep going.

145
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,070
Find whatever you want to see, like what you want.

146
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,793
And then eventually, this sort of like concept turned into the reveal trailer that you guys saw on E3 in 2015.

147
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:49,581
Whoa, someone's angry.

148
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,762
Alright, time to shut you down.

149
00:08:56,022 --> 00:09:00,144
So that whole track of finding the gameplay on the Thunderjaw

150
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:01,905
took roughly around two years to get right.

151
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,626
And the idea behind it is if we can actually have all the

152
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:08,168
states and mechanics and everything that we want out of

153
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,910
this big boss battle, and if it's still fun to play, we can

154
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,591
just chop all the small pieces up and apply it to the

155
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:15,332
smaller robots.

156
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:25,617
So, that's why it actually took a very long time and that was kind of frustrating sometimes,

157
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,218
but it definitely was worthwhile in the end.

158
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,560
And so like during this stage as well, I started to actually search what the style and movement of these machines were going to be as well.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,361
And during our prototype phase, my art director actually sent me this video and said,

160
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,762
yeah, this is what I think the robot should move like.

161
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,840
And as you can see, it's actually very jittery and mechanical,

162
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,602
and that's just because there's no ease-ins or ease-out on the movements.

163
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:57,744
It's all these linear, grip and pneumatic parts

164
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,987
that cause for a lot of overlap on this very unstable installation.

165
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,291
I know, right? So sad.

166
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,891
But just because of the fact that the movement is so unpredictable, that's the thing that he liked.

167
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:17,852
And it reminded him of this sort of zombie-esque type of feeling to that machine.

168
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:22,414
So with that video in mind, I started the prototype on this smaller bot that we were creating back then,

169
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:26,035
which is also looking a lot more mechanical than the previous Thunderjaw.

170
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,156
Unfortunately, I couldn't find my initial test anymore.

171
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,717
But what I can tell you is that I never got it to look right.

172
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,558
As soon as I thought I had something, I exported it to the game.

173
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:41,063
in game it actually looked like there was a frame rate bug or like it was just a very

174
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,325
bad attempt at stop motion.

175
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:48,874
So I just started to tone it down and eventually sort of like found a nice middle ground into

176
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:49,956
this walk cycle that I made.

177
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,838
As you can see, it has this sort of like fluid motion,

178
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,960
but it's still mechanical, and it does feel kind of creepy.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,222
So I was actually sort of happy with this.

180
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,904
It's like, let me just sort of like start iterating on this.

181
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,886
And then as soon as you actually go into higher speeds,

182
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:06,287
everything is out the window.

183
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:07,868
Just because you have that fast movement,

184
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,469
it's almost impossible to actually keep

185
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:11,391
this sort of like jittery mechanical motion.

186
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:14,073
And the only thing that I actually tried to apply to

187
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,795
is on that chest, and you just see it popping back and forth.

188
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:18,736
But it was just like a last attempt

189
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,817
trying to get something mechanical into this thing.

190
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:27,480
On this turn on spot I tried it again, but to me it just became this cluster of movement noise to these things.

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,281
And again in this jump, it's just completely out the window.

192
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:36,682
Eventually I found that I was actually animating these things more and more like realistic animals with an occasional jitter.

193
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:40,544
Or like not perfect spacing, especially in the starts and the settles.

194
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:43,144
Because that's where you can actually have a little bit of a wind up time.

195
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:48,929
It actually started to seem to fit the designs that we were making for the new machines as well,

196
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,790
to actually make them move realistically.

197
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,773
And it also started to relate to the player a lot more.

198
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,796
So if you look at this grazer for example, which was our first terraforming robot,

199
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:02,060
I started to animate that thing super close to a real deer antelope type of creature.

200
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,063
And as soon as playtesters started fighting against these things,

201
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,145
they actually felt bad to hunt them.

202
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:09,726
Especially when they were limping.

203
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,907
Oh, is it not looping? Sorry.

204
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,351
It's not looping anymore, sorry.

205
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,534
But let me see.

206
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,996
But that actually is the fact that I actually started to

207
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,057
feel bad for these things.

208
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,639
That's actually something that was also incorporated into the

209
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,882
story where Aloy is actually being brought up to be very

210
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,084
respectful towards these mechanical creatures.

211
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:35,487
So that was a nice combination of elements of coming together

212
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:36,508
naturally in this process.

213
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:41,285
The only robots that we actually did apply some of the robotic movement to was the ancient

214
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,785
war class like this Deathbringer.

215
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:46,927
Even here, it was just because it fitted the design and the behavior more.

216
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,849
But on these things, we actually started to look more at industrial machines like they

217
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:55,132
use in car factories, since they have that nice combination of fluid motion and mechanical

218
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:55,772
stuff combined.

219
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,541
So that whole track of defining the gameplay,

220
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:04,103
going through this pre-production phase,

221
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:05,704
searching for the style, was done at this point.

222
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,206
And at the same time, the rest of the studio

223
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:09,166
was done with Shadowfall.

224
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,328
So the entire team basically transferred over to Horizon.

225
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,989
And from a production point of view,

226
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,511
it actually makes sense for the producers

227
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,812
to have these dedicated teams.

228
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,234
So we had a team robot, we had a team alien,

229
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:20,595
we had a team living world, et cetera.

230
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,177
And the nice thing for us was that we could actually

231
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,118
only focus on the robots, and that was the only thing

232
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,099
that we had to take care of.

233
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:28,669
Before the team actually transferred over,

234
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,210
I started to make a list as a guideline

235
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,091
that we could hold up to our own work,

236
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,552
but also made it very clear for the rest of the team

237
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,032
what the intention of these things was.

238
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:39,154
And for me, the first and foremost was that these things

239
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,095
actually feel like they belong in the world, right?

240
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,856
So to make them as believable as possible.

241
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:44,796
I knew we were gonna end up with roughly

242
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:45,537
around 25 to 30 robots, so...

243
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,518
It was very important to me that they actually all felt unique with their own personality

244
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:53,819
shine through within their movement.

245
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,983
The third one was that I really wanted them to feel bulky with lots of weight, which turned

246
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:02,786
out a lot harder in the end than I was thinking in the beginning because you can make them

247
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:06,730
as bulky and heavy as you want, but if they're not responsive in terms of gameplay, your

248
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,410
game sucks.

249
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,973
So there's a lot of back and forward that we had to do in the end on this, but I'll

250
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:11,974
cover that a little bit later.

251
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:15,317
Last but not least, they should be very scary to fight against.

252
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,172
So Team Robot, this is sort of like the list that was in there.

253
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:25,095
Three AI coders, four to six animators, three visual designers, two asset artists,

254
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,716
three game designers, three effects artists, two sound designers,

255
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,817
and TechArt was always there to support us.

256
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:33,019
Even on this, we had like three subgroups.

257
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,142
So two animators, one designer, and one AI coder was just working on one machine,

258
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,984
and we had three machines in production at the same time all the time.

259
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:44,806
So there was a very steady flow of creating these machines.

260
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,228
The way we worked was very much layered and we had multiple sign-off moments.

261
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:59,412
So basically game design started with around 50 to 62 pages that basically described the basic functionality of the machines and what mix of animals they wanted to use as an inspiration.

262
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:04,854
And eventually the game director chose roughly around 25 to 30 machines that he wanted to see in the final game.

263
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:09,578
As soon as we had that information, Visual Design actually had enough to start working

264
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,120
on their stuff.

265
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,905
And instead of just drawing, they actually went straight into ZBrush, skid-bashing these

266
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,426
things together to make mock-up models.

267
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:22,011
And once they had their first pass done, it got into TechArt to be rigged, and we started

268
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:22,692
to test it out.

269
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,355
And it became this sort of like back and forward in a loop.

270
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,028
between those three teams.

271
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,329
And eventually we had that sign-off moment

272
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,469
where the mock-up model was done,

273
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,110
and then AssetArt could actually start

274
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,730
making the high-res model while we could

275
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,991
actually start animating on the mock-up model.

276
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:39,111
By the time the designers were actually done

277
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,632
with their low-level design, which was like a 60-pager

278
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,973
book for each robot individual,

279
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,493
and we could actually start animating

280
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,194
the actual machines from that point on.

281
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,694
As soon as we had a good chunk of animations done,

282
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:52,855
we created the animation networks,

283
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,355
which is something that all the animators

284
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,676
at Guerrilla handled their own.

285
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:59,497
We handed that off to AI to actually start working on the behavior and the combat.

286
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:04,360
And here we got like that second circle of so like iterations based on feedback from all the teams.

287
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,761
And eventually once we sort of like halfway through that production,

288
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,463
effects and sound design got to do their best.

289
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:15,605
And at the end of that track we had a alpha ready machine, what we called it.

290
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:20,808
The nice thing from a production point of view was in terms of scheduling,

291
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,489
that everything had the staggered approach.

292
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,730
Everybody was just working one month behind each other.

293
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,551
So yeah, always had.

294
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,352
So nobody was actually waiting for each other.

295
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,954
We just kept on going without actually ever stopping.

296
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:35,517
And for us, like I said, two animators would work on one machine for three months,

297
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:37,258
and then we had an alpha ready version.

298
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:41,721
And that eventually ended up with 25 unique robots,

299
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:42,902
sort of like ranging from...

300
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:46,869
120 to 350 unique animations per robot,

301
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,512
depending on how big the game design was.

302
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,538
So I think that workflow actually turned out

303
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,041
to be pretty successful for us.

304
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,633
So when we actually started a new machine, of course,

305
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,275
the first thing we started to do was to search for reference.

306
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:05,377
And sometimes it was actually really obvious

307
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:06,557
what the real-life counterpart was.

308
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:08,898
We still wanted to keep into things with an open mind.

309
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,779
And that meant doing a lot of research

310
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,120
and really keeping our eyes open,

311
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,881
which is where all those hours of nature footage

312
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:15,801
really comes in handy.

313
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:21,596
So if you look at the Bellowback, which is a transporting class machine that actually carries liquids.

314
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:24,758
If you look at it and just break it down, it's basically just a bipedal animal.

315
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:27,199
So, but it's not your most obvious creature design.

316
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,741
So we just started to search for things like birds and kangaroos,

317
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:35,244
and I stumbled upon this really nice piece of footage of an emu, so like fighting a kangaroo.

318
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:41,660
And the thing that I liked about it is how much of a shape change and posture change

319
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,340
is into that thing.

320
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,340
And it's so fluid.

321
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,761
And I really wanted to get some of that into the bellow back.

322
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:50,242
And in the design document, it said that it actually needed to shoot projectiles.

323
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:54,884
And instead of just having a boring shooting straight animation, I wanted to do something

324
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:55,044
else.

325
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:58,465
And a little bit further in the video, he's actually doing this sort of gesturing thing,

326
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,926
but it reminded me of him actually throwing a baseball.

327
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:02,066
So I figured, okay.

328
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:08,101
Why don't we just throw out the projectiles and that basically just turn into this animation.

329
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,934
So the Rock Breaker, this was an acquisition robot that had to mine for resources on the ground.

330
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:24,576
And if you look at it, it's basically designed, at least from a visual design,

331
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:30,400
it was based on a mole lizard type of character, but I know I never wanted to actually animate like that on land.

332
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,301
And I had no idea what to do with him either.

333
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:36,204
So we just started to work on the underground movement and actually the submerged type of movement,

334
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:40,226
which is all based on worms, but I still had no idea what to do with him on land.

335
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:40,446
And then...

336
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:45,135
As soon as we had to make all those animations, I was actually walking around the studio and

337
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:49,645
I'm not kidding, like somebody was actually watching a nature documentary on their screen

338
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,809
of these two sea lions fighting each other and

339
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,501
The thing that I liked about it is how heavy they look,

340
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:57,983
but they're actually still pretty agile

341
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,564
and there was so much power behind it.

342
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,006
So I figured, okay, let me just do a test animation with it

343
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:03,427
because it's still reminding me a little bit

344
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:04,208
of that rock breaker.

345
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,491
So I made this test animation and showed it to our art director

346
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:08,652
to say, hey, what do you think about this?

347
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,333
And then he loved the idea.

348
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,735
So the entire ground movement was based on sea lions

349
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:13,356
from that point on.

350
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,787
So for the Frost Claw on the Frozen Wilds,

351
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,949
I mean this thing was clearly designed with a bear in mind.

352
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:25,232
And it was really nice to actually have that posture

353
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:26,753
change going from walking on fours

354
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,655
to going on a bipedal stance.

355
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,676
So we started to look for a lot of footage of bears

356
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,639
and we made a bunch of claw swipes and a bunch of roars.

357
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,981
But it was all, to me, it was all very predictable

358
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,702
and it never had that one characteristic

359
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,384
that started to make this machine feel unique,

360
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,385
in my opinion, so.

361
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,206
I started to think, okay, what else can we actually do with him, right?

362
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:47,427
And then I remembered my girlfriend having this huge weak spot for red pandas.

363
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,868
And I thought, okay, those could be interesting, right?

364
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,468
Let me just start looking for footage.

365
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:57,390
And I found this piece of footage, where they're basically just doing these really cool rolls.

366
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,451
And it's also something that you don't really expect out of the frost claw.

367
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:05,472
So I figured, okay, they're basically like regular pandas, but they're so feisty.

368
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,779
They actually can be really angry towards each other.

369
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,600
So I really liked it.

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,882
So I just tested out some of those rolls on the Frost Claw.

371
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:15,084
And that's actually the moment when I started

372
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:16,005
to click with the Skerritt.

373
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:19,008
And I thought that this was the stuff that I really

374
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:19,668
wanted out of this thing.

375
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,289
Of course, I had to put a lot more weight on it.

376
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,971
But that rolling thing was that one thing

377
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,634
that actually made him stand out from the rest of the machines

378
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:28,435
that we had done up until that point.

379
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,527
And then the last example is on the long leg, which is a

380
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,708
recon class that actually uses echolocation to

381
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:35,468
scout for threats.

382
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:38,709
And in the design document, there was this attack that

383
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,730
said that it needed to do a scratch attack.

384
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,031
And whenever I looked at this thing, it always reminded me

385
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:43,971
of a very big chicken.

386
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,752
So just for fun, I typed in chicken scratch in YouTube,

387
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:49,973
and I found this really cool piece of footage.

388
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,495
They're so angry at that lady.

389
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,699
So I just straight copied it over to Doortoon to make this animation.

390
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,783
I didn't even try to make something else out of it.

391
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,505
So before we actually started the machine,

392
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,085
we really tried to define what the main characteristics

393
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:11,865
of a machine would be.

394
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:14,026
And we just took a couple of words per machine

395
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:15,586
to describe the overall behavior

396
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:16,607
and personality of these things.

397
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,487
And here's just a bunch of examples

398
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:19,808
where we tried to distinguish them

399
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,288
as much as possible from each other.

400
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:22,288
So if you look at the watcher,

401
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:26,129
he was supposed to be aware, always curious,

402
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,030
but also very calculated.

403
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,111
And then the shell walker, who's like this cargo...

404
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:36,753
crap type of thing that's super protective of its cargo on its back.

405
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:40,794
We just wanted him to be very grumpy and obsessed about that whole thing on his back.

406
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:46,277
And then the stalker was supposed to be like this angry guy that's always into combat.

407
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:49,958
So it was just like describing them with a couple of words so everybody knew which direction we

408
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:54,560
needed to go. And as soon as we had a nice overview of what all these machines needed to be,

409
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,641
the next thing that we actually did was...

410
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,025
make personality videos which we call movie mood like sort of mood board videos and

411
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:05,588
This is not so like straight-up reference for the animations

412
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:08,650
It's more to actually communicate what the characteristics of the machines

413
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,374
were going to be and to get an overall feel of the character going and

414
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:17,718
It's basically just whipping something up really fast without spending weeks of animation time on their first

415
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:21,922
And it was just a simple way of communicating the ID without just words or pictures

416
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:25,985
So everybody's like got a very clear view of what this thing was going to be

417
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:33,625
So finally, now that everybody had a good idea of what the

418
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:36,125
machine would look and feel like, instead of just going in

419
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,066
and animating all the individual cycles and

420
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,107
animation sets, we started with something which we call

421
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,127
the personality test.

422
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,768
And that was just to see if we can actually capture the

423
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,109
personality and the behavior that you just saw in the

424
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,670
previous slides, but then see if we can actually make a test

425
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,590
animation out of it.

426
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,011
And what you need to look at it is like concept art, but

427
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:54,671
then in motion.

428
00:22:57,172 --> 00:23:00,415
just to come up with a short scenario and put all the characteristics in there.

429
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,117
And it shouldn't take you more than one to four days to actually make these things.

430
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:06,600
And it had so many advantages looking back in retrospect.

431
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,422
And of course, you can actually see.

432
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:13,140
if we could actually communicate the personalities

433
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,161
that we wanted out of these things.

434
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,082
But we also found that it was a lot easier

435
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,803
to actually find your base poses this way.

436
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,205
Instead of forcing yourself to go in and out

437
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,225
of a base pose all the time,

438
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:22,846
these things were already working in motion.

439
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:25,348
So we just started to search for the poses

440
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:26,489
within the movement that time.

441
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:28,730
And it was also really nice to actually tackle

442
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,971
some of the challenges and design limitations up front.

443
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,914
Here's my first initial test that I did with the watcher.

444
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,116
And to me, it still holds all the characteristics

445
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:37,616
of the watcher.

446
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:38,377
I mean, it's alert.

447
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,798
It's super aware of its surroundings.

448
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:40,699
It's very curious.

449
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,681
And I just tried to get some of the group behavior in there.

450
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,503
We're just posing a bunch of those guys around them.

451
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:46,684
But you don't need to move them.

452
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:49,546
But it instantly gives the feeling of, OK,

453
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:51,287
these guys were close in groups.

454
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,290
And let's see if I can actually play it again.

455
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,190
It's not looping.

456
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,727
But then the good thing is if you actually break it down,

457
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:02,927
there's actually, like everything is in there.

458
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:04,427
You have start animation, you have a cycle,

459
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,008
you have some of the gestures going on,

460
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:06,868
you have a run cycle.

461
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:09,148
So what I did, I actually just chopped this up

462
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:10,889
and put it into game and started working from there.

463
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:14,429
Another example is with the grazer,

464
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:15,730
and that was just more to actually get

465
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,970
a skittish, nervous behavior out of this thing

466
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,530
that we wanted.

467
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,151
And again, just threw in a couple of extra machines

468
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,531
around him to get that group behavior.

469
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,208
That was basically it.

470
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:28,250
And I was very lucky that the effects had nothing to do at

471
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,273
that point, so they made this nice composition for me with

472
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,255
a real-life background.

473
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,217
So that helped.

474
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:35,858
Last example is on the stalker.

475
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:37,821
And this was actually to capture that agile and fast

476
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:38,621
nature on that thing.

477
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:40,524
And again, everything is just in this.

478
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,546
So there's a cycle, there's transitions.

479
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,107
And this thing is actually a get up already.

480
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:44,748
There's an attack.

481
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,013
Just chop it up, put it in game, and you'll be surprised how good that works.

482
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:55,237
The thing that I really want to emphasize is that it's basically just concept art but in motion.

483
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:57,859
And it's really something that we try to do a lot.

484
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,922
For testing and design, so game design really wanted this sort of like crocodile type of machine

485
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:10,924
and our art director was super skeptical about that and he had really big doubts about having that long of a body

486
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:14,866
that close to our very sort of like crazy terrain that we had

487
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:19,307
and also in terms of combat he was not convinced that this thing was going to be fast enough to compensate

488
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:24,349
for Aloy just running around him all the time without having those weird AI adjustments going on.

489
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,570
I just started to search, and I really wanted to help the game designers out because I actually

490
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,571
really wanted the alligator in there as well.

491
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:35,272
I just started to search for how these things actually hold them up in nature when they're

492
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:35,992
being attacked.

493
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:39,473
They basically just use their tail a lot to whip themselves around, but if they're being

494
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:43,494
attacked from the back like that, they actually just whip themselves over with their tail

495
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:47,375
and then figure, okay, that's actually a really good 180 attack when Aloy is standing behind

496
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:47,655
him.

497
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:50,355
With this video in mind, we did a little bit more.

498
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:56,104
of an effort on this thing just because we needed to sell the idea so we just made a walk cycle

499
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:58,385
We actually made a swimming cycle as well

500
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:03,668
And then we also sort of like whipped out this little scenario of what it would feel like if a lawyer was being hunted by

501
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:04,629
These things in water

502
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,491
Is he gonna get her new

503
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:15,313
And then I actually just straight up copied over that move that you just saw on the video.

504
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:18,774
And showed this to our art director and at that point he was like, okay, this might actually

505
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,394
work, let's just go for it.

506
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,855
And it worked out in the end, which I'm really glad about, because this is still my favorite

507
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:24,935
machine in the game.

508
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:29,196
And sometimes we also take this personality test just a little bit too far.

509
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:37,777
I wanted to have this in game, but the game designers really didn't want that, so unfortunately.

510
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:44,227
So now that we actually have a good idea of what these

511
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:46,169
characters are and what we can actually do with them,

512
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,371
it's actually time to start animating these things.

513
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:49,993
And how do we animate these things, right?

514
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:52,776
When I actually started on Horizon, I just started to

515
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,458
break it down into very simple shapes.

516
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:58,062
And the biggest difference for me between the two things is

517
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,605
a human is basically this vertical capsule.

518
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:04,470
where there's no lead or follow in the body.

519
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,692
It's just running around like this all the time.

520
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,093
And a robot, you can actually break it up into three sectors.

521
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:11,134
So you have that rear end, the body itself,

522
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:12,675
and the head leading the motion.

523
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:15,757
So if just simplified, it actually looks like this.

524
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:19,480
So if you're actually going to make these things move,

525
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,941
what do you need to navigate?

526
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,002
Of course, you need a zero walk.

527
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:24,543
Damn, nothing's looping.

528
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,163
Of course, a zero walk cycle, but to get that change of path.

529
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:37,867
Sorry about this guy.

530
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:44,372
It's not playing.

531
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:50,985
Okay, I can just tell you it walks around a corner like that.

532
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,807
So you basically need that 90 degree change within one cycle.

533
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:58,471
And when we put that in, it wasn't actually enough for AI to start navigating these things

534
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,151
in the world.

535
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:03,575
As well as mounted action, we basically just needed a tighter curvature for cornering.

536
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:05,436
We animated this.

537
00:28:05,776 --> 00:28:06,536
Yes, this one works.

538
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:08,376
So we animated this 180 degree cycle.

539
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,197
So basically, he's just turning 180 degrees from itself

540
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:12,077
within one cycle.

541
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:13,858
And if you have those five cycles,

542
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:16,759
you'll be able to move your character around freely

543
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:18,059
for just one speed.

544
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,660
So of course, you need to make multiple speeds

545
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,900
for these things and start and stop.

546
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,560
So it's not just like, then it's done.

547
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,661
But I just wanted to point that out really quickly.

548
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,022
And it kind of looks weird when you look at it

549
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,262
from a top perspective.

550
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:32,943
Oh, come on, nothing is playing anymore.

551
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:35,746
And go.

552
00:28:37,988 --> 00:28:38,489
No, no.

553
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:39,590
Everything is good.

554
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,291
Everything is good.

555
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:48,439
OK, so let's get everything up and running again.

556
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:58,332
So, left corner of course a zero cycle. The 90 degree cycle is basically back at its original position again in four cycles,

557
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,855
and the 181 is basically back at its original position again in two cycles.

558
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:07,479
And as long as you keep your foot planting and your body rhythm consistent, you're perfect for blending.

559
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:13,683
And the way we actually calculated the trajectories, if your distance for one cycle is value x,

560
00:29:14,764 --> 00:29:16,045
the 91 is basically just...

561
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:20,468
take x and divide it by half and then go the same amount to the left or right and that's

562
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,849
your end position for your 91.

563
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:26,332
And then for the 181, divide x by 4 and double that trajectory.

564
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:31,595
And we just basically just drew NURB curves on the ground as guidelines and made sure

565
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,357
that we followed the trajectory exactly.

566
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,840
so that AI can actually start calculating with these values as well.

567
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,444
And to really get that nice and fluid motion and really feel that change of direction,

568
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:44,226
you really need to push the poses as much as possible.

569
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:49,271
So if this is your zero cycle, you really need to lean into that 91 and then even further

570
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:49,511
in your 181.

571
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:51,172
And if you do that, then...

572
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,171
this is your end result.

573
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,472
As you can see that I captured that in our test environment.

574
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,594
And what you want is that the player actually feels that change of direction

575
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,995
and how the head is actually leading the motion and the rest of the body is sort

576
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,616
of like following into that lean.

577
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,157
Since this is all player control,

578
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:10,318
we also needed to

579
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:16,544
needed to get things right from an AI driven character as well and we were very lucky that

580
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:20,025
they were fully invested into getting this thing right from their side as well.

581
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:25,127
And they basically had to rewrite a completely new AI mover that was driving these machines

582
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,888
exactly the way as you see here where they would just make use of the full range of navigational

583
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,449
animations that we provided for them.

584
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,754
So the basic logic behind the AI mover is that if you change

585
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:41,435
your path of direction, your forward velocity decreases

586
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,516
while your sideways velocity increases.

587
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:46,177
And here it's just giving a lot of commands to go to new

588
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:49,538
spots, and because of that logic, it almost looks like

589
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:50,859
the system is animation driven.

590
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,680
And at the same time, it uses the full range of motion

591
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,360
provided by the animators.

592
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,721
And this way, you would get actually minimal foot sliding

593
00:30:58,761 --> 00:30:59,382
as they're cornering.

594
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,342
And if you want to have.

595
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:05,547
More info on this, Julian Bertling is doing his talk right now in the next room.

596
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,209
And he's covering this topic like quite in depth.

597
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,730
So go check it out in the vault.

598
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,973
It's really interesting and it's really something cool that he whipped up.

599
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,117
And here you can actually see the same system working on higher speeds where the marks become

600
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,279
a little bit more visible because of that bigger radius.

601
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,782
And I'll explain what they mean in a more close-up look.

602
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:27,945
So when AI is actually giving the command for a new direction, the inner circle is basically the tightest radius that it can handle.

603
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,566
So that's that 180 degree cycle.

604
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:34,828
And then the outer circle checks if the space is actually available for the machine to move.

605
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:42,112
And it's also actually calculating the transition from going from that outer circle to the tightest circle with the logic that I just described,

606
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:46,134
where forward and sideways velocity increase and decreases.

607
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:49,716
And the green line itself is basically the actual path that it's taking.

608
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:52,117
Again, check out Julian Berdling's stuff.

609
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:56,453
So our animations for the machines are all done in Maya.

610
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,673
And to create our animation networks, we use Natural

611
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:00,594
Motion's Morpheme.

612
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:03,194
And it's something that the animators actually take care

613
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,135
of themselves in-house.

614
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:07,155
And it had a lot of possibilities to make these

615
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:09,656
robots way more believable with all the features and tech

616
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:10,296
that it provided.

617
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,837
And I'll talk you through some of the setups that we made for

618
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,157
the features that we wanted to implement.

619
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,358
And one of the examples we had to deal with was actually that

620
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,258
long and narrow body that I was talking about with the

621
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:19,758
SnapMaw.

622
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,302
Here's actually the example of the SnapMod from the top,

623
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,122
the way we started it.

624
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:27,563
And as you can see, it has a lot of like flapping

625
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:28,643
in the tail and the body.

626
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,723
And this just looked ugly to me.

627
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,584
It makes the machines feel way lighter and less believable.

628
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,725
So we had to come up with a solution to counter this.

629
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:40,386
The way we actually did it was to have feather blends.

630
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,427
And feather blends basically sort of like describe,

631
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,548
okay, you can actually just take a bunch of bones

632
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:45,768
and it will only influence those.

633
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:48,569
And so we just split it up into three sections.

634
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:50,629
So if you change the direction,

635
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:51,610
the head.

636
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,090
and the neck actually play instantly,

637
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,131
and then the body is delayed by a certain percent,

638
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:55,851
and in this case, actually,

639
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:57,912
you have six frames behind the original animation,

640
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,513
and then the tail is actually following even later,

641
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:01,894
so in this case, it's 12 frames

642
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:03,174
behind the original animation,

643
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,375
and it causes for a little bit of foot sliding

644
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:07,076
as soon as you go into a new direction,

645
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:08,896
but it's actually catching up really fast,

646
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,017
so you don't notice it in game,

647
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:12,058
and especially with our higher grass and stuff like that,

648
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,038
you don't really see it,

649
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,959
but as you can see, it actually feels and plays a lot nicer,

650
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,140
and there's way more weight to this,

651
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,000
so we were actually really, really happy with this setup.

652
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:23,609
The second example is actually getting rid of the random

653
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:26,994
cycle feel that you don't want out of a character.

654
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,577
And it started to become really obvious to us with the

655
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:31,599
machines once we were actually writing these writers.

656
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:35,084
Whenever you were just sort of behind it, you could just see

657
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:35,865
that it was a cycle.

658
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,026
And instead of actually

659
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,568
Using physics, we felt that we would have more control

660
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,069
over the whole setup if we actually

661
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,089
create a bunch of extra cycles and have Morpheme

662
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:48,010
sort of like in a randomizing setup play the animation.

663
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,451
So if you look at this thing, the middle one

664
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,871
is basically your vanilla straightforward cycle.

665
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,392
And then I made two variations on the left and the right

666
00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:57,192
where the body's sort of like tilting sideways.

667
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:00,153
But also the legs actually go underneath him

668
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:01,313
from left to right as well.

669
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:04,894
And with these three animations, we plug those into Morpheme.

670
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,820
As you can see there right there in red highlight,

671
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,621
that they're plugged into this blend node.

672
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:13,503
And we have this random node that actually

673
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:15,705
gives a value randomly.

674
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:18,667
And in this case, we set it to 1.2 and minus 1.2,

675
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:21,088
and it changes every 1.5 seconds.

676
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:25,011
And that number gets smoothed out through this smooth node.

677
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,972
And that's sort of like actually what's

678
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:28,313
driving this blend node.

679
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,090
And it's actually constantly being updated.

680
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,691
So that's actually determining how much of the game

681
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:36,752
of animation are being played in.

682
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:38,453
Here you can see the whole setup in action.

683
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:40,073
And as you can see, the blend node

684
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:41,334
is constantly changing the value

685
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,094
because of the two nodes in front of it mixing

686
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:44,315
all the animation together.

687
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,176
And this is basically just enough to make it feel

688
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:49,577
like a believable character.

689
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,378
And instead of looking at this random cycle all the time.

690
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,579
And you can just see a little bit of the foot

691
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,340
like going in and out underneath him right there,

692
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,100
for example.

693
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,181
And again, it's really nice.

694
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:06,649
So, uneven terrain, I mean, of course we knew we were going to have this really crazy terrain

695
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:10,635
that we had to deal with, and my plan was always to create slope up and slope down animations.

696
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:15,466
Since our schedule was so tight and we had to animate 25 robots,

697
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,667
there was just no way that we could actually make those anymore.

698
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:22,309
The uneven terrain nodes that are available straight out of Morphine

699
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:24,049
worked way better than expected.

700
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:26,030
It took some extra corners for us to get there,

701
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,071
but once we had the way we wanted it, it had really nice results.

702
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:33,372
To me, the only downside is that we're actually missing friction.

703
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,873
So when you're running up and down a hill,

704
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,053
you want to feel that friction and it's not in there,

705
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,994
but it's just one of those trade-offs that you have to make

706
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:40,635
when you make a game this big.

707
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:43,482
This is the setup in a nutshell.

708
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,744
And without going too in-depth in all the operator

709
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:49,326
calculations, the colored skeleton that you're going to

710
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,067
see is the original animation right there.

711
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:55,109
And then the white skeleton is basically the end result with

712
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:55,989
the terrain prediction on.

713
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:58,010
And as you can see, you can actually solve some really

714
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,731
extreme angles.

715
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:02,293
And what happens is that we get the slope and lateral

716
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:05,274
angle from four ray spheres that we have in our physics

717
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:08,456
rig, and it's basically on front, on the back, and then

718
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:09,156
two on the sides.

719
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,398
those values actually drive the hip IK and the chest IK.

720
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,959
And these come actually standard in Morphium,

721
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:17,840
so that was really nice.

722
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,921
But besides actually just adjusting the height

723
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,602
to the terrain, we also counter the body

724
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:22,483
to the terrain angle.

725
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:24,204
So if you're standing against the hill,

726
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:27,566
like in this example, your body basically gets pushed forward

727
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,367
to readjust for the center of gravity

728
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:30,528
and vice versa as well.

729
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:31,488
When you're standing downhill,

730
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:34,290
you wanna be able to transfer your body backwards.

731
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:37,907
And then for the feet itself, we used the terrain prediction

732
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:40,669
setup, and these are basically just four raycasts being used

733
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,630
from under the ball of the feet, and they just snap the

734
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,330
feet to the ground.

735
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:49,234
The only thing is, what we ran into, is that the terrain

736
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,616
prediction is basically a two-bone IK solver, and more

737
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,298
of them is just made for humans and not for creatures.

738
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,121
So we just had to get this three-bone IK solver,

739
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,662
especially for the back legs, because they have a

740
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:02,243
different setup.

741
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,004
So we came up with this.

742
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:09,226
in a two-way, so we put helper joints in our rigs,

743
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:12,207
and next to that, our tools department actually wrote

744
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:13,888
something that we call an end node.

745
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,529
And it's all based around the following theory.

746
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,849
If you look at the back legs of a quadruped,

747
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,810
basically the femur and the metatarsal

748
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,411
stay close or parallel to each other.

749
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:24,571
And it's basically like a folding chair

750
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:25,792
going in and out all the time.

751
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,915
It's both in stretched and in squashed position.

752
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:33,098
So with that in mind, we created these helper joints

753
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,800
in the back leg, which you can actually see highlighted

754
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,660
in green in the movie.

755
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,183
And the idea behind the helper joints was to actually

756
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,085
create a two-bone IK solver that supports

757
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,026
the three-bone setup.

758
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:45,090
And the length of that first helper joint

759
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,551
is basically A and C combined.

760
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:50,231
and that actually always stays parallel to joint C.

761
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:52,913
So that actually helped us to determine

762
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,715
what the maximum stretch of this thing was gonna be.

763
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,696
And next to that, like I said,

764
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:59,438
our tools department actually wrote an end node in Morpheme

765
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:02,361
and what the end node did was try to keep the same angle

766
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:03,722
between the joints all the time.

767
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:05,743
So it doesn't really matter if you have three joints

768
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,104
or like 10 joints or 15 joints,

769
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:09,967
it always tries to keep the same angle on every joint.

770
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,708
Which is based on that theory, like I said, with the folding

771
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:12,948
chair.

772
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,028
So if you have those two combined, we were actually

773
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:17,569
able to snap the feet to the terrain.

774
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:20,470
And it actually was holding itself pretty well without

775
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,750
just going nuts all over the place with these weird angles

776
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,591
in the knees and in the ankles and stuff like that.

777
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,132
And the last example that I want to show is how we had to

778
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:31,233
work with longer necks when dealing with our look at

779
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,613
targets that were being set by AI.

780
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:36,314
And basically,

781
00:38:37,563 --> 00:38:38,603
This wasn't really working out.

782
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:41,164
So we first made everything animation driven and it was

783
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:42,525
causing for a lot of problems.

784
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:45,806
So normally when you actually, for example, make a turn on

785
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:49,408
spot is you want the head to actually lead the action and

786
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:51,208
show the intention of the machine.

787
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,569
But since our look at target is being set from the

788
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,970
direction where the root point is pointing, which is that

789
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,452
yellow arrow that you see in the top view, you can see that

790
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:02,373
the head is already far more rotated from the position where

791
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:03,253
the root bone is.

792
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:05,374
So we ended up with getting these double calculated

793
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:07,155
rotation on the neck, as you can see in here.

794
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,190
And it's always off, and sometimes it actually turned

795
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,191
inside of its own body.

796
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,591
So this wasn't really working out for us.

797
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:16,771
And then the solution that we actually tried after this was

798
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:19,492
to have a fully overridden IK system.

799
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:23,013
But that basically ended up with losing all

800
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:23,853
the data on the neck.

801
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:26,214
So we had a really nice animated body, and then the

802
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:27,434
neck was just completely static.

803
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:28,694
So that wasn't really working out either.

804
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,295
And eventually we came up with the solution of adding

805
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:32,915
additive rotations on the joints to

806
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,155
replace our IK system.

807
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:37,256
So we basically still animate our robots like you saw in the

808
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:37,896
first example.

809
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,077
But then once we were done with an animation,

810
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:43,178
we just basically just took out all the Z rotations

811
00:39:43,218 --> 00:39:44,959
on the neck, so it looks really weird like this,

812
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,120
but you basically just end up with up and down

813
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:49,441
and tilt animations on your neck,

814
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,502
and AI programmed it in such a way

815
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,823
that the target is actually being set

816
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:53,983
before they play an action.

817
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:55,904
So the head is still leading the motion,

818
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:57,344
the only thing is that it's AI driven

819
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:58,505
instead of animation driven.

820
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:03,986
And if we actually needed a full control over the head

821
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:07,348
and the neck, we had this thing in our markup files

822
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:09,769
where we could actually disable the head IK system.

823
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,231
That way we can actually blend in and out of the head IK.

824
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:15,312
And then you basically just end up with this result.

825
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:19,694
And it's basically just AI setting the targets.

826
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:22,478
And we also took out the neck rotation

827
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:25,462
on all these 90 degrees and 180 degree cycles.

828
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:28,346
So we could actually really keep that focus on alloy

829
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:29,688
as they're sort of like swaving around

830
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,671
to really get that predatory feel in the machines.

831
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,242
And here's a quick overview of the setup in Morpheme.

832
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:37,243
So again, the colored skeleton is basically

833
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:39,184
your original animation, and then the white skeleton

834
00:40:39,224 --> 00:40:41,325
is the result after the target is being set.

835
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,806
And as you can see, we're not just affecting the neck,

836
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:46,588
but also the chest and the spine to some degree,

837
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:49,369
so you have that really nice lean into the motion

838
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:50,370
when they're looking left and right.

839
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:55,580
So once we had all our animation blocked out,

840
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,442
and all this tech was up and running,

841
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,104
we could start our polish pass in the beta period.

842
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,927
And because the game had such a long track,

843
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,049
we knew a lot of balancing and tweaking

844
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,070
needed to happen near the end of the project.

845
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,193
So what we did, we just blocked in the attack super rough,

846
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,295
and made sure that all the movement and gestures

847
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,517
and the hit reactions were already pretty much done

848
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:16,639
by the time we actually hit alpha.

849
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,641
So at that point, we could have basically

850
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:22,424
focus our beta phase only worrying about

851
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,346
polishing these attacks and making sure that this was

852
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:27,307
happening while the tweaking and the balancing of the game

853
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:28,168
is happening as well.

854
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:33,132
So the goal of the attacks, of course, like with any game,

855
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:35,373
is make it look clear and readable from any angle.

856
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:38,176
But we really started to look at it from a front perspective.

857
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:41,927
since 85 to 90% of our attacks are being played

858
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,628
from a front perspective, so we really wanted to get

859
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,709
that asymmetry and opening up the body

860
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:46,589
from that perspective.

861
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,931
So here's an example of the earliest bite swipe

862
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:52,653
of the Ravager, and it's not the prettiest animation,

863
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,334
but it works for game design.

864
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:56,595
It basically has the anticipation that they want,

865
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,296
the forward movement and distance,

866
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,077
and also the timing for the settle.

867
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,218
But if you look at it from a front perspective,

868
00:42:02,238 --> 00:42:04,179
there's basically no sense of forward motion

869
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,080
in this thing whatsoever.

870
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,644
It all looks very boring and symmetrical as well.

871
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,789
And the thing that I hated the most about this thing

872
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,692
is that you're actually losing the weight

873
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,534
in that jump forward.

874
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:14,238
It just gets transferred so quickly.

875
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,422
So when we started polishing, it became like this.

876
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:20,123
So I open up the character in sideways

877
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,404
to make the body a lot more readable,

878
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,185
but then I put in a moving anticipation

879
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,926
instead of like that holding anticipation,

880
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,227
so we're closing the gap already.

881
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,788
So we can actually add a lot more weight into the jump

882
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:32,210
since we don't have to cover that much ground anymore.

883
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,891
We really started to look at clear lines of actions,

884
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:36,432
so in this case it's very clear

885
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,873
from screen right to screen left,

886
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:40,455
and in the end just add some characteristics

887
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,295
with a little head shake

888
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:43,597
and then you have your polished version.

889
00:42:43,997 --> 00:42:44,998
Again, open up the machine.

890
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:50,874
close in and then have that really nice clear line of action and then a nice way to jump in there.

891
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:04,253
So yeah, like I said, very clear from every angle now.

892
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:07,553
The beak set for the long leg, same trick, right?

893
00:43:07,573 --> 00:43:08,914
It's super boring to look at,

894
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,274
but it does the trick for game design

895
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:11,994
to start testing out the combat.

896
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:14,695
And it was also very easy for us to just adjust this

897
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:17,576
within a couple of minutes and then put it back in game again

898
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:19,276
so that they were happy with all the timings

899
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:20,716
and distances and stuff like that.

900
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:22,757
But once we start polishing it,

901
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:25,157
I open up the character again from the start

902
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:26,077
for a better silhouette,

903
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,278
and then follow up with that nice clean line of action

904
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,758
going from screen right to screen left.

905
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:33,642
If you look at it from slow motion,

906
00:43:33,702 --> 00:43:34,843
open up the character, close in,

907
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,565
really present what you're gonna attack with,

908
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:39,508
and then strong line of action to finish the job,

909
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,250
and nice weighty jump again.

910
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:43,793
And then this is the end resulting game.

911
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,797
And as you can see, I really emphasized

912
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,999
that motion going upwards.

913
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:52,279
And then to keep the same angle that he's going in,

914
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,981
just because the player actually might miss the attack

915
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:57,122
since they're dodging or there's so much effects

916
00:43:57,182 --> 00:43:59,623
or rake as being projected on the screen

917
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:00,484
that they might miss it.

918
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,345
So as long as you keep that swiping motion upwards,

919
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:04,966
the player still registers what's going on.

920
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:07,528
And then the last example,

921
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:10,289
for the tail swipe on the snap mod,

922
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:12,110
this was actually a lot clearer from the start already,

923
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,371
when I look back at it,

924
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:15,492
but I really wanted to push that swiping motion

925
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:16,753
in terms of that tail being whipped.

926
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:20,455
So this is what it ended up with.

927
00:44:20,495 --> 00:44:21,916
And as you can see, the tail's already coming up

928
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:22,917
from a front perspective,

929
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:24,518
so the player gets to see what's coming.

930
00:44:24,598 --> 00:44:28,420
And then I open up that character completely right there

931
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,881
before he actually slams down again.

932
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,542
And the biggest difference,

933
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:34,783
that game design actually wanted this thing to face forward

934
00:44:34,903 --> 00:44:37,205
instead of with his back towards Aloy again,

935
00:44:37,225 --> 00:44:38,725
so we added that turn in as well in the end.

936
00:44:40,106 --> 00:44:40,386
So again.

937
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,300
clearly present the tail, strong poses,

938
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,682
and then finish off with a strong line of action

939
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:48,963
so that it's always clear what's happening

940
00:44:48,983 --> 00:44:51,825
towards the player in that turn.

941
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,627
And then this is your end result in game.

942
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:57,029
And even like effects is actually emphasizing these attacks

943
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,510
with all the motion trails going on.

944
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,092
So even though there's so much noise going on,

945
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:03,374
hopefully the player just always registers

946
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:06,416
what's being attacked with and what the attack actually is.

947
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:11,070
Basically 80% of the polish was spent on this.

948
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,371
So we just went through every attack for every machine

949
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:15,412
and then just really started to break it down.

950
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,133
Okay, what is it that we wanna make clear?

951
00:45:18,393 --> 00:45:19,553
Start looking from the front angle

952
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:21,594
and then really start polishing things up from there.

953
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:25,155
Also, since there was so much balancing going on,

954
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:27,436
this is where you can actually really start playing around

955
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:29,177
with your animation.

956
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:30,917
And we just broke it up into three sections, so

957
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,178
anticipation, attack, and settle, of course.

958
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,839
And that's where you can really start playing with your

959
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,099
timing and spacing.

960
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,500
And basically, the remaining 20% was spent on whatever

961
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,541
looked out of place or whatever wasn't up to standard.

962
00:45:43,581 --> 00:45:45,142
And to give you just one example of that.

963
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,786
One of the issues we actually ran into was that the machines

964
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:54,329
were way too overactive and that the movement was actually

965
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:55,109
too big as well.

966
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,334
So the hardest part about that was that the weak spots

967
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,316
almost became impossible to shoot for the player.

968
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:05,881
So both AI and animation had to tone it down very

969
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:06,341
drastically.

970
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,143
And even if we were pretty happy with the movement

971
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:09,644
sometimes, it was a bit of a pain.

972
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:13,387
If the player has a bad time, you're basically just screwing up as an animator and developer.

973
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:15,089
So you have to really take care of that.

974
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:18,311
And it was really obvious in The Corrupter, so I show you that.

975
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:21,514
And this was actually the initial walk cycle.

976
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,677
And since I knew this was going to be one of those ancient war class type of machines,

977
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:29,280
I wanted to get something else out of him than that realistic animal type of feeling.

978
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,703
So to me... Oh, let's see if I can actually play it again.

979
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:35,726
You...

980
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:39,128
Just go back and forth.

981
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,467
Okay, doesn't matter.

982
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,128
But the hardest part for me,

983
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:51,809
like with the big up and down,

984
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:53,691
was it became impossible to actually shoot

985
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,091
that drum barrel on top of its head.

986
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:57,493
So as soon as I sort of like implemented this into the game,

987
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,374
like within half an hour of the game,

988
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:00,535
the director stood next to my desk

989
00:47:00,575 --> 00:47:02,056
and said that I had to take it out instantly

990
00:47:02,096 --> 00:47:03,016
because he hated that thing.

991
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:04,657
As soon as he was aiming at the drum barrel,

992
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:08,059
the corruptor would stop and then would just pop up again

993
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,360
and then he would just shoot into nothing.

994
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,141
So we had to tone it down drastically

995
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:13,162
and then let's see if it actually plays.

996
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:25,306
I'm just going to see if I can end slide show and then move it up again.

997
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:39,667
So this is what we ended up with and it still has some of that up and down motion in there

998
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:41,689
but we completely took it out almost.

999
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,134
The only way that we could counter this is with actually rotating the body forward to

1000
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:50,399
still have some of that motion in there but if you look at the drum bearing and you're

1001
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,221
aiming at it, it's always going to stay inside.

1002
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:56,314
Yeah, he was way happier with this one than the previous one.

1003
00:47:57,014 --> 00:48:00,716
So we just went through all the cycles as well and made sure that the weak spots

1004
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:04,338
were always still pretty clear to hit from a player perspective as well.

1005
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:06,700
So some of the takeaways.

1006
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:12,943
First and foremost, like you saw with that LEGO Thunderjaw, you don't really need anything fancy to prove your gameplay.

1007
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:21,636
It's something that we hadn't done much up until this point, but it helped us a lot focusing on the gameplay first before we started to make things look nicer.

1008
00:48:21,937 --> 00:48:23,279
And that really helped us out in the end.

1009
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,162
The second is to really do your research and really go into things with an open mind.

1010
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:33,225
It really helps shape the character a lot more creative, but it actually makes the character

1011
00:48:33,265 --> 00:48:34,346
also a lot more believable.

1012
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:39,029
And the thing that actually really helped us out the most was if we actually took some

1013
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,250
time out to test our characters.

1014
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:48,413
So I'd really advise everybody to take two or three weeks out of your schedule and start making those personality tests and start making those mood board videos.

1015
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:57,858
So you have a really clear plan in mind before you actually start animating these things and you're basically just finding your character as you're going through it because that wasn't really working out for us in the end.

1016
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:06,422
And last but not least, all the details and all the polish that we put in, it really matters. It really makes a difference and adds immersion for the player.

1017
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:11,121
That was it. Sorry for all those crashes, guys. I have no idea what was going on.

1018
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:25,034
I made it in time, right?

1019
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:34,162
Do we actually have a Q&A question thing right now? Anybody has any questions?

1020
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:38,465
Oh, there's mics in the middle.

1021
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:39,866
Barely.

1022
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:40,807
Yes, in there.

1023
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:42,529
Hi.

1024
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:43,029
Hi there.

1025
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,871
Hi.

1026
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:47,834
So when you showed the production,

1027
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,077
towards the beginning you showed the production sort of cycle

1028
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:52,559
of the design and then animators and the feedback.

1029
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,842
Is that something that you kind of found in retrospect

1030
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:56,603
that that's how it worked?

1031
00:49:56,643 --> 00:49:57,464
Or that was the plan?

1032
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:58,445
No, that was actually the plan.

1033
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:04,949
So the first thing that really helped was actually creating

1034
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,711
these things already in ZBrush.

1035
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,033
So for asset art, you know what I mean?

1036
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:12,057
So we actually had our models pretty fast and pretty clearly

1037
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:12,757
already from the start.

1038
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,980
And then that whole track started happening.

1039
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:17,062
And then we just found out.

1040
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:20,445
Like AI can start if we don't have anything.

1041
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:24,247
And it started to evolve naturally from a beginning

1042
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,148
point of view, you know what I mean?

1043
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,289
Because we have to have something animated before they

1044
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:29,091
can actually start implementing things.

1045
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:31,072
So the first ones were a little bit longer.

1046
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:34,634
But once we had three going into production, it just

1047
00:50:34,654 --> 00:50:35,935
happened naturally from there on.

1048
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:37,136
Cool, thank you.

1049
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:41,439
Hey, Richard.

1050
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:41,779
Hey, man.

1051
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:50,776
Real quick, did you guys establish level design standards, like slope extremes, arena sizes,

1052
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:54,878
and if you did, when during development was that established?

1053
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:55,558
Gotcha.

1054
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:57,559
Okay, we didn't.

1055
00:51:02,287 --> 00:51:04,188
It's one of the, okay, so the thing is like,

1056
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,010
and I'm not quite sure, you probably can find this

1057
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,491
on the vault as well, but a lot of the world of Horizon

1058
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:11,192
was actually auto-generated in the beginning,

1059
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:15,414
and we just had to deal with it up until a certain point.

1060
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:17,315
So basically, I think in our nav meshes,

1061
00:51:17,355 --> 00:51:18,776
there's only to a certain degree

1062
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:20,957
that the robots are allowed in it.

1063
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,918
So I think it's like 40% or something like that,

1064
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,619
and then after that, they just stop,

1065
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,380
the nav mesh just stops.

1066
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,581
So we knew we had to deal with,

1067
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:34,925
So we can actually find what the most extreme angle was that we had to deal with, but then, yeah, we had to deal with it.

1068
00:51:34,945 --> 00:51:36,626
There was no way around it.

1069
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:43,690
But for, like, I think from a player perspective, they actually did establish a lot of the angles up front already,

1070
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,831
but for the machines, we just had to deal with it.

1071
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:51,034
Unfortunately. I hope that answers the question. Okay.

1072
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,715
Hi.

1073
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:59,530
Hi, so for the strike teams, were the teams dedicated on like a per monster basis where

1074
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,234
they'd follow it through all the way from start to finish or was it more like an assembly

1075
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:05,957
line where different parts were handed off down the lines of the teams?

1076
00:52:06,678 --> 00:52:10,382
So during the alpha phase it was actually very dedicated.

1077
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:13,925
So two animators were working on one machine for three months and they weren't working

1078
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:15,047
on any of the other machines.

1079
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,373
After Alpha, that polish, everybody was just picking up

1080
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:22,315
whatever was available at that point.

1081
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:25,237
So everybody was working on every machine at every time.

1082
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:27,258
The only thing that we did do was we really started

1083
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,900
to focus on a machine for two to three weeks,

1084
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:32,242
make sure that we went through all the attacks

1085
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,084
and then showed it to our art and animation director

1086
00:52:35,124 --> 00:52:37,506
back then and he just gave feedback.

1087
00:52:37,526 --> 00:52:40,809
And then we just, as a team, did an entire feedback loop

1088
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:42,550
again on the same machine and then we just started

1089
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,011
going on another machine afterwards.

1090
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,914
That way, looking back in retrospect,

1091
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:49,875
it probably would have been nicer

1092
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:51,736
if we switched things around.

1093
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:53,497
On the other hand, it's also very nice

1094
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:56,219
that you just get to focus on one machine

1095
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,360
for three months in a row,

1096
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,701
and you don't have to think about anything else.

1097
00:52:58,961 --> 00:53:01,282
And you really get the feeling of a character

1098
00:53:01,322 --> 00:53:03,304
after the first week or two or something like that,

1099
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:05,125
and then it's just making things nicer

1100
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:06,325
and better from there on.

1101
00:53:07,326 --> 00:53:10,388
I think it actually, there's some pros and cons

1102
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:11,909
towards it, but yeah.

1103
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:12,289
Thank you.

1104
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:13,130
You're welcome.

1105
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:15,363
One more?

1106
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:15,423
Oh.

1107
00:53:16,544 --> 00:53:17,805
There's only two more standing.

1108
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:18,125
Can we?

1109
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:19,286
OK.

1110
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:20,327
Quickly.

1111
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:21,848
Great job on the game, by the way.

1112
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:22,569
Thank you.

1113
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:23,310
Appreciate that.

1114
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,091
I have a question, a little bit more technical I guess.

1115
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:29,374
How did you account for design changes?

1116
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:35,558
Like all the mechanical bits and pieces, I imagine they probably changed throughout each

1117
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:36,339
creature design.

1118
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:37,639
Not really, no.

1119
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,882
That's what that whole mock-up model process was for.

1120
00:53:42,823 --> 00:53:47,146
Funny enough, game design was actually really dictating a lot of these things from the get-go.

1121
00:53:47,526 --> 00:53:48,547
They said, okay, we...

1122
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:53,471
We have this machine in mind, and in that 60-page design

1123
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:55,893
document that I told you about, everything is in there.

1124
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:58,995
So all the weak spots that they wanted needed to be on there,

1125
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,917
all the weapons, et cetera, all the text.

1126
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:04,699
But then as soon as we did those mock-up reviews, those

1127
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,921
were the first things that we really started to look at.

1128
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:10,244
And then as soon as we had that mock-up, we just

1129
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:12,105
exported it to games so they could actually start feeling

1130
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:14,227
what the size of the creature wanted to be as well.

1131
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:15,928
The only thing that actually happened was,

1132
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:20,852
Some of the machines were too small in the beginning and we had to scale those up afterwards.

1133
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:26,857
And that was sort of like a big hassle because you have to completely re-export everything again, etc, etc.

1134
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:30,800
But actually changing the weak spots, those were actually pretty much set from the start.

1135
00:54:33,822 --> 00:54:36,843
Yeah, so and every once in a while we got something.

1136
00:54:36,863 --> 00:54:39,425
Eventually once we had the high res model in there,

1137
00:54:40,385 --> 00:54:43,027
we did change a little bit, but that was more for readability,

1138
00:54:43,227 --> 00:54:44,568
but not in terms of gameplay.

1139
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:48,550
I can't think back towards that.

1140
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:49,871
Thank you.

1141
00:54:50,031 --> 00:54:50,391
You're welcome.

1142
00:54:51,152 --> 00:54:51,452
One more?

1143
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:52,072
Yeah, OK.

1144
00:54:54,376 --> 00:55:00,182
Hi. You were talking about how you use a lot of references, like video references.

1145
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:07,869
How do you decide which part of the crazy emu fighting the kangaroo to use in your animation,

1146
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:14,876
or what part not to? What was your approach to copying or taking pieces from those references?

1147
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:20,473
So that was more sort of like I knew we had to animate something and then I sort of like

1148
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:21,694
started to search for things.

1149
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:23,674
So I spent like with that shooting thing for example.

1150
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:28,896
I knew we wanted to have like a, we needed shooting animation and I just looked more

1151
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:29,657
like a video reference.

1152
00:55:29,937 --> 00:55:32,918
Like the first thing that I actually started to look at more is like okay what's the energy

1153
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:33,638
that's being.

1154
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:38,280
what energy does the character have instead of just going through it like,

1155
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,901
I just got to copy this frame per frame, you know what I mean?

1156
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,362
So as long as I sort of like the energy or what's going on on screen,

1157
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:47,723
I'll just take that as a base first and then just start working from there

1158
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:50,544
and then just test out either with a couple of poses

1159
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:54,386
or just a really quick animation test and then to see if it does work or not

1160
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:56,527
and then just get going from there.

1161
00:55:56,567 --> 00:56:00,308
But most of the time it was very specifically that we started searching for animation,

1162
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,449
for reference per animation basically.

1163
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:05,308
Does that answer a little bit or?

1164
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:15,404
kind of like, how do I say it, the process of looking for a reference, like how did you

1165
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:18,585
translate that reference into your animation?

1166
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:22,306
Like what were the specific, were you looking at the speed, were you looking at...

1167
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:26,387
That's like, that's different on any vid, like any reference, like so sometimes like

1168
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:30,508
I said, like with the chicken thing, I just straight copy that over, so I just went frame

1169
00:56:30,548 --> 00:56:34,449
by frame and then took all the poses and then eventually that's sort of like what I had

1170
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:36,289
as an end result, but sometimes I just look at...

1171
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:41,272
Like I said, like an energy or whatever, or then it's so hard to explain.

1172
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:41,512
Shit.

1173
00:56:41,952 --> 00:56:42,132
Sorry.

1174
00:56:45,094 --> 00:56:46,675
It's just like a case by case thing.

1175
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,355
Like it's not so like always the same.

1176
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,076
You know what I mean?

1177
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:51,577
Is that, I don't think that answers your question.

1178
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:56,100
I have no idea what to say about it to be honest, like how I can explain that.

1179
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:58,314
Sorry.

1180
00:56:58,334 --> 00:56:59,456
It's okay.

1181
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:00,417
I got a girlfriend.

1182
00:57:00,457 --> 00:57:06,645
You just like from every single one of them, you just pick what animation or what energy

1183
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,069
or what movement you want from it and just like...

1184
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:09,629
Yeah.

1185
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:09,710
Yes.

1186
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,390
It was...

1187
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:10,471
It...

1188
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:10,591
Yeah.

1189
00:57:10,611 --> 00:57:10,691
Yeah.

1190
00:57:10,711 --> 00:57:10,791
Yeah.

1191
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:10,891
Yeah.

1192
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:10,991
Yeah.

1193
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:11,091
Yeah.

1194
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:11,953
Yeah.

1195
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:12,093
Yeah.

1196
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:12,213
Yeah.

1197
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:12,313
Yeah.

1198
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:12,413
Yeah.

1199
00:57:12,433 --> 00:57:12,513
Yeah.

1200
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:12,653
Yeah.

1201
00:57:13,394 --> 00:57:14,154
It's so hard to...

1202
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,975
Because sometimes I already know what I want

1203
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:18,495
and then I don't even look for reference

1204
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,636
and then every once in a while I just have no clue

1205
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:22,056
and then I just start looking for videos

1206
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:23,756
and see if I can actually find something cool

1207
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:26,377
and see that, like, oh yeah, I like that a little bit

1208
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:27,818
and then, oh yeah, I like a little bit from that

1209
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:29,138
and then I just take a couple of videos

1210
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:30,898
and start mixing and matching those

1211
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:33,119
and then eventually you have that end result.

1212
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:35,620
So it's always different for every animation that I make.

1213
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,420
No, I mean, that does sound right.

1214
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,201
I wanted to know if there was like a logic behind it

1215
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:40,841
or it was like...

1216
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:41,982
No, there's no logic.

1217
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:44,777
We're in a chaotic process, so thank you.

1218
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:45,737
No logic whatsoever.

1219
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:46,877
That was it, right?

1220
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:48,298
I'm sorry.

1221
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:49,218
I'll just...

1222
00:57:49,738 --> 00:57:51,959
I thought we'd have to cut it, I think, so.

1223
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,760
You're done now.

1224
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,160
Okay.

1225
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,781
You can ask me afterwards, sorry.
