1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:07,429
Thanks for coming to the Independent Game Summit.

2
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:11,852
I have the pleasure to introduce Jen Sandercock, who's going to talk about focusing your indie

3
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:12,172
career.

4
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:14,213
Let's give her a warm hand of applause.

5
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:24,604
Hi, hopefully you can hear me here.

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,425
I was gonna stand there,

7
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:26,965
but then I realized all you'd see was my head,

8
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,846
so I thought I would stand over here instead.

9
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,107
So yes, I'm obviously Jen Sandercock,

10
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,089
and I'm gonna begin with a little story.

11
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,632
Once upon a time, once upon a time I didn't make games.

12
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:46,956
I used to work at the Australian Department of Defence doing air operations research.

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,619
I then switched to do a Masters in Artificial Intelligence at,

14
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,562
and I was looking at how to create diverse character personalities in sort of very academic games.

15
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:01,885
I sort of thought I wanted to do games, but I was like, oh, games isn't a real career,

16
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,646
or, you know, that's not going to be a thing.

17
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,948
And then when I sort of realized games was a real career,

18
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,708
I'm like, oh, well, I'm like coding,

19
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:08,749
maybe I should be a coder.

20
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,930
And I met a bunch of people who are a lot better

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,050
at coding than I was.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,131
And so I was like, oh, that's not so good.

23
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:16,472
And I don't know if I necessarily enjoy coding

24
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:18,153
that much to do it full time.

25
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:20,574
I then had an epiphany.

26
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:22,175
I'm a game designer.

27
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,435
I'm not really a coder.

28
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,076
I can code, but it's not what I'm best at.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,271
So I set out, I gave myself a new goal.

30
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,312
I just wanted to get experience in games.

31
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:36,094
And thus began my non-indie games career.

32
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:41,235
The first job that I had in the games industry,

33
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:45,357
I'd gone for the interview and then I got the call

34
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:47,678
that they wanted me to take the job.

35
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,019
It was working on L.A. Noire for Team Bondi

36
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,440
as a junior game designer working on the tutorial levels.

37
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,574
The company reputation wasn't particularly good,

38
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:00,356
shall I say politely.

39
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:04,881
But at the time, my only goal was to get experience.

40
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,344
And then I sort of looked a little deeper

41
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:08,405
at the game as well.

42
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,148
And L.A. Noire, although it's sort of a first person shooter,

43
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,309
it's also an adventure game.

44
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:13,510
And I love adventure games.

45
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:18,192
It's also set in the 1940s, which is a period of time I very much like.

46
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:22,813
And also, it was a contract position, so I knew it wasn't going to be forever.

47
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:28,675
So I took the job, I worked at LA Noire, we shipped the game, awesome.

48
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:35,177
And then next, I went to work on a little educational game that was teaching Australian

49
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:39,258
12, 13-year-olds how to, teaching them English.

50
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:45,089
It was a relatively small team and I ended up having quite a bit of responsibilities.

51
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,313
I somehow became somewhat the lead game designer on the team and then I was doing some producer

52
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:54,716
stuff and I just didn't feel like I had the experience to have such a role.

53
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,457
I wanted to learn from other people.

54
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:06,243
So I packed up and moved to the USA from Australia because I felt like at the time the Aussie

55
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,885
industry wasn't going to give me that experience that I wanted.

56
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,877
I started working for Disney Playdom on some hidden object games,

57
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:18,279
and hidden object games are also sort of adventure games, somewhat.

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,541
And then I quit my job.

59
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:26,405
I quit my job because I had a boss who was making me feel really miserable.

60
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,006
I was crying a lot of the time,

61
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:32,729
and even though quitting meant that I might have to leave the country,

62
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,251
I was like, there has to be something more,

63
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:37,352
I shouldn't be crying so frequently.

64
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:44,796
I stopped to kind of look around at my career and I sort of felt like it had been plateauing.

65
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,738
I wasn't really sure where I was going, I wasn't really making progress.

66
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:54,561
I'd worked on a bunch of different genres, but like nothing was really holding it all

67
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,101
together.

68
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:59,964
Now, I didn't really know what I was going to do about that, how to make that work at

69
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:00,124
all.

70
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,961
But I did have an idea for a game.

71
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,563
So I thought, great, I'm going to work on this game.

72
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,384
And so I went indie.

73
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:13,448
So hopefully the majority of people here are indies.

74
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,731
And being indie is basically freedom.

75
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,573
It's freedom to make whatever I want.

76
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,354
I can work on whatever genre I want to.

77
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,956
I can kind of work with whoever I want to,

78
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,018
because I don't have to work with somebody I don't like.

79
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:28,739
And.

80
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,830
The big problem is there's a bunch of creative decisions

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,892
that you've got to make.

82
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:35,853
You know, there's all this freedom,

83
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:37,614
you can do whatever you want, what will you do?

84
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:43,098
So my first decision was what is my game company all about?

85
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,620
What is Inquisiment Inc. that I had just founded

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,420
going to be all about?

87
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,282
So I created a list of my core values.

88
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,644
I'm just going to pause for a moment here

89
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,864
because you might have noticed

90
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:54,906
that art is not one of my skills.

91
00:04:56,434 --> 00:05:00,536
And so this little image here is supposed to somewhat be like a sphere and then there's

92
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,037
like a hole in it and that's like where your core values go.

93
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:06,859
So just thought I'd better explain that because it may not be obvious from just looking at

94
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,379
that picture.

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,762
Anyway, I created a list of my core values.

96
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:15,884
It was basically three things that I wanted in the games that I was working on.

97
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:19,846
I wanted to make games that foster friendship, curiosity, and challenge.

98
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,880
Now, what do I mean by that?

99
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,682
Well, so friendship to me is about,

100
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,244
I think that people in the world are pretty lovely people.

101
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,545
Sure, there's some not great people,

102
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:31,526
but I want to be reminded of the nice people in the world.

103
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:33,528
There's a bunch of games out there

104
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:34,808
where it's somewhat violent,

105
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,089
you're going around killing people,

106
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,671
and I didn't want that in a game.

107
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:42,253
I wanted a game that either within the game itself,

108
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:49,156
was talking about friendship so that you would have a new understanding of ways you can have

109
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:54,798
friendship or a game that outside of the game was encouraging you to be better friends with

110
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,638
the people, your friends you have in the real world.

111
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:01,477
I want to work on games that foster curiosity.

112
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:04,338
So I think the world is pretty amazing.

113
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,858
I think we can create amazing digital worlds as well.

114
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,099
And yet a lot of games kind of just push you through.

115
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,200
They're like, do this, do this, keep going.

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
Don't stop and look at the sunset, blah, go, go.

117
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,741
And so I want to work on games where, you know,

118
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,401
you're somewhat encouraged to take your time and explore.

119
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,982
There's a bunch of different options

120
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,842
and there's not really big penalties

121
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,062
if you choose one over the other.

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,842
I want to work on games that foster challenge.

123
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,444
So there are a lot of games out there

124
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,925
that aren't necessarily super gamey.

125
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:39,106
They don't have a set of game rules

126
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:41,267
and you don't necessarily win or lose.

127
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,448
But I like games that make me feel like

128
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,530
I've accomplished something and done something.

129
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,393
And so that's what I say when I say challenge.

130
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,880
So I explicitly listed out my core values.

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,183
This is a picture of me at the little office space

132
00:06:58,203 --> 00:06:59,304
that I had at the time.

133
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,687
And initially it was just meant for my current game,

134
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,748
Glimpse Friends, that I was starting work on.

135
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,851
But then I realized I could apply

136
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,272
these core values to a lot more.

137
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:14,096
So this is kind of where we get to the guts of the talk.

138
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:17,019
I'm gonna talk to you about how using your core values

139
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,280
can answer a bunch of questions that are gonna come up

140
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,863
while you're developing games and in your career.

141
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,448
And I'm gonna use some examples of how I've used them.

142
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,889
So for example, you might ask,

143
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,569
what feature should I implement next?

144
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,230
Should I implement multiplayer or a new level

145
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,210
or maybe local co-op

146
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,371
or perhaps some like quality animations like this?

147
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,611
I mean, is this not quality?

148
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:47,012
Wouldn't your game be better with this?

149
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:51,193
Or perhaps in-app purchases or, you know, smell a vision.

150
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:56,308
So I'm going to give an example of my game A Glimpse Friends.

151
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:59,089
So in A Glimpse Friends, it's a mobile phone game

152
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:03,249
where you are taking photos and sending challenges to friends.

153
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,490
So basically a friend might have sent me this challenge,

154
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,710
something that makes you smile beginning with E.

155
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,851
And I would go out in the world and I would go,

156
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,671
ooh, here's Alamo Square and some elegant houses.

157
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,512
I would take a photo of that and then I would create a challenge

158
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,993
to send back to my friend and we would go back and forwards.

159
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,914
So it's about taking photos and exploring the real world,

160
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:24,895
looking up from your phone.

161
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,277
So when I was working on it, I had a decision

162
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:29,917
between what features should I put in next.

163
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:32,879
Should I put in messaging with friends from within the game

164
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,061
so that you could say, hey, sorry about that last photo.

165
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,602
It was tough or wasn't that funny.

166
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,524
Or should I put in offline mode so that you could play it

167
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,225
like on the airplane or wherever you were?

168
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:50,107
So because I want a game that fosters friendship, curiosity, and challenge,

169
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,532
offline mode doesn't really do that at all.

170
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,235
So I didn't implement that.

171
00:08:57,152 --> 00:09:00,193
Another big question you might ask is how can I market my game?

172
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,255
So what are the key themes of the game?

173
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,896
Which con or expo should I go to?

174
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,857
What social media platforms should I be posting on?

175
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,198
Should I just put on a sandwich board and walk around GDC?

176
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,320
Or maybe I should like beg press to, you know, be nice to me?

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,181
Should I be targeting teens or 50-year-old women?

178
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:25,643
Should I be, for my merchandise, should I be making posters or t-shirts or like underwear?

179
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:26,263
Who knows?

180
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:31,230
So in my example, I work on a game called Simple Weed Park.

181
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,852
It's an adventure game in the style of Lucasfilm games,

182
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:38,734
so some of the games that came out in the late 80s and early 90s.

183
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,237
It's a single-player game, but when I was younger,

184
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:46,079
I remember playing adventure games with my brother and sister,

185
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,641
and it was very much about my friendship with them

186
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,662
and working together to solve these puzzles.

187
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:58,718
So when it came to, I had to create a booth for us at PAX,

188
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:02,860
I set up the booth so that they had two stools per station

189
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,401
and also had two sets of headphones.

190
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,203
And this was so that people could sit next to each other

191
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,443
and take their time to play.

192
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,404
So it's a single player game,

193
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,285
but I'm adding friendship into the game.

194
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,947
So another big question you will ask is,

195
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,708
what game should I work on next?

196
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,779
Should I work on a zombie shooter?

197
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,400
Or an arty walking simulator?

198
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,382
Or maybe a kid-friendly indie darling?

199
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,463
An audio-only game?

200
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,424
Or a white-hearted political game?

201
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:37,207
Because politics is light-hearted, not?

202
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,908
So, I mean, like most game developers,

203
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,769
you probably have a lot of ideas

204
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,970
of what you want to work on next.

205
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,811
But many of these will not fit your core values.

206
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:49,444
So, for example, back in 2013,

207
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,746
I did a personal project for myself

208
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,548
where every month for the year,

209
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,789
I came up with a different gameplay mechanic

210
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,770
and I implemented it.

211
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,692
So one of the goals of the game

212
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,253
was to actually implement games

213
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,174
and feel like I was doing something.

214
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:07,498
Another goal was I wanted to make games that gave me hugs.

215
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:08,999
And when I say hugs,

216
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,780
I don't necessarily mean physical hugs,

217
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,621
although they're lovely.

218
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,263
I kind of meant that feeling of being accepted

219
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,864
for who I am and being loved.

220
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:24,330
So I created these 12 games, and they all gave me hugs to some extent or less.

221
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,172
But if I'm considering, like they were all somewhat small games,

222
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:32,715
because I did them within a month, and it was just one gameplay mechanic in each one.

223
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:37,038
So how do they rate if I'm now considering, should I work on one of these more?

224
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,459
Should I build it out to be something bigger?

225
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,241
How are they going with Friendship, Curiosity, and Challenge?

226
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:45,954
So for example, my first game was just a little game

227
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,216
that you played on the back of business cards

228
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:49,657
that I could hand out at GDC.

229
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:51,779
It sure, it was about friendship

230
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,800
because I was making friends

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,161
by handing these cards to people,

232
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,983
but it wasn't really about curiosity.

233
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:00,966
The next game I did was a game where two people

234
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:04,108
are on the same keyboard and they're trying to navigate

235
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:06,750
their little characters in sync with the other person.

236
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:08,451
Again, about friendship,

237
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,954
but there wasn't really anything curious about it.

238
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:16,758
The next game I did was one of my first edible games.

239
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,399
So a game where you eat the pieces.

240
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,323
In this game you would actually, you know, you'd be around a table,

241
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:28,186
you would compete for ingredients and then you would make cookies

242
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:29,567
and eat the cookies at the end.

243
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,229
So it was definitely about friendship

244
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:32,630
because you're eating cookies with friends

245
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,971
and that's what friends are about.

246
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:36,873
But it wasn't really about curiosity other than

247
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:39,035
is this going to taste super gross or nice?

248
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:46,479
But by the time I look at this fourth game, Marie's Mr. Right,

249
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,361
this one does meet all of my criteria.

250
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,483
The game itself is a little text-based game

251
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:56,164
where you get one line of the story at a time.

252
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:57,885
And you need to decide whether that line

253
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:00,006
of story is important to remember or not.

254
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:05,109
If it is important and you remember it, then the story will branch differently and you'll

255
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,490
end up with different endings.

256
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,893
So it's about friendship because it's about this woman deciding whether she should be

257
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:15,815
staying with her boyfriend or whether he's really just a friend and not a romantic interest

258
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:16,176
at all.

259
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:21,199
It's about curiosity because you're just sort of exploring these like weird little paths

260
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,219
and seeing what happens.

261
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,922
And it's about challenge because it's actually very difficult to get what I call the happy

262
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:27,282
ending.

263
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:34,570
So I can keep going through and looking at all of the other games and kind of rating them.

264
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,994
So there's like a game where you've got Dixit cards, you're telling stories.

265
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:42,617
I did an audio only game because people said they liked the sound of my voice.

266
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:49,783
I worked with a team of other people on a game about, we've got like a comic strip

267
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,745
and you're editing what people will say.

268
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:57,937
This game, The AI with a Broken Heart, was basically about breakups and this was not

269
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,638
about friendship.

270
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,001
It made me feel horrible.

271
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:04,189
It was very depressing and I learnt I do not like to work on depressing games.

272
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,803
So, keeping on going through, this is one of my favourites, Dragon Whisperers.

273
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:14,805
This is a game where you're sitting next to somebody else and you each have half of a

274
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,727
dictionary and you're trying to work out what the dragon's saying to you.

275
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:24,391
It was a game where there's two sisters dividing up what their father has left them in his

276
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:24,671
will.

277
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:29,394
And then there was a very stressful game which was about driving on the road and calling

278
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:32,816
out guesstimate and being wrong and it was not a good game.

279
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:40,492
Anyway, in summary, 50% of these games are not suitable for me to work on currently

280
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,113
with the current set of core values that I have.

281
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,514
So that's great. I don't need to consider the other ones.

282
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:51,997
So pushing this idea further, back in late 2009 I did another personal project

283
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,438
where I came up with a different game idea every week for the course of the year.

284
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,119
Now I didn't implement these games, they were just game ideas.

285
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,180
And that created these 52 ideas.

286
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:07,643
And then if I now go through and consider the lens of friendship, curiosity and challenge,

287
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:12,264
I can kind of mark each one and go, yep, tick, tick, cross, cross, whatever.

288
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:17,505
And in the end, there's only 17 that would fit my core values of friendship, curiosity

289
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:18,006
and challenge.

290
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:21,767
That's under 33% of those games would be suitable for me to work on now.

291
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:30,646
So another big question that one might ask that Core Values can help you with is who should I work with?

292
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:38,212
Should I work with a team of 20 people? Should I work by myself or with some billionaire who's going to pay me tons of money?

293
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,594
Or should I like work with my best mate?

294
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,879
The important thing to note is that other people don't need to share your core values.

295
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:50,626
You need to talk to the other person about what your core values are, and then you need

296
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:54,291
to ask, am I going to need to compromise my core values to work with this person?

297
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,536
Are both of your own individual core values compatible?

298
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,622
So all of the decisions that you've been making kind of lead up to this how do I

299
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:07,847
build a legacy of games that I'm proud of? How do I create like an oeuvre of work,

300
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:12,111
a portfolio, or whatever you want to call it? How do you kind of get that coherence

301
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,055
like you're really making something bigger and making progress? And it's kind

302
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,356
of what I was lacking before.

303
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,259
So, well, the answer is pretty simple.

304
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,784
You just follow your core values because if you follow your core values, you'll end up

305
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,026
having games that all have something very much in common.

306
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:30,310
They'll have those core values in common and they'll feel like a wholeness.

307
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:35,756
So let me talk a bit about some of the games that I've worked on since I came up with my

308
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:36,377
core values.

309
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:41,900
So A Glimpse Friends, as I said, is about staying in touch with your friends.

310
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,500
So it's definitely about friendship.

311
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,563
It's about curiosity because I'm encouraging you to put your phone down and look at the

312
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:48,863
world.

313
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:52,845
And it's about challenge because you're actually sending individual challenges to people.

314
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,001
Now this game was a total and absolute financial failure.

315
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,583
I spent like two years of my life on it.

316
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,065
I hardly had any downloads.

317
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:03,586
I made like.

318
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,812
It was financially terrible.

319
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,673
But I am like super proud of this game.

320
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:11,414
This game is very much the epitome

321
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:13,035
of friendship, curiosity, and challenge.

322
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:16,576
So that brings me to a side benefit.

323
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,997
If your game fails, but you followed your core values,

324
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,298
at least you can kind of feel okay about yourself.

325
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,519
You may not feel great because your game's failed,

326
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,260
but you're not gonna like hate yourself in the sense that,

327
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,881
hey, I did something that I didn't really like

328
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,762
and it failed and wow.

329
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:39,778
So another game I've been working on since I came up with my core values is Thimbleweed Park.

330
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:44,702
And as I said, it's not really about friendship within the game because it's a single-player game

331
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:50,067
and the story itself is about two agents who don't like each other in a weird town.

332
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:55,672
But it's about the people playing it and the way that you play it.

333
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:59,636
So we've brought in a bunch of playtesters and we often bring in a couple to playtest.

334
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:04,741
And what's fascinating is that since only one person can control the mouse, the other

335
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,744
person often doesn't even necessarily notice that they're not controlling the mouse.

336
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,227
They feel like they're part of the game and they're contributing just by saying, hey,

337
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,750
how about you try combining this or doing this.

338
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:22,718
The game is definitely about curiosity because there's a bunch of really pretty environments and places to explore.

339
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:26,501
There's a library that's filled with over a thousand books to read.

340
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:29,724
And the game lets you take your time with it.

341
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:36,210
And it's about challenge because there's a lot of puzzles in it, adventure game puzzles.

342
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,994
And they're adventure game puzzles that kind of respect you, they're not super obtuse.

343
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,885
So I've been doing a series of edible games.

344
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:49,709
And there's a lot of things that you could do with food

345
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,731
that aren't really very friendly.

346
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,854
For example, I could make people eat really gross things

347
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:59,477
or have people competing a lot more for food

348
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,558
so that you're backstabbing each other.

349
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:05,482
But I choose not to make games like that in my series

350
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,203
because I really want to have games

351
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,204
that are encouraging people

352
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,085
that actually like the other people around them.

353
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:16,567
In terms of curiosity, many of the games themselves aren't super about curiosity,

354
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,869
but for me, while I'm coming up with all these games, I'm like,

355
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,470
ooh, what can I do with food?

356
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,211
And so I'm really exploring my own curiosity.

357
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,633
And I always try to make sure that the games actually have challenge,

358
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,874
so you're not just sitting down and eating food,

359
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:32,756
you have to earn the right to be able to do that.

360
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,914
So for example, one of the games I came up with is called Gingerbread Friends.

361
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:42,959
It's a slow game about getting to know friends and asking these very awkward questions of people.

362
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:50,846
I showed this at Babycastles in New York and one group of people who were playing

363
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:55,811
were mostly strangers before the start of the game and then by the end they were exchanging

364
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,755
contact details and had basically become friends, which seemed perfect to me.

365
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:08,728
This game, The Order of the Oven Mitt, the game itself doesn't say that you have to play

366
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:12,472
cooperatively or competitively, it's totally up to you and the friendship that you have

367
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:13,914
with the people you're playing with.

368
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:21,221
It was fascinating, I showed it at XOXO and I think absolutely everybody at that festival

369
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:23,063
played cooperatively.

370
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,245
They were like, hey, which things do you like best?

371
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,328
If I give you that, will you help me have this other candy that I like?

372
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,552
Whereas other places I've showed it, people have been a little bit less friendly.

373
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:36,794
But still generally pretty friendly.

374
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:38,756
It's about eating cookies, that's friendly.

375
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:45,941
So by now, I bet you're thinking, hey Jen, these cool values sound like super awesome.

376
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:50,265
But Jen, I'm not really into friendship, curiosity, and challenge.

377
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,161
It's not really my bag.

378
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,042
That is totally cool.

379
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:56,483
You need to come up with core values that work for you.

380
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:57,683
So how do you do that?

381
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,624
You basically come up with a big list

382
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,786
of a whole bunch of words that might mean something to you.

383
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,007
Maybe you want to have a sense of empowerment.

384
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:09,208
Maybe you want to create amazing cinematic art.

385
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,729
Maybe you just want to have a sense of joy.

386
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,890
So you basically list out all the things

387
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,110
that you could possibly care about.

388
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,371
You then start bunching them down into groups.

389
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,831
And then once you've got those groups,

390
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:23,132
you try to pull out one word that might mean

391
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,732
most of the stuff in that group.

392
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,953
And you try to reduce it right down to the bare minimum.

393
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:29,293
Three is a nice number.

394
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:33,154
And you're aiming to make it really short and memorable.

395
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:35,654
Partly so you can remember it yourself,

396
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,095
but also so you can tell other people.

397
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,895
So you can be, hey, I'm doing this thing, and it's awesome.

398
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,383
You need to update your core values regularly.

399
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,064
Life changes, you can change,

400
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:49,325
and your values can change too.

401
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:52,547
Now, sometimes you've got to do a project

402
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,068
that compromises your core values

403
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,349
because you need to pay rent.

404
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:58,170
You should totally pay rent and be able to eat.

405
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,491
That's super important.

406
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:04,954
You shouldn't, you know, core values come on top of,

407
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:06,555
like, the basics of living.

408
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:13,240
Sometimes you want to work on a project that isn't really 100% in line with your core values,

409
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,763
but maybe you want to do it for more experience, or you want to do a favour for a friend,

410
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:20,184
or perhaps you just want a little extra money would be nice.

411
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,259
And that can also be okay too.

412
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,460
But you need to be making that decision consciously.

413
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,120
If the compromise that you're making on your core values

414
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,681
is minor or the timeline is pretty short,

415
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,161
then sure, that's fine.

416
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,722
But if you're making like serious compromises

417
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:38,102
on your core values, maybe you need to check to see

418
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,702
if your core values need to change

419
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:42,663
or you might end up pretty miserable.

420
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,404
Because at the end of the day,

421
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,644
being indie should be about freedom.

422
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:50,505
If it isn't, you're doing something wrong.

423
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:54,337
So in summary, you should find your core values,

424
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:56,097
list them out explicitly,

425
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:58,638
use them, believe them, and live them,

426
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:00,719
update them as life changes.

427
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,159
So just follow your core values,

428
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,500
make amazing games you're proud of, and yeah.

429
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,860
That is all.

430
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,101
Don't forget to fill in evaluations

431
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,061
so I can come back some other time.

432
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,714
Cool, do we have, I think we've got time for questions.

433
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:26,875
Any questions?

434
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:29,918
Not so much.

435
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,599
Oh no, somebody's coming up.

436
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,780
Yeah, thanks for the nice talk.

437
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:38,324
Did you update your core value along the way?

438
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,506
You talked about updating your core value, right?

439
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,607
So, have you done that?

440
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,376
Yeah, well so I guess initially my core value was just,

441
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:47,576
I just wanted experience.

442
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:50,797
And so that was all I cared about

443
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:52,577
when I was starting out in the industry.

444
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:55,257
And so now I have my friendship curiosity and challenge.

445
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,658
If I find that's not working for me,

446
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:00,558
then I will definitely reconsider

447
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,199
and change what I'm doing.

448
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,140
Cool, well, thanks everyone for coming.
