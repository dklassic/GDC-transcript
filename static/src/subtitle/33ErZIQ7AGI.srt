1
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:16,113
So I'm Bryce Johnson I'm the inclusive lead for Microsoft devices I work on both Xbox and surface devices kind of work on our hardware.

2
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:25,518
I'm Aaron must in first I'm an occupational therapist I work at Craig hospital and if you're curious why I'm here I will tell you in a minute.

3
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,360
Because she made this thing now so.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,542
This is the Xbox adaptive patroller.

5
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:34,414
I'm sure some of you have seen it.

6
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,336
If you haven't seen it, please go to our demo hall.

7
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,397
Go to the Expo Hall and South Hall.

8
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:39,137
We've got them set up there.

9
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,218
You can kind of see it in action.

10
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,500
We can show you it as well.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,381
We like to call it Zach.

12
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:45,901
Not all of us do.

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:46,061
I do.

14
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,103
I like to call it Zach, Xbox Adaptive Controller.

15
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,424
Zach, it's less of a mouthful.

16
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:55,047
And this is some of the friends that play well with it.

17
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:59,169
The one important thing that we found with this device

18
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,010
is that having a rich ecosystem of peripherals

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,751
is really vital.

20
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,706
So where are we going to start?

21
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:08,688
Wait, I had something and then I put it down.

22
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:09,729
Oh wait, here it is.

23
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,830
We're gonna start with this.

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,332
This is a traditional Xbox controller,

25
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:18,875
as we like to now say, traditional Xbox controller, classic.

26
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,556
We love this thing.

27
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:25,099
I personally think that we make the greatest controllers.

28
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:29,762
Your opinions may vary, but I think they're the best.

29
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,343
But if you look at this controller,

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,990
through the lens of exclusion, it's very possible

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,351
that we need to recognize where this device

32
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,451
can leave some people out.

33
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:45,032
And the thing is, this device makes a lot of assumptions

34
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:47,533
about how you use it, right?

35
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,013
All controllers do.

36
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:54,114
It assumes that you have two hands to hold it, right?

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,795
It assumes that your thumbs have a fluid range of motion

38
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:01,536
and that you can hit all these buttons, right?

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,441
How many buttons are on a controller?

40
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,201
Does anyone know?

41
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,622
Anyone have a guess?

42
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,223
Actually, I'd love to hear some guesses.

43
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:09,684
Just call some numbers out.

44
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:09,984
Seven.

45
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:10,424
Seven. 24.

46
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,526
Someone saw this before and said 17.

47
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:17,348
Yes, there's 17 buttons on an Xbox controller

48
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:19,549
that you hit with two thumbs

49
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,410
and your two index fingers, right?

50
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,631
That's a lot of density.

51
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,211
That's a ton of density.

52
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,532
That's more dense than a keyboard.

53
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:47,322
So the other thing that we assume about this device is that we assume that people have the endurance to be able to hold it all day long right and that's something that was really important for us to recognize early in our process that while we love this device that this was the barrier.

54
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:55,026
This is how we approach inclusive design at Microsoft.

55
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,127
Recognize exclusion.

56
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:00,786
Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases.

57
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:04,228
As Microsoft designers, we seek out those exclusions

58
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:08,511
and use them as opportunities to create new ideas

59
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:10,352
and inclusive designs.

60
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,833
That's how we think about it.

61
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,995
The next one, learn from diversity.

62
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,637
Human beings are the real experts

63
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,098
in adapting to diversity.

64
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,039
Inclusive design puts people in the center

65
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,920
from the very start of the process

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,942
and those fresh, diverse perspectives.

67
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,835
are the key to true insight.

68
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:32,337
And then the last one, solve for one and extend to many.

69
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,978
Everyone has abilities and limits to those abilities.

70
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:38,979
Designing for people with permanent disabilities

71
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,660
actually results in designs that benefit people universally.

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,180
Constraints are a beautiful thing.

73
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,161
So those are the principles we live by.

74
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,642
And I've already talked about recognizing exclusion

75
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,262
with our controllers.

76
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,403
So this is where we start the next process, which

77
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:54,483
is learn from diversity.

78
00:03:54,807 --> 00:04:04,711
This is Sergeant Josh price we met Josh in 2015 when him and Ken Jones came to the Microsoft campus to work with us in our one week hackathon and it was.

79
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:15,996
It was so enlightening to kind of work with Josh and Ken because you can kind of see Josh is an amputee actually Aaron what type of amputee is Josh.

80
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,443
I didn't put it in the spot.

81
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:19,643
Oh my goodness, healthcare.

82
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,824
Oh, Josh looks to me, I don't know him,

83
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,025
but he looks like he is an above the elbow amputee,

84
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,365
meaning he does not have an elbow joint,

85
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,025
he's missing everything below that.

86
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,165
Right.

87
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:31,586
So you can see that Josh basically has a joystick

88
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,227
that he puts under where his elbow would be,

89
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:36,347
and then he uses an elite controller on his hand,

90
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,168
and then he has an array of buttons

91
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:40,348
that he gets in front of him.

92
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,749
The reason why this was so important

93
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,150
and so impactful for us was that, you know,

94
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:51,007
we got to really see what Josh's life would be like

95
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,327
if he couldn't play video games.

96
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:55,849
And we have a lot of veterans

97
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:59,150
on our Xbox hardware leadership team,

98
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,052
and they got to see what it would be like

99
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,352
if Josh couldn't play.

100
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,973
And I will say, like, in, you know,

101
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:12,915
it really fundamentally changed,

102
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:15,056
like, how they looked at controllers.

103
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,257
It was super powerful.

104
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,600
So powerful that in 2016 we went back to the hackathon.

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,622
We kind of went away for a year.

106
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:26,645
We kind of, we had some ideas kind of percolated.

107
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:31,869
And Xbox Hardware's leadership team basically assigned us three interns

108
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:37,113
to go into this 2016 hackathon to have a new version of the prototype.

109
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:40,216
To basically kind of iterate on what we did in 2015.

110
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:40,776
2015 was really hacky.

111
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:43,018
2016 was a little bit better.

112
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:46,041
You know, we had something.

113
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:53,457
And I'm going to play a video that's of Rachel, who is one of our interns.

114
00:05:53,457 --> 00:06:05,468
People use the ready-made adapter to the Xbox One controller so that if they want

115
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:10,832
to externalize the inputs for their own custom use for their physical needs,

116
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:13,554
they can easily just grab it off the shelf and then plug in some buttons

117
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,316
and it's right there ready for them to use.

118
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,314
So that's Rachel.

119
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,375
And if you can hear that music,

120
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:25,437
it's because I have Minecraft on in the background of my PC.

121
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,258
And I really am digging it.

122
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:30,359
We just hope it relaxes you all and kind of sets a mood.

123
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:30,479
Okay.

124
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,440
Yeah, super into it.

125
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,540
Yeah.

126
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,281
So actually, maybe I shouldn't for this one,

127
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:37,742
in all due respect to our partners.

128
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,663
But no, you know what, it's fine.

129
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:40,243
You'll be fine.

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,681
So after 2016, we started reaching out.

131
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,903
We worked with Warfighter Engaged.

132
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,644
We had some ideas.

133
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,925
We started reaching out to other non-profits and charities.

134
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,807
We started working with Able Gamers.

135
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,088
Who's familiar with Able Gamers?

136
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:54,589
A lot of people in here.

137
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,029
Great.

138
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,611
A lot of people aren't.

139
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,332
So I'm going to play this video.

140
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,132
Please indulge us.

141
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:02,455
It's really important for us to work with these partners, and I really want to make

142
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,575
sure that we give them their due.

143
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:13,793
For over a decade, AbleGamers has been on a mission to bring inclusion and improve quality of life for people with disabilities through the power of video games.

144
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:17,015
And in 2018, we had the honor of helping many incredible gamers.

145
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:25,022
Gaming accessibility doesn't really have a one-size-fits-all solution, however, and sometimes it takes a couple tries to get it just right.

146
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:30,686
As was the case with AJ. AJ has cerebral palsy, a condition that makes holding and using a standard controller difficult.

147
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,708
The first controller we gave AJ wasn't a perfect fit.

148
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,602
So we went back to the drawing board to make him the perfect controller,

149
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:39,904
which ended up being a much better fit and got AJ back in the game, destroying his opponents.

150
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:44,686
In the process, we found out that AJ's fiancee Regina, a gamer who also lives with cerebral palsy,

151
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:49,068
had taken the first controller, and now they're able to play games together in ways they weren't able to before.

152
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,049
It's stories like these that inspire us to create more,

153
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:55,912
and all of this was only possible thanks to the love and support of the generous AbleGamers supporters like you,

154
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,613
who are with us every day in the belief that gaming is for everyone.

155
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,274
Together, we're changing the world, so everyone can game.

156
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,728
I am going to turn that down.

157
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,529
That's starting to get out of hand.

158
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,270
I'm sorry, Minecraft.

159
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,810
Sorry.

160
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,091
We'll get there.

161
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,491
We'll get there.

162
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,311
We will.

163
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,793
You just might have to give us a minute to get back to it.

164
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:18,834
OK.

165
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:26,837
Sorry, one second.

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,441
Oops.

167
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:39,887
Uh-oh, slide snafu because of Minecraft music.

168
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,248
Where were we?

169
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:43,810
So, the one thing I will say about AbleGamers,

170
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:50,175
AbleGamers has a service that they offer developers

171
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,015
called Player Panels.

172
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:55,379
If you want to get people with disabilities

173
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,781
viewing the things that you make,

174
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,462
and I cannot stress enough how important that is.

175
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:09,176
The one thing we always say about the adaptive controller is that we designed it with the community. We didn't design it for the community. It's a very important distinction.

176
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:24,659
Able gamers player panels were invaluable to us when we did a beta of the hardware for the first time Microsoft did an external beta of hardware. We typically don't need to go outside of our employee pool to do betas of hardware. We have hundreds of thousands of employees.

177
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,600
So, but when we did this, we know we knew we needed to.

178
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,696
And AbleGamers gave us 20% of our,

179
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,318
they recommended 20% of the people who are in our beta.

180
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,199
It's very, very valuable for us.

181
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,160
For over a decade, AbleGamers.

182
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,262
Skip that, we already watched that.

183
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:48,125
So, next organization we worked with, SpecialEffect.

184
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,287
We talked about AbleGamers, they're in the U.S.

185
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:51,347
SpecialEffect is in the U.K.

186
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:56,270
I think what we learned from SpecialEffect was that,

187
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,371
and all the partners we worked with,

188
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:58,531
that.

189
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,807
Everyone had goals that aligned.

190
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,948
Everyone wanted to basically make people be able to play.

191
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,129
But their approaches and how they went about it

192
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:07,749
were all different.

193
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,310
And when we were creating the Xbox Adaptive Controller,

194
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,171
we needed to create a device that not only worked

195
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,932
for one organization, but worked for all of them.

196
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:17,992
And then even beyond those organizations,

197
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,753
we had to think about who was going to use it.

198
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,133
So the thing about SpecialEffect,

199
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,734
because you're in the UK, they can get in a car,

200
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,095
they can put an occupational therapist

201
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:28,735
and a technician in a car.

202
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,373
They can go to someone's house,

203
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:31,574
they can build them a controller,

204
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,675
and they can leave.

205
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,697
You can't really do that in the U.S.

206
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,258
The geography of the U.S. doesn't allow us

207
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,260
to have a mystery machine that goes around

208
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,822
building controllers for people.

209
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,322
It'd be really cool.

210
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:41,383
It'd be really cool.

211
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:41,903
It'd be super cool.

212
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,865
So, that's how special effect works,

213
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,947
and I'm gonna just show you,

214
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:48,129
oh, before I show you the video,

215
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,172
the one thing that was also super powerful

216
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,114
about special effect is they're really good

217
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:53,855
at sharing.

218
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,191
the work that they do online.

219
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:59,093
So their Instagram feed, before we actually met them

220
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,595
in person, their Instagram feed was basically a huge source

221
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,595
of inspiration for us.

222
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,257
["Adagio for Piano Concerto in F Minor"]

223
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,067
It's been yet another amazing year.

224
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:33,888
From all of us at Special Effects, thank you and Merry Christmas!

225
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:38,430
It's always fun to hang with those people.

226
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,830
So, now we're going to get into the us.

227
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,370
Us? That's me.

228
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:49,232
So another one of the charities that we work, not charities, nonprofits.

229
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:54,934
We're a nonprofit hospital. We're a hospital. That's what I think is the biggest difference.

230
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:55,134
And, uh...

231
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,222
So this was still in 2016, we met Aaron and Patrick here.

232
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:04,185
And I will say that from our very first sort of call,

233
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:06,427
which was this one, I'm a total creeper.

234
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,107
I recorded it.

235
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:09,329
I did not know he was recording it.

236
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,934
So from our very first call, it was apparent and amazingly

237
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:21,939
wonderful that the approach that Craig Hospital had was unique.

238
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,380
It was different than AbleGamers.

239
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,861
It was different than SpecialEffect.

240
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:25,942
It was different than Morphiter.

241
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,061
And that's what made it so valuable to us.

242
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:31,263
Yeah, and I will get into, I guess,

243
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,585
why we're unique in a bit.

244
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:39,431
But this first call for me was kind of a proving ground,

245
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:41,292
like in terms of just feeling out.

246
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,693
At this point, I didn't know anything really

247
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,734
about the project.

248
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:46,637
But it was just a conversation about accessibility and gaming

249
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:51,061
and what we were doing and the problems that we were having.

250
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:56,734
And so for me, this was pretty cool to start having a conversation with someone in the

251
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:02,917
industry and to be kind of speaking the same language in terms of devices and workarounds

252
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,037
and things that we were using.

253
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:08,439
Because especially in the hospital setting, sometimes you're taking your best shot and

254
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,560
your best guess and you're hoping that you're on the right track.

255
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,481
I did stalk special effects Instagram page as well.

256
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:18,122
So that's kind of where some of my ideas came from too.

257
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,523
So that's kind of what this meant for me.

258
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:20,983
Yeah.

259
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:21,123
Yeah.

260
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:30,259
I think for a lot of people on the team too, because Craig's in Denver, it's actually the

261
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,980
closest to us up in Seattle.

262
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,323
And so we would send a lot of the team there.

263
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:40,847
And so for many members of our team, it was their primary and kind of initial experience.

264
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,970
It was their first sort of foray into this world.

265
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,372
So they were really affected by it.

266
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:46,893
Yeah.

267
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,814
And that's something I probably.

268
00:13:50,048 --> 00:14:12,865
took for granted and it took me a while to kind of see that impact because I'm I'm in a hospital every day. So there are a lot of things that are like quote unquote typical day for me that the team at Microsoft probably didn't have even been exposed to. So I think it raised a lot of good questions in terms of situations or design ideas even that they might have to account for in a hospital environment.

269
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:26,613
So I'm kind of showing some showing what I can show you what we originally told the folks at Craig hospital and you can see that some of the things we're talking about our copilot does anyone know what copilot is.

270
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:38,444
Some some folks in does just good copilot is on Xbox one and Windows 10 it's the ability to take 2 controllers and tell the system that there one controller.

271
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,533
It was one of the things that we did really early on to address this notion of like that

272
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,314
controllers are meant to be used by this, like this.

273
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:53,438
So we saw that if we took two controllers and we made them mirror each other on the

274
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:57,140
console, all of a sudden someone could use controllers like this.

275
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,001
You can imagine me having another one.

276
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,722
So they could split the inputs apart.

277
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:12,077
And at the same time we knew we were going we were in the process of developing the Xbox adaptive controller and we do really want people to use the Xbox adaptive controller with the traditional controller.

278
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:19,386
So yeah that's how we kind of got into copilot there so I want to kind of go back to this bit.

279
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:24,006
just to kind of reinforce what we talked about earlier

280
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,486
when it comes to inclusive design.

281
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:27,307
So recognize exclusion, you know,

282
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,808
we talked about that in the beginning.

283
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:33,530
We needed to recognize that this was the challenge, right?

284
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,590
This was the barrier.

285
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,931
Learn from diversity.

286
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,172
We worked with not only Craig Hospital,

287
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,373
who are an excellent partner, we worked with AbleGamers,

288
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:44,475
Special Effect, also Warfighter Engaged.

289
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:45,836
Our last charity that we worked with

290
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:47,976
when we were developing this product

291
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:49,437
was the Cerebral Palsy Foundation.

292
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,217
They are a wonderful partner.

293
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,679
So it was very important to work with them all.

294
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,720
We do believe in nothing about us without us.

295
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,663
And then this last bit, solve for one and extend to many.

296
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:05,245
So we're going to get into this one a little bit more,

297
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:06,165
kind of as we go on.

298
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,608
But the idea is that when we first

299
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,849
started pitching this to our engineering team,

300
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,550
they kept asking us what the primary use case

301
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,171
of the Adaptive Controller was.

302
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,532
What's the primary use case?

303
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,836
And we really didn't have a good answer

304
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:24,237
because we knew that the diversity of needs was so great.

305
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:27,138
So what we eventually kind of came to

306
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:30,219
was this idea that this is the primary use case.

307
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:33,480
Our traditional controller is still the primary way

308
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,621
that most people will play games on Xbox.

309
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,402
But what we needed with the adaptive controller

310
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:44,743
was a device that tackled all the alternate use cases.

311
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:45,504
Everything else.

312
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,704
And that's what we went and set about to do.

313
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:57,460
I want to kind of show you some of the bits of our journey here.

314
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,101
After the hackathons, we had a pretty big pivot

315
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:04,062
into what was the form of the device.

316
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:07,003
And that, there's a number of reasons for it,

317
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:10,064
but it was enabled basically because we knew

318
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,504
that Copilot was going to be a thing.

319
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:14,665
We knew that you could always use a traditional controller

320
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,466
in conjunction with the adaptive controller.

321
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,007
And that gave us a lot of freedom.

322
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:24,046
to basically explore forms that were quite unusual.

323
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,747
As you can see, the device is probably not

324
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,747
what you think of when you think about a controller.

325
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,888
So these are sketches from the industrial designer,

326
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:40,350
Chris Kajowski, kind of as we started to go down this path.

327
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,530
So I'm getting a little parched.

328
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,971
If you can't see, on the back of the device here,

329
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:47,511
there is...

330
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,303
Like we said, there's 17 buttons on a controller.

331
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,283
There's 19 ports on the back of this device.

332
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:56,664
So there's one for every button on the controller

333
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:57,744
plus two extras.

334
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:03,105
This was how we determined how big this device was going to be.

335
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,546
Once we got to a point where we were re-evaluating,

336
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:07,886
we started from a place of basically,

337
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,307
we knew that there was going to be this many ports

338
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:11,907
on the device.

339
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:16,668
And it basically determined how wide this needed to be.

340
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:19,149
After that, we started to think about.

341
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:22,791
Well, what are we going to do with all this space?

342
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:22,891
Right?

343
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,772
Because at the time, we were thinking

344
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:29,375
about this kind of more like a hub than, I think, a controller.

345
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,576
So we started to think about adding buttons.

346
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:35,218
And we started to explore not only adding the buttons

347
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,840
that you need to, all the buttons that

348
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,261
are on the adaptive controller or what

349
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,562
you need to use the system shell on Xbox One.

350
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:47,156
So if people are wondering if these are directional or capacitive in any way, they're not.

351
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:52,460
They're actually two big buttons, they're A and B. And they're meant for people who

352
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,465
basically can't hit small buttons.

353
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:02,928
Did you want to say anything about this part?

354
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:05,550
In terms of just the design of it?

355
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,791
Yeah.

356
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,351
I mean, I think...

357
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:12,154
Bryce hits on the fact that you guys were initially thinking of it as a hub, and that

358
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,015
allowed a lot of flexibility in the device.

359
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:19,117
And that certainly gives me a lot of creative freedom when I'm trying to match it up to

360
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:24,840
someone, but including some of the buttons and using that space on the top of it functionally

361
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,102
in a way that people can actually have access to buttons and inputs has been super helpful.

362
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:35,924
Without saying too much, I will say that there was a lot of discussion around that, right?

363
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,305
And...

364
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:42,589
a lot of opinions around that and things, feedback we gave them on different ways to

365
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:46,873
do it that they definitely heard, but then understanding that there are always reasons

366
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:51,176
in the design process why certain things work, certain things don't.

367
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:55,199
But I think it just generated a lot of discussion, like a lot of collaborative dialogue about

368
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,702
what are we going to do with the top of this control.

369
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:03,186
So you can also see from these photos of these polyjets, you know, we would write on them,

370
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,488
we would sketch on them, we would kind of figure it out.

371
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:10,827
you might notice that the corners of these are actually fairly sharp,

372
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:14,307
which we got feedback on pretty quick from Erin.

373
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:17,288
I did say I was pretty opinionated about some things.

374
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,689
I've been working in occupational therapy for 10 years,

375
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,870
and that's given me a lot of time to develop feelings

376
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,351
and to learn how to express them appropriately.

377
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:32,412
But while that was a really sharp, sleek-looking design,

378
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:33,632
having those sharp corners,

379
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,350
for the people that I work with,

380
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,471
that was not going to work well,

381
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,012
because maybe because of fatigue,

382
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:41,614
they were going to have to rest the side of their hand

383
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,955
on those corners.

384
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:45,597
And maybe because of whatever impairment they have,

385
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,878
they might not have feeling in the side of their hand

386
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:48,559
that they're resting on.

387
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,161
And so that can actually lead to skin breakdown,

388
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,743
blisters, actual wounds,

389
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:56,545
just from resting in a space or rubbing on a space

390
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:57,145
and not knowing it.

391
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,866
So I was pretty vocal about that.

392
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,068
And, you know, we needed to hear that.

393
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:07,210
Because up until this point, we were really kind of assuming that people wouldn't interact with it a lot.

394
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:14,874
But once we did really kind of understand that there was a lot of value in interacting with the device,

395
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:20,317
we started to think about how we could make it more ergonomic, better for playing with.

396
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:25,019
And one of the things that we came up really early on with was the idea of sloping the device.

397
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,621
So, you know, these early polyjets, it was pretty boxy.

398
00:21:28,724 --> 00:21:31,506
We sloped the device so that you could rest your hands

399
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:34,789
on the table and just kind of lay your fingers on it

400
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:35,790
or your hands or whatever.

401
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,272
And you wouldn't have to like kind of get over this edge.

402
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,494
And it was tricky to do because these buttons

403
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:43,756
on this thing are actually pretty big.

404
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:45,617
They take up a lot of vertical room.

405
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,519
The ports in the back take a lot of vertical room too.

406
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,522
So we couldn't make the whole profile of the device thinner

407
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:54,063
because at the back we basically need it.

408
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,645
So we came up with the slope.

409
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:02,549
So this one is pretty far along.

410
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,810
I mean, this is pretty much what we kind of came up

411
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,211
with in the end, this form.

412
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:10,594
I think what's really interesting about what Aaron

413
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:13,176
sort of came to us with was, like I said,

414
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:15,357
we didn't assume that people would interact with the app.

415
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:16,518
But when we started looking at it,

416
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,680
we started to see things like, well,

417
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,582
let's move those buttons like View and Menu and the Xbox

418
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,544
button out from between those two buttons

419
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,085
because you might accidentally hit them

420
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,007
as you're going between these two big buttons.

421
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,131
We just increased the overall white space of the device.

422
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,311
And it was really important because, sorry, Erin.

423
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,772
No, you're fine.

424
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,172
I always joke that these buttons aren't for fingers,

425
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,553
even though they work really well with fingers.

426
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:46,693
We thought of this place where it was like,

427
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,794
you could rest your hand here and just kind of rock it

428
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:51,274
back and forth to get at these two buttons.

429
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:53,375
And it felt really good.

430
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,956
It felt like this place of where we couldn't accidentally

431
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:57,456
hit things.

432
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:05,327
I think another thing, and this one will be a little bit harder to see, but I will do my best.

433
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:10,930
You know, I talked about Copilot, I talked about using these devices together.

434
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:17,712
We really tried to make it fit so that you could, in essence, hold this and use these two big buttons

435
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,614
while you're holding a traditional controller.

436
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:27,256
And we're going to get into an example of that in kind of a minute.

437
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,734
So yeah, one of our researchers at the hospital,

438
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:34,055
his name's, or sorry, one of our researchers at Xbox

439
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,735
when he was visiting the hospital,

440
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,496
he noticed that a lot of the corners

441
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,537
were dented and scratched.

442
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,157
And it's a new facility.

443
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:43,678
Yeah, we just expanded like the year

444
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,198
before they started coming, so.

445
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:45,898
Yeah.

446
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:47,679
It's got a lot of love on our walls.

447
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,240
And you know, we asked why this was the case,

448
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,241
and the reason is is that when you get someone

449
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:57,142
who's like new to driving their power chair, you know.

450
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,838
They're going to make some mistakes.

451
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,319
They're going to hit a wall.

452
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,984
Run over toes, hit walls, scratch up the mirror in the elevator because they're trying to

453
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:08,527
turn their chair around and don't have a sense of space.

454
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:08,848
So yeah.

455
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:14,173
So when we thought about how this would affect the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

456
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,899
we put some mounting in the system.

457
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:20,000
So you can actually mount this controller

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,300
to any number of things.

459
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,420
If you go to the expo hall,

460
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,421
you can see some of the mounts that are there.

461
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:28,201
But we envisioned basically people possibly mounting this

462
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,761
to their wheelchair.

463
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,482
And once we saw that like,

464
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:34,822
oh, they're gonna run into a wall,

465
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,403
possibly with this thing attached to it,

466
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,863
it actually made us go back to the drawing board

467
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:42,424
and make sure that we kind of beefed up

468
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:44,784
the mechanical engineering of this device.

469
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,103
So not only is there a tripod mount,

470
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:52,126
there's a different type of mount, the AMPS hole pattern.

471
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:55,048
And that's used in things like RAM mount.

472
00:24:55,048 --> 00:25:00,412
And these are attached to a structure inside the controller

473
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:04,114
that is actually very, very strong.

474
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,796
We went back and redid it to make sure

475
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,279
that if you did happen to run into a wall,

476
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,580
your controller wouldn't snap off.

477
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,361
Don't try that, though.

478
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:13,761
I tried that.

479
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:13,921
Did you?

480
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:14,201
Yeah.

481
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:14,382
Cool.

482
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:25,089
One of the things that was also amazing about this journey was that we got to bring our

483
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,570
packaging designers along with it.

484
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,792
And when Scott was doing the research, he would basically go to someone's house and

485
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:39,014
he saw them open a Coke can with their teeth because they just didn't have the mobility.

486
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:41,255
And so it

487
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:45,147
basically created one of the strangest design rules

488
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,708
for our packaging team.

489
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,329
Like one of the principles of the design

490
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,991
for the controller packaging was no teeth.

491
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,232
So to just kind of go through, I'm

492
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,252
going to kind of back up and go through this one again.

493
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:01,434
Oops, there we go.

494
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:06,917
So you just need a finger to basically pull the tape off

495
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,378
and the mailer opens up.

496
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,098
Inside, there's another tape loop.

497
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,685
which you can pull up and then this cloth strap is exposed.

498
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:18,447
The controller sits on a card that also has a loop

499
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:20,128
that you can pull out of the device.

500
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,249
You can slide it out.

501
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,370
And then the last thing that is in the packaging

502
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,152
is the USB-C cable, which is in that little loop,

503
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,213
but there's no ties on it.

504
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,194
You can just shake it and it kind of falls out.

505
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,195
And the thing that the controller sat on

506
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,556
is the quick start guide.

507
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:38,236
So we're very extremely happy

508
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,637
with how this packaging turned out.

509
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,120
And the team is so excited.

510
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,523
It's really changed how they think about packaging.

511
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:51,004
So as we develop packaging for future Microsoft devices,

512
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:54,766
you know, we're really going to see what we can take from this,

513
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:57,927
where it's appropriate, and kind of have it affect our packaging

514
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:05,971
kind of all up.

515
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:09,753
So one thing that I didn't think I would have expected.

516
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:14,040
to be as important as it was, which in retrospect sounds

517
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,903
silly, is the form and the visual design of this device.

518
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:25,746
We were very focused on empowering people.

519
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:30,828
And what we found when we went out into the world was that,

520
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:35,350
and I think this totally makes sense when you put it,

521
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,111
now that we have the opportunity to look at it this way.

522
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:44,688
People didn't want a device that looked too medical.

523
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:46,789
They wanted something that looked like what

524
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,570
their friends were using.

525
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,652
So we really made sure that the Xbox Adaptive Controller felt

526
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,173
like a member of the Xbox family.

527
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,554
The width of the device, remember I said before,

528
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:01,336
the width of the device is determined by the ports?

529
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:02,597
It also matches the Xbox One S console.

530
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,058
So the width of the controller and the One S console

531
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,578
are the same.

532
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,241
It has rounded edges.

533
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:10,503
It follows our visual design pattern.

534
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,784
It looks great.

535
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:14,885
I think a lot of things, when it comes to assistive technology,

536
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:22,970
they tend to look either overly medical, overly homemade,

537
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,913
or they can look really childlike.

538
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:31,215
I don't know if you've seen a lot of assistive technology,

539
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,836
but they, yeah.

540
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:32,936
Yeah.

541
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:33,556
Colorful.

542
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,412
A little infantilizing, I think, from that side of it.

543
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,393
And then yes, also overtly medical,

544
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:42,014
because they have to be medical grade.

545
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,956
And they just look different.

546
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,898
And people really struggle with that.

547
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:47,918
Yeah.

548
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:52,522
And so the fact that we created this device

549
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,903
to look like it was part of the Xbox family

550
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:57,205
was something that we heard from the community,

551
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:59,327
and we really appreciated, and we took it.

552
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,448
But the fact that when we launched the device,

553
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,530
that right away we got tons of feedback

554
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,562
just how non-medical it looks and how it looks like it's part of the family was actually

555
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:12,103
really, really gratifying to us.

556
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:16,505
And it's really taught us a lot about how we think about assistive technology, right?

557
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:21,467
I mean, some people have told us, well, you mass manufacture these, you have an opportunity

558
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:21,907
to do that.

559
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:23,228
I think that's partially true.

560
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,229
Lots of assistive technology is mass manufactured.

561
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:29,371
That doesn't mean that it isn't medical.

562
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:33,993
So I think one of the things that's really been interesting is this idea of like,

563
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:39,254
How do we create a device that doesn't stigmatize you from using it?

564
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:41,455
Doesn't other you for using this device?

565
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:42,515
That was super important to us.

566
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:50,657
Yeah, and so I think that's something that I see really frequently in my work.

567
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:55,379
So I'll take a moment to kind of just talk about Craig Hospital and what I do there and

568
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,400
why Microsoft would even think about approaching a hospital on a project like that.

569
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,018
Because there are a lot of really great nonprofits

570
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,819
out there who are in the gaming world and addressing gaming.

571
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,542
But Craig Hospital is a rehabilitation hospital.

572
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:12,664
We treat people who've had either a spinal cord injury

573
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:16,086
or a brain injury or both, honestly.

574
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:19,288
And what a rehab hospital is, is basically

575
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:23,470
after you have had a change, an injury after you've

576
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,671
been in kind of the acute medical ICU

577
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:29,073
stages of a hospital, you get kind of medically stable.

578
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:29,353
But.

579
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,943
because of that change in your function,

580
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:34,064
you still may not be strong enough

581
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:35,744
or able to go home and resume things.

582
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:38,386
So at Rehab Hospital, we really work with people,

583
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:42,107
partner with them to help them learn the skills

584
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,849
that they can take with them and go home

585
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,549
and be as independent as possible

586
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,010
and do the things that they wanted to do before.

587
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,272
So I'm an occupational therapist

588
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:53,372
and that's kind of the bread and butter of my work

589
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,914
is understanding what's important to a person

590
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:57,815
and just helping them develop the skills

591
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,435
or use the tools to do that again.

592
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:01,704
I think that's the easiest way to describe what an OT is.

593
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,986
And I work in assistive technology,

594
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:06,368
which means a lot of times I'm looking at a person's ability

595
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:08,309
to use a computer, to use their phone again,

596
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,171
all these things we take for granted to control

597
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:13,173
their environment, to use a communication device

598
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,954
that they can no longer speak.

599
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:17,376
And we did those things really well at Craig,

600
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,458
but we didn't have anything for gaming

601
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,320
when I first started there.

602
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,681
And so you're going to get kind of an origin story inside

603
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,562
of an origin story here.

604
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:28,244
So I'm going to talk a little bit about why I do gaming.

605
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:33,808
I actually worked with a patient five-ish years ago

606
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,129
that when he came to the hospital,

607
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,529
his big goal was to be able to play video games again.

608
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,890
He'd had a spinal cord injury.

609
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,371
He's what we would call a quadriplegic or tetraplegic,

610
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,231
meaning that he couldn't move his legs anymore,

611
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:46,092
he couldn't move his trunk.

612
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:48,432
He could move his arms,

613
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:50,173
but he didn't have any fingers anymore,

614
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:52,833
so he was essentially working in a world

615
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,714
of kind of gross motor movement.

616
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,975
And he was just really struggling with rehab.

617
00:31:58,354 --> 00:31:59,695
And it was because he was a gamer.

618
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:05,299
And at the time, we didn't have the tools to meet that need.

619
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,020
And he saw that.

620
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,641
It was very apparent.

621
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,562
And it affected his participation.

622
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,104
So those are the kind of patients

623
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,426
that get referred to me in the tech lab.

624
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:16,747
When there's not a solution, they usually come to me.

625
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:20,510
And just through the process of working with this person

626
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,953
and understanding his need and being really honest

627
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:26,635
and learning from him and helping him get back to gaming

628
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:30,184
We saw kind of the power in that, in his ability

629
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:31,804
to participate in something he loved,

630
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:34,245
to relate to his friends in his online gaming community.

631
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:37,565
And that really translated to his overall rehab.

632
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,746
So from that one need, we built a whole program

633
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,007
because we saw the importance of it,

634
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,427
which is kind of an inclusive design thing, right?

635
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:44,687
Yeah.

636
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:45,848
Right, right?

637
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:46,048
Yes.

638
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:46,588
It's parallels.

639
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:50,069
So that was kind of our start to it.

640
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,210
And about six-ish months into it,

641
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,790
I think is when Microsoft approached us.

642
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,713
And I was pretty skeptical in the beginning.

643
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,914
Again, when you work in a specialty hospital doing

644
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,854
a specialty area, assistive technology,

645
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:07,495
you get approached sometimes by people

646
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:10,255
who have a project, a passion project, and want to do it.

647
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,736
And you see a lot of projects die.

648
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:15,097
And it's a waste of your time.

649
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:16,917
It's a waste of your resources.

650
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:21,598
And there are always reasons.

651
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:24,139
But it also is really disheartening to.

652
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:29,948
expose that potential to a patient and then take it away.

653
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:31,629
So that's kind of how I came at it.

654
00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:34,730
And that's kind of why I was probably a little skeptical

655
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,572
in those initial calls.

656
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:41,094
But those calls kind of evolved into some focus groups.

657
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,015
Bryce mentioned the team coming out to the hospital.

658
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:47,757
That was really interesting, having a whole team

659
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:49,858
kind of come in and kind of examine our space

660
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:50,719
and have those conversations.

661
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:53,680
And what I think was really interesting

662
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,601
was what they saw.

663
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,811
in addition to what we said.

664
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:58,851
So again, I take for granted that I work in a hospital,

665
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,012
so there's things I don't think about.

666
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:02,133
I don't really see the dents in the walls anymore

667
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,753
because it's my day to day.

668
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,214
So for the team to observe that and then come back

669
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:11,135
and really ask questions about that was really interesting.

670
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:14,737
And then of course, we were a part of the beta testing

671
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:16,957
with our patients and that ended up being

672
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:18,638
kind of a really cool thing to offer.

673
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:21,079
Like if you can imagine being in a hospital,

674
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,739
being in an uncomfortable position,

675
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,360
adjusting to.

676
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:28,574
you know, a major life change and just dealing with that.

677
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:31,936
And then all of a sudden, not only do we want you to play games, but we want to

678
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,277
want you to test this cool new thing that's not even out yet.

679
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:37,298
And you're not even allowed to talk about it.

680
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:40,459
So that that provided some really, really interesting and good motivation

681
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:45,302
for our patients and I think helped them see what they could contribute

682
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:51,104
and that their voice still mattered in that regard. Yeah.

683
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:53,345
So I will talk about these pictures a little bit.

684
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,204
because these are our patients, this is my hospital.

685
00:34:56,204 --> 00:35:02,246
I think, yeah, the upper, orientation-wise,

686
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,787
upper left and lower right, those two pictures

687
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,947
were in the official announcement video

688
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,008
for the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

689
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,309
And they show two very different people

690
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,629
with two very different abilities.

691
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,569
And that's pretty typical for our hospital.

692
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:20,831
And so it diversifies our use cases, I guess, in that regard.

693
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,611
But again, these guys are there at a game night.

694
00:35:23,611 --> 00:35:24,312
We host game nights.

695
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:31,149
weekly, and they're able to try the controller and really get a good feel for it and use

696
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:33,511
it to work towards their therapy goals as well.

697
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:40,754
So the guy on the bottom, you can see, like, he really has to work to look up at the screen

698
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:41,535
while he's playing.

699
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:45,117
Like, it's really hard for him to divide his attention between the two activities.

700
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:46,898
So that's like a really good therapy goal.

701
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:52,060
He also was unable to communicate and was using a device to talk, and he had to press

702
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,262
buttons to navigate that device.

703
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:54,302
So...

704
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,402
This controller actually helped him build skill and capacity

705
00:35:58,402 --> 00:35:59,763
to use his communication device.

706
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:01,544
And actually, eventually, to drive a wheelchair,

707
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:05,388
which we weren't sure he was going to be able to do.

708
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:08,350
The guy on the top was actually transitioning

709
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:12,073
between using a power wheelchair to using a manual wheelchair.

710
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:14,095
He was developing the strength to do that.

711
00:36:14,095 --> 00:36:18,059
And again, the big joysticks, he's using the buttons.

712
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,680
All the reaching he's having to do

713
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,662
is a great way to work on that strengthening.

714
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,023
Because if you

715
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,417
have someone all of a sudden wheeling around a hospital in a manual chair all day.

716
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,397
It's really tiring.

717
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:34,698
And then actually the guy on the bottom was transitioning also between using a power wheelchair

718
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:36,539
but with his mouth, right?

719
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:42,320
So using a sip and puff or a straw he would blow in to drive his wheelchair to a hand

720
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,580
control to drive his wheelchair.

721
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,821
And so the controller actually gave us the ability to have him work on both of those

722
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:50,962
skills and kind of transition between them, which was pretty cool.

723
00:36:53,873 --> 00:37:03,982
Okay, this is a photo of one of our game nights, and it's also a photo of maybe a different way to use

724
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:08,766
one of these, right? You know, Bryce talks about assumptions. We assume we have to hold on to this

725
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:14,090
thing, but a lot of my people cannot hold on to this thing. So the gentleman in the picture,

726
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,073
he can rest on the table, and then he can kind of use his hands on top of it,

727
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:21,877
use his knuckles, the side of his hands to get to the joystick. He can't get to the buttons on the back.

728
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,381
So that was probably a little bit of a limitation

729
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:26,022
before we had the adaptive controller.

730
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:28,123
But now with the adaptive controller,

731
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,464
we could actually break those two buttons out

732
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,285
and put them somewhere where he could reach them.

733
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:37,468
And then the guy next to him had been one

734
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,949
of our patients for a while and actually

735
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:40,470
was kind of a good example of how people could just

736
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,872
start to use gaming as a way to relate to each other

737
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:47,054
and have some common ground while they're in a hospital.

738
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:54,068
This is like a pretty heavy setup.

739
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:57,951
This is probably not something you guys imagined using it for.

740
00:37:57,951 --> 00:38:00,672
You know, I think when we talked to everybody,

741
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,834
we knew that we couldn't imagine everything

742
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,215
that it'd be used for.

743
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,976
We kind of got to that place.

744
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:06,456
Yeah.

745
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:10,159
So this patient had had a surgery

746
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,100
as a result of his injury that required

747
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,263
him to be on what we call flat bed rest for like 12 weeks.

748
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:19,104
So if you can imagine not being able to sit up or get out

749
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:20,125
of bed for 12 weeks, right?

750
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:20,405
That's.

751
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,332
That's pretty boring, especially in a hospital.

752
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:26,894
So the adaptive controller really

753
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:28,435
gave us the flexibility to put things

754
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:31,416
within his reach, which actually helped him maintain his strength

755
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:34,878
while he was on flatbed rest for that whole time.

756
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,840
The glasses he's wearing, again, it's probably

757
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,621
something people don't see.

758
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,702
The glasses actually have a mirror in them

759
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:43,884
so that the TV's in front of him and he could still see that.

760
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:45,464
That's a pretty low tech workaround,

761
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:47,466
and a little safer than suspending a TV

762
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,107
over top of someone, to be honest.

763
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:54,090
But we actually would bring him down to game night

764
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,411
in the hospital bed, wheel it all the way down,

765
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,712
so that he could get to know his roommates

766
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,674
unlike the other people in the hospital.

767
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,635
And again, the flexibility of the controller

768
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:05,957
allowed us to really put things where he could reach them,

769
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:06,597
change them.

770
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:09,379
You can see he's actually using a switch in his mouth

771
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:12,381
that he bites to do one of his button presses.

772
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:14,482
He's got a button on his chest that he can hit,

773
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:16,163
and then he's using a joystick with his left hand.

774
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:17,884
So that's so important.

775
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:18,385
I mean, just.

776
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:21,338
for his overall quality of life and his ability

777
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:23,439
to just kind of get through that moment.

778
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:25,059
His final setup looked a lot different

779
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,439
because he got to the point where he could,

780
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,320
he wasn't up in a chair, he was driving a wheelchair,

781
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,820
and the controller gave us that flexibility to mod it.

782
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,481
So, you know, those are some really extreme kind of cases.

783
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:38,742
And I mentioned before that last principle,

784
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:43,062
inclusive design, solve for one, extend to many.

785
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:46,823
So we started this device from that place

786
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:48,463
like solving those extreme cases.

787
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,786
But what we found along the way were some really interesting use cases about how to

788
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:55,508
use it for people who might have a less severe condition.

789
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:58,070
So this is my friend, Cherry Ray.

790
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,312
She's not here, so I'm going to like basically just make fun of her.

791
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:05,615
And when this goes up on the vault, it'll be there forever.

792
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:06,796
So hi, Cherry.

793
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:09,838
So you know, this is a picture of her.

794
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:15,632
And this is how an idea that she had that kind of came to her

795
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:18,634
for how she can use the controller.

796
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,856
Stick presses are really hard for her.

797
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:24,958
It is hard for her to use, to basically maneuver thumbsticks

798
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,920
and use them as buttons at the same time.

799
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,481
Happens for a lot of people.

800
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:30,482
So we mentioned Copilot before,

801
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:33,884
the ability to make two controllers seem like one.

802
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:36,926
So what Cherry can do is she can take the adaptive controller,

803
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:39,368
she can make these two big buttons into stick presses.

804
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:43,038
And then she can basically just use a controller.

805
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,339
And instead of pressing down on the stick,

806
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,740
she can just let her hands drop and let

807
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,001
gravity hit these buttons.

808
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:50,781
She can lean on them in different ways.

809
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,783
You can kind of move it forward and back.

810
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:56,583
So that was really powerful for us.

811
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:00,505
And when we talk with people who have RSI or arthritis

812
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:03,626
or other repetitive stress conditions,

813
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:07,628
we would hear stories like, I play Destiny for three hours

814
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:07,948
a night.

815
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,526
and then my fingers are on fire.

816
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:14,107
But those three hours are the most important three hours

817
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,948
of my day, because those are the three hours

818
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:18,449
that I spend with my friends.

819
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,469
So I ration that time.

820
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,451
I am not casual about how I use that time.

821
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,892
So we were always just like, well,

822
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:29,293
if you can change the movement from like this

823
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:34,836
to something else, maybe we could give you four hours.

824
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:36,797
That was the whole point.

825
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,490
How do we give someone more time to play?

826
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:48,577
So I'm going to transition a little bit

827
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:52,280
into how do I design for the Xbox Adaptive Controller?

828
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,582
So we get this question a lot from game developers.

829
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:58,585
How do I design for the Xbox Adaptive Controller?

830
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,946
And here is my answer.

831
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:03,248
Please don't.

832
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:05,890
So what does that mean?

833
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:05,930
OK.

834
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:09,345
I'm a designer.

835
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:13,767
I don't really believe in prescriptive guidance.

836
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,267
I'm not a fan.

837
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:17,608
I don't like people coming up to me and telling me what to do.

838
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:20,009
I like being told what the problem is.

839
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:21,249
Right?

840
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:26,091
So when we're talking about creating games for people

841
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:30,733
with limited mobility, I'd rather people ask these questions,

842
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:34,835
apply it to their game, and I believe that if they ask these

843
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,615
questions, their games will be better.

844
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,610
Not only for people who use the adaptive controller,

845
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,810
but for people who use like a typical controller,

846
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,291
for people who use mouse and keyboard,

847
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,732
for people who use other input devices.

848
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,913
I think we are getting to a place

849
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:54,055
where we can't design for just one device modality anymore.

850
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:57,196
So I don't want to put out into the world,

851
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:59,717
do this for the adaptive controller.

852
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:01,038
So what are my questions?

853
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:02,278
Here they are.

854
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:03,859
I'm going to go through some examples.

855
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,340
And we'll kind of get back to these in a bit.

856
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:09,190
Can your controller remapping be as unique as your gameplay?

857
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,071
We have robust controller remapping

858
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:12,912
on the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

859
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,993
You should still do it in your game.

860
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:16,974
There's a lot of reasons for it.

861
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,835
What unique game assists can tune

862
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:22,077
your gameplay for individuals?

863
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:27,860
Would secondary action facilitators hurt gameplay?

864
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,581
Can you have fun with simple controls?

865
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:31,982
And I use that word fun in particular.

866
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,377
Because I think a lot of the times when we're talking

867
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:38,058
about the games that we create, we think about mastery.

868
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:40,579
We think about being able to compete.

869
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,840
And I'm using the word, can we have fun?

870
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,702
Is precision vital to progression?

871
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:50,623
And my example there is Sniper versus Shotgun.

872
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:53,844
Are simultaneous actions required?

873
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:57,386
This one I'm going to be a little prescriptive.

874
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,387
Please try not to do simultaneous actions.

875
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,467
It's very hard for people.

876
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:07,292
Can inaccurate timing be forgiven?

877
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,113
Can timing be flexible?

878
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,794
Oh, we got Minecraft here,

879
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:12,796
we got a little creeper coming out of the water.

880
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:18,779
Minecraft's a really interesting example for me

881
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:21,781
because Minecraft has, you know,

882
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,563
some really decent controller remapping.

883
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:28,125
There are more actually actions in Minecraft's...

884
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,488
controls, then there are buttons on a controller.

885
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:34,769
So they have to give you the ability

886
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:35,590
to choose what you want to do.

887
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,070
There's some things you can't do on a typical controller.

888
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,531
But for me, what I really like is this tiny little accelerator,

889
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:42,351
which is auto jump.

890
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:46,192
Because now all of a sudden, when I'm going up this hill,

891
00:44:46,192 --> 00:44:49,253
I don't have to keep going A, A, A, A.

892
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,294
I don't have to do that repetitive action.

893
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:57,515
It's a tiny accelerator that doesn't really affect gameplay.

894
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,047
but makes the world of difference to someone who's hitting this button.

895
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,508
I'm going to talk about Fortnite.

896
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:06,190
Here's the accessibility menu in Fortnite.

897
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,992
I am not going to talk about anything in the accessibility menu.

898
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:14,956
What I'm going to talk about is the feature that they have on console,

899
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,717
which is sprint by default.

900
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:20,099
So, we talk about simultaneous action.

901
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:23,049
The fact that I can go here and say,

902
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,351
yes, I'm going to sprint by default.

903
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,433
I don't have to hold that stick down to run.

904
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,316
I'm just always going to run, has opened up

905
00:45:30,316 --> 00:45:32,337
this game for people immensely.

906
00:45:32,337 --> 00:45:34,679
I know some people who play Fortnite

907
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,761
with the adaptive controller.

908
00:45:36,761 --> 00:45:37,982
They cannot use left stick.

909
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:40,424
We have a feature on the adaptive controller

910
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:43,687
that lets you assign stick movement to a button.

911
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:44,668
So her name's Mellie.

912
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:45,649
She lives in Germany.

913
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,912
She puts a button between her knees,

914
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,093
and when she presses that button,

915
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:51,575
her character runs forward.

916
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:55,078
So in a first-person shooter, or in a game like Fortnite,

917
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:57,159
her character just runs forward.

918
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,861
She uses right stick to steer.

919
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,443
She doesn't strafe, she doesn't go backwards.

920
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:03,325
She just goes for it.

921
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,607
But the fact that she doesn't have to do

922
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,849
a simultaneous action hit sprint by default is a big deal.

923
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,573
One stick, two buttons, all you need to play.

924
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:14,154
Inside.

925
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,724
I love this game.

926
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:22,926
I love the idea of this, you know, that it's,

927
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,867
you have such a rich thing,

928
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:28,389
you have such rich gameplay with just the simple controls.

929
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:31,810
I wasn't very good here, I forgot what I had to do.

930
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:38,974
And then I remembered, so I sped it up there a little.

931
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:40,695
Yeah, all that, two buttons.

932
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,216
This is my youngest daughter.

933
00:46:43,566 --> 00:47:06,117
In front of an Xbox adaptive controller and a monitor demonstrating something we have in a facility we have at Microsoft called the inclusive tech lab. It's rocket league with no hands so she has a rock band pedal that she's using for accelerate and you can see that her knee is between what's 2 buttons sort of mounted to the desk so she pushes on that rock band pedal and she steers the car by hitting these 2 buttons it's very digital.

934
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:08,958
Like digital digital digital.

935
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:13,552
So her movement is very specific.

936
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:15,933
The other thing that you can see is by her head,

937
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,673
she's hitting a little button.

938
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:19,454
So I said no hands, I didn't say all feet.

939
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:22,174
So she's got that button there,

940
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:25,735
and that's her jump button is that little head button.

941
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:28,616
And we like this in the lab because it shows,

942
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:30,296
it shows a very simple control.

943
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:32,717
The great thing about Rocket League,

944
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,597
one of my favorite things about it,

945
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,318
is in their controller remapping,

946
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:37,538
they have controller remapping

947
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:38,998
which is contextual to their game.

948
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:42,823
So you can do acceleration in reverse,

949
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:44,104
you can map it to a thumb stick.

950
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:48,507
So it's very possible to play Rocket League

951
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:50,648
with just the thumb stick.

952
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:55,171
You might not be able to do everything,

953
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:58,213
but again, can you have fun?

954
00:47:58,213 --> 00:48:00,234
You might not be able to master it,

955
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:03,876
but can you have fun with the simplest of controls?

956
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:06,277
I'm Canadian, so hockey, Rocket League,

957
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:08,999
that's really why.

958
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,651
We have to talk about Celeste.

959
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:14,974
Celeste gives you the option to turn on assist mode

960
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,294
when you kind of come in.

961
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,616
Now, the developers of Celeste said

962
00:48:18,616 --> 00:48:20,677
that they didn't believe in assist mode,

963
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:24,999
but I really, really thank them for putting it in anyway.

964
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,801
And Celeste's assist mode is wonderful.

965
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:30,663
It lets you do things like turn down the speed of your game,

966
00:48:30,663 --> 00:48:32,143
you can turn on infinite stamina,

967
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:34,645
air dashes you can make infinite,

968
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,706
and then you can turn on invincibility.

969
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,587
This might not be the game that you envisioned.

970
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:43,619
But for a lot of people, this really opens up

971
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,399
this amazing title to them.

972
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:47,680
It's super wonderful that they did it.

973
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,001
I like air dashes because I can pull a Superman through the level.

974
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:52,221
It's like a superwoman, I think.

975
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,301
Let's talk about Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

976
00:48:53,301 --> 00:48:57,623
Here's their accessibility menu.

977
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:01,364
There's some wonderful work in there.

978
00:49:01,364 --> 00:49:02,884
There's fantastic work that they did.

979
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:09,931
One of the things that I really like is that you have the ability to change weapon aiming

980
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:12,553
from left stick or from right stick to just left stick.

981
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:14,475
So you can do a lot with just the left stick.

982
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:15,856
It's great.

983
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:17,817
One stick kind of being able to play.

984
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:25,464
The other thing that they did which was really, really tuned to their game and just wonderful

985
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:29,267
was the idea of having different types of difficulty.

986
00:49:29,757 --> 00:49:31,678
for the types of action you're playing,

987
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:34,258
like combat difficulty versus exploration difficulty

988
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:36,059
versus puzzle.

989
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,760
The fact that they have these assists

990
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,281
and they're so tunable really makes this game really great.

991
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:48,202
So, I just kind of want to get back to this.

992
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:51,243
Can your controller mapping be as unique as your gameplay?

993
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:53,583
You know, Rocket League, good example of that.

994
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,204
What unique game assists can tune your gameplay

995
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:57,064
for individuals?

996
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:58,825
Shadow of the Tomb Raider has some awesome assists.

997
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:01,086
Really great stuff in there.

998
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:04,008
Would secondary action facilitators hurt gameplay?

999
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:06,789
Auto jump in Minecraft, things like that.

1000
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:08,690
Would it really change your game a ton?

1001
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,532
Can you have fun with simple controls,

1002
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:13,033
not necessarily compete?

1003
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,034
Rocket League inside, things like that.

1004
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:17,456
Is precision vital to progression?

1005
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:18,797
I didn't show an example for that,

1006
00:50:18,797 --> 00:50:20,538
but I think you'll kind of get it.

1007
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:22,359
Simultaneous actions required.

1008
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:25,521
One of the great things in that Shadow of the Tomb Raider

1009
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,630
accessibility menus that allows you to kind of tone down your quick time events.

1010
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,291
Even though it's something they're kind of known for,

1011
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,572
they've given you a lot of options for kind of getting by them.

1012
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:35,972
This last one is tricky.

1013
00:50:35,972 --> 00:50:40,594
The example is basically Celeste and the ability to slow the game down.

1014
00:50:40,594 --> 00:50:43,915
But one of the things that we always kind of hear from people is

1015
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,276
that they don't necessarily want the game to be easier.

1016
00:50:47,276 --> 00:50:49,896
They just want to have more time.

1017
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:53,297
And I think people with cognitive, like, cognitive limitations.

1018
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:55,324
can kind of just need an extra second.

1019
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:58,427
Yeah, just to kind of figure out, navigate, process,

1020
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:00,749
and react without dying.

1021
00:51:00,749 --> 00:51:01,649
So I really want to kind of do a demo,

1022
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:05,933
but I also really want to make sure I have time for questions.

1023
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:08,835
Actually, maybe I could do a demo later

1024
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,657
if someone wants to see it.

1025
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:12,819
I have this button here.

1026
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,040
But maybe we can line up for some questions,

1027
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,422
and I'll try to do the demo at the same time.

1028
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:16,922
Is that cool?

1029
00:51:16,922 --> 00:51:17,883
Does anyone have questions?

1030
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,644
We would ask you to go to the mic.

1031
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,386
If you can't go to the mic, just shout your question out

1032
00:51:22,386 --> 00:51:23,267
and we'll repeat it.

1033
00:51:24,903 --> 00:51:25,883
No questions questions.

1034
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:29,444
Oh here we go yeah thank you the first ones the hardest right.

1035
00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:30,704
Oh boy OK there's a fight.

1036
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:36,165
It's a total softball I want to know where you can get them where you can get them.

1037
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:41,407
You can get the Xbox adaptive controller at a Microsoft store at Microsoft stores online.

1038
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:46,168
So if you go to the Westfield center like just like a block from here in the Microsoft store they have them.

1039
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:49,329
And are they available in other countries or is that you know we're available.

1040
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:54,230
I don't have the countries listed off the top of my head but we announced in Mexico City that we're working on.

1041
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:58,196
expanding them to more of the world.

1042
00:51:58,196 --> 00:52:01,879
So we're going to have an announcement

1043
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:02,799
in the future about that.

1044
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:03,320
Sorry.

1045
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,440
But like right now?

1046
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,663
Right now it's like US, Canada,

1047
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:10,185
most of, a lot of parts of Europe.

1048
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:14,247
I think kind of typically what you would expect.

1049
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:14,668
Thanks.

1050
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,929
Thank you.

1051
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:17,089
Sorry.

1052
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:17,870
Right on.

1053
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,951
Please.

1054
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:33,000
I just wanted to how you got from you know getting the product out to Super Bowl commercial

1055
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,002
Sorry, you know, I think I think

1056
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:38,243
What I can say is that

1057
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:43,046
The response has been

1058
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:53,033
We've had heaps and heaps of accolades it is super appreciated we have been overwhelmed and

1059
00:52:53,033 --> 00:52:53,413
we just

1060
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:56,050
We love this story and we love that people love this story.

1061
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:00,194
So the way that we got to the Super Bowl commercial

1062
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:03,476
was basically we were going to do a holiday commercial.

1063
00:53:03,476 --> 00:53:05,678
So Reindeer Games was our holiday commercial.

1064
00:53:05,678 --> 00:53:08,580
That's where you guys met Owen.

1065
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,502
And we had a lot of fun doing that commercial.

1066
00:53:10,502 --> 00:53:12,103
We got to work with the community.

1067
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:14,365
We got to work with not only Owen,

1068
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,567
but we got to interview and audition

1069
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,368
a lot of players for that.

1070
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:21,036
for that role.

1071
00:53:21,036 --> 00:53:24,257
And when Reindeer Games, the holiday ad, did so well,

1072
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:26,177
basically the team kind of went,

1073
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,718
oh, let's really amp this up.

1074
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:30,859
And so we already had a group of kids

1075
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:32,959
that basically were like,

1076
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,680
that were in the audition sort of,

1077
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,621
that were in our audition process.

1078
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,122
So we basically went back and talked to them all.

1079
00:53:40,122 --> 00:53:44,003
And I think the one thing that I super appreciate

1080
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,724
what the team did was that even though we had a story

1081
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,944
to tell for the holiday ad,

1082
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:52,345
For the Super Bowl ad, they really doubled down on making sure that the kids talked.

1083
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:57,889
And that we got to see, you know, these kids and they could talk with their own voices.

1084
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:00,551
And that was something that was super important to us.

1085
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:01,092
Ian?

1086
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:06,376
It's kind of related to the first question.

1087
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:12,962
So if anyone in the room is interested in building their own input devices to plug into the Adaptive Controller,

1088
00:54:12,962 --> 00:54:17,265
what advice would you give them and are there any resources available for them?

1089
00:54:18,245 --> 00:54:19,866
So we do have an input spec.

1090
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:22,748
Oh, sorry, the question was do we have a spec

1091
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:25,470
to be able to build your own input devices.

1092
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,573
I will say that buttons are a very simple thing.

1093
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:31,315
You can take a headphone cable, cut it off,

1094
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:34,157
cut the headphone cable off, take the wires,

1095
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:37,300
touch them together, and it'll fire the button.

1096
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,441
That's what an open switch is, right?

1097
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:41,603
You're completing the connection.

1098
00:54:41,603 --> 00:54:43,865
So we do have a spec online that allows you

1099
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,987
to design and build your own buttons.

1100
00:54:46,945 --> 00:54:53,550
As long as well as potentiometer based devices for analog controls like triggers and joysticks.

1101
00:54:53,550 --> 00:55:01,978
I would encourage people to do that just as a selfish person in health care who's looking for more inputs

1102
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:06,241
And maybe lower cost inputs like please take a crack at it and let us know what you have

1103
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:06,561
Yeah

1104
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:09,484
Sorry this side okay, yeah

1105
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:14,818
So it's really great work with the controller.

1106
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:22,942
The thing that I'm wondering is how are you spreading this information to other healthcare

1107
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:32,447
like, I'm from Norway, so how would personnel in Norway get to know how to actually use

1108
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:33,207
this controller?

1109
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:38,349
Yeah, I think that's a great question and a question that we hear a lot and I think

1110
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:38,810
every time.

1111
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:41,885
These guys put out another commercial.

1112
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:43,845
My inbox gets flooded with questions, right?

1113
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:50,386
So, I'm doing a lot of talking, you know, for, so for those that are here, here you go.

1114
00:55:50,386 --> 00:55:52,907
Microsoft does have some resources online.

1115
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:55,507
Bryce can speak to what you guys have online.

1116
00:55:55,507 --> 00:55:57,947
And then I know some of the nonprofits also are starting to put

1117
00:55:57,947 --> 00:56:00,028
out videos and information as well.

1118
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:02,048
So, just reach out to the community.

1119
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:03,769
Yeah.

1120
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:04,409
Yeah.

1121
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,109
I mean, I do think that this is.

1122
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:08,995
this is new ground for a lot of us.

1123
00:56:08,995 --> 00:56:11,336
And I think there's a lot that we can all do

1124
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:15,777
to kind of put this information out into the world.

1125
00:56:15,777 --> 00:56:20,479
But yeah, I would just encourage you to kind of keep at it,

1126
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,180
keep engaging with us,

1127
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,761
keep engaging with people with disabilities.

1128
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,021
We're all gonna learn.

1129
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:27,742
If you think about how long it took

1130
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:30,123
to get to the form of what a modern controller is,

1131
00:56:30,123 --> 00:56:33,584
and now we've opened up something that's like,

1132
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:36,585
I just wanna, there's a lot that we can explore.

1133
00:56:38,761 --> 00:57:00,724
Yeah, I am wondering about if you guys have plans for integrating or allowing this to be used as a controller with windows mixed reality headsets or VR in general because like I know some games you use controllers and like I've

1134
00:57:01,347 --> 00:57:09,709
helped try to give demos of VR games to some people in wheelchairs and with paraplegics and

1135
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:19,432
they love seeing these worlds that are typically like five or ten feet away through a small screen.

1136
00:57:19,432 --> 00:57:28,295
They're in the world and having a controller like this is so fundamental to that system but I don't

1137
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:30,715
know how your teams are currently...

1138
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:34,250
Talking OK.

1139
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:39,614
Windows 10 and Xbox One don't see the Xbox adaptive controller any differently than this.

1140
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:40,655
They're the same thing.

1141
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:47,640
So if you're mixed reality game you can work with a with a traditional Xbox controller.

1142
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,302
It will work with the Xbox adaptive controller.

1143
00:57:50,302 --> 00:57:50,503
Thank you.

1144
00:57:50,503 --> 00:57:51,443
Yeah over here.

1145
00:57:51,443 --> 00:58:01,151
So I want to just first say thank you for making this because you actually touched.

1146
00:58:01,987 --> 00:58:06,911
one of my friends lives with this and thank you so much for doing that.

1147
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:10,534
So my question is kind of from the research side of things.

1148
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:16,399
So with a lot of, this unfortunately is my area of human-computer interaction,

1149
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:22,324
but I know that there's a lot of research into input devices

1150
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:24,445
and the therapeutic effect that they have,

1151
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:28,048
and I've not yet seen any papers published on this.

1152
00:58:29,154 --> 00:58:31,055
you know, are there going to be papers published

1153
00:58:31,055 --> 00:58:32,897
on the therapeutic effects of this?

1154
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:39,621
And also, could you elaborate a little bit more on that?

1155
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,743
Oh, oh. I'm working in healthcare

1156
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:43,784
and medical research is slow.

1157
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:44,445
Yes, yeah.

1158
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:46,446
There's, okay, it's slow.

1159
00:58:46,446 --> 00:58:49,789
There's a lot of rules about hurting or not hurting

1160
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,910
and who you can work with and who you can't.

1161
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,731
So I do envision things will come out.

1162
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,073
If you do a lit review of just gaming and therapy,

1163
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:57,694
you already get a ton of things.

1164
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:03,388
Some of them are really old things right now, talking about really old devices,

1165
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:07,550
and that's I think because of the amount of time it takes to do research.

1166
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:08,130
But stay tuned.

1167
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:08,770
I mean, I would say it's coming.

1168
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:08,970
Yeah.

1169
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:09,370
Awesome. Thank you.

1170
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:13,572
I want to just, before I ask the question, I just want to give people a quick demo.

1171
00:59:13,572 --> 00:59:18,414
Twin stick 3D world game Minecraft, two sticks, one to look around, one to, you know, move.

1172
00:59:18,414 --> 00:59:22,616
I've set this button with the adaptive controller to be like a shift key.

1173
00:59:22,616 --> 00:59:24,517
It allows me to change what button values are.

1174
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:25,757
It even allows me to swap sticks.

1175
00:59:26,336 --> 00:59:29,238
So when I do this demo and you see me do this,

1176
00:59:29,238 --> 00:59:30,800
now I'm looking, now I'm moving,

1177
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,383
now I'm looking, now I'm moving, right?

1178
00:59:34,383 --> 00:59:36,344
Just so when you see me watch,

1179
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:37,846
so you know what's going on.

1180
00:59:37,846 --> 00:59:40,328
Yeah, which side were we on?

1181
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,429
I guess this side.

1182
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:41,829
That side.

1183
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,591
So I was just wondering how you arrived at the decision,

1184
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:46,213
especially with the...

1185
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,253
massive enlargement of the buttons. How did you arrive at the decision to have a

1186
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:53,394
standard-sized D-pad on the adaptive controller?

1187
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:58,217
So the D-pad is actually a hundred and fifty percent bigger than our one on our

1188
00:59:58,217 --> 01:00:03,541
regular controllers. I mean I will say that you know we knew we

1189
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:08,824
wanted a bigger one. I think that in my personal opinion I think that we could

1190
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:11,446
have the D-pad is the one thing I wish we could kind of go back and look at the

1191
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:14,888
but yeah it's a hundred and fifty percent it was

1192
01:00:15,595 --> 01:00:16,696
It was really about symmetry.

1193
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:22,220
We didn't expect, we wanted to make sure that people had something that they could navigate the dash.

1194
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,521
And that was primarily what it was intended for.

1195
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:24,962
Thank you.

1196
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:26,142
Yeah, you're welcome.

1197
01:00:26,142 --> 01:00:33,647
Hi. I know that you talked about, hey, don't design specifically for the adaptive controller.

1198
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:33,747
Don't.

1199
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:34,028
Don't.

1200
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:34,808
Yeah. Okay.

1201
01:00:34,808 --> 01:00:41,833
So I was thinking, though, if, let's say if people did start creating something like.

1202
01:00:42,547 --> 01:00:46,728
Alt Control GDC or Nintendo's ladder or Steel Battalion.

1203
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:54,269
Would you be concerned about the standards of the controller being made over complicated

1204
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:55,410
again or do you think it's...

1205
01:00:55,410 --> 01:01:02,351
We've gotten the Alt Control GDC question today and I will say I really did try to get

1206
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:03,491
something in there this year.

1207
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:05,232
I just kind of ran out of time.

1208
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:09,853
So when I say don't design for the controller, I don't...

1209
01:01:10,722 --> 01:01:13,903
I mean, if someone wants to create something unique,

1210
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,844
the last thing I ever want to do as someone who makes platforms

1211
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:19,965
is tell a game designer how to design anything, right?

1212
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:24,187
So, if someone wants to create something unique with this device,

1213
01:01:24,187 --> 01:01:25,107
I am happy to do that.

1214
01:01:25,107 --> 01:01:29,309
I just get concerned when people want to break a game down

1215
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:33,450
in a simple way that is far too focused on this device.

1216
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,971
And what I mean by that is that

1217
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:37,452
if you made something that would work with this device,

1218
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:38,632
it would also make...

1219
01:01:39,372 --> 01:01:46,719
Games with a typical controller better for people with limited mobility as well. Okay. Okay, so just think broader not specific

1220
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:52,344
Yeah, but I mean I think your idea of I mean one of the things that came up really early on was that someone built

1221
01:01:52,344 --> 01:01:58,410
a joystick that uses potentiometers that they could stand on and they literally lean on it like a pogo stick and it would go like

1222
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,872
You know and that and that'll work

1223
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:03,959
You know, when people ask me, I think one of the things

1224
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:05,540
that we need to start talking about soon,

1225
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,103
like Ian kind of suggested, was the maker community, right?

1226
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:12,487
And so when people ask me, when people don't quite get

1227
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:15,149
what this thing is and they're like kind of entrenched

1228
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,871
in gamer culture, I basically go,

1229
01:02:16,871 --> 01:02:20,734
hey, you could build a wicked arcade cabinet with this thing.

1230
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:21,535
And then they get it.

1231
01:02:21,535 --> 01:02:24,058
That's really kind of it.

1232
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:24,238
Cool.

1233
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:41,402
So kind of an opposite question. Do you have any intentions of making a standard peripheral that could be used by somebody who has no prior knowledge of how to set up a gaming controller or how to operate something like this?

1234
01:02:41,402 --> 01:02:54,850
So so the question as I understand it. When you say this, you mean specifically the Xbox adaptive control. Yeah, I mean things like buttons that you didn't necessarily have to make out of a headphone wire. Yeah, so.

1235
01:02:55,549 --> 01:03:00,377
I mean, I will say that that's one of the areas that we need to work on.

1236
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,800
We recognize that.

1237
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,107
And the challenge is that, as you saw from our examples today, there's a huge range of

1238
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:06,367
ability.

1239
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:06,447
So,

1240
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:06,647
So,

1241
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:06,768
So,

1242
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:07,088
So,

1243
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:07,128
So,

1244
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:07,309
So,

1245
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:07,509
So,

1246
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:07,609
So,

1247
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:07,689
So,

1248
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:07,849
So,

1249
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:07,890
So,

1250
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:07,950
So,

1251
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,591
So,

1252
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:09,051
So,

1253
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:09,352
So,

1254
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:09,452
So,

1255
01:03:09,905 --> 01:03:15,528
While when someone comes up to me or Aaron or someone who's basically in this field,

1256
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:20,050
we can typically quickly come up with a rig that probably works for them, but we certainly

1257
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,432
recognize that that might not be the easiest thing for people.

1258
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:30,715
So we need to tell better stories of how people can use this device because I know that now

1259
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:36,438
that the commercial's out, you know, people get how kids with one hand can use this device,

1260
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,438
but that's not.

1261
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:43,710
That's not a broad enough group of individuals, right?

1262
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:49,875
So we need to tell those stories better.

1263
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:55,158
We need to continue to basically give people this inspiration

1264
01:03:55,158 --> 01:03:56,439
about how they can build devices with this.

1265
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:58,420
And for us, this is the start of the journey.

1266
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,102
We're trying to figure out what's next.

1267
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:00,502
Cool.

1268
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:00,802
Thanks.

1269
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:02,283
Want to play more Minecraft?

1270
01:04:02,283 --> 01:04:03,244
So yeah.

1271
01:04:03,244 --> 01:04:05,926
So movement, auto jump.

1272
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,961
When I hold this, it's jump, right?

1273
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:13,662
But when I shift, right, okay, let me shift.

1274
01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:16,563
So when I shift, all of a sudden this button is now, oops,

1275
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:16,903
or it isn't.

1276
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:17,863
Oh yeah, now it's mine.

1277
01:04:17,863 --> 01:04:21,864
So think of that, like not only are we swapping the sticks

1278
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:26,325
with the shift button, we're swapping what buttons are.

1279
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:31,527
And that's a great way to reduce the number

1280
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:35,088
of buttons you might need.

1281
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:45,859
You know yeah so we use that demo and then the other nice thing about the big buttons is that you know you can hold this thing and still hit these big ones like while you're holding hey we got another question.

1282
01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:50,663
I will repeat your question.

1283
01:04:50,663 --> 01:05:00,392
You guys are leading this on the Windows 10 Xbox front to see and you said it's seen as a regular Xbox controller has there been any talk about.

1284
01:05:00,935 --> 01:05:04,838
collaborating with the other platforms or phones and Android and iOS?

1285
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:10,184
Yeah, no, so when we launched the Xbox Adaptive Controller,

1286
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:17,270
or when we announced it, Phil said that we would share our knowledge with the world.

1287
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,173
We are completely open to working with other companies.

1288
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:21,334
I cannot speak for other companies,

1289
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:25,118
but what I can tell people is that...

1290
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:53,946
We share all this knowledge I run a facility at Microsoft called the inclusive tech lab I've had all kinds of developers that are not Microsoft game developers you know actually Robert spoke at one of our events today and he's a from Wizards of the Coast Wizards has come by the lab a bunch of times we are very open to sharing what we know with the community but I can't speak for any other kind of development has but I actually you know so I can't talk to them.

1291
01:05:53,946 --> 01:05:54,546
Thank you.

1292
01:05:58,957 --> 01:05:59,758
How you guys doing?

1293
01:05:59,758 --> 01:06:02,400
Ian's coming back up.

1294
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,180
Thanks for coming.

1295
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,821
Thank you, yeah.

1296
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,222
Oh, Ian's sitting back down.

1297
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,423
You know us, well no, ask Ian, come on.

1298
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:09,625
No one's kicking us out yet.

1299
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,267
I'm not seeing anybody yelling at us.

1300
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:12,487
Are you?

1301
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:13,643
Yeah, all right.

1302
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:16,424
All right, cool.

1303
01:06:16,424 --> 01:06:20,587
So it was just another question related to the maker community.

1304
01:06:20,587 --> 01:06:23,468
So you mentioned one thing, like the giant oversize controller.

1305
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:24,809
I mean, already there's been tons

1306
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:26,830
of people making loads of really cool, interesting stuff.

1307
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,591
So just wondering if you have any favorites?

1308
01:06:28,591 --> 01:06:30,672
Any favorites from the maker community?

1309
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:35,394
Well, I mean, the one thing that I think for many of our teams

1310
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:40,096
that was really tricky was all of the charities

1311
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,537
that we worked with are makers.

1312
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,382
So when we would start to talk with marketing about,

1313
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:49,663
oh, we're gonna do a maker beat next,

1314
01:06:49,663 --> 01:06:51,564
they were like, what?

1315
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:52,965
And they didn't quite get it.

1316
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:56,566
And they didn't quite realize that people with disabilities

1317
01:06:56,566 --> 01:06:59,167
are like the original life hackers, like let's get real.

1318
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,288
Right, so all of these folks,

1319
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:05,249
we are here to learn from them and kind of build off them.

1320
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:06,270
Do I have favorites?

1321
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,090
The rimless guys are here.

1322
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,531
I could talk about their stuff.

1323
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:11,072
I'm really excited about their work.

1324
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:16,976
The Limitless guys are doing some amazing stuff with prosthetics and there's really

1325
01:07:16,976 --> 01:07:19,558
great potential for how we can think about it.

1326
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:19,859
Cool.

1327
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:21,560
That's our cue.

1328
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,142
Thank you.

1329
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:23,763
Thank you.
