1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:07,350
Game aims squarely at me because it is narrative and turn-based tile strategy all in one.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,271
So as I begin, we're watching some pre-recorded footage here. Feel free to ask questions for

3
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:17,792
John and Tom while we're talking. We're here to talk about making Pendragon, so please be sure to

4
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:22,193
square your questions that way. And yeah, we're just gonna have a conversation about

5
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:25,173
making these games, but I should let them introduce themselves. John, Tom, how are you doing?

6
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,736
We're good! I mean launch day is always a bit crazy.

7
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:33,577
I'm suffering a little bit from having pressed the refresh button on Twitter

8
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:38,739
just a few thousand too many times today, but otherwise I'm good.

9
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,800
It's been really nice actually as we've launched a lot of games.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,561
Inkle's been going about 10 years now and this is the first time that we've

11
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:50,102
launched a game that we actually had finished like two weeks ago.

12
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:53,924
Like normally you kind of sprint to the final line but this one we

13
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,645
because we knew the game is so complicated and so...

14
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:02,690
like weirdly put together that we really were very scared about getting it solid and tested.

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,753
So we started testing ages ago and then we finished testing and then for the last few

16
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:13,178
weeks we've been going, should we add this? Nah, let's not add that. It's been quite relaxed

17
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:16,920
actually for some in some ways but launch day is always launch day. It's always nerve-wracking.

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,444
So we're okay. We're okay. Yeah and uh John we've had you on the stream before. Tom you're new to

19
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:24,105
the stream. Would you mind introducing yourself?

20
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:28,288
Hi, yeah, I'm Tom. I am, uh, John, what's my job title?

21
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:32,453
Um, uh, you're senior designer developer now.

22
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,295
I, it's all the words.

23
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,496
I make things with John Inkle.

24
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,478
And yeah, everything John was saying, like, we took today off, in fact,

25
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,482
because apparently we're that confident or stupid.

26
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:51,004
But nothing seems to have gone wrong, which is really nice.

27
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,647
And yeah, such a change of pace to normally how games get released.

28
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:55,588
Yeah.

29
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:01,774
Sorry everyone who has caught me looking down my phone. I had to tweet out that we're live. We you know

30
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:08,079
It's it's alive. It's live television. This is where we make our mistakes for you to see a quick shout out to father

31
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,982
Let in chat. Thank you for joining us today father. We'd love to have you

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,961
John and Tom, let's get to it.

33
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:20,002
Pendragon, like I said, narrative game, turn-based strategy, and it's cool.

34
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:20,382
It's neat.

35
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:24,663
You're seeing me discover how cool and neat it is right now where I'm navigating a conversation

36
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:26,304
by doing turn-based strategy things.

37
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:33,245
Can you tell me how this game started and what were Inkle's design goals after the interesting

38
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,686
game that was interesting and ambitious, Heaven's Vault?

39
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:37,726
Yeah.

40
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:38,006
So...

41
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,196
The chronology doesn't quite work like that.

42
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:46,899
The game, Pentagram was already quite heavily designed

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,681
by the time we released Heaven's Vault.

44
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,363
So, but the two are kind of connected.

45
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,144
Basically while we were working on Heaven's Vault,

46
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,066
which is like a big 3D game, lots of cameras,

47
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,688
lots of like fucking around with 3D and stuff like that.

48
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,391
When we wanted to not be working on Heaven's Vault,

49
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,953
when we needed a break, especially Tom,

50
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:06,974
Tom was building a,

51
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:13,830
turn-based strategy prototype board game, mostly just because it was the most unlike

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,412
Kevin's vault thing he could possibly do with his spare time while still making a game.

53
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:19,733
That's about right, isn't it, Tom?

54
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:20,953
It's about right, yeah.

55
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:27,115
Yeah, and so we were messing around with that and kind of over lunch breaks and like when we

56
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:30,776
went to the pub in the evenings and we'd just sort of try out the rules of this game and sort of

57
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:31,477
play it.

58
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:35,876
And after about maybe two years of fiddling around with that prototype,

59
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:39,519
we ended up with a really good, really strong two-player game

60
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,080
that was a little bit like chess or a little bit like checkers.

61
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,162
And it was played with counters on a 5x5 board,

62
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,844
and you could have made it out of wood and sold it in a shop.

63
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:52,246
And we kind of thought, well, we can't do anything with that

64
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,707
because we make narrative games,

65
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:57,570
and you can't possibly stick a narrative on a game like that, can you?

66
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,962
But then once you have a feeling like that, once you have a question like, well, you can't possibly do that, can you?

67
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,944
You start to think, well, or can you?

68
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:11,667
That's kind of how Pendragon happened, I think, with like after the end of Heaven's Vault,

69
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:14,269
we had this sense that we didn't really know what to do next.

70
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,970
We didn't want to make Heaven's Vault 2.

71
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,871
We had this prototype knocking around.

72
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:22,814
So I think we kind of thought, well, let's just see how far we can take this idea of

73
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:26,577
putting a narrative onto an abstract strategy board game and making it work.

74
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:31,949
Because it won't work, it's gonna fall apart, it's gonna go wrong, this is a ridiculous idea, it can't be done.

75
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:37,431
And then we carried on doing it and like, yeah, now we've released it and it appears to work.

76
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:40,953
So we've gone to the other end of it, but...

77
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,854
Tom, do you want to tell any of your experience aside from, you know, fiddling?

78
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:47,636
It's cool to see a game that you fiddle with in your spare time become, you know, a full game.

79
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:53,601
Yeah, I mean it's honestly the dream, at least it's certainly my dream, to have like a boss be like,

80
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:58,105
oh let's make that game you've been playing with. But yeah, it goes back a really long way. It

81
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:03,410
actually goes back to when I first joined the company and we were porting 80 Days to Steam,

82
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,494
and that's when, at least according to my notes that I've been keeping, it goes back to 2015,

83
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:13,579
and I remember showing it to Joe, because I think...

84
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:18,384
John, you were off having your second kid, so Joe actually played it a lot more at the time.

85
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:22,508
And then when Joe went off to have his kid, that's when you started playing it with me.

86
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:26,511
And that's when you started throwing these dangerous ideas of adding a story to it.

87
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:27,893
And I started getting all scared.

88
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:32,077
And you proposed that you would add the AI to the game,

89
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:35,600
because I couldn't play it against myself, so I had to test it over lunch.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,882
You said, I'll ride the AI.

91
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:43,761
and then I might also add a story or something? I was like yeah sure that sounds like a good idea.

92
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:47,202
I made a Fausti impact with you which was I agreed to write you in AI

93
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,205
on the condition that I could also write a narrative layer for it and you were like yeah

94
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:58,088
sure that sounds like a fair trade. Slowly over the next two years the narrative layer took your

95
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:01,110
beautiful balanced symmetric game and ripped it to pieces.

96
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:21,943
Yeah, let's talk, uh, we're actually, the game is demonstrating something interesting, which is, so unlike, this, this strategy game has a little bit of chess in it, which is, uh, your units can only move certain directions depending on, uh, uh, certain tiles, and capturing is just a matter of, like, this isn't, like, XCOM, this isn't Fire Emblem, there's no fancy stats, it's just move, capture.

97
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:23,684
So it's very chess-like to me.

98
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:29,527
While units mostly move diagonally, they cannot capture other pieces, while they must be adjacent to them.

99
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,069
So it creates this interesting back-and-forth that gets more complex later on.

100
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,851
Tom, I suppose since this is your baby, like, what made you go,

101
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,113
Oh! Yeah, chess! That's a game that is already solved.

102
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:43,255
I'm gonna make strategy chess with, and then enter Arthurian.

103
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:45,616
Um, so...

104
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:50,208
It's sort of a bugbear of mine. I really, really like tactics games,

105
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:53,591
and I started playing Fire Emblem and Advance Wars on Game Boy when I was a kid,

106
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:57,875
and I always really loved those kind of games, but I'm not a PC gamer,

107
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:02,280
and so I sort of missed out on XCOM and that kind of thing,

108
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,762
and whenever I tried learning them, I just couldn't,

109
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:08,266
because there's too many buttons and rules and menus and stuff.

110
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:09,707
And so this was kind of...

111
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:18,232
Me trying to take what I really loved about tactics games and boil it down into something without any context menus

112
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:19,033
without

113
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:26,417
Like resources or numbers. I want to just basically make it really minimal which you know also means you can make it on your own

114
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,358
Fairly easily. I thought be a really fun design challenge

115
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,387
And it actually turns out that that's really hard because it tends to be all of the menus and stuff

116
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:40,212
that, you know, gives these games the complexity they need to be interesting for like 20 hours.

117
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:47,419
And obviously chess solved this. You can play a lot of chess. And so I ended up sort of going

118
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,064
down the same route just because that seems to be the route if you want to make a tactics game that is...

119
00:07:54,045 --> 00:08:01,011
very replayer, low-income infinite, you kind of have to find ways to give all of your actions

120
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:08,297
as much nuance to them as possible. Like, this action isn't just something minor, it actually

121
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:13,382
changes the state in this sort of fairly important way. So you have, you can really puzzle over each

122
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:19,327
move. Right on, yeah. Oh, John, go for it. Go for it, John. I was just going to say, I remember one

123
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:19,887
of your goals.

124
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,313
was that idea that you wanted people on every move to be stopping and thinking,

125
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,556
oh this is an interesting situation and I really want to treat it as a puzzle.

126
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:33,959
I think we tried a lot of iterations of rules over the years but I remember that was always

127
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:39,723
the metric, that was like the pillar of the strategy game was, am I puzzling? Am I getting

128
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:44,166
an interesting decision to puzzle over during this game or am I just working for a pattern?

129
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:48,730
So I had a really interesting interview with another reviewer last week who turned out it

130
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,590
was quite a chess boss.

131
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:52,309
And he was saying that he felt the game wasn't like chess,

132
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,430
because when you play chess at a high level, you just execute patterns.

133
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,711
Like you do, oh, this is the Sicilian defense, and this is the whatever gambit.

134
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:02,413
And chess players look at these patterns and just apply the patterns to each other.

135
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,994
And he was saying one of the things he liked about Pendragon was there weren't any patterns.

136
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:09,876
Like you genuinely had to actually think about what you were doing on every move.

137
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,597
And I said, well, there probably are patterns,

138
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,037
you just haven't found out what they are yet.

139
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:13,558
Yeah.

140
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:16,099
But, you know, it was kind of a nice thing, actually,

141
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,580
to try and make something that had the responsiveness of...

142
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,082
Not chess played at a high level, but chess played at a sort of low level, where you do interesting moves,

143
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:26,103
but you don't actually know how to play chess properly.

144
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:30,327
And I thought that was quite a nice thing to end up with. It's like chess, but fun.

145
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:35,691
That's actually... Man, we aren't even talking about the interesting procedural story things that happen here,

146
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,813
and we're off to some great design questions.

147
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,516
I agree with the... I have just such an inverse reaction to that...

148
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,858
to that reviewer's talk about chess, which is that...

149
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,164
I think of chess and I think of it more like, you know, the strategy games I enjoy, which is I'm looking at...

150
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,566
But that's because I'm a bad chess player.

151
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:57,772
Um, I play other strategy games where I'm like a much better player, and even then I'm still more like,

152
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,796
reactive, like, okay, I'm here, I have these abilities, like,

153
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:02,638
like, that's where I thrive as a player.

154
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:05,501
Um, so what did you sort of learn about, like, I don't know, like...

155
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,016
you know, taking sort of the core part of chess, which is moving pieces around,

156
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:14,398
throwing out the pattern part that, you know, identifiable patterns and like

157
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:18,679
help making it so that players could make these decisions. You can see me negotiating

158
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:22,460
decisions around these bears as we speak. So I'm kind of curious like what your thoughts

159
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,262
were for making sure that like, you know, it was never a solved problem, I guess.

160
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:34,083
How did you avoid making a solved game? He said knowing many developers would happily make solved

161
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:34,363
games.

162
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,586
I think when we were originally building the abstract board game,

163
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:43,568
like it was a five by five grid and the team started in either corner.

164
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,808
And we played that game a lot and we enjoyed it.

165
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:46,589
And it was interesting.

166
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:50,450
But I think it probably was a solved game or a solvable game.

167
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,231
I think, Tom, you were much, much better at it than I ever got to be.

168
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,912
But I think you had a sense that that game.

169
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:59,623
that game was finite, you could get to a point where you could just master it and then it

170
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,664
wouldn't be interesting anymore.

171
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,244
Yeah, right.

172
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:04,784
And as soon as that happened, I'd say, right, it doesn't work, we need to change a rule

173
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:05,744
because I've solved it.

174
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,785
And then you'd go, no, no, no, you haven't solved it.

175
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,045
Look, I'll beat you and then you'd lose.

176
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:17,987
And this happened a lot, maybe like 30, 40 times or something like that.

177
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:22,407
I remember there was this one time when I was like, I've got this strategy and I'm pretty

178
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:23,948
sure I can just completely ruin the game.

179
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:25,348
But at the time...

180
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:29,459
you could infinitely create new knights.

181
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,680
There wasn't a limit on it, and there wasn't a variable that said, you know,

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,441
it costs this many to spawn. And so I said, look, here's what I'm

183
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,482
gonna do. I'm gonna spawn a knight, I'm gonna move him, and then I'm gonna spawn

184
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,002
another guy, I'm gonna move him. I just built this wall,

185
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,143
and it completely broke the game. And like, none of us have really thought to

186
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,025
play like that, because it sounds really boring, and it's fun to move your pieces across.

187
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:50,369
And that's kind of a prime example of how we added a rule to the game.

188
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,291
We played it, broke it, and then said,

189
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,092
right, this doesn't work.

190
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:59,797
In this case, I think we went straight for adding a variable, like Admiral,

191
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,360
which really helped, actually, straight away.

192
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:06,943
I think we called it Spawn Monkey for the longest time, and I don't know why, but we did.

193
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:11,189
Let's be clear, you called it Spawn Monkey.

194
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,677
I, as a writer, wouldn't dream of calling it Spawn Monkey, but never mind.

195
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:23,641
Um, well, while I could let you two, uh, insult each other and slag each other in the chat all I want,

196
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:26,584
let's talk about, um, there's a procedural narrative component here.

197
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,487
So as you can see, uh, if you're watching the gameplay footage,

198
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,591
um, Guinevere, my chosen character, has an ability called push forwards,

199
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:37,314
uh, which she picked up when I made a decision back there in the meta, in the meta layer,

200
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,096
uh, out in the game world.

201
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:42,279
Or maybe I got it earlier because I still love Arthur.

202
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:50,388
And this is an ability that I could see normally manifesting a character having through, you know, a leveling tree, a talent tree.

203
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,753
It's just simple as, like, she can move further. She spends energy to move further. Sure. Simple.

204
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:59,117
But these abilities pop up in Pendragon. This is what makes it unique.

205
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:05,980
Because of narrative choices you make and narrative choices aren't just dialogue trees there how you get through missions

206
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,962
How do you do murder these spiders like lots of interesting things will happen in this hour because?

207
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:13,643
Not just how I made decisions

208
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:17,405
Narratively, but how I made decisions strategically which I think is really cool

209
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:22,947
So would you two mind talking about that layer of gameplay and how like abilities came out of story and that sort of thing?

210
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:28,330
It's interesting to think about how we designed that like I think

211
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,865
So we were talking about how the 5x5 game felt quite solved,

212
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:36,428
and we started to solve that partly by adding rules,

213
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,929
but also by adding variation to the board, right?

214
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,310
And changing the shape of the board.

215
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,852
And we found that adding just one of those hummock squares,

216
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,033
where you can go in any direction,

217
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:46,375
completely shifted the balance of the strategies and the patterns.

218
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,676
So that was really useful.

219
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,277
But then another idea we kind of naturally had was,

220
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:53,800
well, you know, what if we have pieces with extra abilities?

221
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,061
We have heroes and they have some kind of special ability.

222
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:59,875
And can we find some special abilities that don't just destroy the game straight away,

223
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,078
but are fun to use? And eventually that got tied into the resolve mechanic.

224
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:08,362
But we didn't really have a sense of how to pace those out.

225
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,604
Like, when should we unlock it? We didn't want to do experience points.

226
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,586
We didn't want to do another resource that you collect.

227
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,208
We thought about you gain 10 for clearing a level,

228
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:20,871
and you gain 5 for killing an enemy, and when you get 30, you get one.

229
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,633
But it just felt really arbitrary. It just felt really random.

230
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:25,374
It wouldn't be very satisfying.

231
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:26,355
And then I think...

232
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:32,109
the particular solution we hit on actually came, I was re-watching the Lord of the Rings films and

233
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,590
uh there's the bit where the, I've forgotten her name, but the lady in armor like the the king of

234
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,251
the undead guy says you know no man can kill me and she rips off her helmet and says I am no man

235
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:47,793
and then plunges a sword into him and and kills him. Yes. And I thought oh I love that thing of

236
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,753
heroic figures having like

237
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:55,545
a call to arms or having a kind of motto or having or doing a big speech on the battlefield where

238
00:14:55,565 --> 00:15:01,207
they say for god and king henry and then everyone suddenly is buffed up and can do stuff and that

239
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:06,609
idea really resonated for me because it kind of connected the the mythological tone but also the

240
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,690
strategy board game so at that point oh right okay basically they should do a special move when

241
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,751
they're able to shout a rallying cry yeah and

242
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,642
That brought me to think, well, okay, what gives you a rallying cry?

243
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,505
And like, well, it's you declaring your love for someone, it's you're losing,

244
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,426
you've lost your lover on the battlefield.

245
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:29,149
And that just felt so rewarding and so good that we had to explore it.

246
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:35,293
And like, yeah, it's quite weird in a way, because it means that you have,

247
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,435
you don't really know what's going to happen in terms of what moves you'll get or what moves,

248
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:42,837
or how the moves will change over time.

249
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:47,657
But the one thing I really like is when you've got a move that's really good and you're really enjoying using it

250
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:50,438
and it's connected to something like, you know, I found my love

251
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:55,260
and then your love gets murdered by a spider on the battlefield and you lose that move

252
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,761
and it changes to, you know, I will avenge my fallen love

253
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,562
and you get something else because you lost something

254
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,423
because the character did lose something.

255
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:04,763
That's just lovely.

256
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:10,405
Like that kind of, where the change in the narrative causes the gameplay to change in a way that you might not actually like

257
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,306
that isn't technically an upgrade.

258
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:16,582
But it's right. And that felt to me really strong and really interesting.

259
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,507
And I'm kind of every time the system can do that, can make something happen,

260
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:22,312
which is not great, but feels appropriate.

261
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:25,236
Yeah. And I think, yeah, no, we found something interesting there.

262
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:31,580
Before our nerd crit gets slammed too hard, it is AoN who shouts that, and I also double-checked that if you saw me go off my phone,

263
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:38,902
because I really wanted to make sure I didn't have AoN and Arwen mixed up, because I am a nerd and nerds are pedantic.

264
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:41,963
But yeah, I love that example, Jon.

265
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:50,827
Tom, did you have any thoughts about, from a design perspective, how these narrative abilities manifest and how they make your game better? Your perfect chess?

266
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,798
Yeah, so John was always like, oh, I want to add this thing.

267
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:59,319
And from the story side, it's going to change the gameplay.

268
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,820
And every time he said that, I'd be like, oh, no,

269
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,120
he's going to break the game.

270
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,582
And I kept throwing down these rules like, OK, yeah, fine.

271
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,463
They can get abilities, but we have to test all the abilities

272
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:10,244
really carefully because they don't want to break anything.

273
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:11,785
And they all need to be perfectly

274
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:12,845
balanced with each other.

275
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,107
And actually, in the end, a lot of that

276
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:20,489
turned out not to be true for the reasons John was saying.

277
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:20,849
It's.

278
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:28,144
So long as they are narratively appropriate, it's actually really interesting when you get a move that is...

279
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:34,278
actually quite overpowered or maybe it's underpowered because the thing that caused it is

280
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:39,800
embarrassing or sad or just sort of fits the tone. And there's also sort of moves that feel

281
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,082
like they've been meaningfully upgraded or downgraded and you just don't get that sense

282
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:48,323
if everything is sort of perfectly balanced, which was kind of always my instinct for this

283
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:54,046
game is to keep everything very pure and elegant. And I feel that that's this really nice tension

284
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,246
in the game with sort of...

285
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,322
Yeah, the way that the gameplay and the story interact.

286
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:05,764
It doesn't ever fight, but it creates, yeah, this tension all of the time.

287
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:12,547
My writing-loving brain really wants to dive into more of the, like,

288
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:14,087
writing Arthurian legend, blah, blah, blah,

289
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:16,909
but I also want to linger here in game design world for a minute longer.

290
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,490
You know, we've sort of talked about abilities,

291
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,031
we've talked about movement and traversal and adding things to the game,

292
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,232
but how do you, like, how...

293
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:31,294
In a game where like the game has to generate scenarios for the player like this one's really interesting the one we're in right now

294
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:34,155
Because this isn't a clear friend or foe situation with where we're going

295
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:42,078
Um, although these rats apparently move diagonally and attack diagonally. Um, which is just video games. Um, uh

296
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:47,199
What is the secret sauce to making interesting encounters so that the computer can go,

297
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:51,661
oh, I'm going to grab this, and this will be the right time for the player to encounter this thing,

298
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:56,623
even though I am a dumb computer and I will only do what I am told to do, and I have no agency.

299
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:57,223
For now.

300
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:05,566
Yeah, that was really hard, actually. So, um, internally there's...

301
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:26,131
I totted them up on Twitter just the night before release and I think there's something like 20 different heuristic or analytic or algorithmic or AI systems in the game that determine and control what the game is doing or what the game is going to give to the player, like in terms of the board layout or where the resources are spread.

302
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,893
And one of those systems is the one that decides what...

303
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,698
what scene you're going to encounter.

304
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,122
So very broadly, the game has template scenes that you can get into.

305
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,146
So this one that you're playing at the moment is the meeting the archer

306
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:38,867
in the woods scene.

307
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,210
And that's quite a specific one because it's always the archer.

308
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,073
But they might be quite generic ones as well.

309
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,056
Like, you know, go to a village that's got a problem with some animals

310
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,659
and like the animals can change and the villagers can change whatever.

311
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:56,829
and that system looks at what you've done and looks at what you're about to do and looks at

312
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,632
where you are through the game and looks at it looks at a whole bunch of stuff and it doesn't

313
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:06,254
generate a level i shouldn't really reveal this because i feel like it's secret sauce but like

314
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:11,036
um it doesn't decide what scene you're going to get until the absolute last possible moment

315
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,858
and then it's all just balanced to try and make sure that the adventure is

316
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:20,827
interesting, like that's its goal. There are lots of systems in the game which are fair or which are

317
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:25,008
kind of, you know, based on difficulty sliders, but this particular one is purely for narrative

318
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:30,529
interest. And I remember just about a day before we shipped the demo, which was like one, it was

319
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:36,211
five levels long, it was a run through five levels long, and it did a tutorial and then it did another

320
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:41,833
level and then at the end of it, it tended to give you a hero, a new hero in a castle. You get to the

321
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,553
castle, you meet them.

322
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:47,063
And it was this really limp ending to a demo, because it felt like, oh, everything's going fine here.

323
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:51,728
So I wrote a version of the scene where you go to the castle and the hero's supposed to be there, but they're not.

324
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:55,792
And there's a Mordred knight there instead, who says, oh yes, Sir Kay was here, and I killed him.

325
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:59,816
And that was such a good ending for the demo, because it was like, dun dun dun!

326
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:00,597
Um...

327
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:02,499
And that kind of...

328
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:09,011
totally like non-design focused pacing but much more narrative pacing of just sort of playing it

329
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:13,014
and feeling like well have we had enough tension recently have we had enough drama recently well

330
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:18,499
okay what what lever can we poke or what variable can we tweak to try and make it a bit more inclined

331
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,003
to give you something exciting now because you're sort of at the right kind of time for that um

332
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:26,206
and that took ages

333
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:30,479
to get right, but it was kind of just another kind of balancing really, in the same way

334
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,121
that we balance the AI, we balance the board generators.

335
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:38,565
It was just another system that wanted to stick its elbow in and muck around with the

336
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:39,346
game experience.

337
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,188
I felt we got that right.

338
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:44,890
Tom, do you want to throw in anything at all?

339
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,372
Yeah, it's really complicated.

340
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,353
It's like this one...

341
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,274
I mean like...

342
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm allegedly the programmer on the game, but I'm fairly certain that the ink script,

343
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,842
which is sort of John's side of things, which is supposed to be for the story,

344
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:06,024
but actually has ended up being just this massive amount of logic control.

345
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,485
Everything, like so much AI has ended up being piled onto the ink.

346
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:22,131
And while a lot of gameplay stuff is kind of like, okay, we're gonna build a feature and then it's in and then that's just a box and then you can stack the boxes on top of each other, this thing was just constantly improving for like the whole year and a half of development.

347
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:31,557
Gotcha. Let's talk about failure. Failure will come much later in the stream because thankfully I'm sort of savvy.

348
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:35,457
This is a game where failure...

349
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,177
Actually, no, we're gonna get some mild failure,

350
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,018
I think, in a few minutes.

351
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:39,738
Sorry, pre-recorded footage.

352
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,059
I hate sounding like a prophet.

353
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:44,920
But failure is a weird thing in games

354
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,441
because it's, failure in a shooter means,

355
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:48,802
oh, okay, I can try again

356
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:50,843
and I can do a Twitch skill a little bit better.

357
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,264
In a procedural game, failure might go,

358
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:55,004
oh, well, come on, you gave me this

359
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:56,245
when my health was low.

360
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,006
Come on, why didn't the RNG go Twitch this way?

361
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:05,071
But because you have a game where we talked about failure sometimes means interesting things change in the narrative and the abilities like

362
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:07,853
This is a this is a specific

363
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:12,457
Like it feels like you need a specific vision for how players fail in order to make this game fun

364
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:14,959
Is that accurate and if I'm wrong, tell me why?

365
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,621
No, that's absolutely accurate

366
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:23,985
And it's something that we thought about a lot and actually has been a kind of common recurring theme throughout all the stuff that we've done

367
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:24,766
at Inkle

368
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:30,692
that we're always interested in creating a story that has a beginning and a middle and an end.

369
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:34,617
And the problem with failure, and it is a drastically serious problem from a narrative

370
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:38,682
point of view, is that the minute that the player fails and tries again, the narrative dies

371
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:44,229
completely until the player has got to and surpassed whatever point it was where they were getting stuck.

372
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,022
And there is only one solution to that in current games,

373
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,202
which is the time loop solution, where you go,

374
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,523
oh, well, we just do the whole level again,

375
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:52,903
and that's that part of the narrative.

376
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:55,564
And it's fine, but not every game can be a time loop game.

377
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:57,345
Yeah.

378
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:59,446
So what we've tried to do, and we tried to do it in...

379
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,207
We sort of dabbled with it in Sorcery,

380
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:03,607
but we definitely do it in 80 Days,

381
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:04,848
and we do it in Heaven's Vault, too,

382
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:08,009
is this idea of failing forwards.

383
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:08,569
Mm-hmm.

384
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,670
So in Heaven's Vault, you can miss.

385
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,230
I'm running away right now. This is failure.

386
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,791
Yeah, right. Exactly. Exactly.

387
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:22,936
So, like, in Heaven's Vault you can completely miss huge amounts of, like, the content and the clues that might be in a particular location.

388
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:28,439
And the narrative will work to cope to make sure that that just becomes the way that your story went,

389
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:35,062
rather than where you need to backtrack and pick up that key that was in that chest, like in most adventure games.

390
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:40,305
In 80 Days, of course, there's no way to die, really, and if you go over 80 Days, it's not a problem.

391
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:46,894
So for this game, we knew we wanted the idea that you could fail, but that it would push you forwards and it would push your narrative forwards.

392
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:52,936
But then you have that question of, well, how do you do that if when you get killed, you get killed?

393
00:24:54,637 --> 00:25:01,819
Which obviously led to us bringing in the flee button, which was pretty controversial, you know, within the team.

394
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,760
And I know Tom was convinced for a long time that no one would ever press.

395
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:10,936
a flee button because it was like having a button that literally said I am a loser when you press it.

396
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,976
He may not be wrong, it still may be true.

397
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:19,918
Well it may be, but like even, well the weird thing is even when it's strategically absolutely

398
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:24,359
the correct thing to do, like you know you're massively overwhelmed, you don't have the support

399
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,199
structure to do it, you could throw all your knights at this problem and kill them all,

400
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,860
or you could flee and save your entire party. That's a reasonable thing to do strategically,

401
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,561
but in game world it feels...

402
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:41,509
completely unpalatable and I thought that was a really interesting friction actually to kind of

403
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,831
bring the player up against this idea that they feel that they're supposed to win every encounter

404
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:50,993
but the game is a tragedy about being overwhelmed by forces much stronger than you, like you ought

405
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:56,076
to flee, like you ought to flee because everything's going wrong, you ought to flee because you found

406
00:25:56,116 --> 00:26:00,017
a level that's too hard, you ought to read the board and decide you can't win this one and go

407
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:04,159
and do another one and those were all interesting and they come with other narrative consequences

408
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:04,700
attached to them.

409
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:08,034
Yeah, this is about to get very interesting in gameplay for what you're talking about

410
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:11,376
with where Gwynevere winds up, because this is a can't flee level because I've already

411
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:11,616
fled.

412
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:16,298
Right, okay, yeah, so some of the levels, so that kind of went backwards and forwards

413
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:19,359
what the balance of that was, but yeah, there are some levels where you can't flee to create

414
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:23,161
pinch points where you can die early, because in the end we decided it was nice, it was

415
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,781
nice to have that as an option.

416
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,843
But then there's also the other kind of...

417
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:33,133
uh way of avoiding failure which is the rage mechanic which i i don't know if

418
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,296
that's going to happen in your oh it's gonna oh it's gonna happen

419
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,600
yeah right and that again was just it was it was kind of thinking about well

420
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,802
what's fun like because we do want the game to

421
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:45,165
be fun as well and so if you're overwhelmed and you get trapped in a

422
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:48,668
corner and then your character just flips out and completely loses their rag

423
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:52,592
and turns into an unstoppable terminator with you know a cost associated with

424
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:52,772
that

425
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:58,661
that felt really interesting and it felt really enjoyable to play and it was just a lovely narrative moment.

426
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,563
Everybody remembers the first time their character goes into rage mode.

427
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:04,424
So it just,

428
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:10,628
it was really interesting to me that this idea of saying we are not going to let you simply die

429
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:18,533
opened up an enormous number of design questions and design ideas and design and narrative opportunities that we simply wouldn't have even thought about

430
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:21,795
if we just said, yeah, when you die, you die and then you restart.

431
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:25,860
you know, or you can restart any level at any time, which was a button we had.

432
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,643
Well, I mean, we still have it in the debug build for the game,

433
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,706
but like that was going to be a button the player could press, you know, just go again.

434
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:34,008
And now it's rage time.

435
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:36,651
So here we'll get to show off that mechanic right now.

436
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:41,436
Right. You can lose a raid if you don't manage to murder everyone

437
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:43,358
in within the kind of time limit.

438
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:45,080
He's got like an energy bar which goes down.

439
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,634
But you also are very, very overpowered when you're in rage mode.

440
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:50,816
That really is just about.

441
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,799
And hey, that applies for real life too.

442
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:53,320
Ayyy.

443
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,182
Yeah, exactly.

444
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:59,889
Tom, do you want to throw in on failure, making failure interesting, before I move on to my next question?

445
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:04,616
Yeah, I guess it's, I mean, I think Jon sort of said it all, but I feel like it's almost

446
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:07,778
an Inkle philosophy at this point. Every time I pitch a new game design to Jon, he says,

447
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,200
yeah, okay, what happens if you die? And I never have a good answer. And something Jon

448
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,521
says a lot, and I think it's definitely true in this, is...

449
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:21,618
It's about surprising the player, so when they think they've lost,

450
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:24,438
you can give them an extra life that they didn't know they had.

451
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:27,459
And that's sort of what Rage Mode is here. It's like,

452
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,179
ah, you really thought you'd lost, but now we're going to give you one more chance.

453
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:32,160
And you obviously can't keep giving that to the player.

454
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,480
They can't keep failing forward all the way to the end.

455
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,921
But it's a sort of get out of jail free card you didn't know you had.

456
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:41,662
And I feel that's a lesson that's applicable to a lot of games, actually.

457
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:44,082
You can kind of hide a little extra continue in there.

458
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:45,423
I like that.

459
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:52,547
In fact, for the longest time, we had, heroes could have zero health and they'd still be

460
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:57,971
alive and this is kind of that philosophy extended and we took that one out in the end

461
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:02,193
because it was sort of too against game convention where, you know, if you have one heart.

462
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:04,244
and you lose it, you expect to die.

463
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:07,965
What we had before that was if you have one heart and you lose it,

464
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:10,666
well, now you have no hearts, you're not dead, you just have no hearts,

465
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:12,387
and then it would take another hit to die.

466
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:16,288
And John really, really liked this, and I kept pushing back,

467
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:19,749
and in the end, I think it was just because players kept reporting it as a bug

468
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:23,210
that we took it out, but it would have fit the philosophy,

469
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,971
and it would have, I think if players had understood it,

470
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,552
it would have felt good for the same reason that Rage Mode felt good,

471
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,273
which is just that they thought they'd lost.

472
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:34,034
and then they kind of get this moment of hope.

473
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:38,618
Yeah, sadly I think we've been too conditioned by red bars in video games in general.

474
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,680
Um, we are a stupid lot.

475
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,242
Um, okay.

476
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:46,844
Uh, now I finally get to be the story nerd that I love being.

477
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:48,746
Uh, this is an Arthurian game.

478
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:51,728
Um, Arthurian legend and Arthurian lore is...

479
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:58,457
Interesting, uh, because by- even the game kind of reflects this. It's a little bit whatever you want it to be.

480
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:04,144
Do you want the happy story? Well, it's about Arthur finding the stone, or finding the- pulling the sword out of the-

481
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:08,610
No, wait. Lady in the Lake. Right, Arthur is Lady in the Lake. Um, uh...

482
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,172
If you want that, that's how you get Excalibur, that's the hero story.

483
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:17,513
If you want the comedy version, you get Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

484
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:22,895
If you want the tragic version, you have the various Merlin miniseries which have

485
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:27,497
made their way to TV. Like the whole story of Arthur, and I'm speaking as an American,

486
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:30,978
so I'm literally like this is the most outside perspective, well not the most outside perspective,

487
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,578
but it's a very outside perspective on...

488
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,819
on something that seems very...

489
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,700
Like, everyone has opinions about this, you know?

490
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,261
And instead of telling sort of one linear story about Arthurian legend,

491
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,221
you've told a lot of different stories at once that, like, you know...

492
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:48,303
And I'm curious how, once that, where that came into the game

493
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:50,723
and how that influenced the narrative and design direction.

494
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,764
Yeah, so, I mean, I've always...

495
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:56,085
I've always been an Arthurian.

496
00:30:56,722 --> 00:31:02,604
nerd. I loved Arthurian Legends as a kid. My favorite book is an Arthurian retelling. So I

497
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:06,765
kind of had that context and I think when we were first kind of thinking about narrative frameworks,

498
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:12,027
the idea of making it knights in armor battling out just sort of fitted the flow of the game.

499
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:16,468
A few people have described it as being a bit like a dance. You kind of dance around the board and

500
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:21,330
strike when you can and it feels a bit like swordplay. It feels a bit like that kind of

501
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:25,874
a swashbuckling feel, especially when they're trading insults while they're moving around.

502
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:31,837
So that tone of being knights with big swords thwacking each other really heavily and really

503
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:37,620
hard felt right for the pace of the game that we'd built.

504
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:41,702
In terms of the narrative more widely though, I think it was quite a struggle for a while

505
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:46,585
to work out how to make it work, because as you say, the Arthurian legend is a lot of

506
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,926
different stuff and it covers an enormous amount of time.

507
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:54,483
But we knew that we wanted something very focused on combat, because that's the core mechanic,

508
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:59,345
very focused on traversing across the space, across Britain.

509
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:06,529
So it could have been the quest for the Holy Grail, but it just feels quite nerdy in a way, and not actually that compelling.

510
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:16,554
And I don't know when it was that we had this idea of setting it after the end of the Arthurian myth,

511
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,715
and that felt tonally right to me.

512
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:24,595
that the goal of the game is not even to save Arthur or to build Camelot, it's just to literally

513
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:25,896
witness him die.

514
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:31,400
And that felt like, it had the right sense of, well you're going to die, everyone is

515
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,403
going to die, the question is only where do you die and how do you die and how well do

516
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:35,863
you die.

517
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:41,867
And that had all that kind of chivalric sort of honour against the darkness, like hope

518
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:42,148
when...

519
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:48,883
hope is unreasonable, which I think speaks to me as a tonal thing, but it also makes the gameplay

520
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:54,804
feel kind of tense and taut and fraught with danger and it ties into that mechanic that we have that

521
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:59,885
which I don't think we've mentioned, which is just that anyone on the board can be killed at any time

522
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:05,566
and the narrative will deal with that. You know, nobody is ever safe at all and if you want to

523
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:10,467
murder all your key people then you can and you will sometimes, whether you want to or not.

524
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:18,152
But it also tied very strongly into the political angle as well,

525
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:23,176
that I think when we were getting inspired about this game,

526
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:27,920
I realised that one of the reasons that I wanted to do Arthur was...

527
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:32,049
the what was happening in British politics at the time which is still

528
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:35,050
happening and it's very much comparable I think to what's happening in American

529
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,152
politics as well where you have a new class of

530
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:42,154
leaders who are so committed to lying to us and to

531
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:46,076
and to hurting the population that they're supposed to be protecting they

532
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:48,917
are so happy to do that and they do on a daily

533
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:52,819
basis you know in America the the COVID situation is unbearable the

534
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,881
police brutality situation is unbearable Britain is not quite that bad but we are

535
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,142
not doing very well either

536
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:05,460
And that sense of a leadership that has abdicated its moral responsibility to its people is at the

537
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:11,927
core of the end of the Arthurian narrative as well. Arthur is this noble just king who is

538
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:17,992
thrown off the throne by his son who's just rubbish, who's just this power-hungry brat

539
00:34:19,153 --> 00:34:22,837
who doesn't want anything apart from just to hurt his dad and to screw stuff up.

540
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:29,218
and Arthur goes to face him even though he knows he can't win against this, he can't,

541
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:33,861
he doesn't have a chance but he has to, and that's always spoke to me as a kind of,

542
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:37,963
you know, as an honourable and noble sacrifice in that kind of romantic vision.

543
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,667
The book that I liked as a kid, which is called The Once and Future King, was written

544
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:48,471
very much about the rise of Nazism in the 30s, but as a King Arthur story, but that it's that same tone and that

545
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:50,432
same tone applies now and that sense of

546
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,134
we can be good people and we should be good people.

547
00:34:54,975 --> 00:35:00,037
And what do you do when the people in charge and the people who have all of the power

548
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:05,581
have absolutely no moral compass at all and you have to fight even though you can't possibly win? And that

549
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,201
that felt to me like a story that

550
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:10,813
that I was happy to tell, that I wanted to tell, that I was angry enough to tell,

551
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:13,194
and that needs to be out right now.

552
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:15,375
And that got me through the writing process.

553
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:18,156
Because I think if I was just writing some Arthurian legend, you're right,

554
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,117
it would be like, well, here's a giant and here's like a quest for a stone

555
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,617
and here's a magic screaming rock.

556
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,958
And it would all be very arbitrary and very random.

557
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:26,519
And I think the reason that the game...

558
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,380
Sorry, I've gone all serious, but...

559
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:41,038
The reason that the game hangs together thematically is because underneath all that Arthurian stuff and the thwacking and the board game and all of that is this consistent, angry, passionate, moral core.

560
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:45,540
And that's something that as a writer, I believe that we should always have.

561
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:55,787
And I think games often don't bother to have because they're scared of being political or they're worried that they're going to tell people what to think, which is absolutely not the point. It's not about telling people what to think.

562
00:35:56,213 --> 00:36:00,955
It's about getting people to feel something consistently and be involved with that feeling.

563
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:07,277
And that was so important to me, that that really tied it together.

564
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:12,359
So for me, it's because Arthur is actually such a deep symbol in the British psyche and

565
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:18,060
also in the American, I think, by extension, of what our leaders are supposed to be like,

566
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,421
what government is supposed to be like, what the country is supposed to be like.

567
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:24,082
We're supposed to live in a world of round tables and nights.

568
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:25,543
And we like to believe that we do.

569
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,172
but we often don't.

570
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:31,299
And I think that, yeah, that really was the motor

571
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,945
behind the storytelling for me.

572
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,231
And I, yeah, and I hope some of that comes across to people.

573
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,114
I really do, because I think it's terribly important.

574
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:45,089
I think it comes across in this one run we did, like as you watch the whole arc of it.

575
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,573
Tom, I keep just going, I keep throwing out a question, John answers, and then I go, Tom,

576
00:36:50,593 --> 00:36:51,113
do you want to weigh in?

577
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,934
But that's all I can do.

578
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:58,518
Tom, do you want to weigh in on your thoughts about turning your beautiful board solve chess

579
00:36:58,538 --> 00:37:00,259
game into something Arthurian and messy?

580
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,401
No, everything he said.

581
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:04,322
The theme fit really well.

582
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,643
I think we all realized that.

583
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,184
We tried some other themes a little bit.

584
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:12,465
Ages and ages ago, we were thinking how it could be a court case and it was two lawyers fighting

585
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,346
I don't even know how that was supposed to work

586
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:15,847
and there's

587
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:21,370
Like we flip-flopped on a lot of things. Um, like really early on before we started really developing it full-time

588
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,031
But I think this was something we were really consistent on. Yeah

589
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:29,069
Um, uh, yeah, there's one neat- oh, I think we're actually about to come across it.

590
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,251
Um, there's one neat feature in this game, which is the Tales game.

591
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:37,493
I completely forgot to mention this at the top, but, uh, we low-key have to do some disclosure.

592
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:42,375
Um, this is a GDC Twitch stream, but we also, you know, this is also tied to Gamasutra,

593
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:47,237
and Gamasutra editor Chris Kerr is one of the people who submitted a story for your, uh, campfire.

594
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:51,398
feature where the characters hang out and talk about the fire.

595
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,440
Chris Kerr is a great writer and I'm so glad that he got something in.

596
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,100
The one we'll see in the stream is actually really fun.

597
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,842
We'll see it, I guess it's not this encounter but maybe the next one.

598
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:06,344
What were your

599
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,765
thoughts on that and roping good writers in to write little tales for you?

600
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,066
That's a neat story, what was all that about?

601
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:18,224
I'm so happy we did that and that was a complete stroke of luck really.

602
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:22,567
So we had this mechanic of people sitting around the campfire in the game

603
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:25,749
for a while and it was really just a way of gaining an extra health point and

604
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:29,151
they would sort of run some conversation between their characters

605
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,773
and I felt like they didn't have quite enough to talk about and obviously at a

606
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:35,535
campfire what you do is you tell a story so I thought okay maybe sometimes they

607
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:38,257
could tell a story and I wrote a story and I thought I'll write some more of

608
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:40,319
those later I just I don't feel inspired right now.

609
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:45,757
Then lockdown happened, coronavirus, COVID lockdown happened.

610
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:52,782
And there was kind of this mood in the air of lots of people stuck at

611
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:54,864
home and not quite knowing what they were doing.

612
00:38:55,084 --> 00:39:00,388
And it kind of, I thought what I really, what we really want to do, I had this

613
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,571
sudden urge to try and make some space for some people

614
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,692
to do something nice and do something like

615
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,335
fun and interesting and take their minds off this thing.

616
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:13,959
We didn't have an enormous budget for this game, I couldn't hire extra writers in any way,

617
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:19,182
no one would have been able to understand the way the game was written internally because it's such

618
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:24,605
a mess. Like, you know, there was no way to hire co-writers for the game, but here was this

619
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:31,749
this one aspect, these campfire killers, which was not only perfect for packaging up and giving

620
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:34,771
to people who had no idea how the rest of the game worked and didn't need to know,

621
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:38,773
but also would really benefit from getting, you know, different

622
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:45,617
voices. So I pitched it to Joe, Joe Humphrey, the co-founder of Inkle, and said, you know,

623
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:50,360
can we spend a bit of money and get some writers? And he said, well, we can try, but like, do you

624
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,204
think they're going to be any good? And we sort of thought, well, we really have no idea. We just

625
00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:59,907
have to try. And I remember we put the call out for writers, and it was quite widely promoted,

626
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,870
actually, which was really nice. I felt it captured the mood of the moment quite well,

627
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,313
just this sense of people, look, here's a nice thing to do. Do it if you can, if you feel like it.

628
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:14,436
And I remember the very first story that we got sent back was from one of, it's in the game,

629
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:19,439
and it's called The Man Who Couldn't Fart. And the note that came with it said,

630
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,423
despite the title, this is a serious story, I hope you enjoy it. And I thought, oh god, here we go,

631
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:29,306
you know, this is what I've let myself in for. And I read The Man Who Couldn't Fart, and I was,

632
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:34,729
I'll be honest, I was blown away. It's an amazingly good story, it's got a really

633
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,731
quality moral, it's geniusly delivered.

634
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,747
And I just thought, oh wow, this is gonna work.

635
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:42,088
This is actually gonna work.

636
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,488
And over the next, I think it was two,

637
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,969
maybe three weeks of submission period,

638
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,089
we got something like 500 entries.

639
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:52,250
So I was just constantly reading these tales.

640
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,091
My family would come downstairs in the morning

641
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,191
and I'd be sitting there on my laptop

642
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,271
going, I've read another 15 of these things.

643
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:00,292
And like just churning through and churning through.

644
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:02,473
And here we go, here's the-

645
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,513
And the kind of averages worked out, if you might.

646
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,610
Oh, which one is it?

647
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,531
Um, the story of failure.

648
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:10,771
The lonely knight and...

649
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:11,972
A knight who fails at his quest.

650
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:14,993
Oh, it's, um, Baldwin and the Chalice.

651
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:15,473
Yes.

652
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:16,113
Yeah.

653
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:18,214
Um, and...

654
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,995
Yeah, the averages kind of worked out,

655
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,716
you like, might, you might expect

656
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:27,077
maybe 10% of the stories were not great.

657
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,078
Um, and then 10% of them were absolutely

658
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:33,179
dishing, and then there was a middle ground

659
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,319
where we had to find the ones that...

660
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:38,105
for our game and our characters and our universe.

661
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,686
But it was a really enjoyable process.

662
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,127
And kind of bringing those together,

663
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,107
I was just delighted, actually.

664
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:44,388
I was delighted with how it went.

665
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,689
And they still just make me so happy

666
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:47,629
when I find them in the game.

667
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:49,970
And I feel like they're kind of the heart and soul

668
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,671
of the game, is this idea of.

669
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,861
voices and stories and stories mattering and uh yeah i love all of that stuff i really do i love

670
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:02,642
this little story um we started a little late i think i'm still gonna cruise us in for a i'm gonna

671
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:08,044
cruise us in for a landing soon um uh you know best best best to get out while you're still

672
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:14,145
welcome is one of my philosophies in life maybe maybe that's why uh i'm not a rich man but i

673
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:18,326
don't know wow that got really too weird and deep okay that's what covid let me tell you as an

674
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:18,746
interviewer

675
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:22,929
has made interviewing so weird because you're trying to have a conversation

676
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:24,109
acting like everything's normal.

677
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,851
And then midway through, you just sort of like have to admit it's not.

678
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:31,074
And I'm so thankful that you two have discussed that covid and locking down

679
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:34,016
has influenced your work as designers because it saved me

680
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:37,638
sort of assessing the generic question, how are you doing?

681
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:38,939
How is your lockdown going?

682
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:42,081
And in the UK, you have a totally different lockdown situation over here.

683
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:45,143
Like apparently I hear it's illegal to drive halfway across the country

684
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:48,425
to test your eyesight over there.

685
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:55,329
Well they keep changing their mind about whether that's legal or not, but I think it basically

686
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:57,891
boils down to it depends on who your father is.

687
00:42:58,691 --> 00:42:59,052
Oh boy.

688
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:00,273
Oh that's this country too.

689
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:00,733
Oh no.

690
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,935
Anyway, so if you have questions for John and Tom, let's get them in.

691
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:05,216
I guess...

692
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,340
Oh man, do I have any questions left? I think I do.

693
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,426
Hopefully chat is willing to throw in something intelligent, uh, because I try to be an intelligent person.

694
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:20,452
But like I said, this is... the masks, like, the mask of professionalism slips more often when you're...

695
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:25,904
when you're just like, oh shit, this interview wraps up and I have to go sit in my apartment

696
00:43:25,924 --> 00:43:30,207
some more and then my day wraps up and I sit in my apartment playing video games like Pendragon.

697
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:34,390
I guess, oh, oh okay, I have one.

698
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,912
It's shown up in the stream already so we're past it.

699
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:42,735
There's a line that repeats which is where Guinevere says this...

700
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:48,439
This plot, this field reminds me of where Arthur chose to build Camelot.

701
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,781
And it fires twice in this playthrough, and on the second one,

702
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:54,322
Guinevere talks about something different that followed the first one.

703
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:57,404
And I feel like this is a huge challenge for procedural narrative.

704
00:43:57,424 --> 00:44:00,246
It's why sometimes, like, I start off procedural narrative games,

705
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,807
and then I bounce, is at a point where I'm like,

706
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:04,468
okay, I'm running through some of the same basic beats before,

707
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:06,129
and it doesn't feel, it feels stiff.

708
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:08,170
It feels like a machine is spitting words out at me.

709
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:13,193
And I think it's for better and for worse that good games and bad games I've played have encountered this.

710
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:18,296
I love Blaseball, but this sort of might be why I bounced off Blaseball when I tried it.

711
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,878
I don't know if you two know what Blaseball is, but I don't either, so that's okay.

712
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:27,962
Um, uh, um, but yeah, like, what do you think, like, you know, for a company that keeps doing procedural narrative,

713
00:44:28,342 --> 00:44:34,606
what do you think is sort of the sauce behind making sure that your computer, which is taking inputs and spitting outputs...

714
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:38,688
you know, ones that you've carefully strung together, but still,

715
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:42,531
you know, how do you make sure that stories feel like stories and not

716
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:44,992
inputs and outputs, I guess? Like, that's my last question for the

717
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:45,412
both of you.

718
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:57,600
Yeah, that's quite a big question. So I think repetition is a

719
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,582
particularly bad thing, because we're so good at

720
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:03,183
noticing it as people.

721
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:11,987
And Dragon actually contains a whole bunch of systems to prevent repetition from one game to the next game.

722
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:14,928
Like, actually, it remembers quite a lot of what you see.

723
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:16,929
It remembers everything you see during the game.

724
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,571
That's just what the Ink Engine does.

725
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:23,172
But actually, it remembers most of what you've seen during all your previous games as well,

726
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:29,355
to try and mix things up and try and find new routes through the content and avenues that you haven't seen before.

727
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:31,576
There's a limit to how much of that we can do because...

728
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,921
like we can't record every word.

729
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:38,043
Obviously, this is a game you might play 200 times.

730
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:42,324
But it's definitely something we've worked really, really hard

731
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:43,505
to try and avoid.

732
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:47,826
But a lot of it is actually a balancing problem.

733
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:50,027
You need a decent amount of content,

734
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,508
and you need the content to be able to vary itself,

735
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:54,668
which is something that the Ink Engine is very good at.

736
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:56,329
So, you know, a single sentence can...

737
00:45:57,028 --> 00:46:01,010
turn out different ways depending on who's saying it and how they're feeling and just

738
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:08,414
random numbers as well. But I think also it's about kind of what we try to do is we try to

739
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:14,437
lay down a bedrock of things that the game can say which are very self-varying but will work

740
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:21,441
and then to pick out as much specific context as we can. So the way that the system works,

741
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:25,323
I think I wrote a Garner Sutra article about this actually, but the way the system works is that it

742
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:25,843
looks for...

743
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,011
very specific matches for the current context and then dropped back to generic ones that can't find

744
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:37,632
any. So if you have a move where it's Guinevere and she is attacking a creature and the creature

745
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:41,813
has just attacked one of her own pieces, there might be a specific line of dialogue for that

746
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:47,014
exact context which will fire under very random, rare circumstances because it's so specific.

747
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:51,135
So that doesn't need much variation but if it turns out that it can't find any of those and

748
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:54,675
it'll drop back something more generic which is just the usual kind of...

749
00:46:55,185 --> 00:47:01,530
Guinevere runs across the ground and wallops something with her sword, of which you will have seen the same line of content

750
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:05,073
50, 100 times, just tweaked and varied by the context.

751
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:12,999
But yeah, it's an enormous problem, and I think Pendragon is an attempt to tackle it much more than we ever have

752
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,504
before. 80 Days does a little bit of this stuff in some places, and Heaven's Vault does too,

753
00:47:19,564 --> 00:47:22,246
but Pendragon pretty much is entirely built out of

754
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:27,825
content which is actually repeating itself all the time, but attempting to disguise that

755
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:32,567
as much as possible. And largely getting away with it, I think. But yeah.

756
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:34,428
Tom, do you have any...

757
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:36,229
There are always going to be some repetitions along the way.

758
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,350
Do you have any thoughts?

759
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,893
I actually have a question for John also, because John is the master of story. I just

760
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:45,915
make like code things happen. I'm curious to know whether...

761
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:55,123
it was easier to give the ink solid pieces of state that you could work off with this game,

762
00:47:55,243 --> 00:48:01,686
which is obviously really state-based, or something that's more woolly and story-based,

763
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:05,768
like Heaven's Vault or something, where there's no fixed positions of things,

764
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:07,388
there's just you're in a world and there's stuff around.

765
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,403
Yeah, this was a lot easier.

766
00:48:13,264 --> 00:48:16,285
Like, the bedrock of Heaven's Vault is the knowledge map,

767
00:48:16,505 --> 00:48:20,167
which is kind of all the things that Aaliyah can be thinking or realise

768
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:21,207
during the course of the game.

769
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:24,688
And that is impossible to really write down,

770
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:29,911
so the only way to make the dialogue work is to have that knowledge map

771
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,031
entirely in your head while you're writing it.

772
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:34,372
So at the time that was okay, but now when I look back at it,

773
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:36,133
I have no idea what's going on.

774
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:44,001
Oh John, I lost you. Tom, did you lose John?

775
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:44,962
Game side thing.

776
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,564
John, we lost you there for a second.

777
00:48:47,864 --> 00:48:48,284
Am I back?

778
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:50,206
Yes, you're back.

779
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:51,086
Well,

780
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:54,989
in PedDragon anyway, there's a game side

781
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:56,930
thing which Tom wrote which works

782
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,032
out what the current move looks

783
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:00,693
like and assigns tags to it.

784
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,414
And that's a lovely piece of robust

785
00:49:02,714 --> 00:49:04,696
analytical code. It just looks at the board

786
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:06,517
and looks at the squares and looks at the threats.

787
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:11,515
and then there's the ink side can just read off that completely and that separation between

788
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,738
the kind of game analysis and then the ink just running with it that made it a lot easier to do

789
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:22,579
I think that there was a clear a really clear distinction whereas Heaven's Vault everything

790
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,682
is very muddy um so yeah not that I ever want to make a game like Pendragon again because it was

791
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:31,703
really very difficult I thought I don't know what do you think Dom was it hard?

792
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:38,548
Ah, it was hard in some ways and easy in others. I think maybe, I don't know, I think because

793
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:44,710
it's so much, um, I don't have a word for it, bucket of stuff approach where it's just everything

794
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:50,432
is contextual or at least so much is, it probably took it longer to come to life. I remember first

795
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:55,654
showing it to Joe when he came down first, showing him what we've been doing for a while.

796
00:49:56,934 --> 00:50:01,938
and sort of having seen it in this state where like every time it would load a level it would

797
00:50:01,978 --> 00:50:05,161
just say something completely random and you showed it to Joe and like he had this perfectly

798
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:09,164
normal playthrough and just everything just worked out and like after just piling stuff

799
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:14,048
into the bucket after like a few months all of a sudden oh no it can just sort of produce

800
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,792
like really robust content and like yeah the more you pile away the better that system gets.

801
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:24,240
Yeah, I do love the bucket of content approach actually for exactly that.

802
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,424
That when you get to the point where it starts to produce halfway sensible output,

803
00:50:30,245 --> 00:50:34,689
then everything you do from there, every extra bit of content you add is just adding value

804
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:38,372
somewhere. And you don't know where it's going to come out or when it's going to come out,

805
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:43,416
but when it does, it's always like really, it's a real pleasure to see it when it does.

806
00:50:43,476 --> 00:50:47,980
I remember that joke. Yeah, I have enjoyed that actually.

807
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:53,673
Right on, I think it's time to start wrapping up. I'll give a quick shoutout to Chaotic94 in chat, who just says,

808
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:55,854
love all the talks on YouTube, keep up the good work.

809
00:50:56,735 --> 00:51:03,318
Uh, as a pitch for our friends at Inkle, there are some talks on the GDC YouTube channel from, uh,

810
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:07,820
from folks at Inkle about the making of games like Heaven's Vault, 80 Days, and so on.

811
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,261
Um, one of my favorites, it's not Joe Tomer.

812
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:19,284
or John here, but Meg Giants talk about NPCs in 80 days and how you can empower your NPCs to tell

813
00:51:19,324 --> 00:51:23,365
better stories in games. One of my favorite talks and one of my inspirations for some of the writing

814
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:29,987
I've done outside of, you know, I love it. I love thinking about game worlds in terms of the

815
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:35,068
characters you meet in them. So with that, John and Tom, if they have more questions for you about

816
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:39,169
Pendragon, where can they ask them? And also, where can they buy Pendragon? I might as well

817
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:40,050
let you pitch the game.

818
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:49,468
So, Pendragon is available now with a 10% discount all week on this weird little shop called Steam that you might have heard of,

819
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:53,510
and also on this lovely shop called GOG which you might also have heard of,

820
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,871
and also on the Mac App Store if you're unfortunate enough to ever use the Mac App Store.

821
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,592
I'm joking, it's wonderful.

822
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:02,373
And yeah, you can get it there.

823
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:05,394
And if you want to talk to us, we're at Inkle Studios on...

824
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:09,899
We also have a Discord channel, but you can find that from Twitter probably.

825
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,285
Also, it's in the game. You can access... I thought this was really smart.

826
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:15,954
You can hit escape and you can click join Discord, which I think more devs are doing.

827
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:21,183
Oh, there you go. So you need to buy the game so you can join our discord. You can ask about the game

828
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:23,504
There you go

829
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:27,185
Okay with that, uh before everyone on my team gets horrifically murdered

830
00:52:27,365 --> 00:52:31,606
I'm going to end this looking like i'm a smart strategic person and bid you all adieu

831
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:35,907
We're actually uh for fans of gdc. It's gonna be an interesting week for us tomorrow

832
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:41,628
We have a stream with uh, the ceo of proletariat. They make spell break. Um, uh later this week

833
00:52:41,648 --> 00:52:46,229
We've got some cool things coming down the pipe about what is happening next gdc is going to be

834
00:52:46,669 --> 00:52:46,849
next

835
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:48,270
Next year?

836
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,870
Question mark?

837
00:52:50,011 --> 00:52:55,073
We've announced July things, but I don't... it's all weird.

838
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:56,113
It's... it's...

839
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,234
I mean, we're... no, that's announced.

840
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:58,094
That's confirmed, to be clear.

841
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:01,436
But also, like, we're still figuring out how to make GDC happen in...

842
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:03,161
in these uncertain times.

843
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,642
So we're doing that.

844
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,382
We're trying to bring more lessons for you.

845
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,323
We're bringing more great interviews with developers.

846
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:12,323
We're excited to keep,

847
00:53:13,643 --> 00:53:15,964
we're excited that as the world enters a weird space,

848
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:17,344
people want to keep making games.

849
00:53:17,804 --> 00:53:19,885
And we want to keep talking to them about making games

850
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:21,525
and learning what they've learned, et cetera, et cetera.

851
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:22,385
That's always going to be,

852
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,986
it's so thrilling to see that that like holds up

853
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:27,326
even when everything gets weird.

854
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:33,569
And I'm just grateful that John and Tom are willing to talk about like how a weird world influences

855
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,491
Making and releasing games it's gonna be a weird like man you two are it's gonna be weird for all your colleagues in a year

856
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:44,473
So when they release their games and they're like, yeah, we finished this in lockdown

857
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:46,533
That influenced some stuff

858
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:53,936
Anyway with that odd note, I will end this stream and wish everyone a good day. Thank you for let for hanging out

859
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:57,277
Thank you chaotic 94 other folks and have a good day. Bye

860
00:53:59,044 --> 00:53:59,413
Bye.
