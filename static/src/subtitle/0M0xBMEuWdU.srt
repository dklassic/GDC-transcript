1
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:12,253
Okay, guys. It's really nice to see so many familiar faces from companies I worked for

2
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:19,214
previously. My name is Eugen Harton. I'll be talking about cheating. And currently I

3
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:23,415
work as an associate producer on Project DayZ, and I've been focusing on security and deployment.

4
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:30,117
I have a question for you. How many of you cheated in a game so far? Can you just raise

5
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:33,638
your hands? Cheaters. Nice.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,440
How many of you spend money on cheats?

7
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,022
Anybody?

8
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,083
Interesting.

9
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:47,566
OK, so I got a really famous tweet

10
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:49,827
that made me really popular on hacker forums and cheater

11
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:50,167
forums.

12
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,168
It's called Gotta Catch Them All.

13
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,590
I called cheaters Pokemons because I was collecting them

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,970
in the ban library.

15
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,413
And the basic thing about that is, like, it's a huge game of cat and mouse.

16
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:10,762
Like, you're basically trying to get ahead and get those guys banned in as many ways as possible.

17
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:16,128
And I really found out that unhackable game is a myth.

18
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,191
I've been focusing on that for a couple of months now.

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,012
And...

20
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:28,312
Since I tried a lot of cheats over the time and months, not just daisy cheats like Counter-Strike,

21
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:33,514
every game imaginable that was out there and became popular for some reason, especially for cheating.

22
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:42,359
How many of you guys have cheated in a multiplayer game like Sandbox or just FPS? Speed hacking,

23
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,703
for example, aim bots. Can you just raise your hand if you've tried that? A couple of guys, nice.

24
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,568
So I'm going to talk about the basics.

25
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,529
Cheating business.

26
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,072
I did an analysis on the current state of the cheating business

27
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:01,834
in really different ways.

28
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,256
And I'll show you over a couple of slides.

29
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:07,519
So what it is, cheating is getting a fair advantage

30
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,681
in a game in different ways.

31
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,683
Through exploiting, so it's bugs that we bring into our games

32
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,885
that we leave them or forget about them.

33
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:21,398
It's cheating itself, which can be done by many different ways.

34
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:22,558
I'll talk about that later.

35
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:26,439
It's scripting, memory injections, memory manipulation,

36
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,260
memory reading, and a lot of other stuff.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,021
Gear and items, like all of the games, RPGs, FPS,

38
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,602
whatever the game is, you get items, you get gear,

39
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:38,503
anything that can give you an advantage in the game

40
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:39,564
and progress you further.

41
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:43,405
So people pay for services and gear directly

42
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,546
that can be transferred through accounts and used in the game.

43
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,166
So who are cheaters and what's their motivation?

44
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:56,889
There are creators who are actually guys creating the cheats.

45
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,891
Now there is an interesting thing, like most of the people do it for money.

46
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:06,296
I'll talk about revenue a bit later, but it's really interesting the amount of money people

47
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,476
make from making cheats.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,081
There are buyers, who are guys who actually have money and can buy cheats.

49
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:18,482
The subscription can be pretty costly, and you'll see it in the next couple of slides as well.

50
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:24,743
Wannabes, those are cheaters who beg on forums, on chats, and they're trying to get cheats for free.

51
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:26,824
So, wannabes.

52
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:30,545
An interesting category is griefers.

53
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,965
Like, you see them in many other games.

54
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:35,066
Like, the toxicity in DayZ is pretty high.

55
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,624
You can see it in forums, you can see it in every social channel that we have at the moment.

56
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:47,231
And we got a couple of personal connections on Griefers and Vandals.

57
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:53,117
They've been trying to, wouldn't I say, destroy our game, but they've been trying really hard to make us look really bad.

58
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:56,039
And they wasted a lot of time and money to do that.

59
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,504
So, Sellers.

60
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,792
It became a big business, so marketing is part of it.

61
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,773
In cheating business, a big part of it is peer promotion,

62
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,073
which is reputation building.

63
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:14,374
When you look at forums, cheating forums, chats,

64
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:17,095
private communities, hacking forums, whatever it is,

65
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,556
there is certain kind of social status

66
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,016
that you build through reputation,

67
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,297
and you use that to sell hacks

68
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,538
and become famous in that community.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,461
There's a lot of advertising going on.

70
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:33,842
You can see it on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter.

71
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,604
I've even seen a couple of streamers of ours

72
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,344
cooperating with cheaters.

73
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,745
So they increase their view time,

74
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,907
because they are actually behind the scenes talking to them.

75
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:48,189
So they can see effects in game, get good gear.

76
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,130
And it's been a big problem as well.

77
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,651
And social engineering.

78
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,612
When somebody sells a hack, he wants

79
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,093
to sell a hack for a reason.

80
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,354
When you're a kid and you're buying something,

81
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,495
it's probably your parents' money.

82
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:03,263
If you're an adult, it's your money and you can do whatever you want with it.

83
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,364
And you choose based on a number of things.

84
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,866
However, the big thing in social engineering when marketing a cheat is creating an enemy.

85
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:16,388
Whenever you visit hacking forums, cheater forums, or whatever it is,

86
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:23,151
you can see that they target something that they think is evil.

87
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:28,273
For example, in our case, it's Batly, our kernel agent that we use to protect the game.

88
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,108
They make Batlaya into rootkit, which it isn't, really.

89
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,669
And they make it an enemy.

90
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,051
So what they do by buying cheats is actually

91
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,152
fighting the big enemy, the big brother,

92
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:41,292
that we are at the moment.

93
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,494
Besides reputation, there are a lot

94
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,235
of features that can differentiate the cheats

95
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,555
that you buy or sell.

96
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,777
And I'll be talking about different features in our game

97
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:55,498
that you can see being used.

98
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,355
You only know who sells cheats. Those are usually guys who do it for money, because it's a big business.

99
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:10,098
There are two ways they do it currently, or most of them.

100
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:15,581
Subscription model. So you buy like a subscription for a month, two months, a year,

101
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:23,085
where a guy who's on the other side or a team provides you with cheats for a game that you bought a subscription for.

102
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:28,488
The features can change. However, the basic business model of that is

103
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,837
that they enable you to cheat over a long term of time.

104
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,998
When you get banned and your license is no longer usable,

105
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,259
they always can provide another cheat,

106
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:39,879
although you have to buy a license.

107
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:45,540
So there is a revenue coming in, even for us there.

108
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:48,421
Where do they get sold?

109
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:51,341
There's a big paranoia in the hacking and cheating community.

110
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,802
I've seen a lot of website portals, guys

111
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,723
like private sellers that

112
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:05,786
To evade leaks of their cheats, keep it really simple or really complicated.

113
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:12,433
They sell it through IMs, Skype, ICQs, IRC, forums, both private and public.

114
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:17,458
A lot of the forums actually need a recommendation from other people in the forums.

115
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,263
And there's a big infiltration topic there that I'll talk about as well.

116
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:26,889
and web portals, which are the big guys who actually sell cheats for a lot of games,

117
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,130
and they make the big bucks in general.

118
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:32,953
So what does it cost to buy a cheat?

119
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:38,178
For DayZ, it can go from $1 a month up to $500.

120
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:46,264
If you can ask why so much, there are things out there that they are keeping in private communities,

121
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:52,109
and people are willing to pay a lot of money for undetected cheats that stay there for a long time.

122
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,998
What is the difference between the cheats?

123
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:59,921
It's features, service, reliability, and communication,

124
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,883
which is something that I talked about before.

125
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,444
And it's about reputation.

126
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,646
When you build it up and you're a seller of a cheat,

127
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,309
you're the big guy, and you can offer it

128
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,631
to different customers, and your customer base grows.

129
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,232
Although you have to be really careful,

130
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:14,514
because once you become big, you become

131
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,796
a target for the developer, and you're actually

132
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:20,159
trying to find out how the guy does it, what he actually does,

133
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,981
and how it becomes a service.

134
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:32,813
As I said, it is a full-time source of income. There are public services and private sellers.

135
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:38,657
There are a lot of precautions that the guys do to make the cheat unusable and untransferable

136
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:43,181
between guys, between people. So when we have a snitch in the cheating community and when

137
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:49,005
he wants to send us a cheat, it's usually hardware ID locked. It's unusable, it's usually

138
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:54,849
running in a VM and a bytecode, and it has a lot of anti-reverse engineering protection.

139
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,511
When you're buying a cheat, especially in Russian communities, they use services like

140
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:08,954
VK, WebMoney, and a lot of services that you don't get in Europe, or are hard to get, and

141
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,935
the barrier of the language is really a problem there.

142
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:18,998
So a lot of the sites require a citizen ID to buy a cheat, which is really funny when

143
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:19,598
you think about it.

144
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:22,259
They require a Skype call, so you will have to be...

145
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:28,387
really outspoken in their language, and you have to be able to prove your identity to

146
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:29,488
the guy on the Skype call.

147
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:35,169
They require Facebook and Viki account checks, which is really interesting when you think

148
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:36,189
about the paranoia they have.

149
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,090
And the paranoia is real.

150
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,491
So cheating business and numbers.

151
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,712
Currently in DayZ, 1.39% of sold licenses are banned.

152
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:55,636
There is a big extrapolation that I did on the data that we have from Banning,

153
00:09:56,497 --> 00:10:00,360
and which just confirms what I said in the start of the presentations.

154
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:01,942
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

155
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:06,566
There's a 76% bounce rate for a guy, for most of them.

156
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,449
And so, when you think about it, the real thing is,

157
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,513
most of those people who cheat would rather stop playing than stop cheating.

158
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,204
Currently, we have a total of 44,000 banned accounts.

159
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,284
That counts for both public and private sector of cheater sellers.

160
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:31,706
In the database of cheats, or a library, to say, and detection methods that we currently

161
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:38,547
use, there are around 400 cheats that have been sold or resold by different suppliers

162
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:39,627
and different methods.

163
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:46,168
When you compare the numbers to other services, since the

164
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:54,032
business itself is growing. For VAC bans, it's 1.42 of total accounts banned.

165
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:58,033
And here's the revenue numbers, which is really, really interesting.

166
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:05,196
Revenue for some public sites goes up to 1.25 million a year.

167
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,297
That's euros or dollars, depending on the site.

168
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,418
It's a big business. It's a multi-million dollar business,

169
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:13,639
and it's happening now. With the rise of survival games...

170
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,932
like DayZ, where a game and the gameplay mechanic is based around permanent death, which is

171
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:26,214
becoming a problem, the gameplay experience itself really suffers when somebody is cheating.

172
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,736
You die, you basically lose everything, and you don't want to play the game anymore.

173
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:37,838
When it comes to public sellers in DayZ, so you contact the site, for example, AimJunkies.

174
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:42,760
I make hacks for DayZ, I want to sell through you, because you have a reputation to cover.

175
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:49,174
You get in contact, you start selling cheats, you can make as much as 40k euros a month.

176
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,556
And no problem, it's like not really that hard.

177
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,478
For private sellers, it's a bit harder.

178
00:11:55,618 --> 00:12:00,400
It's usually private forums, IRC chats, or places where you can sell the hack privately

179
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,542
in a small community of 10 to 50 people.

180
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:05,823
And they buy a subscription from you.

181
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:10,166
And some of those private sellers are making like 5k dollars a month,

182
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:13,147
which is a really good income when you think about it.

183
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,167
So what cheating business means in DayZ?

184
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,889
It's gear selling. We heard a lot of that.

185
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,334
ESP, which are raiders that show you items and players in-game.

186
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,299
Item and player magnets, so that's teleportation of items and players.

187
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,484
Remote damage, which is causing damage through really large distances

188
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,227
by creating explosions or just teleporting bullets.

189
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:39,949
AimBots.

190
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:45,670
really common. Speed hacks, common as well. This is really special for DayZ. We're in

191
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,312
early access, so we're pretty buggy as well. And there are loads of ways to cause server

192
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:54,775
crashes, and a couple of guys found that out, and they've been abusing that over the past

193
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:57,716
couple of months, crashing servers and different kinds of things.

194
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:07,801
So how do they cheat? That's the big question. When you think about it, there are loads of

195
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,321
ways to do it.

196
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,838
However, you can categorize it in two ways.

197
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,019
There are external cheats and internal cheats.

198
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,780
There are attack vectors to inject in Windows,

199
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:21,363
engine, through data or script, or the anti-cheat itself,

200
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,504
which we had a problem recently.

201
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,288
When you want to cheat, there are

202
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,229
lots of ways to do it besides buying a cheat.

203
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,970
If you want to learn by yourself, there are.

204
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:40,967
a great number of tutorials out there that you can use on the hacking forums, cheating

205
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:45,770
forums, or you can ask a guy when you build up a reputation and he'll tell you and give

206
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,894
you advice how to build it up. Most of the people in cheating forums start

207
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:53,877
with something that's really base. They either take something from a guy and try to modify

208
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:58,740
it or they go all the way when they have a programming experience and they download something

209
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,084
from GitHub and use it to hack a game. When you're talking about memory manipulation,

210
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:08,513
There are a couple of programs on GitHub that do that.

211
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,393
I've selected some of them.

212
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:11,913
There are more of them, of course.

213
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:17,055
We're talking about Xenos, which is really, really used a lot.

214
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:22,636
Cheat Engine, used as well by a large number of people.

215
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:25,757
And more, Reclass, MemorySharp, DLL Injector.

216
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,617
Besides injecting a DLL memory manipulation, which means

217
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,398
reading or writing to a memory.

218
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:39,576
There are other ways to cheat, which is usually external programs or modifying the data, modifying the script that's running within the game.

219
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:47,581
And we have a different kind of problem with DayZ, because we're a moddable sandbox game, and we won't have full conversions at one point.

220
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,804
And if that's going to happen, and we're going to get there...

221
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:56,905
we can expect that the problem of cheating is going to become more obvious.

222
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,506
That's why we're focusing on different layers now,

223
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,747
and I'll show those layers in a couple of slides.

224
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,969
When you use a dedicated application or a driver,

225
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:12,751
you're talking about direct memory manipulation or...

226
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,962
abusing gameplay script, patching the data, or executable, or using gameplay exploits

227
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:24,285
in combination with both of those things. We had a couple of funny stories from our

228
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:31,089
development where they were able to create spectacular things, like tornadoes and explosions

229
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:36,252
making like models almost from particle effects. And there was this one guy, because we have

230
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:41,335
full physics system in game, who actually created like a shield by injecting.

231
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:46,882
arrows in the game because they have collision, and created an arrow shield around this character,

232
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:49,923
and he was running around the game, just hitting people with that shield.

233
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:57,465
And when you see that, it's where I understand why the Twitch streamers actually abuse that,

234
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:58,706
to increase their viewership.

235
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:02,807
Contacting cheaters, making spectacles, using cheats in many different ways.

236
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:03,927
It's almost like modding.

237
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:06,208
People want to try that out.

238
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:10,950
I had a friend who made a mod for DayZ, the original one.

239
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:18,539
where he built a bat cave. A proper bat cave that would open up and he would fly out with a batmobile and just run out of that.

240
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,923
So they just want to make the spectacle work. And even our griefers and vandals, they usually don't damage the game as much.

241
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:30,966
Although there are a couple of those as well. But the spectacle is a big thing there for those guys.

242
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:36,409
So when you have a...

243
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,532
So, for example, you want to cheat in game.

244
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:45,165
You find a way to modify Xenos driver with Blackbone or use

245
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:48,188
cheat engine and modify it yourself from GitHub. You have

246
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,610
to find a way to bypass the protection. There are always

247
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,332
vectors in the anti-cheat in the Windows and a lot of other

248
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,234
things that you can use to bypass the protection. Nothing

249
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:58,996
is perfect. There is no unhackable game and Windows

250
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:04,701
isn't perfect either. There is a thing called kernel patch guard

251
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:07,563
that you can see in 64-bit Windows and

252
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:13,690
There are loads of ways to abuse it, to turn it off, and it doesn't even exist for most

253
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:18,554
of the versions of Windows in 32-bit. That's why running a kernel driver in Windows

254
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:26,341
is really easy for most people out there. When you set it up in layers, like what you

255
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:32,807
want to do is create a module that you can use to manipulate the memory or inject something

256
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:37,210
into data or a library of a game, finding the right offsets is really easy.

257
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:44,710
in the memory so you can abuse speed of a player, position of a player, damage of a

258
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,134
gun, whatever it is, health, invulnerability, whatever it is you can use in the game to

259
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:54,458
find a way to make the experience harder for other guys or make the experience better for

260
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:59,082
yourself. Most of the cheats are a combination of exploits.

261
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:04,346
They are based around gameplay logic. And when you get there...

262
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:08,949
and injecting the game that are usually, for our purposes,

263
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,930
since we're moddable and the script is really, really

264
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,390
powerful.

265
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,611
Execution methods for gameplay script.

266
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:20,232
Now, there's been a big thing in ARMA communities,

267
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:24,553
and Daisy as well, since we have our own script called SQF.

268
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,974
And we're moving to other things now.

269
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,775
With the SQF, you've got pretty powerful tools

270
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:31,435
at your disposal.

271
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:36,039
In the original structure, I'll talk about that as well later,

272
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,462
SQS could have been abused for a lot of things.

273
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:45,125
And there are execution methods for our script within the game.

274
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:50,691
that enable you to even compile strings that you inject in a library

275
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:55,593
or any part of the function of the original gameplay.

276
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,134
Which has been a big problem for us,

277
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:00,256
and we're trying to improve on that over the course of time,

278
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:02,678
but it's not an easy task and it takes some time.

279
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,562
When I was thinking about the future of hacking and cheating in games,

280
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,704
I've been on a hacking conference a couple of months ago.

281
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,365
I was discussing with the guys, like, what are the options.

282
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,059
Windows is improving.

283
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:21,540
Kernel of Badge Guard is kind of working.

284
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,021
But there are still ways to hook on a process,

285
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,162
to get in there, to work it out.

286
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,243
And we created a small hacking hardware

287
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,084
on the hacking conference.

288
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,405
It was a USB key 3.0.

289
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:41,847
And if you don't know, USB 3.0 firmware on the controller

290
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:43,287
has a direct memory access.

291
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,888
So what I see in the future are a dedicated hardware

292
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:47,328
to cheat.

293
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:55,966
and hack, really hard to detect. And firmware hacks on hardware that can access the memory.

294
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:01,891
Some of the new motherboards and some of the new stuff that you can see out there can be

295
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:06,134
really abused by the guys that want to do it. And it's not that hard when you think

296
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:13,361
about it. So dedicated hardware coming for sure. Now the funny thing is, how do we protect

297
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:13,701
the game?

298
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:19,497
You have to consider the damage that cheating does to user experience of your players.

299
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,981
For a game like us, DayZ, it means a lot.

300
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:28,168
When you kill somebody in game, it's a problem because he loses all of his progress.

301
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,070
So it's different for every other game.

302
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:32,493
In survival genre...

303
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,635
It's a huge problem.

304
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:39,378
What you need to focus on is your terms of service, EULA,

305
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:40,458
and fair use.

306
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,701
So we can set the base of why you ban,

307
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:46,903
what is the license ban, what is the fair use of the game,

308
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,205
and identify the core gameplay where

309
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:50,246
the problems might emerge.

310
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:56,190
Protection has to be layered.

311
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,093
I set out to talk about those layers,

312
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:03,576
and I tried to name them as proper as I can.

313
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:09,195
Prevention, detection, obfuscation, banning strategy,

314
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:09,695
and legal.

315
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,138
Now, for prevention, what is prevention?

316
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:18,540
In our case, we implemented BatLieAgent,

317
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,642
which is a ring zero kernel agent.

318
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:25,024
Using kernel patch guard and OB callback routines,

319
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,046
you can see that in a couple of other entities as well.

320
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:39,780
It's something really that Microsoft implemented for what was abused previously as undocumented

321
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,101
calls by different antiviruses and heuristics in general.

322
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:50,523
Now, when you talk about OB callback routines, which is the prevention layer of making sure

323
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:56,865
that you detect or prevent a hook to a game, to a running model process, whatever it is.

324
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,759
Besides that, we use a DLL whitelist.

325
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,621
Within the protection system that we enabled

326
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,803
is a whitelist of DLLs that can be

327
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:11,364
within the module of the Z or touching the module.

328
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,786
And we're trying to unlink or dishook whatever

329
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:15,987
is trying to get in the process.

330
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,190
We did one more thing that's really interesting.

331
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,871
Since when you talk about PatchGuard, which is a

332
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,974
something that Microsoft implemented that I mentioned before.

333
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,676
We disabled running of the game in Windows test mode.

334
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:38,500
When you're trying to create a memory injection application or a driver or whatever it is,

335
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:44,303
usually you have to, if you want to get it to a kernel level, you have to certify it

336
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:44,824
and sign it.

337
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:50,527
Now, buying a certificate is not really cheap, but for the guys who are making the big bucks,

338
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:51,287
it's probably nothing.

339
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:58,161
But even then, disabling the test mode was one of the better choices that we did over

340
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:01,283
the course of the story of DayZ and our battle with cheating.

341
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,928
Because unsigned drivers are really easy to use and really easy to get running because

342
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:09,850
you only need some programming knowledge and access to GitHub.

343
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:14,654
How do we detect?

344
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,956
There are loads of patterns that you can use.

345
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,283
Since the kernel driver and a ring zero agent that we use at the moment,

346
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:28,127
you can detect through strings, which means strings in running scripts that they inject in-game,

347
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:30,369
names of files.

348
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,592
Hackers and cheaters are really like simple people in a certain sense

349
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:37,815
because the reputation building is about names and being recognizable.

350
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:40,076
So a lot of the things they do, they sign.

351
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:43,880
You can see their names, their patterns in everything they do.

352
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,121
They use the same certificates.

353
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,666
They usually try even abusive words within the name of the certificate or name of the

354
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:57,350
strings they use in the menus that you can see in the cheat itself.

355
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:03,155
You can see driver memory patterns that you can detect through OBCallbacks as well and

356
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,478
a couple of other Windows features, which hopefully if we get the time, I'll get into

357
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,079
technicalities.

358
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,484
You can detect bypass vectors.

359
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:14,464
So there are loads of vectors within Windows

360
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,985
that they can use to abuse the game, get into memory,

361
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,846
read it, inject, and change the memory.

362
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,567
Those vectors usually require some kind

363
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,667
of change within Windows.

364
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:28,268
So we can be looking for registry entries, UNSP journal,

365
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:30,809
and a lot of other stuff that Windows uses at the moment

366
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:35,110
to generate data and logs on what the user has actually

367
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,290
done.

368
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:42,157
Even when using OB callbacks and other Windows features,

369
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:44,959
there is a big difference.

370
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,140
Because these features have been designed for antiviruses

371
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:51,342
and protecting the user.

372
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:52,763
We're doing a different thing.

373
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,285
And it's really, really a problem.

374
00:24:56,566 --> 00:25:01,669
We're trying to make the user not do certain things.

375
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,550
And it's not about the antivirus,

376
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,590
which is protecting the user.

377
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,151
We're trying to suppress the user.

378
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:11,039
And the features that Windows has haven't been designed to do that originally.

379
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,083
However, the cheating as a problem is really huge and we have to fight it somehow.

380
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:20,185
And this is the best way that we did it.

381
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:25,148
We're trying to improve it. We'll see where it actually goes.

382
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,233
Besides protecting the game and detecting any manipulation within the data, executable,

383
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:33,873
whatever it is.

384
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,138
You need to protect the agent itself.

385
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,801
As I said in the beginning, we had a couple of injections

386
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:42,244
that were based around exploits within the anti-cheat itself.

387
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:47,230
There are technicalities regarding the user mode

388
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:52,096
and full access within the hook that they can abuse.

389
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,299
And two.

390
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:59,198
understand what we do at the moment, I'll try to explain this.

391
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:04,019
We're trying to protect the agent and the game from reverse engineering,

392
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,600
so being able to understand what actually happens within the game.

393
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,222
For the battle I anti-cheat, we remove part of the code and reintroduce them later.

394
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:17,943
So the cheaters can never know what's actually happening and what's changing,

395
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,284
and the obfuscation is really a big part of it.

396
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,605
We're doing live updates to game.

397
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,762
and the entity itself.

398
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:35,529
And we're using the Authoritative Master Server for detection and processing of the data

399
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:37,751
that we get through our agent.

400
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:44,217
We don't want the detections to be part of the client that we're running on the user

401
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:44,617
PC.

402
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:47,380
Encryption is really needed.

403
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,263
A big part of being

404
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:56,670
game that's not abusable is engine architecture and server client architecture.

405
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,053
Now when you look at all the other games and anti-cheats out there, which is besides BatLive,

406
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:07,378
which we use, and it's amazing, easy anti-cheat, Warden that Blizzard uses, and a couple of

407
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,280
other things that are either private or available for you to buy.

408
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,062
The client-server architecture is a big part of it.

409
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,223
Now, you cannot trust the client.

410
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,344
It's a user PC.

411
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:18,105
He can do whatever he needs to do

412
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,347
or whatever he wants to do with the PC

413
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,209
and with the data, memory, processes that are running.

414
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,731
It's his, and he can be byte-patching all your logs.

415
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,013
He can be byte-patching and manipulating

416
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,674
the packets that he sent.

417
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:31,554
He can do anything.

418
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:35,717
So the agent itself is a big part of the protection.

419
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:38,879
The server architecture.

420
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:42,499
And what we recommend, if you're going to implement any of it,

421
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:44,480
is extensive sanity checks.

422
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,801
Now, there is a gameplay logic to a game.

423
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:52,765
You know that there are certain outcomes that you can expect.

424
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,826
There is a logic to the game.

425
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:56,247
You shoot through the guy.

426
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:56,987
You aim at him.

427
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:58,708
You know that when you hit something,

428
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:02,590
the bullet cannot turn around and hit something else.

429
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:04,391
So you are detecting changes in logic.

430
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:07,302
And we call that sanity checks.

431
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,405
It's something that has been used for a while.

432
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,986
Always consider performance and impact.

433
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:15,548
When you're using the client as a terminal client,

434
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:17,570
so the guy actually, or any simulation,

435
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,590
isn't running on the client.

436
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,432
It's only temporary.

437
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,114
Performance is a big impact there.

438
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:25,295
Since server is doing most of the work,

439
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:27,937
it can cause performance problems

440
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:29,698
for all of the guys that are playing the game.

441
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:31,740
Extensive logging.

442
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,161
It's a big part of.

443
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:37,164
Bring in the anecdotal evidence into our banning strategy.

444
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:42,867
And logging everything that happens on the server and the client, and even using fake

445
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:47,550
logging on the client so cheaters have work to do, because they found it, they think that's

446
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:53,693
our thing, like how we do it, and they work around it, spend weeks on something that really

447
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,193
doesn't matter.

448
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:56,854
Never trust the client.

449
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:02,097
So use authoritative servers when you can for a multiplayer game of any kind of sandbox,

450
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:14,876
or whatever it is. I was talking about protecting our agent and our anti-cheat. Don't forget

451
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:19,798
about protecting the game data and executable. Make it harder to unpack, make it harder to

452
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:25,081
extract offsets through obfuscation, consider performance as well, make it harder to identify

453
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:25,801
the functionality.

454
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,236
If you guys know about Starforce and how it works,

455
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,538
it created the bytecode out of simple scripts

456
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,659
that were running on a kernel level.

457
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,661
And it's something to consider when you're

458
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:39,482
making something like that.

459
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:42,684
Extract the functionality.

460
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:43,804
Run it in a different place.

461
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,046
Try to obfuscate it as much as you can, especially

462
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,287
the core functionality of the game.

463
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:51,169
Find the right balance between performance and protection.

464
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:54,211
Everything you add costs something,

465
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,312
either on the client or server.

466
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:06,290
I already mentioned that the big part of making progress within the strategy is obfuscation.

467
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,250
Use client-side checks that are fake.

468
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,412
Make something up so the guys have work to do within the cheating community and they're

469
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:16,112
spending time on something that doesn't really matter.

470
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:20,453
Remove it, edit again, just make them work for their own.

471
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:23,334
Leave bypasses open to gather bands.

472
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:28,995
Now when we talk about band waves and delaying the bands...

473
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:35,411
Leaving bypasses open to gather bans is a success strategy.

474
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,092
For real.

475
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:40,875
People, even when you look at the public side,

476
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:42,016
they start selling a cheat.

477
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,478
It starts being recognized like, this

478
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:45,678
is the cheat that's being used now.

479
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:46,259
Let's buy it.

480
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,040
Just wait a couple of days.

481
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,941
Let them buy it.

482
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:49,941
Ban them later.

483
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,464
Just more guys who get into ban lists, the better.

484
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,006
Fake the detections when needed.

485
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:59,989
There was this one site, I'll talk about it as well,

486
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:01,450
CFF in Russia.

487
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,397
They are really hard in paranoia.

488
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,158
They required a citizen ID from us.

489
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:09,179
I talk about that.

490
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:11,600
They required a Skype call.

491
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,702
So I had to hire a Russian snitch who actually did the call

492
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:18,084
for us and provided the ID and the VK account

493
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:19,385
and the history of cheating.

494
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:21,966
But he was willing to do that, and he got money for that.

495
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,669
And there's a lot of things like that

496
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:29,130
that happened over the past couple of weeks and months.

497
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:33,236
And bandwaves are one part of it.

498
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:35,418
So when CFF did give us the hack,

499
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:38,400
it was hardware ID locked, so it was used only on one computer,

500
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,582
we had to use anydesk to connect to the computer of the guy who

501
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:44,664
actually bought it, do the OLE debug,

502
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,825
and see what's actually happening within the cheat

503
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:47,946
and what vector they are using.

504
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:53,050
Funny thing was that when the guys found out

505
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,070
after the bandwave happened.

506
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,763
They removed the part of the code which was a real problem for us, because they were abusing

507
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:07,386
user mode within Windows to hook on the battle.ai and the exploit within the anti-cheat itself.

508
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:12,750
But they thought that's what we detected, which we weren't able to, and you're not able to most

509
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,874
of the time. But they advanced and removed the cheat, and we didn't need to do anything,

510
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:23,736
even though it would stay undetected for a while. We were hooking on a certificate that they had.

511
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:30,945
Using delayed bans is a big part for guys who are testing cheats.

512
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:34,907
Now, when you're a creator of the cheat, you're trying to

513
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:38,789
find bypasses, scripts, vectors that you can use to make it

514
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:43,871
viable. Delayed ban means, so whenever somebody uses a vector

515
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:48,252
that has already been detected or found as usable, you use a

516
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:51,554
delayed ban. Just randomize it. One to three days, one to seven

517
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:54,075
days. He creates a hack, starts selling it, and you ban it

518
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,515
later. And it's perfect.

519
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:01,118
Just the basic thing about obfuscation. Waste time for the creator of the cheat.

520
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:09,245
Make them think, make them paranoid, so they work a lot more on what they do

521
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:12,288
and spend time on unnecessary things.

522
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,472
You have to be really careful about false positives.

523
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:22,556
They do happen. Be ready to use customer support,

524
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:25,899
be mindful and every case that you ban.

525
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:27,708
Be sure that you're doing the right thing.

526
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,290
It's better to be safe than sorry.

527
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:34,792
When it comes to banning, there are loads of ways to do it.

528
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,754
There are time-based bans, permanent bans.

529
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,736
I know a lot of games based on the exploit,

530
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,957
or whatever you do, they use time-based bans.

531
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:47,338
They give you time to cool off.

532
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,100
It wasn't the option within the DayZ because of the bounce

533
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,861
back rate we had.

534
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:55,684
As I said in the beginning, we had a bounce-back rate of 76%.

535
00:33:57,225 --> 00:34:00,806
For people who are cheating, they'd rather stop playing than stop cheating.

536
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:03,946
So, for us, permanent ban was the option.

537
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,107
We ban a license, usually.

538
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:13,529
Now, when banning, and when you were looking at the couple of the first slides,

539
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:16,030
and types of cheaters like sellers, wannabes,

540
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,551
cheaters who buy cheats, and griefers, and vandals.

541
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,991
Vandals are a big topic because they...

542
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,501
Even though it's funny to look at the Twitch stream and you see explosions everywhere

543
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:30,806
and a guy running with those arrows around his body, it creates a different perspective

544
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:31,286
on the game.

545
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:35,250
And griefers don't limit themselves to the game.

546
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,833
We have personal attacks and things happening that actually involve law enforcement.

547
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:46,599
These vandals need to be stopped, and in our game we do it through hardware bans.

548
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,302
So we identify the hardware ID, which can be spoofed like anything.

549
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,101
But we do it in a really clever way, which I will not talk about now.

550
00:34:56,042 --> 00:35:03,305
And we ban the guy in a really complicated way.

551
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:09,467
Even when he is spoofing the hardware ID, spoofing the license, using a different license, different IP,

552
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:12,668
we're able to find a correlation between the data.

553
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:15,690
They have patterns that you can detect.

554
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,793
So those are the repeated offenders who want to damage your game.

555
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,095
And it's really important to get them out of the picture.

556
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:26,619
When you're talking about cheating and the story of DayZ,

557
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,663
when I started this, it was January.

558
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:35,225
We had a big problem with cheating in-game.

559
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,868
It became insanely huge.

560
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:40,750
The only thing you would see in the forums was like,

561
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,711
cheaters everywhere, nothing is working.

562
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:44,313
Just goes on the game.

563
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:54,062
And when you see that, you know what's important and the first thing that you should do.

564
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:57,926
You should focus on that and make it not a thing in your game.

565
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:06,613
Now, when we implemented the agent, the rate of cheating has slowed down to something that

566
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:08,475
we are able to contain.

567
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:19,429
And the data suggests that at most one and a half percent of accounts, as seen in the band data, are usually cheaters.

568
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:24,112
Even when you count the active ones that you know are cheating, but you weren't able to find the case.

569
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:31,737
When you're fixing the problem, there are loads of people that need to get involved.

570
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:37,982
We're talking about legal, production, hiring dedicated staff, and even cheaters in the community.

571
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:48,138
When it comes to legal, when you saw the revenue numbers that are happening within the cheating sites,

572
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,843
taking down the sites offering cheats is something that can be done.

573
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:59,407
It sometimes doesn't happen the right way, and they can move really quickly

574
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:03,270
when they have reputation and money to cover their sales and their assets.

575
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,613
Now, when it comes to legal and how do you do that...

576
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:10,159
So a lot of people within cheating business go corporate.

577
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,580
So they are usually tax frauding.

578
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,761
And it's a big part of what you can use within legal

579
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,703
to get on their backs and get them in jail.

580
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:21,804
Certificate use.

581
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:26,126
Now, when I was talking about memory injection drivers,

582
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:29,387
and since we disabled test mode of Windows

583
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:32,169
for uncertified drivers, they have to use certificates.

584
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:32,689
They buy them.

585
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,790
We can revoke those certificates through certificate

586
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,231
authorities for fair use.

587
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:43,958
and made them just pay more, or actually use that within the case for legal.

588
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,459
When I was talking about griefers and vandals, there are a lot of things that happened over

589
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:55,160
the past couple of weeks in regards of personal harassment, DDoS attacks on our service, and

590
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:03,102
it was a problem because we made it personal. Make focusing on your game inconvenient for

591
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,023
creators and let them move on to other games.

592
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:15,977
It's important to make the cheating thing as hard as you can, so that the guys who are

593
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:21,239
actually trying to make money off you are not able to, or it's as hard that either their

594
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:28,361
skill set is not sufficient, or the time investment they need actually doesn't return back on

595
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:28,962
the money side.

596
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:35,764
From the production, highly dedicated staff.

597
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,107
That means programmers, community managers, and cheaters.

598
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,988
Now, when I'm talking about cheaters,

599
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,489
I mean people within the community

600
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,210
who are part of cheating community

601
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,812
and can snitch for you, buy you cheats, send you stuff,

602
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:51,614
involve the community through reporting.

603
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:55,656
When you talk about dedicated staff,

604
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:00,059
it suggests that on the engine level,

605
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,020
you focus on authoritative servers,

606
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,440
especially for multiplayer games,

607
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,361
which is what we are talking right now about.

608
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:08,443
and focus on network and the controller within the engine.

609
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:11,766
For community managers, there are three levels

610
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:13,727
of infiltration that we are using currently.

611
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:16,549
We infiltrate hack providers, sites,

612
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,892
acting as an unknown user and the good guy who's

613
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:21,993
just trying to buy a cheat.

614
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,715
We're infiltrating hacking forums

615
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:26,416
where the private communities reside,

616
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,198
and we're acting as a.

617
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,882
nasty hacker, a vandal, and we're impersonating ourselves within the community,

618
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:37,023
gathering the reputation, getting the connections, making friends.

619
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:41,104
That's how you get to the private sheets and the exploits, which aren't mentioned anywhere.

620
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,266
When it comes to infiltrating the private communities, that's where the reputation really

621
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:54,769
is needed. You need to make fake identities, create fake people to get within those communities.

622
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,030
And they're really private. We're talking about three to four guys.

623
00:39:58,715 --> 00:40:04,518
who've been with each other for years, and they usually don't let anybody inside their

624
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:04,718
group.

625
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:10,221
So we have to bleed some exploits to get into those groups, and once you're in, you usually

626
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:10,641
stay there.

627
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,183
Timing is really important.

628
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:21,887
When you infiltrate a community, as I said before, delayed bans and ban waves, don't

629
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:26,790
just start banning immediately when you find out an exploit or any problem within the game.

630
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:37,236
Wait for it and just gather some bands, get some data, be analytical about what you do.

631
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:46,884
When it comes to community, I already said, make friends.

632
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:51,448
I have a lot of snitches within the community who report things to me.

633
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:58,050
I have some really friendly relationships with them, and they've helped us a lot when it comes

634
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:03,273
to investigating, identifying the problems that we have, and the exploits that the guys use.

635
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:08,896
We closed eight of those exploits within the last month just because of snitching.

636
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:15,579
That's a good outcome. We're talking about expanding the system

637
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:20,041
besides the NTG that we use, besides the engine changes that we're focusing on.

638
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:23,865
rewriting the network, rewriting the controller,

639
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:26,267
creating an authoritative system within the game,

640
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,509
making the prevention layer work accordingly.

641
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,312
We're also well thinking about, let's make this public.

642
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:36,214
Besides snitches and communication

643
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:39,996
through fake accounts, let's give the public, cheaters,

644
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,217
an opportunity to report something and get paid.

645
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:46,720
It's still in the making, but we intend

646
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,222
to introduce a public reward system for the people.

647
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:57,208
who are willing to help or just find it really interesting to create cheats through servers

648
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:04,312
which have disabled protection. So get those guys to focus on creative cheating

649
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:11,456
and choose one, get extensive logging on those servers, and get those exploits found.

650
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:15,418
There's a risk to me made there, of course, but I think...

651
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:24,757
What it actually means is extension of what I said before, making friends and get those

652
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:28,599
people involved within protecting their own game that they have invested so much time in.

653
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,003
Get public report system out, either through email or an application or web,

654
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:42,467
where people can report stuff they found, a video, a cheat, and have your dedicated staff

655
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:45,368
go through that, identify things that you haven't known about before.

656
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:51,505
and get into those communities through means necessary.

657
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:58,169
Now, there are lessons to be learned besides what I talked about so far.

658
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,333
Try not to make it personal. I made a mistake before.

659
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:08,836
I was taunting the guys on Twitter and different social channels, and they retaliated.

660
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:13,880
And it's not only retaliation within the money side, cheating side, or...

661
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:18,766
They made it basically personal on their side and went on a revenge streak, which means

662
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:21,026
personal abuse and other things that happened.

663
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:26,747
So don't retaliate, don't taunt, and beware of the repercussions that can happen.

664
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:35,649
Now I'm going to ask you a couple of questions, or you can ask me questions, I'm not sure

665
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:36,729
which I'm going to start with.

666
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:38,590
How much time do we have?

667
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,090
I'm not sure.

668
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:48,119
Ten minutes? Okay. I'm going to leave you with open questions.

669
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,101
Now, who wants to ask a question?

670
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:54,483
Okay, can I get a microphone there somewhere?

671
00:43:56,264 --> 00:43:57,865
Just raise your hand if you want to ask a question.

672
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:05,871
They wanted to get it recorded, so I'm supposed to wait for the microphone.

673
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:10,954
Yeah, it's going to repeat it.

674
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:33,586
Just raise your hand if you want to ask a question so they can see where to bring the microphone.

675
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:54,458
Hi. So ruining other players' time is horrible, but what do you think about newer companies

676
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:59,182
that are just throwing cheaters to a different server silently and just leaving them there

677
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:01,924
to cheat themselves to death or something like that?

678
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:06,607
Yeah, we actually, since we don't have a single point of contact within the client, you have

679
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:09,830
a server browser, so you can connect to any server, it wasn't an option for us.

680
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:16,123
When you look at Guild Wars and games which have made the obfuscation for cheaters really viable,

681
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:20,028
I think it's an option that if you have the game that can enable something like that,

682
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:23,333
and you can hide it between a layer, it's something that you should use for sure.

683
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:25,416
Like, put them somewhere, let them play.

684
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:27,559
It's something that we did, we created.

685
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,061
cheater servers. And it's really funny when you log on that server, things that happen

686
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:37,383
there, just amazing. Like the spectacle, cheaters fighting against cheaters, like shooting insane

687
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:42,165
bullets, tornadoes running all over the map, cars that are ten times bigger. It's just

688
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:45,947
like amazing. So yeah, if you get the chance, for sure.

689
00:45:48,064 --> 00:45:53,787
Hi, how do you think the cheat market evolved with the rise and development of the free-to-play games,

690
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:57,368
which surely brought many more players into the online gaming?

691
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,790
Do you think this evolved and how did it evolve, the market?

692
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,211
The market itself.

693
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:07,813
Okay, so when I was doing the revenue report and the numbers that I've shown so far...

694
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:12,683
I was trying to go through the people who actually went corporate and see their tax

695
00:46:12,723 --> 00:46:18,987
records and government official sites, see how much tax they actually return, how much

696
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:23,529
money they make, and I was extrapolating the data, trying to compare it to other different

697
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:23,790
sites.

698
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,933
Since I've been doing it only for a short time and focusing on that for only really

699
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:34,035
like almost maybe a year at the most, I've seen an increase.

700
00:46:34,856 --> 00:46:37,197
However I wouldn't say I was there in the past.

701
00:46:38,644 --> 00:46:40,845
and there haven't been too much data on it in general.

702
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:44,807
But currently, I would say it's a multi-million dollar business

703
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:46,307
and we see companies

704
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,749
in the future, I guess mobile and

705
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:53,831
in general cheating for competitive games and games which have a

706
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,032
asynchronous multiplayer, synchronous multiplayer

707
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:57,692
or leaderboards.

708
00:46:58,012 --> 00:46:59,173
There's a real problem there.

709
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:01,414
Because if it's a hook on your game,

710
00:47:01,774 --> 00:47:04,275
if it's what's supposed to be making it fun,

711
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,236
the competitive aspect of the game.

712
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:08,358
You need to focus on that.

713
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:10,179
And there are ways to do it on mobile.

714
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,519
There are ways to do it on PC.

715
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:13,260
It's something that the person holds

716
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,961
and can do anything with it.

717
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:17,782
So you can expect all the things in the future.

718
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,083
As I said, from hardware hacks, I

719
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,424
can see an add-on for a mobile that enables you

720
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:26,586
to root your phone and just root it out and get access

721
00:47:26,606 --> 00:47:29,127
to the memory and all the processes running

722
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:30,768
and hack the game even on mobile.

723
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:33,529
Hopefully that answered the question.

724
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:34,750
Perfect.

725
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:35,830
Any other questions?

726
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:58,463
Yeah, so do you see an interest in industry-wide efforts, maybe collaborating between different studios, seeing best practices, sharing the name, well, maybe not the name of the snitches, but something that goes beyond just one company, each company doing its own effort in one side, and do something a bit more organized, industry side?

727
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:02,526
So, it's basically the reason why I'm here.

728
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,908
to share the data, share the experience.

729
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:11,249
And I would like to see something like that.

730
00:48:11,549 --> 00:48:13,550
Although even when I was making the presentation itself,

731
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,551
I understood that I didn't see, I think I, I don't think I can show it.

732
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:23,372
So there was a, like a Kickstarter that happened for a couple of cheaters.

733
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:27,613
They started a Kickstarter to get funds to get here in the room and troll me.

734
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:30,333
They didn't get the funds, so they didn't go.

735
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:31,393
Hopefully they are not here.

736
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:38,263
So I was really limiting the information that I was sharing through the presentations,

737
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:43,625
because I know that $500 that you need to pay to see the presentation, it's enough for

738
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:48,967
them and they make big bucks, and it's worthwhile for them to see that and listen to it.

739
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:53,849
So most of the conversation should happen in personal space, so anybody who wants to

740
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,870
ask me questions after the presentation, it's more than welcome.

741
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,050
So any cooperation is welcome.

742
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:02,835
Within the cheating and becoming a multi-million dollar business,

743
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,116
it's something that we should consider for sure.

744
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:08,719
I have a question over here.

745
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,781
Oh yeah, perfect.

746
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,183
So you're hiring people from the community

747
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:15,404
to basically play James Bond and spying around,

748
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:17,906
but does that make you afraid of double agents?

749
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:19,127
What are you doing against that?

750
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:23,631
I usually, so when I get into the community

751
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,173
and infiltrate it through either one of the dedicated staff

752
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:28,755
or me myself, I usually cross-check.

753
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:33,470
And so I have a couple of snitches. I cross-check their information, cross-check their data.

754
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:39,232
They usually don't know about each other. I found a couple of liars. I called them lying.

755
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:42,953
I didn't call them out on it because they kept supplying information.

756
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:47,674
But yeah, double agents is a real thing. CFF, the site that I mentioned before,

757
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:55,576
they actually prepared a special site that only appeared for any of our IPs that we use within

758
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:56,137
the VPN.

759
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,999
And we thought the cheat was offline, because there was no talk about it.

760
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,122
And even when we contacted them with the fraud account, the fake account,

761
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:04,583
they gave us a different cheat.

762
00:50:05,484 --> 00:50:08,507
So yeah, the paranoia is real, and double agents are a thing.

763
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:13,711
So cross-checking and getting within the communities from different vectors is important.

764
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:17,354
Yeah?

765
00:50:17,574 --> 00:50:17,995
One over here.

766
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:25,572
Have you ever thought about baiting cheaters as in releasing your own hacks or cheats and then just banning them?

767
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,474
Yeah, I actually part of the presentation mentioned

768
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,435
like leaving the bypasses open.

769
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:37,597
When I was at that point like delaying bans and and doing that sort of thing I was thinking about

770
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,519
even building the reputation is based around releasing hacks.

771
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,040
So yeah, it's something that I considered, but I'm not going to talk about it too much.

772
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:49,667
I'll leave it in private.

773
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:52,250
Okay, any other questions?

774
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:56,015
Anybody?

775
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:13,620
This is an extension of the double-agent question.

776
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:21,965
What happens when your servers are infected with non-ideal code?

777
00:51:23,846 --> 00:51:27,067
I haven't been able to confirm any suspicion regarding that so far.

778
00:51:27,528 --> 00:51:32,350
There have been whole XCs that they built within the DayZ, where they were saying they

779
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,011
infected servers and such.

780
00:51:36,252 --> 00:51:38,973
But I haven't found a case of that happening.

781
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:46,196
I think it's a real possibility. All of our game is actually running on Windows,

782
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:51,699
the dedicated servers. It's like 2,500 of them or something like that.

783
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:59,765
So there is a possibility of human error, of software application layer error, of getting

784
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:05,208
there and doing something really nasty. There are a couple of hoaxes that happened

785
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:07,710
months ago, and I've seen it on other games as well.

786
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:12,148
When you have a network engine within the game, you need to transfer files, especially

787
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:17,415
for moddable games and synchronization through Steam network and getting the mods downloaded.

788
00:52:18,116 --> 00:52:23,843
And there are always vectors to abuse that, like even sharing malware through open channels.

789
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:28,993
And even the server can be used as a rootkit, in general sense, for the clients running,

790
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:33,934
and to transfer data to those clients of running malware, creating botnets, slavenets, and

791
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:34,174
such.

792
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:38,475
So yeah, it's something that I consider, and I've been focusing on security of the servers

793
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:39,155
for a long time.

794
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:40,976
I've been in SRE for 10 years.

795
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:43,656
So yeah, I'm keeping an eye.

796
00:52:46,137 --> 00:52:47,137
Okay, any other questions?

797
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:55,537
So I'm wondering, why are you giving this talk publicly?

798
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,899
Shouldn't be this kept private between companies

799
00:52:57,939 --> 00:53:00,201
so cheaters don't know how you're trying to find them?

800
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,264
So when you look at the data they shared,

801
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:05,306
I tried to limit it as much as I can.

802
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:07,428
But I wanted to be here with the developers

803
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:08,349
to share some of it.

804
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,442
But most of the things that we've done in the last six months, I'll be keeping private.

805
00:53:13,923 --> 00:53:21,729
So the data is real and it's recent, but the methods, as you have seen, I've limited it

806
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:23,310
to just a couple of pointers.

807
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,073
If you're going to do anything like we are doing at the moment, I've gave pointers but

808
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:29,054
haven't said the real thing.

809
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:35,258
So if you're a programmer, coder, and do it in TensorFlow, you can find it, and you can

810
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:36,779
find the pointers and get in it.

811
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:45,395
But yeah, I've limited it to as less information as I can, focusing on the data, on things

812
00:53:45,415 --> 00:53:51,737
that should help you get good at the game of playing the cat and mouse with cheaters,

813
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:52,418
basically.

814
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:55,579
Okay, any other questions?

815
00:53:58,219 --> 00:53:58,339
Yeah?

816
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,169
Thank you. Do you use any ways based on statistics?

817
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:24,793
For example, find AI bots with a lot of headshots from sniper rifles or something like that?

818
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:32,836
Yeah, it's a really good question. So, when I was talking about sanity checks, those are basically based on statistics.

819
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:37,918
Now, we haven't extended them as much as we would have or could have so far.

820
00:54:38,854 --> 00:54:44,696
But I'm really working hard to get those things moving and get things like you mentioned right

821
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:49,797
now in the game so I can extrapolate the data and get it within the anecdotal evidence for

822
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:50,337
banning lists.

823
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:53,478
Any other questions?

824
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,819
Okay.

825
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,921
Have you been in false positive health yet?

826
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:03,981
No.

827
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,467
We got a couple of false positives that were confirmed.

828
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:12,829
There was one outbreak, but I would say it's like in tens of bands,

829
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:14,309
and we contained it.

830
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,632
So yeah, false positives hasn't been much of a problem for us, so far at least.

831
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:20,032
Good for you.

832
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:25,455
Yeah, Eva

833
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:30,737
thought about hiring a cheater, not as a snitch, but as a game developer, because they

834
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:31,758
seem really

835
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:33,979
into your game and know your game really well.

836
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:39,683
So I actually considered it. We got a couple of CVs from cheaters, even the vandals that I mentioned before.

837
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:43,466
No, I wouldn't hire a cheater.

838
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:48,390
The reason is, we talked about it a bunch within the office with the guys.

839
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,474
Now, the problems that I see, like, he's been an abusive person for a while.

840
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:58,659
It's just a leak that I can't consider as a real help.

841
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,400
It's a problem and a risk.

842
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:04,343
And the help that I get from them, from snitching, perfect.

843
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,443
I wouldn't want them in company, for sure.

844
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:29,478
So, let's say you have a lot of cheaters in the game,

845
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:34,462
and do you think that by communicating upfront

846
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:36,324
some of the consequences come from cheating

847
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:38,105
and the seriousness of that?

848
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:40,026
I'm sorry for the microphone.

849
00:56:40,707 --> 00:56:42,528
Or would you rather keep it low profile

850
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:43,889
so that other people might not be tempted

851
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:46,592
to go into the cheating and go into,

852
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:49,073
become more aware of this community

853
00:56:49,093 --> 00:56:51,075
that easily provides cheating?

854
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:54,737
But it's fine, I understand the question now.

855
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:05,081
We haven't been too much spoken about the consequences of cheating because we don't

856
00:57:05,142 --> 00:57:11,324
have much tools besides the license ban that we can use, and we haven't expanded on the

857
00:57:11,364 --> 00:57:14,846
idea yet, but there is something to be made out of it for sure.

858
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,208
Either through sharing information or making it public.

859
00:57:21,995 --> 00:57:23,816
I'm not sure. When I look at the tribunal systems

860
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:29,218
within some of the games or things when community gets to decide what happens, maybe there

861
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:35,621
is something in the public spectacle of getting that out that can lower the initial number

862
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,622
of cheaters or people who are willing to do that.

863
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,245
But I don't have the data from our game. And even though I have spoken to a couple

864
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:47,707
of other guys from companies, those are usually private data, so I can't share that yet.

865
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:52,173
Okay, any questions or are we out of time?

866
00:57:52,554 --> 00:57:54,115
Even though we have questions, we have to stop.

867
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:55,937
Okay, perfect.

868
00:57:56,477 --> 00:58:00,200
So, thank you guys for coming and if you have any questions,

869
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,383
you can find me outside and we can talk a bit more.

870
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:04,063
Thank you.
