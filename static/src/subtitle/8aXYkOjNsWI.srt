00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:14,079
Hi everyone. Greetings in this remote presentation in this COVID-19 world that we're living in.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,571
Great to be with you today. My name is Devin. I'm the Senior Director of Product at EA, the APAC region.

3
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:27,468
I'm going to be talking to you today about integrating product management into development teams,

4
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:32,393
specifically teams that have not had mobile experience before.

5
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:37,578
They may be working on new mobile games now or other platform games,

6
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:40,420
but they don't come from a mobile background.

7
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,863
And that presents some interesting challenges.

8
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:44,784
So let's get into it, shall we?

9
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:50,462
I'm first going to talk to you today, just give you an overview of my journey.

10
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:53,024
I'm going to talk about the PM discipline in general.

11
00:00:53,044 --> 00:01:00,289
I'm going to talk a bit about games as a service and PMs and how they fit into that.

12
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,072
I'm going to talk about some common challenges and solutions to integrating PMs

13
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:07,834
into these types of AAA teams.

14
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,555
And I'm going to give you some closing thoughts.

15
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:12,397
So a bit about me first.

16
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:21,146
So my journey actually started on the M&A and capital side where I was raising money for a lot

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:26,653
of free-to-play gaming companies in the infancy of free-to-play. I worked with companies like Zynga,

18
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,375
Gris, Funzio, etc.

19
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,920
I really developed my interest in free-to-play at that time.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,161
I then took a sabbatical to pursue a passion for a while of playing Magic professionally,

21
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,842
which didn't work out so well.

22
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:47,524
And soon after that, landed at Kabam, where I was fortunate to come on during the first

23
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:52,286
the web game days and the first mobile revolution where we were just getting started on mobile,

24
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,107
where user acquisition CPIs were less than a dollar and everything was

25
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:58,628
a totally different landscape.

26
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:05,452
Gave us an opportunity to define a lot of what mobile free-to-play would look like and a lot of

27
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:11,516
what product management analytics would look like in the industry. Stayed on a command in what I

28
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:16,479
like to call the second mobile revolution where we started leaning in more to data science,

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,541
launching more of a contest of champions which I'll talk about later.

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,051
and venturing eastward where I moved to our Beijing office,

31
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,732
built out the product function there,

32
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:32,112
and actually launched a fully culturalized version

33
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,313
of Contest in China for the Chinese user base.

34
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:41,015
Soon after that, I had the opportunity to join EA

35
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:49,730
sort of a broader role which I fully embraced and dived into, moved to Shanghai and went deeper

36
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,692
into Asia with EA with a large sort of IP-based portfolio. I joined really excited about the

37
00:02:56,732 --> 00:03:01,833
sports titles like FIFA and NBA which we were going to launch in Asia and I've since been

38
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:09,136
fortunate to work with a lot of other brands from SimCity and Red Alert to PBZ and Apex Legends.

39
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:14,740
Very exciting time at EA, it's been very gratifying for me.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,365
And I've learned a lot over my time here, so I'd like to share some of that with you.

41
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:23,871
So, going into the PM discipline in a little bit more detail.

42
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:29,157
Product management in gaming is a young family.

43
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:29,707
I

44
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:34,492
mean, it's well established in technology companies for more than three or four decades now.

45
00:03:52,717 --> 00:04:00,088
PMs all over the org from ads to gaming to social etc. And that's where sort of the Agile manifesto

46
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:05,777
came from. These technology companies with product managers and getting into an agile

47
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,660
sort of scrum based way of doing things.

48
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:14,242
So it's very well established in bigger technology companies but in gaming it's actually quite young.

49
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:22,044
Gaming PM function sort of gained prominence after free-to-play and social became

50
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:30,386
more prominent in the gaming industry. So you may recall in the early or sort of late 2000s I guess

51
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:37,049
Zynga started taking off with Facebook games and Facebook games in the mid-2000s really started

52
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:43,271
taking off where developers started developing on the Facebook platform. Zynga and Farmville series

53
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:49,414
really caught fire. You had other sort of social gaming platforms like CrowdStar, Kixai,

54
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:57,937
Kabam came soon thereafter and Rovio. But one of the reasons why it gained prominence is because

55
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,958
it realized with

56
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:04,162
The amount of data we were getting from these free-to-play and solo games, the types of real-time

57
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:08,005
engagement metrics and microtransactions that were starting to take shape with the free-to-play

58
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:14,129
business model, you could really analyze and optimize in real time and build the type of

59
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,034
experience that your users wanted. And PMs were rock stars at doing that, and we are rock stars

60
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:26,239
at doing that. So the function sort of took off after that sort of inflection point in the gaming

61
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,739
industry.

62
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:33,537
So what is PMing and what are amazing PMs?

63
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:37,198
I always like to say that PMs are a Swiss Army knife.

64
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:39,899
Maybe an overused phrase, but I still use it a lot.

65
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,301
PMs use cross-functional business skills to elevate game teams.

66
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,408
And they do it through a few different pillars.

67
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,549
The first pillar is design and strategy.

68
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,072
Having a strategic vision of the roadmap that maximizes the lifetime value of your games,

69
00:05:56,813 --> 00:06:01,695
leverages monetization design best practices, looks at competitors and competitive intelligence,

70
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:07,819
and balances player wants with team capabilities, the resource requirements and resource costs,

71
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,299
and the business needs.

72
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,543
And PMs, amazing PMs I like to see, have a very strong ability to abstract.

73
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,932
A lot of times come from consulting and strategy backgrounds and were excited about gaming

74
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,572
and came into gaming from there.

75
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:31,395
And are very good at this sort of long-term view of strategic vision of the game and the

76
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:37,157
product and also very good at looking into designs that work and designs that don't work

77
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:39,017
and servicing why those things happen.

78
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,918
The second pillar is live operations.

79
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,782
So being not always the one pressing the buttons,

80
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:50,986
but the guiding voice in monetization and engagement planning,

81
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,749
owning problems of game and platonomy balance and lifecycle management,

82
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,772
and having that sort of semi-aggressive,

83
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:01,796
almost proactive revenue mindset, being the guardian of game performance.

84
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:07,829
And game teams will trust the PMs to show them, you know, how is our game doing?

85
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,550
You know, what's the game performance?

86
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,912
What should our game be doing in terms of revenue and KPIs in the next six months?

87
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:16,873
Those are questions for your game PM, right?

88
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:23,756
And for this reason, the game PM is the sort of guiding voice in the live operations.

89
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,357
Sometimes they're actually executing it themselves.

90
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:27,217
Sometimes you have...

91
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:31,783
LiveOps GMs and game masters and other people actually what I call pressing the buttons.

92
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:36,446
But that function of live operations that the pillar doesn't doesn't change much.

93
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:45,370
The third one is analytics and optimization. And this actually goes hand in hand with live

94
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:53,895
operations. But using data to drive outcomes over outputs. A lot of times I think teams can get

95
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,216
caught up in producing content.

96
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:01,944
in shipping features and almost the amount of content or the amount of things that get shipped

97
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:08,207
is an indicator of success. However, if those things don't hit, if they don't move the needle

98
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:15,331
in terms of revenue and other engagement KPIs, how effectual was that content push? And PMs can be

99
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,692
relied upon to use data.

100
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:24,166
Wizards with data, very strong in data analysis and optimization.

101
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:29,767
They come from those backgrounds to keep the team honest in terms of the types of outcomes

102
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:34,888
that these changes are making. So outcomes over outputs, having that growth and optimization

103
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,429
mindset backed by behavioral data. So always thinking about how can I grow the player base?

104
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,610
What are some creative or innovative things that I can do in the game to try to grow the product?

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:55,209
And not always pulling from gaming, pulling from other tech products and pulling from other best practices and using that sort of strategic and almost design expertise.

106
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,295
And in doing so, having effective and rapid communication with the team.

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,342
and with outside stakeholders.

108
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,004
A lot of times the PM is almost the guardian of the team.

109
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:10,628
The team doesn't want to be distracted by a bunch of execs coming in and asking questions.

110
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:14,612
And a lot of times the PM can serve as the face of that type of communication

111
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,294
so that the team can focus on making the magic.

112
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:22,197
So that's the PM discipline as I see it in terms of these pillars.

113
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:27,641
But I also like to show that the pillars of product management

114
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:29,743
almost map to a game's life cycle.

115
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:34,607
If you look at the game and feature life cycle over the course of concept, pre-production,

116
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:37,810
production, testing, launch, and live service,

117
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,334
then you see that the product management pillars almost change over time.

118
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:46,477
Early on, you will need strategic and design clarity.

119
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:53,144
And the PMs will work cross-functionally with designers and consumer insights and publishing to define what the product should be.

120
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,546
Once the product launches,

121
00:09:56,406 --> 00:10:01,828
you have this LiveOps excellence pillar where the PM will collaborate with the analytics function

122
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:07,591
and with LiveOps game masters and other executors to optimize the product in real time.

123
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:14,634
And as the team is looking toward their next adventure, right, PMs play a very, you know,

124
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:18,470
a very pivotal role in that roadmap guidance, right?

125
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,633
Not only the next feature or large content update,

126
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,815
but also even the next game, right?

127
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:26,638
And that sort of comes back to this product definition phase.

128
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,581
But in terms of live features and content updates,

129
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,545
PMs work with analytics and CI and publishing functions to...

130
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,881
You know, analyze what the players are saying, how players are feeling, how players are behaving in game,

131
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:42,462
and use that to provide the road map guidance to the rest of the team.

132
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:49,665
The guidance for the future in terms of what content and client updates we need to push in order to move the game.

133
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,318
So what are some quick examples of PM success in free-to-play?

134
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,502
So spanning these different functions, these are just some very, you know, sort of random

135
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,104
examples that I pulled from different products.

136
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:08,608
So a feature impact is something that we do on FIFA very often where we analyze the KPI

137
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,649
impact of releases.

138
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:15,970
We surface that information back to the team. I'll talk about that a little bit later, but these have

139
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:23,435
been big wins for us in terms of improving the KPI impact of our live releases. So that's one example

140
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:28,819
of feature impact. Another example is

141
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:39,006
you know deconstructing individual games and business models to guide our design teams.

142
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:48,444
This is something that I think is a very good at deconstructing systems and thinking abstractly.

143
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:55,508
And then also I'm doing so to help the design teams embed them in terms of what are these

144
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,272
games doing well, what are the core loops, what are these new features, what are these

145
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:05,295
new business models, things like battle pass, what is this new emergent genre like auto chess,

146
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,237
what are things that are driving daily gameplay.

147
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,462
These are some things that over the course of my career,

148
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,724
that one of the strengths of PNs is sort of deconstructing

149
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,487
and providing guidance to design teams and game teams

150
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,969
on the sort of latest and greatest.

151
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,592
It's another very specific example

152
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,533
from when we were doing Contest of Champions,

153
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:34,875
but working with analytics teams in very close proximity

154
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:38,498
allows us to uncover some really incredible things.

155
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:43,424
On Marvel, we uncovered the importance of a new metric, which we started out calling

156
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:46,545
subscribers and then eventually called players.

157
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,087
Players that basically played every day.

158
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:55,610
And we brought this metric and others with us to EA in the terms of committed players.

159
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,593
But it was so staggering to us how a player who played seven days a week was so different

160
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,855
from a player who played six days a week.

161
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:08,717
And that was something that we uncovered working closely with the analytics teams at Marvel.

162
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,923
It's something that I've taken with me into any game that I've worked on or that I've been a part of in analyzing.

163
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:23,406
And we've shown that it really moves the needle in terms of driving sustained lifetime value increases.

164
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:31,889
So just another example of collaborating with analytics very closely to drive very impactful and powerful insights.

165
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,551
So games is a service, and he is.

166
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:44,242
One of the reasons I'm talking to you today is not about the PM function overall, but it's how

167
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:51,648
PMs, a lot of these wins that I've talked about before are in the mobile gaming industry and in

168
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:59,695
the mobile platform. But our industry as a whole, if you talk about HD and console games, you talk

169
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:05,199
about PC games, subscription games, all of these games are universally moving to what I call a

170
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,080
game as a service.

171
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,558
Consumer packaged goods are phasing out.

172
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:16,782
Packaged goods is still a big business for us at EA,

173
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:21,389
obviously the majority of our business, but you know a lot of these things are moving,

174
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,813
even these packaged goods are moving to a games as a service.

175
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,143
Players are going to expect content updates over the course of the life of the game.

176
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,267
They're not going to want to play a 20-hour PvE experience and be done with it.

177
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:41,494
They're going to want to play with other players in PvP and other multiplayer situations with players.

178
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:46,678
Subscription is another business model that's been tacked on to a lot of console games now.

179
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:52,923
So games are becoming more of a service inherently, not just endemic to mobile.

180
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,830
but something that's happening across different platforms in the industry.

181
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:03,212
And because of that, the value of PMs and the importance of PMs is becoming more pronounced

182
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:07,213
across platforms in console, HD, PC, online, etc.

183
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:19,195
Now, one of the PM superpowers, and what I like to say is the PM's problem space,

184
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,256
the problem that we generally own.

185
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:26,230
in these Games as a Service scenarios is abstracting a game into its business components.

186
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,891
And this is something that, which I'll get into a little bit later, something that is unique,

187
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:35,472
I think, in terms of how PMs think about a game and think about the business,

188
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:45,035
is breaking it down into these component parts, right? Being able to, you know, acknowledge the

189
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:49,156
creative portion of the game, but also being able to break down the constituent parts as a business

190
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:50,876
through the funnel of acquisition.

191
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:56,989
from different sources to retention and the factors that allow you to keep your acquired

192
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:01,533
users down to monetization and back forward through the funnel through acquisition.

193
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:08,499
So maximizing acquisition, minimizing churn, maximizing retention, optimization, right?

194
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,024
And abstracting a game into these components is the first thing, the first step to optimizing

195
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:14,404
the game.

196
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,446
And this is the PM's problem space.

197
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:23,492
In addition, so this is something that becomes more important I think as Games as a Service takes

198
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:31,278
hold of our games, right. The other thing that I find as Games as a Service becomes more and

199
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:40,946
more prevalent is that team composition also needs to change, right. In pre-launch of a Games as a

200
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,689
Service game or you know in production before you launch the game.

201
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:48,189
This is generally how we have our teams constructed.

202
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:49,990
There is the feature team, the development team,

203
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,893
consisting of designers, engineers, artists, QA, et cetera.

204
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,914
And there's also a live team.

205
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,137
A lot of times they're working on other parts of the game.

206
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,678
So they're working on the live content pipeline,

207
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,680
making sure that there's enough content in the game

208
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,320
when it launches.

209
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,582
They're working on developing live ops tools,

210
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,944
the tools that allow us to go in the band

211
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,466
and basically deliver the content to our users.

212
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,688
And they're working on live service readiness.

213
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:16,432
What is the calendar like?

214
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,093
What is our first month going to look like?

215
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,514
What is our first six months going to look like in terms of events and content, etc.?

216
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,975
That's what the live content team is working on.

217
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:29,977
And in pre-launch, the PM will often play a supporting role.

218
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:35,259
Like I said, they will talk about product definition and product direction,

219
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,400
live service readiness.

220
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:44,186
free to play, ready, and thinking about new features and pre-launching a feature that

221
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,227
guides us to the future.

222
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:52,511
Now once a game launches, the team composition tends to change, right?

223
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:56,954
You still have the exec producer who is managing the feature team, managing all the engineers,

224
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:58,155
artists, designers, etc.

225
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:02,758
And these guys are designing core gameplay features, major gameplay systems, and long-term

226
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:03,018
things.

227
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:11,503
Now the PM, once a game launches, generally becomes more hands-on and a lot of times elevates

228
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:16,446
their stature in the game team to be an equal sort of business partner with the exec producer

229
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:23,210
and will generally take control of a live team. So that team will work on live ops roadmap,

230
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:28,353
they will continue to produce live content, oftentimes we'll staff it with analysts and

231
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:31,375
we'll look at analytics and we will...

232
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:45,026
We'll also look at how we can augment our live tools to create more nimble ways to interact with players and deliver content to players.

233
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:51,371
So in a post-launch live service phase, a lot of times the PM, as I said, becomes more hands-on, becomes more prominent in the team,

234
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,574
and a healthy team, as I see it, is one in which

235
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,194
The exec producer and the PM are equal business partners and trust each other to make the right decisions.

236
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:07,077
And, you know, the EP sort of trusts the PM as the sort of business voice behind the product,

237
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:13,681
while the EP sort of takes center stage in town halls and summits, etc., to talk about the game.

238
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:13,741
So.

239
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:24,386
In AAA games, and because many AAA teams have spent years shipping games and then starting the next one,

240
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:30,347
as we move into games as a service, the model in which you have to work sometimes is foreign,

241
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:35,689
right? And as a result, integrating PMs into the team and adopting that iterative development

242
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:40,830
mindset can sometimes prove challenging. And this is easier for some teams than others,

243
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,771
but for those teams that have challenges, one of the purposes here is to talk about how to overcome this.

244
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:51,728
So let's go into some common challenges and solutions, right?

245
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:56,710
Of integrating, you've got PMs, you hired your first PM, right?

246
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,551
He's really excited, he wants to contribute.

247
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,172
But you're going to start to run into some challenges

248
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:06,554
as a VP or GM, as an EP, whoever hired the PM,

249
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,695
as you integrate these guys into your teams.

250
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,758
Now the first sort of acceptance of the PM role.

251
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:24,576
So as I said, PMs, game PMs who've had experience will come from other gaming companies, but a lot

252
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:30,220
of times junior PMs will come from other backgrounds like consulting strategy, sometimes financial

253
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:36,144
industry. And most non-mobile teams don't really understand the role of the PM in the development

254
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,847
process. A lot of times because they have not worked in a live service product before, they

255
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:45,571
have not worked in games as a service before, and they won't understand the PM's role. They won't

256
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:45,791
know.

257
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,282
how to interact with a PM initially.

258
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,344
And as a PM, for those PMs in the audience,

259
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,705
you have to accept the fact that in a AAA team,

260
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,146
you'll often be viewed as the outsider.

261
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:00,368
You'll often be viewed as sort of the black sheep.

262
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:04,970
And that can have challenges to not only team onboarding,

263
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,571
but also just team chemistry, morale, et cetera.

264
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,120
And also just the value of the PM initially, right?

265
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,140
If the PM is sort of viewed as someone that the team wants to

266
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,801
sort of hide away in a corner

267
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,942
and not have them be a prominent voice at the table,

268
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,602
it will definitely limit their value.

269
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:25,743
And a PM's value is directly correlated to

270
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,123
the team's buy-in of the PM function.

271
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:31,724
So this is something where early on,

272
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:33,945
team acceptance of the PM role is going to be a challenge.

273
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:52,753
The other thing, and I've learned this, teams, is that a lot of these teams, you know, maybe have worked on a live service before in a different way, right?

274
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:59,156
Maybe they've worked on a game that shipped live DLCs, you know, or had post-launch content that they would launch.

275
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:03,198
And because of this, they developed sort of pride in Ubis, right?

276
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:11,850
And when you come in as PM, you'll say, I'm a PM, I look at business, I look at design and strategy, live execution, look at data, etc.

277
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:17,197
Teams will often feel and they'll often say that they have the PM role covered by other functions.

278
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:25,630
This is a little bit dangerous sometimes, but they'll say, you know, we've got live producers

279
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,912
that produce our live content. We're good. We've got this. We have data analysts. We're working

280
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:37,875
with the CI team and the data analysts. We're good. We got this. And, you know, it kind of

281
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,196
stonewalls the PMs right away.

282
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,328
And this is something that needs to be,

283
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:44,168
need to look out for very closely.

284
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:46,169
I would say for team leadership,

285
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,069
as you onboard PMs onto your teams,

286
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:50,129
because this is quickly something

287
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,450
that could stonewall your PMs,

288
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,970
can demotivate them, et cetera.

289
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,591
If your team doesn't know how to interact

290
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,852
and does feel that they have the PM role covered

291
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:00,592
by other functions.

292
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:03,232
You know, sometimes it's the case that they do,

293
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:06,073
but most oftentimes it's the case

294
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:07,493
that they actually don't.

295
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:12,675
And you know, they're standing there, I can hear, and the house is burning down.

296
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,637
So this is something that you have to be mindful of.

297
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,863
So how do you circumvent these challenges? And there are ways to do it.

298
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:31,328
One of the things that PMs can do, and I like to think of this as a bottoms-up approach versus

299
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:36,872
a top-down approach, one approach is always the GM or the VP saying, these are your PMs,

300
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:43,121
Listen to them. They do X, Y, and Z, and you need to rely on them for this. That's definitely a top-down way.

301
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:48,343
If you're a PM, I would approach this as a bottom-up way. And one way is to involve the

302
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:53,384
dev team in PM processes. And this is something that we've seen a great deal of success with

303
00:23:54,225 --> 00:24:01,127
on products over my career. So FIFA Online is one example where we instituted the feature impact

304
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:06,369
assessment process. It was a process that we set up to instill rigor in

305
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,008
You know, shipping our client releases and the types of releases we're shipping,

306
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:15,371
looking at the KPI impact of the of the releases we're shipping.

307
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:19,654
And the rest of the team was fully involved and we made sure to do it this way.

308
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:24,016
We set up different milestones for these feature impact assessments

309
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:28,959
that integrated into the development process each milestone.

310
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,301
So at the beginning of a milestone, we would come in and look at the design docs

311
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:32,721
with the team.

312
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:38,128
We would get a full sort of download of what the feature was trying to achieve,

313
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:42,809
and then we would come with our KPIs and say, what do we think this is going to be?

314
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,070
It would be a brainstorming process for the team.

315
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,852
It's going to do engagement, it's going to up monetization, and by how much, right?

316
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:55,053
And then after the feature was released, and after we had sufficient data, we would come back

317
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:59,835
and we would task the analytics team with pulling all the right data, we would put it together,

318
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,255
and we would do

319
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:09,333
a postmortem of okay how did this feature actually perform versus what we expected.

320
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:14,315
And so for FIFA mobile in China we've extended this to a weekly program analysis

321
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:20,158
because you know a lot of our live content is in the form of programs and it's it's a faster

322
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:25,160
content cadence because it's mobile. So we have this weekly program analysis with the dev team

323
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,302
to understand the why behind different decisions. So feature impact assessment

324
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,382
program impact assessment, et cetera,

325
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,123
and doing it at a regular cadence

326
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,644
and doing it in the same timeline

327
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,106
and integrated into the milestone

328
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:42,567
that the process of the team

329
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:44,948
and involving the team early on.

330
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:49,170
So they can get exposure to you as a PM

331
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:52,332
and they can see the value that you bring early on

332
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:54,293
in discussions to get to alignment.

333
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:56,854
And then later on, once we get the data

334
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:59,556
and showing what impact these features actually have.

335
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,597
So that was a very positive way for us to do it.

336
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:10,781
Another thing that I've implored all my PMs across different games to do,

337
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:17,184
it's something that other teams like the Pentium team, which I'm very closely in communication

338
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:23,227
with them, does as well, is to work for the team rather than trying to lead.

339
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:29,270
And there's a lot of literature on the PM function out there, a lot of it related to other tech.

340
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:36,217
Parts of the tech industry that sometimes I view as erroneous and damaging a bit in gaming is that

341
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:43,762
a lot of times PMs are paraded around as the CEO of the product and you've got these eager PMs that

342
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:51,768
come in and they try to lead right away. Oftentimes this is the wrong approach. As I said, you need

343
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:55,210
to accept the fact that you're going to be viewed as an outsider when you come into these teams.

344
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,953
One great way to build equity is to work for the team rather than trying to lead.

345
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:03,573
And one of the things that we've done, you know, across the products that I'm across,

346
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:09,934
across other products that other heads of PM are across at EA, is to embed PMs directly in the dev

347
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:15,636
team and require them to split time between sitting with a centralized PM pod and sitting

348
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:20,017
with the core team. Oftentimes we'll just have our PMs sit directly with the core team.

349
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:25,927
um all the time and you know you wouldn't think this is important where they sit but it's extremely

350
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:31,531
important um to sit with the team and then we'll come back to the pm pod maybe one day a week or

351
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:38,075
just during our scrums etc um but you know all pms will sit with the team and they'll begin

352
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:39,496
onboarding onto the team

353
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:45,602
by basically listening to team needs, talking to team leadership, and tailoring their tasks to

354
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:51,928
the team needs. And this is something that I've observed is that, you know, for different projects

355
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:55,872
our PMs, the needs of the PM are going to be different.

356
00:27:57,602 --> 00:28:03,226
Sometimes you've got a team with designers that are very quantitatively motivated and you may need

357
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:09,250
to do less hand-holding with the design team onboarding with analytics. Sometimes you'll

358
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,834
have to do more, right? Sometimes it just depends on how the project shakes out, but because PM

359
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:22,980
skills are so cross-functional and so broad-based, PMs can often tailor their tasks and tailor their

360
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,022
function to the team needs and should be doing.

361
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,182
So this is something that we've seen a lot of success with at EA, both on products that I'm

362
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:36,804
across and products that are other heads of PM across the company and in EA Mobile and, you know,

363
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:43,306
Max and BioWare Maxis also have had success with. He is working for the team rather than trying to,

364
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,026
you know, take the lead right away.

365
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:54,809
Another thing beyond team acceptance of the PM role is ownership and accountability, right?

366
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:01,132
And this is something that AAA teams are very, you know, they'll harp about this a lot.

367
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:07,354
I've noticed more, more so than mobile teams, is what are you actually accountable for? What

368
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:13,536
are you actually owning? And one harsh reality is that because, again, the PM role is very

369
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:18,678
cross-functional, there will be confusion about what PMs own and are accountable for.

370
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:21,948
And you see this sort of, you know,

371
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,789
the cameo from Office Space here,

372
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:26,910
if any of you have seen that,

373
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,050
and one of my favorite scenes in the movie.

374
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,372
But you'll actually get these questions

375
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,312
from people on your dev team.

376
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,513
A guy from QA will come up and say,

377
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,434
what are you actually doing here?

378
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,735
Or a designer or creative director will say,

379
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,095
what value are you adding?

380
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:46,117
And a lot of times, you know,

381
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,624
It's on you to educate, but it also can be damaging to the morale of new PMs.

382
00:29:53,645 --> 00:30:01,072
Being met with this type of attitude, I guess, from people on the team that they're actually excited to be a part of.

383
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:05,456
But it's a harsh reality that you'll have to accept that there will be confusion.

384
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:08,298
And there are definitely ways to solve that confusion.

385
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,982
So, how do we solve for this?

386
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:17,026
One of the things I've learned in my years as a PM leader is that

387
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:22,509
the strike team approach is a very popular sort of approach to PMing where

388
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,610
you'll have PMs in a central pod who will,

389
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,091
you know, whenever a project has problems, whenever a game

390
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,232
isn't hitting their KPIs, they'll come in as a strike team

391
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:37,174
or they'll move from project to project. And this is something that I've learned

392
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,875
is actually better off abandoning.

393
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:48,624
Because as a strike team approach, PMs come in as consultants, they come in as advisors,

394
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:54,107
and then they roll off. So not only does the team not always understand what they're doing,

395
00:30:54,227 --> 00:31:00,331
what they're accountable for, but they're gone from the project six months later or a year later,

396
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:04,573
and were they actually part of the team? So abandoning this approach and actually making

397
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:09,356
them part of the team is, I think, a really good thing to do. So in FIFA,

398
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:15,785
One of the things that was done very early was we bifurcated the team into dev and live, right?

399
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:23,328
So as I said before, the feature team and the live content team. And early on, the PM team

400
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,789
actually assumed direct ownership of the live content team and the live roadmap, eliminating

401
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:33,591
ambiguity as to what they are responsible for. If someone says, what do you do? What are you

402
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:34,191
accountable for?

403
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,033
I control, I'm the decision maker for the live team.

404
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,854
That's a very short answer.

405
00:31:38,874 --> 00:31:42,076
And it was one that we had a lot of success with.

406
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:48,540
FIFA Mobile in China was a project that launched very fast and very aggressively,

407
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,841
but it quickly sort of bottomed out.

408
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:54,164
And once we did this sort of bifurcation of the team,

409
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:57,147
and gave PMs control of the live team,

410
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,750
our performance started coming up considerably.

411
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,833
We nearly doubled our DAU,

412
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:07,196
and we've been on a very good sort of trajectory ever since.

413
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:09,658
So it's something from a performance standpoint that worked,

414
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:12,220
and it's something from a sort of...

415
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:17,726
Team function standpoint worked because the team was able to gel, was able to work very quickly

416
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:23,150
without, you know, sort of scratching their head as to, you know, what does the PM actually own here.

417
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,974
In the BioWare team with Anthem, I think I talked about with, you know, we had a senior leader

418
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:35,898
that was hired now a couple years ago in BioWare, who's a great guy, hired for that PM function

419
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:39,040
reporting directly to, you know, the VP GM of that studio.

420
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:47,176
and had his PMs assume accountability for the live roadmap in a similar way.

421
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:53,879
So one part of that was having a leader come in to sort of represent the PM function in BioWare

422
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,863
for Anthem and another one was to have other PMs come in accountability over things like

423
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:06,746
game economy and live roadmap and other things that the team quickly saw had massive value

424
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:09,488
as you know Anthem was seen.

425
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:12,221
At that point, a game is a service and live service product.

426
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:21,669
Another way to sort of, you know, circumvent this harsh reality I was talking about before

427
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:27,975
is to use sign-off. And the reason you use sign-off is it forges dependencies within the team, right?

428
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:35,001
And this is something that a lot of times the GM or the VP will have to do as a top-down thing,

429
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,564
but it's very powerful once it's done. And this is something that we've done

430
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:43,328
across our FIFA products, our free-to-play FIFA products in Asia.

431
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,350
with FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

432
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,711
Even though these products were both free to play,

433
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:54,496
the teams working on them were not mobile teams.

434
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:57,998
These were teams that came from AAA, so that's why I'm including them here.

435
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,202
But we quickly had this sign-off built in where

436
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:06,464
we aligned in our interop site that PMs would own

437
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:09,306
all engagement metrics for the game.

438
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:14,226
Also design the model used for forecasting and operational modeling

439
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:17,428
and how we basically lock financial forecasts and financial targets.

440
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:20,210
So because financial targets have to be locked every month,

441
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,853
PMs have to be consulted as long as they own the engagement metrics.

442
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:32,599
It's a forced sort of dependency in order to sort of involve PMs in the operational modeling.

443
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,682
in looking at the features and using feature impact to assess what those engagement metrics would be,

444
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:43,946
etc. Another thing that PMs directly own is, as I said, the feature impact assessments for each

445
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:47,909
client release. And this is something that is mandated as part of the milestone,

446
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:50,371
and it's something that gets presented back to the team.

447
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,248
in the spirit of iterative development, right?

448
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:55,990
And we've instilled these processes,

449
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,051
and we've developed muscle memory around them,

450
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:00,774
and we've used sign-off to forge those dependencies.

451
00:35:00,874 --> 00:35:04,276
So even if the dev team may be confused in the start,

452
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:08,400
they have to, they do know that there's a sign-off dependency,

453
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,222
and they have to go to PMs and work with them.

454
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,265
And that sort of forcing function has allowed the team

455
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:17,147
to better understand what PMs do and what value they bring.

456
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:27,215
So a third sort of bucket of challenge is creative versus data-driven decisions. And this is one that

457
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:34,659
you know is I think a bit harder to get out of even if a team understands what PMs do.

458
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,743
Moving to a games as a service mindset, moving to a more analytical mindset,

459
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:45,345
is often very very hard for teams. Not only

460
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,021
but also you know mobile teams as well, depending on the function.

461
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:55,045
So the harsh reality is that you know I think I feel and maintaining morale quote unquote

462
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,626
will often take precedence over data-driven realities.

463
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:01,869
And I mentioned maintaining morale is one because you know I've been in situations where

464
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,711
the KPIs were not great or you know we were not

465
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:10,314
focusing on the right things in terms of long-term retention.

466
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,655
Do we have the elder game features?

467
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:14,476
We're seeing where there's smoke, there's fire, right?

468
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:17,878
And some of the PMs will see smoke and they'll want to call it out.

469
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:21,621
And they'll get, you know, the response that, well,

470
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:24,563
we don't want the team to focus on this right now

471
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,764
because we don't we want to maintain the morale.

472
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,566
This this isn't great for team morale to see.

473
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:32,468
You know, once we launch this great game, we should be celebrating.

474
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:35,690
But you're talking to us about, you know, how the KPIs are good.

475
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,410
And.

476
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:42,374
I think that is a little bit dangerous and it's something that really has to be kept at bay

477
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,616
because data-driven realities are something that should be positive for the team,

478
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:49,718
even if that data is not proving out what we want, right?

479
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,580
Because it's a learning experience and if you adopt a test and learn my unset,

480
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,361
then it's just an opportunity to get better, right?

481
00:36:57,522 --> 00:37:00,043
So, harsh reality, how do we get around that?

482
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:08,960
One way to get around, I think, I feel, is to use frameworks to maintain rigor in fact-based decision making.

483
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,944
Now, this is something where, you know, the Anthem team, again, had a really good way to do this.

484
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:21,686
And this is something that I actually barred for them, and it's worked very well for me, too.

485
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:24,787
It is speaking in frameworks, right?

486
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:31,021
Maybe we don't all agree on what the right decision is. Maybe we don't want to talk about

487
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:36,606
retention that's lower than we thought it would be or revenue that's lower. But can we all agree

488
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:45,645
That as a team we all have the same shared goals. Can we all agree that our goal is to maximize

489
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:52,666
traffic and to maximize revenue? It's to grow MAU as much as possible. It's to grow our monthly

490
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:58,588
revenue as much as possible. And oftentimes when you get down to that very simple fact-based

491
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:04,389
decision making and that simple framework, those goals are irrefutable for the rest of the dev team.

492
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,412
I don't think anyone's going to tell you no, we want to minimize traffic.

493
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,916
So you break it down into first principles and you establish those shared goals.

494
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:18,340
And once you've aligned on those shared goals, what you realize is that magic starts to happen,

495
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:18,780
right?

496
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,344
Once you can agree on those shared goals, you can move to the brainstorming phase about

497
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:28,587
what the best ways are to get there instead of arguing over the goals themselves.

498
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:29,227
So

499
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:34,960
Now that we know that MAU is, you know, something that we want to maximize, how do we do that?

500
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,362
And then that's where PMs start to shine, because PMs can bring proposals for how to maximize MAU.

501
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:45,524
And a lot of times in our meetings with teams where we bring in those plans,

502
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:48,746
the team's response is, oh, we'd never thought about it that way.

503
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:49,226
Oh.

504
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:51,145
Yeah, that's actually true.

505
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,448
That's not something that's top of mind for us.

506
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,011
And they start to realize the value

507
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,714
of the different perspective of data-driven reality

508
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,776
that PMs will bring into the team

509
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:02,498
when they're thinking about things

510
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:03,519
in a little bit different way.

511
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:10,126
So this is something that I would highly recommend is speaking in frameworks and using frameworks

512
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:12,627
to maintain rigor in fact-based decision making.

513
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:18,151
I think I feel is something I think everyone eventually sort of reverts to, but it's something

514
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:21,274
that has to be kept in check on a more regular basis.

515
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:25,276
Another way to win is...

516
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:29,466
Again, to use business realities to pressure test decisions, right?

517
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:34,709
So sometimes the team will, you know, make a feature decision or make a design decision

518
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:40,312
based on, I think, I feel, and that client release will get shipped and, you know,

519
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:44,053
the PM will have said or someone on the team will have said, yeah, I don't think we should

520
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:47,755
be doing this because X, Y, Z, and the team should have said anyway.

521
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:53,218
However, if you have the right processes set up, you can pressure test those decisions.

522
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:53,598
So...

523
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,726
On all our products now, we have bi-weekly business reviews.

524
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,668
Every two weeks, we have a business review,

525
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:03,250
which are high visibility, comprehensive reviews

526
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,391
of the business, the live ops performance,

527
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:06,873
and how we're tracking versus targets.

528
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:07,913
And this is very simple.

529
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,936
This is something that I think a lot of teams

530
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:12,897
that are listening to this probably already do

531
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:16,180
in some shape or form, but I would encourage these

532
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,103
to include a lot of cross-functional people in the team,

533
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:24,586
not just the PMs and the producers, but across the team.

534
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,614
And I would actually encourage you to include execs in these reviews to the extent that you can.

535
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:35,536
Because when you do that, and when you have execs present,

536
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:39,378
when you execs will want to talk about objective things, right?

537
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,379
It makes it hard to hide in the gray area, I think, I feel.

538
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,104
And very quickly, it starts to change the team's mindset in terms of what's important,

539
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,868
and in terms of who needs to be consulted before decisions get made.

540
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:58,793
And that can have some very powerful sort of impact in terms of how the team approaches releases,

541
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:01,916
how the team approaches live content development, etc.

542
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:05,399
And I think we've seen that prove out across our products.

543
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:11,424
FIFA Mobile I'm using as an example here, which is where we've seen a profound impact.

544
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:17,661
But we've seen the same impact on FIFA Online, we've seen the same impact on Red Alert, and

545
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:19,303
it's something that I would highly recommend.

546
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:31,840
is on the org structure side is maintaining an unbiased view through central reporting lines

547
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,800
but at the same time staying embedded within the core team and sit together.

548
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,181
Right, I go back to sitting together because I think it's really important.

549
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:46,222
So it's a fine balance, right? A lot of times, you know, the PM function is well-staffed on a lot

550
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:51,483
of teams. A lot of times you'll see PMs reporting into the exec producers of these different games.

551
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:56,228
which can work in some cases, but can also be dangerous in others.

552
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:03,757
And the reason it can be dangerous is because the PM, you know, as a great communicator of data and business realities,

553
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:11,445
can sometimes become a tool to mask business realities or sort of, you know,

554
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:18,389
Use data to basically communicate whatever message the exec producer or the creative director wants to put forth

555
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:23,252
versus the actual sort of unbiased truth. So for that reason,

556
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:28,895
especially in orgs where the PM function is not that sure yet,

557
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:31,997
I recommend a central reporting line structure.

558
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,118
So a structure more like this

559
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:37,020
where you have a director of product

560
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,162
that reports into a VP or GM or other exec.

561
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:46,799
That person has PMs under him, and those PMs are embedded within the team.

562
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,681
They sit with the team, they tailor their tasks to the team's needs,

563
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,282
and they dotted line into the team leadership.

564
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:59,343
However, they report back into the head of product, who reports back into the GM,

565
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:04,365
which serves as a nice sort of check and balance on the team in terms of, as I said again,

566
00:43:04,805 --> 00:43:09,992
I think I feel over data-driven realities, right? And it sort of keeps that in balance. And I think

567
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:15,359
one of the reasons why these bi-weekly reviews have been so strong for us, why feature impact

568
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:20,626
and these other sort of central processes have been so strong, is because of this matrix-based

569
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,047
reporting.

570
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:28,673
That said, I think on teams where PMs have sat there for years, where you have EPs who are very

571
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:33,537
fast and agile and have worked on several games as a service or free-to-play games before,

572
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:39,441
this structure can work. I'm not saying it can't work, but when you're introducing the

573
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:43,164
function specifically, I do think this structure is a bit better.

574
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:48,368
So, some closing thoughts for you.

575
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:54,781
I do want to leave time for, I would say questions, but this is a recorded session, so no questions,

576
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:55,481
unfortunately.

577
00:43:55,561 --> 00:44:00,324
However, I would encourage you to reach out to me afterward for questions if you have

578
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:02,926
them on LinkedIn or through email, etc.

579
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:12,172
So my first closing thought is that GM and games as a service and agile and free to play

580
00:44:12,272 --> 00:44:14,073
is a mindset first and foremost.

581
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:22,305
You know, the physics model, having this mindset, so, so important.

582
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:28,827
And even on games where, you know, you're even on a game that was not games as a service.

583
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:34,988
I think this mindset is so incredibly valuable that I would just, you know, this is the one

584
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:38,009
thing that I would take away from everything is that it's a mindset.

585
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:42,510
And the quicker you can get everyone on the team into thinking about this mindset.

586
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:49,021
From exec producers, to producers, to art directors, to creative directors, to designers, to QA,

587
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:55,766
to everyone into this spirit of iterative design and rapid experimentation informed by behavioral

588
00:44:55,786 --> 00:45:01,630
data. Having people adopt this testament mindset, it elevates the creative process. It absolutely

589
00:45:01,751 --> 00:45:07,915
elevates it, right? Now PMs are at the center of, I guess, owning the problem that this mindset

590
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,156
solves for. PMs own

591
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:14,558
The problem, how do we maximize for engagement? How do we maximize monetization, etc. Right?

592
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,582
And act as the stewards and evangelists of this for the rest of the team.

593
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:22,865
But, you know, the sooner you can get the team thinking this way,

594
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:24,427
the better it's going to be for your game.

595
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:33,591
So some rules of thumb as part of my closing thoughts. Rule one, after you've adopted that

596
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:40,577
mindset, align on shared goals. And it can be very, very simple. The best way to get past differences

597
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:46,442
between the PM and their iterative mindset clashing with other big personalities on the

598
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:53,107
dev team is to establish those shared goals. And you'll see that once you do that, magic starts

599
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:54,148
happening with the rest of the team.

600
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:58,632
You can start simple, like I said. Identify your North Star metrics that both creative and business

601
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:04,117
types can rally around. Prove the value of the discipline by optimizing your North Star metrics.

602
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:11,524
As a PM, take ownership of optimizing your metrics. As a VP, empower your PMs to optimize

603
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:17,429
these, to run A-B tests and run experiments, and provide the communication to not only your

604
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:19,571
internal dev team, but to outside stakeholders.

605
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:25,461
in the form of air cover. The dev team will thank you because they'll be able to focus on creating great games.

606
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:30,866
My second rule is to adopt a service-based support mindset.

607
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:37,832
So as I said, a lot of this literature about PMs being the CEO of the product is, I think,

608
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:44,778
a bit toxic when it comes to games. And the best PMs are great at working for the team

609
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,200
rather than viewing themselves as the CEO.

610
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:47,661
So...

611
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:54,942
Put your head down, deliver great results, listen to the team's needs, and tailor your function to their needs.

612
00:46:55,443 --> 00:47:03,291
Think about how can I use my amazing Swiss Army knife tools to help the team deliver on what it needs right now.

613
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,823
Leading through influence and doing this goes a long way.

614
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:14,925
And you know, it may sound a little bit harsh, but come in with a mindset that you will have to prove your value first,

615
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,726
before you're able to foster a fundamental mindset shift,

616
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:22,707
before you're going to be viewed as a member of the leadership team and giving guidance to those leads, meetings, etc.

617
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,067
You're going to have to prove your value.

618
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:29,908
So coming in with that mindset and adopting that service-based mindset is going to help you a lot as a PM.

619
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,278
The third thing I would say is that, as I just said,

620
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:37,781
PM reporting structure depends on team maturity.

621
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,143
So when beginning to hire for the PM function,

622
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:43,426
a matrix reporting structure, I think, is ideal.

623
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:45,729
And PMs serve as that check and balance

624
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:48,832
for the team as a new mindset is in training wheels.

625
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,394
Once the team becomes more mature,

626
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:55,939
PMs reporting directly into EPs and game GMs can make sense.

627
00:47:57,703 --> 00:48:02,704
And PM value, you know, when it doesn't need to be policed by a functional head like a head of product,

628
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:08,425
reporting lines can become more flexible, right? Especially in a full buy-in scenario,

629
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:14,267
I think director of product, head of product becomes more of a career coach for PMs that

630
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:19,228
hones their skills and impact and doesn't really have to micromanage PM workflows with their

631
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:22,948
respective dev teams because the dev team is doing that with the PM directly.

632
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:33,457
The last thing I would say is that the PM function overall is going to require

633
00:48:33,617 --> 00:48:38,200
buy-in and blessing from execs and leaders. There's going to be the blessing from the VPs and GMs

634
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:45,224
or exec producers is required in order to maximize the PM function. Convincing the dev team

635
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:48,746
involves getting early buy-in from the game team and studio leadership.

636
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:50,183
We're going to have to get that buy-in.

637
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,445
Without this buy-in, it's going to be difficult for the PM to shine,

638
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:55,426
and their value in voice will be greatly reduced.

639
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,107
I've seen teams where they have a PM,

640
00:48:58,307 --> 00:49:00,669
but that PM is relegated off into a corner,

641
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,570
and this guy came in excited.

642
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,992
You know, he came in from McKinsey or another gaming company,

643
00:49:08,873 --> 00:49:12,675
another free-to-play company like King or Supercell,

644
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:17,278
and he's now working on this AAA team, and he's in a corner,

645
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:18,758
and the rest of the team is...

646
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:21,396
laughing and high-fiving about this great game they shipped.

647
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:25,218
And within six months, this great talent is gone.

648
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,239
He's quit the company, right?

649
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,821
Because he didn't have the buy-in and the blessing from leadership.

650
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:33,662
So that leadership blessing is really required.

651
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:36,844
And that's basically it.

652
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:38,925
And I would just leave you with, again,

653
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:42,987
this mindset is really important, that iterative development mindset.

654
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:46,708
Work on fostering that within your teams if you're leadership.

655
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:54,185
If your PM's coming onto the team, remember these harsh realities and remember the ways to solve for them.

656
00:49:54,906 --> 00:50:02,412
And try, try and try to work for the team, influence to get them to adopt that mindset as soon as possible.

657
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:10,478
It's going to lead you to releasing much more impactful features, thinking long term, and really maximizing your business.

658
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:11,499
Thank you very much.
