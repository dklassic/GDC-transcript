00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:30,054
Hello and welcome to this special edition of the 22nd Annual Independent Games Festival Awards.

2
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:36,076
As I'm sure you may have noticed, we are not all in San Francisco celebrating together.

3
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:42,258
Instead, I am in a forest and you all are tuning in from wherever you happen to be in the world right now.

4
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,542
I have plenty that I would love to say, but I understand attention spans are short and I'm sure you all want to get to the awards, so I'll keep this short and sweet.

5
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:59,804
These are interesting times and as a perpetual optimist, all I can think of is how much I really love our community.

6
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:05,670
Even when we're faced with extraordinary circumstances, collectively we're always moving in the right direction.

7
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,533
And we're supporting each other in really remarkable ways.

8
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:14,780
And while I wish that we were all together celebrating the incredible games and teams that will be honored tonight,

9
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:20,280
I am grateful that we have this opportunity to create a virtual celebration and to include

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,621
so many of you in sharing this experience with us.

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,623
So here's to you, the games and teams who received honorable mentions, the people who

12
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:33,185
worked tirelessly to make the IGF happen, and of course, best of luck to all the finalists.

13
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:36,266
So let's get this crazy experiment started.

14
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,709
Hi, welcome to the IGFs.

15
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,111
I'm Trent Custers from League of Geeks,

16
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:52,233
and we're here at our studio in Melbourne.

17
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:54,895
We couldn't come together in person this year,

18
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,356
but I'm honoured to be your host

19
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:58,718
for the 22nd Annual IGF Awards.

20
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,901
And thanks to our lead sponsor, ID at Xbox,

21
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,882
and a whole heap of last minute elbow grease,

22
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,084
we'll be doing things a little bit differently.

23
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,086
This year we'll be celebrating

24
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,468
the past year's indie achievements like this.

25
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,590
No envelope opening, no tuxedo,

26
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,731
just me, you.

27
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,029
and a bunch of sweet awards. ♪♪

28
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,490
-♪♪

29
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,372
-♪♪

30
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:28,255
Look, 2020's been kind of grim so far.

31
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,117
But let's not forget the heartbreak that was 2019.

32
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:36,640
And I'm talking specifically that it was a big year for video game breakups.

33
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,562
Bungie left Activision's bosom

34
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:42,403
and is now strutting around with that big single energy.

35
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:47,537
Reggie, our sweet, sweet Reggie, left Nintendo.

36
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,179
And I mean, Nintendo's gotta be pretty cut up about it.

37
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,241
They're dating a guy literally named Doug Bowser.

38
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:54,561
They're with Bowser.

39
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:58,243
Now, no one wants their ex to date a bad guy.

40
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,665
Nintendo's dating the bad guy.

41
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,966
And then of course, there's the messiest,

42
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,347
most public breakup of 2019.

43
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:07,829
Blizzard and Hong Kong.

44
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,091
But these are all AAA woes.

45
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,007
If you're an indie developer, there are more hot singles on the indie dating scene than

46
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:21,789
ever before, and they've all got a shit ton of real weird money.

47
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,212
That's why this IGF, we're launching Indie Daddy Dating.

48
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:31,336
We've rounded up the hottest, most cashed up daddies, and we've got them here for you

49
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:31,676
tonight.

50
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:37,220
Our first daddy has always been pretty well off, but they've recently come into a lot

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,842
of money with their newly formed Children's Entertainment Empire.

52
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,523
Pretty epic.

53
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:50,177
Your friends won't really approve of them, but the perks are overwhelming and they never

54
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:51,238
ask for their change back.

55
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:55,281
Our next daddy is smart, trendy, intellectual.

56
00:03:56,422 --> 00:04:00,384
Your shot at everlasting love could be Apple Arcade.

57
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:06,249
This design Ford hottie will promise you the world, but once they've got you, they might

58
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,109
just check out.

59
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,732
Our next daddy is all about performance, strength, power.

60
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,567
with a playful jock vibe.

61
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:17,628
Meet Xbox.

62
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:20,930
They got into the dating game late

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,991
because they were all about hanging with the boys

64
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,072
until their 30s.

65
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,054
But they're our only daddy

66
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,315
with an Axe deodorant endorsement.

67
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,737
Okay, for our next daddy,

68
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:35,198
let's go a little bit more mysterious.

69
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,440
Flashy car, rich AF,

70
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,322
and they know where you live.

71
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,423
It's Google Stadia.

72
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:50,391
Even though they've told you 40 times what they do, you still don't understand.

73
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:56,736
Now look, if commitment isn't really your thing, and let's be honest, this is the independent

74
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:01,479
games festival after all, then our next option may be right up your alley.

75
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,304
Devolver, Annapurna and Raw Fury, our indie publishers.

76
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,947
Sure they may sleep on a mattress on the floor.

77
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:12,108
And yes.

78
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:15,553
They might even ask you to pick up the check from time to time,

79
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,494
but you'll never be tied down again,

80
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,694
unless you're into that.

81
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,239
Alright, let's give out some awards.

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,242
This first category terrifies established developers.

83
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,045
This is the IGF for Best Student Game.

Thank you, IGF, for giving us this award.

99
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,588
It's very nice to be here.

100
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,969
And whether or not we receive actually this award...

101
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,512
We asked, you voted.

102
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,493
Now the winner of this award can rest easily

103
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:55,155
knowing that they've appeased our almighty overlords, the gamers.

104
00:07:55,997 --> 00:08:00,102
This is the winner of the IGF Audience Award, chosen by you.

105
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,654
Audience Award, and the winner is A Short Hike.

106
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,179
Oh, wow. I'm.

107
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:22,287
so honored and excited to receive the audience award.

108
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:27,010
Thank you to everybody who voted for my weird little hiking game and

109
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,314
everybody who helped me get here today and make the game.

110
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:34,276
I really want to thank my partner, Dawn, who

111
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,759
supported me throughout the entire journey and her wisdom

112
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,942
and her contributions to the game made it something a lot better

113
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,323
and it wouldn't have been the same without her.

114
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,624
I really want to thank.

115
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:52,778
My friend Andrew who contributed art to the game and spent time with me while I was working on it.

116
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,360

00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:09,086

And of course also my mom who always encouraged me and supported me throughout this entire journey, my entire life.

120
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:24,374
So, yes, thank you so much. Thank you everyone and yeah, it's such an honor.

121
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,984
You can't hear good audio, you feel it.

122
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,606
Well, you can obviously hear good audio.

123
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,924
But good audio is a type of glue.

124
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,565
It's a bonding agent that takes all the different elements

125
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:45,866
and pulls them together into one cohesive piece.

126
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:49,808
This is the past year's greatest achievements in game glue.

127

00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,874
We are totally delighted to accept this incredible honour.

157
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:53,395
Mutazione has been held by many people's hands and hearts of minds

158
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,696
over the 10 years since creative lead Nils Denneken

159
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,236
dreamt up the wonderful world of the game.

160
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,537
And one of the biggest influences during that time

161
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:02,358
has been composer and musician Alessandro Coronas.

162
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,899
Over to you, Alessandro.

163
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:08,159
Thank you, Hannah, and to everyone at IGF.

Thank you so, so much.

00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:13,062
It's a big privilege.

And I want to extend a huge thank you to the whole team.

167
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:23,327
As we all know, making games is a gigantic team effort.

168
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,928
So this is also for you, pals.

169
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:27,269
You know who you are.

170
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,890
So thanks again.

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,892

Hi, I'm Jon and I'm Joe. Hello!

192
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,542
And we're Inkle. Thank you for this award.

193
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:54,223
It means a huge amount to us. When we started Heaven's Vault five years ago, it seemed like a really good idea, didn't it?

194
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,928
I mean, yeah, it did seem like a really good idea at the time,

195
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:02,151
until we added that entire ancient language that you could decipher.

196
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,173
It was so hard.

197
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:08,477
Oh, and that entire narrative that you could play in just about any order.

198
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:11,179
That made the game really hard to build.

199
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,200
It was so hard.

200
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,483
Anyway, if you played Heaven's Vault, thank you so much.

201
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:17,844
We really hope you enjoyed it.

202
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,866
We'll be coming to Switch later this year,

203
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,489
and we have a new game called Pendragon, which will be out this year too.

204
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,524
So from me and Joe, thanks to Anastasia Wyatt, Laura Dilloway, Pirantra Mythic, Tom Blunden,

205
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:33,126
Sarah Hefford, Lawrence Chapman and Tom Kale.

206
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,387
So that's everyone at Inkle who helped with the project.

207
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:36,408
You guys were amazing.

208
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:36,789
Well done.

209
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:37,629
This is for all of us.

210
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,571
Thank you, amazing Inklers.

211
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:40,611

212
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:40,691

213
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,193

We start our own studios so we can design our dream games.

216
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,405
And then when we're too busy,

217
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:02,246
we have to hire game designers.

218
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,289
These next finalists either hired great game designers

219
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,512
or never admitted they were too busy.

220
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,733

238
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:04,051
Thank you so much. I'm really, really honored to receive this

239
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:09,255
award. I'm so thankful to so many people who have helped and

240
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:14,299
supported me. So many people, like my family, my online

241
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,722
friends from many communities and my offline friends. I

242
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:19,963
really hope to continue to

243
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,798
help and support others back and to contribute back.

244
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:29,919
I'm so inspired by so many games, so many independent games,

245
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,522
and I'm really really happy to be here participating with my own work and to

246
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:42,043
to be contributing and helping to move things forward and to be part of it.

247
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,185
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so honored.

248
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,687
Excellence in Visual Art. We were actually nominated for this once, but we didn't win.

249
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,291
I guess that's the best thing about hosting these awards remotely, is that I don't have

250
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:06,596
to hand this award to someone else again. Let's take a look at this year's beautiful games.

the team that all worked on the game with me.

272
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,800
I also want to thank our friends at Double Fine

273
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,342
who kept us alive and...

274
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,138
made sure the game could come out.

275
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:26,482
And I also really want to thank our Kickstarter backers,

276
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,845
because there is no way that this game would exist

277
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:30,505
without them.

278
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,328
So just thank you so much to everyone involved.

279
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,111
It's just mind-blowing to get this award.

280
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:38,771
Thank you.

281
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:55,925

302
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:26,299
I am the game developer of The Space Between

303
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,279
and I am speaking to you here from the

304
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,200
wonderful city of Linzen, Austria.

305
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
I want to thank you for the

306
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,321
Nuovo Award and I am honored to

307
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:36,541
represent an award that is dedicated

308
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,042
to the very adventurous

309
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,122
exploration of what video games can be.

310
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,343
So, thanks again and

311
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,443
I hope I'll see you soon in real life.

312
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:45,603
Bye!

313
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:56,138
Hello. Due to the circumstances, we can't do this live, so I'm going to do it my preferred

314
00:24:56,178 --> 00:25:04,625
way, heavily edited, with an excessive filter. Okay, perfect. Now, all I need to do is introduce

315
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,127
the grand prize nominees, but first I want to talk about 2020.

316
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:16,804
Careening into a new decade here, and it turns out that this year is also a notable anniversary for the IGF.

317
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:23,846
20 years ago, the grand prize winner here was a tank combat game called Treadmarks by Longbow Digital Arts.

318
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:31,689
The founder and lead programmer at Longbow was Seamus McNally. Maybe you've seen his name around somewhere.

319
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:38,862
Shemis was just 21 at the time, but had already made a few games, and in a lot of ways, he was a pioneering indie developer.

320
00:25:39,342 --> 00:25:42,325
For one, Longbow was selling their games online, digitally.

321
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:46,949
That doesn't sound like a big deal now, but back at the dawn of indie time in 2000,

322
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,673
there was no infrastructure and no easy sell without a physical copy.

323
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:55,137
And Shemis made an effort to share his knowledge with other developers.

324
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:59,077
about selling games online, but also about technical issues.

325
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:03,581
Even though he was young, he was already a very good programmer, and I remember how useful

326
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,484
his articles on 3D engines and hardware were at the time.

327
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:10,487
After Treadmarks, Seamus wasn't able to make another game.

328
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:15,731
He had been fighting Hodgkin's Lymphoma for a few years, and passed away just one week

329
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:16,952
after winning the Grand Prize.

330
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:23,871
In his brief time, Seamus showed a kindness, an independence, and especially an openness

331
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:26,413
that set the perfect standard for the IGF.

332
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:30,915
And for me personally, I'm proud to be associated with his name.

333
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:32,876
He's a great model for indies.

334
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:36,498
20 years so far, and 20 more coming up.

335
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,181
And now to segue, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize nominees for 2020.

336
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:48,533

00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:27,267
Thank you so much.

352
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,589
I'm really, really honoured to be selected

353
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:32,351
amongst the amazing games here at IGF.

354
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:35,153
Uh...

355
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,515
I really want to thank everybody who helped me get here today.

356
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:38,276
Um...

357
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:40,918
Firstly, I'd like to thank my partner, Don,

358
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,580
who supported me throughout the entire journey.

359
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,501
Um...

360
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:49,055
She always believed in me and the game, even when I wasn't so sure myself.

361
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,817
And I don't think the game would have been the same without her wisdom and support.

362
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:57,518
I want to thank Mark, who made the amazing soundtrack for the game.

363
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,141
Andrew, for the art and his friendship as I worked on the game.

364
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,182
I want to thank David, who made the amazing logo.

365
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:11,364
And my mom, who supported me every step of the way.

366
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:17,620
and I really just want to thank everybody who played the game and gave me feedback and helped

367
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:25,424
shape it into something better. So thank you so so much. I'm so honored to be selected today. Thank you.

368
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:38,691
Well, there you have it. That's another IGF's in the bag, folks. That's a wrap.

369
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:43,801
Thank you to Lucas Pope for giving someone else a chance this year.

370
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,184
Of course, thanks to Kelly Wallach, chairperson of the IGF,

371
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,046
all the judges and jurors,

372
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,949
our lead sponsor, ID at Xbox,

373
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:54,872
thanks again for supporting the festival and making it everything that it can be.

374
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:58,415
And speaking of which, I wanted to thank the IGF team

375
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:01,158
who make all of this magic happen behind the scenes.

376
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:06,634
I also did want to take a moment to say that our hearts go out to all of those affected

377
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:07,574
by the coronavirus.

378
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:09,375
Be sure to stay safe, people.

379
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,597
We'll be back next year, live in San Francisco, again for another IGF Awards.

380
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:15,918
Don't you worry about that.

381
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:22,861
Now it's time to watch the Game Developers Choice Awards, this year hosted by Kim Swift.

382
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:28,343
We might even get a chance to finally find out what Death Stranding is all about.

383
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:30,004
Thanks, everyone.

384
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:30,984
Have a great night.

385
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:34,321
you

386
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:07,197
Hey everyone! So, how about that coronavirus, eh?

387
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:15,385
I'm sure you're keenly aware GDC isn't happening this week so that way we can all avoid, you know, disease and pestilence.

388
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:21,831
Since, obviously it would be super weird for me to be giving the awards in a completely empty auditorium,

389
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:27,776
I was asked to help out with a remote Game Developers Choice Awards because, obviously, you want to tell everyone who won.

390
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,127
So here I am, coming to you live.

391
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:31,588
Actually, take that back.

392
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:33,149
This is pre-recorded.

393
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:34,170
Say hi to the crew.

394
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,071
Hi, guys.

395
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:38,934
So we are coming to you from sunny Los Angeles, California.

396
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,835
I'm a bit disappointed, however,

397
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,757
that I don't get to present on stage this year

398
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:45,159
because I had this whole outfit planned.

399
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,180
It was pretty great.

400
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,100
And I mean,

401
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:53,952
Look at these shoes, these absolutely perfect, exquisite foot torture devices that I will

402
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:54,633
not get to wear.

403
00:31:55,293 --> 00:32:00,418
Anyways, it is what it is, but hey, the advantage is I could be wearing sweatpants right now

404
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,940
and you'd have absolutely no idea.

405
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,060
So, welcome to my roof.

406
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,043
Definitely not your typical setting for the awards.

407
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:08,805
Also, this is my co-host.

408
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:10,107
This is Sundae.

409
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:11,348
You'll be seeing her more.

410
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,052
And also, hey, because this is at my house,

411
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,555
if you are lucky, you'll get to hear

412
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:19,958
the amazing ice cream truck that rolls around

413
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,580
with the broken Lacooka Ratchahorn.

414
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,260
It is just.

415
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:23,721
Fantastic.

416
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:25,121
Well, let's get things rolling.

417
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:28,102
I've been sitting on who's won for a little bit now,

418
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:30,143
and it's killing me to keep it a secret.

419
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:31,203
So you know what?

420
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:33,403
Let's head inside, because it's getting a little warm out.

421
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,485
Hey, welcome to the inside of my house.

422
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:41,645
Fair warning, there's probably going to be parrot noises

423
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:44,006
at some point, so be prepared for that.

424
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,027
Oh, hi, Sunny.

425
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:49,478
Anyways, these folks are the future of our industry.

426
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,179
Brand new developers making exceptional content,

427
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,700
showing us new facets of what games can be.

428
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,181
Compelling storytelling, colorful artwork,

429
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:59,061
and groundbreaking points of view.

430
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:01,182
Here are your nominees for Best Debut.

431
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:02,382

Hi GDC!

455
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,220
We're Zaoum.

456
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,902
We're greeting you from rainy London.

457
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:38,145
We're super grateful for the best debut.

458
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:38,785
Thank you.

459
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:41,567
We're sorry we couldn't be there,

460
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,950
but hopefully we'll all see you soon enough.

461
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,550
Thanks again.

462
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,531
Bye!

463
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,904
I'm not gonna lie, this right here is my absolute favorite category.

464
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,382
So I learned about a word, which I'm likely going to butcher saying out loud,

465
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:04,303
hypnagogia, which is that point in time,

466
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,564
right before you completely fall asleep.

467
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:09,245
It's called threshold consciousness.

468
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:12,046
It's like you can hallucinate and have lucid dreams.

469
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:16,147
And I really feel like innovation and true creativity in games

470
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:18,048
is like manufactured hypnagogia.

471
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:21,349
We create dream states for our players that they get to control.

472
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,430
And hey, that's pretty damn cool.

473
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,031
Here are your nominees for innovation.

474
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:28,784

485
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:50,985
Baba Is You.

486
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,800
Hello everyone, this is Arvi Teikari.

487
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,340
Thank you so much for awarding Baba is You

488
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,501
in the innovation category.

489
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,041
I'm super grateful for that.

490
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:02,062
I'd like to thank three people.

491
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:04,883
Anni Leskela for all the encouragement

492
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,983
and support over the years.

493
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:09,184
Niklas Nygren for teaching me a lot about motivation

494
00:37:09,204 --> 00:37:10,624
and how to keep working on a project

495
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,845
even when I'm not feeling like it.

496
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:15,846
And Lukas Meller for helping me so much over the years

497
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:18,107
and teaching me many things and many ways

498
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:19,367
to make the things I do better.

499
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:25,123
Thank you and thanks to the GDC staff for organizing all of this and all their hard work and take care.

500
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:25,924
Thank you.

501
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:32,306
Once upon a time, I went to nerd school, DigPen, to get a CS degree.

502
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:40,990
I got about halfway through the degree and realized that not only do I not particularly like programming, I'm like, eh, okay at it.

503
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,573
But I buckled down, quit playing EverQuest, very, very key,

504
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:46,794
and graduated.

505
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:49,856
If I took one thing away from the experience,

506
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:51,617
however, was the sheer appreciation

507
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,578
of how difficult and complicated it

508
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,940
is to build the technologies that

509
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,841
allow us as designers and artists

510
00:37:58,061 --> 00:37:59,242
to bring our visions to life.

511
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,904
So let's take the time to appreciate

512
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:03,705
the NOMs for best technology.

513
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,206

00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,577
Oli Hariola.

529
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:19,560
Arvi Tikari.

530
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:27,718
And the winner is Control.

531
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:33,760
Hey, I'm Sean Donnelly, lead programmer of Control. I'm

532
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,682
accepting the GDC award for best technology on behalf of Remedy

533
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:40,703
Entertainment. Thank you so much for this award. It really is a

534
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:44,165
great honor, especially when we see the competition in this

535
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:45,906
category. It's kind of insane.

536
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:50,827
Big shout out to our in-house engine and tools team, Northlight,

537
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:55,048
and of course a massive thank you to everyone who actually worked on Control,

538
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:57,648
who showed the tech off in the best possible light,

539
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:00,969
made the game play, look and sound amazing.

540
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:01,749
Thank you so much.

541
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,690
It's time to announce the award for Best Narrative.

542
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,091
First though, I had a very serious request from a friend of mine.

543
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:11,831
We need to talk.

544
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:14,732
Up for this category, we have both Outer Wilds,

545
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:16,245
and Outer Worlds.

546
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,846
At what point in time do you think both teams found out

547
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,427
about the other game's name?

548
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:24,609
And were like, oh shit, that's unfortunate.

549
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,090
Luckily for both of them, they are excellent,

550
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,672
along with the rest of the nominees in this category.

551
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,033
Here are your nominees for Best Narrative.

552
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,834

Outer Wilds, developed by Mobius Digital, published by Annapurna Interactive.

564
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:53,346
And the winner is...

565
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:56,988
Disco Elysium

566
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,630
Hi!

567
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,871
Hey GDC!

568
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:05,994
We are Zahum and we are sending you greetings from rainy Revachol

569
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,816
and thank you so much for the Best Narrative Award.

570
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:12,278
So sorry we couldn't be there in person but we will definitely see you in the summer.

571
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,139
Thank you guys, bye!

572
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:14,940
Bye!

573
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:21,884
If you know Kate, you know Kate's heroes.

574
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:25,286
Kate loves strength, she loves misfits,

575
00:42:25,606 --> 00:42:26,707
and she loves rebels.

576
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:28,328
She loves them so much

577
00:42:28,428 --> 00:42:30,068
that she frequently dresses like them.

578
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:33,790
Kate's Thor cosplay is some of the most beautiful.

579
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,754
powerful costuming I've seen outside of an actual Hemsworth.

580
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:41,057
In the 90s, when Microsoft and Ensemble Studios

581
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,319
released the first Age of Empires game,

582
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,040
it contained a grievous error.

583
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,243
For totally benign reasons, the game misrepresented

584
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:50,686
a crucial point of cultural history,

585
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:52,447
an error that was so egregious

586
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:55,870
that a regional executive of ours was actually put in jail.

587
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:01,311
We needed a hero. We needed somebody to help us fix our problem.

588
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:05,533
We needed somebody maybe from Asgard sent to save us from ourselves.

589
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:08,955
And that's when I got to meet my favorite geographer, Kate Edwards.

590
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:14,898
Kate is a rare being, a leader introvert. As a kid, Kate would frequently look up

591
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:18,760
from wandering the playground in a reverie to notice other children following her.

592
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,821
And she would demand, why? Why are you following me around?

593
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:24,624
But to me, the answer is obvious.

594
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:26,486
Kate is never lost.

595
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:28,948
Born into a loving and supportive family,

596
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:31,331
her parents established a morality

597
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:33,253
based on doing the right thing,

598
00:43:33,473 --> 00:43:34,494
defending the little guy,

599
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:36,416
and taking action where possible

600
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:39,239
that forms the basis of Kate's worldview today.

601
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,622
At Microsoft, Kate led the entire company

602
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:43,864
in the establishment of a set of processes

603
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:50,334
for geopolitical reviews and standards that is the basis for our friendly global relationships

604
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:53,198
and authentic cultural representation today.

605
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:56,803
And yes, Kate did help us get our executive out of jail.

606
00:43:57,424 --> 00:43:58,746
As director of the IGDA,

607
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:04,212
Kate broadened both her global worldview and also her understanding of the games industry.

608
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:09,677
She also gained fame for her outspoken opinions on the imbalances and the injustices

609
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,640
that threaten independent game developers even today.

610
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,923
She formed a kind of Dumbledore's army of advocates.

611
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:19,605
focusing on topics ranging from crunch to diversity

612
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:21,525
to safety from online hate mobs.

613
00:44:21,805 --> 00:44:23,746
Kate expanded the reach of the IGDA

614
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:25,747
to emerging game development regions

615
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:29,028
like Bangladesh, Tunisia, Egypt, and many others.

616
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:32,389
And her advocacy hasn't ended in the years post-IGDA.

617
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:36,230
Last year alone, Kate traveled to more than 25 countries,

618
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,792
and she spent more than 76 hours on stage or in panels

619
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:43,192
inspiring game developers everywhere.

620
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:44,253
Her global focus

621
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:48,860
is what makes her so perfect for the Executive Director of the Global Game Jam.

622
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,788
Although she has confided in me, she believes it's time to expand Global Game Jam's horizons.

623
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:58,616
Somewhere in a galaxy far, far away, the Rebels need our help.

624
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:03,646
I would like to thank GDC and the selection committee and all my fellow game creators

625
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:07,847
around the world for this tremendous honor of receiving the Ambassador Award this year.

626
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:12,788
I was honestly taken by surprise by this and so I don't know what to say other than I'm

627
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:17,889
truly humbled and I'm very thankful so, you know, thank you so much for this recognition.

628
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:20,090
It means a tremendous amount to me.

629
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,692
As we cannot be together this year because of the postponement of GDC,

630
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:27,334
obviously because we're all aware of global events at the moment,

631
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:30,116
I am glad that we can at least connect via the stream.

632
00:45:30,316 --> 00:45:33,978
As game creators and as people who live in a digital world,

633
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:36,960
we have the ability to maintain this connection no matter what.

634
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,482
So we are very resilient in that way.

635
00:45:40,142 --> 00:45:47,130
And so as I'm standing here in Hoth, in actual Finnsund, Norway, where they filmed the Empire Strikes Back over 40 years ago,

636
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:54,199
I wanted to share just a few quick thoughts to you about what this award means to me and what it means to the industry.

637
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:59,933
You know, when we talk about being an ambassador and what that means,

638
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:04,574
you know, it's about putting our best self forward and trying to present the

639
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:08,455
industry in the best light and to make change happen for the better.

640
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:11,416
And, you know, what does it really mean to make change?

641
00:46:11,556 --> 00:46:14,897
I think for a lot of us, you know, we find that challenging today

642
00:46:14,977 --> 00:46:16,917
because we don't really know where to start.

643
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:20,618
And I think in my own experience, where it really starts is with ourselves.

644
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:21,478
If we can.

645
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:27,722
figure out what is stopping us from taking that step to help somebody or to take that step forward

646
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:33,286
or to be a voice for someone who's marginalized. You know we have to find the confidence in

647
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:38,370
ourselves to get over our imposter syndrome and get to that point where we have that confidence.

648
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,592
You know whether you actually believe in that confidence or not,

649
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:46,235
it's more about believing in the reason to have that confidence which is for other people.

650
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:49,777
And I know in my experience, that's what's really been driving me.

651
00:46:49,817 --> 00:46:55,859
I mean, I have been driven for a long time now by this notion that evil triumphs when good people do nothing.

652
00:46:56,279 --> 00:47:01,181
And I really believe that. And so that's what has been driving my action in this industry.

653
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,783
Because I want people to be better and I want the industry to be better.

654
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:13,286
And I want us to treat each other with more respect and to treat each other with fairness and being inclusive in how we approach everything.

655
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:17,937
You know, at one point, John F. Kennedy, the former U.S. President, said,

656
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:24,459
if not us, then who? And if not now, then when? And really, I think that's something that all of

657
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:29,561
us need to challenge ourselves with. When we see something that we don't like, when we see something

658
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:34,662
that we are dissatisfied with in this industry, and it could be a huge issue that affects all of

659
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:39,224
us, or it could be a tiny thing that affects your local community, you have to ask yourself,

660
00:47:39,884 --> 00:47:41,145
Why is it not changing?

661
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,705
And then how can you be that agent of change

662
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:44,526
to make it happen?

663
00:47:44,926 --> 00:47:46,226
And you know, in my experience,

664
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:47,647
and I think what people have seen,

665
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:49,448
at least in my actions,

666
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:51,908
is that basically I made a decision

667
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:53,989
that I'm gonna be the one to step forward

668
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:55,570
and actually try and make change happen.

669
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,710
It's not because I'm better than anybody.

670
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,111
It's not because I have more experience than anybody.

671
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:02,252
It's just, it's a simple act of will.

672
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:04,793
And it's actually a decision saying,

673
00:48:04,813 --> 00:48:07,254
I want this to change for the better

674
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,974
because I think it's gonna help all of us.

675
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:14,657
And so, you know, as you think about this, and again, I just I'm so thankful for this award.

676
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:20,219
And for for this kind of honor, you know, just think about for yourselves, what does it mean to

677
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:25,381
be an ambassador for this industry. And so I'm just going to leave you with that challenge. And,

678
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:30,523
you know, I know that if all of us are doing our part, and are trying as best as we can to be that

679
00:48:30,623 --> 00:48:32,904
that voice for the industry and for other people.

680
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:37,791
who are marginalized, you know, this industry and this and this world frankly is going to get better

681
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:42,879
but it's going to take all of us to take that step. So once again thank you so much for this

682
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:47,666
award and I just am deeply appreciative and I hope to see you at GDC next time.

683
00:48:50,776 --> 00:48:55,798
Audio teams are the unsung heroes of our industry, always the last ones to get to bring their

684
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,358
art to life in a game's pipeline.

685
00:48:57,658 --> 00:49:01,659
And of course, those players that mute the audio and don't wear headphones.

686
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,160
The worst, right?

687
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,160
Audio really makes a game.

688
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,162
Corrective guidance cues, warnings of things to come, and memorable tunes.

689
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,963
How many times have you woken up with a theme song stuck in your head?

690
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,761
Let's give the audio and music on these wonderful games

691
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:21,502
the appreciation they truly deserve.

692
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:23,503
Here are your nominees for Best Audio.

693
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:25,583
Best Audio.

694
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:32,066

Hi, my name is Ville Sorsa.

711
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:53,916
I'm the lead audio signer here at Remedy Entertainment.

712
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:59,239
On behalf of the entire Remedy Audio team,

713
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,921
we're super excited about the fact that we just won the GDC award.

714
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:07,603

715
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:10,065
and especially 505 Games

716
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,846

718
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:19,597
Thank you.

719
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,004
Filming an award show is hard work. Um, time for snack. What do you say?

720
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:30,766
I baked muffins for the crew. Um,

721
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:36,531
what do you think? Huh?

722
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:39,118
All right, well, this next category of folks

723
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:42,762
maybe took sci-fi movies, TV, and books a little too seriously

724
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:46,266
and swore a sacred oath to bring Holodecks and Oasis

725
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,368

748
00:53:38,518 --> 00:53:39,879

00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:45,364

758
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:18,516

759
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:22,713
Oh, hi.

760
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:24,254
Roadshow, right?

761
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:24,895
Yeah, OK.

762
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:27,197
Who would have ever guessed back in 2007

763
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:30,439
that the iPhone would have had this much of an impact

764
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:31,059
on our industry?

765
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,722

766
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:38,465

767
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,287
and play the most ridiculous game of golf,

768
00:54:41,968 --> 00:54:42,888
all in the palm of your hand.

780
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:23,318
Guys, guys, we bought something!

781
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:24,859
It's insane!

782
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:27,201
Guys, it's that phone!

783
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:27,981
Oh my God!

784
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:28,922
Oh my God!

785
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:29,602
Oh my God!

786
00:56:29,763 --> 00:56:30,563
Oh my God!

787
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:31,244
Oh my God!

788
00:56:31,424 --> 00:56:31,644
Yes!

789
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:31,924
Yes!

790
00:56:32,124 --> 00:56:32,204
Yes!

791
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:32,585
Yes!

792
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:37,468
When I first started to learn about digital art

793
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:39,149
and creating the pretties for video games,

794
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:42,632
one thing that struck me is just how absolutely ugly

795
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:45,354
and gruesome things started before they became beautiful

796
00:56:45,374 --> 00:56:45,894
and took shape.

797
00:56:46,729 --> 00:56:49,772
Weird blobs of brown at the beginning of a piece of concept art,

798
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:51,173
chonky shapes for models,

799
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:53,935
and have you ever seen an unwrapped material

800
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:55,196
for a character's face?

801
00:56:55,336 --> 00:56:56,077
Like, yikes.

802
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,619
It rubs the lotion on its skin, am I right?

803
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:00,260
Luckily for us tonight,

804
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,503
we get to see the gorgeous, exquisite, and glorious

805
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:06,145
end products of these extremely talented artists.

806
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,447

And the winner is...

825
00:58:31,437 --> 00:58:32,118
Control.

826
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:37,259
Hi, this is Janne Pulkkinen, Art Director from Remedy.

827
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:43,537
I'm honored to accept the GDZ Award for Best Visual Art for Control.

828
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:46,160
Thank you. This is amazing.

829
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:51,867
Brutalism plays a big part in control, so I'd first like to thank our World Design Director,

830
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:55,551
Stuart MacDonald, for doing an incredible job with the environments.

831
00:58:56,394 --> 00:59:00,298
Then I would like to thank the key members of the art team,

832
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,501
Antti Puomio, Elmeri Raitanen, Damien Stempniewski,

833
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:07,266
Riho Kroll, Miro Westerinen and Leonardo Kalamati.

834
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:08,026
Thank you.

835
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,210
Then of course, I would like to thank our creative director,

836
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,412
Sam Lake, and game director, Mikael Kasurinen,

837
00:59:13,813 --> 00:59:16,336
for having the courage to build something this unique.

838
00:59:17,707 --> 00:59:23,332
Then finally, I would like to thank the whole team here at Remedy for building an environment of trust

839
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:28,276
where all the weirdest and wildest ideas are allowed to survive and flourish.

840
00:59:28,937 --> 00:59:29,297
Thank you.

841
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:38,666
The first time Roberta Williams played Colossal Cave Adventure, she was transfixed.

842
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:41,989
It was a computer game unlike anything she'd ever played before.

843
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:44,111
Literary, narrative, fantastical.

844
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,131
She burned through that game, then others, and when she ran out of games altogether,

845
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,572
she took matters into her own hands.

846
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,234
She sat down at her kitchen table and designed her own.

847
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:56,137
It was 1979, and Roberta Williams was 26 years old.

848
00:59:57,198 --> 01:00:00,360
From that initial moment, a truly unconventional legacy would rise.

849
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:06,084
Born Roberta Lynn Hauer in 1953, the woman who would one day become the queen of adventure

850
01:00:06,104 --> 01:00:08,966
games grew up quietly in the suburbs of northern Los Angeles.

851
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:11,477
That first game became Mystery House.

852
01:00:11,977 --> 01:00:15,498
Her husband, Ken Williams, programmed the game, but she designed it and drew its images,

853
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:20,340
making Mystery House not just the first adventure game with graphics, but one of the earliest

854
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,181
examples of a separation between programmer and designer.

855
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:28,042
In a moment when most people didn't know what personal computers were good for, Roberta

856
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,804
and Ken Williams would strike out on their own adventure to press the limits of computing

857
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:32,904
in the name of entertainment.

858
01:00:33,724 --> 01:00:37,766
Together, they founded Sierra Online, a company that needs no introduction in the annals of

859
01:00:37,806 --> 01:00:38,606
video game history.

860
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,331
For much of the 1980s and 90s, Sierra was the largest publisher of home entertainment

861
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:47,873
software in the world, and flagship among its titles was Roberta's King's Quest series,

862
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,655
a bright and lively collection of eight games spanning nearly 20 years of production and

863
01:00:52,735 --> 01:00:53,916
millions of copies sold.

864
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:59,198
Best remembered today for their surreal mashup of folklore and fable, mythology and legend.

865
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:04,594
Only in King's Quest could Medusa share a landscape with evil wizards or Pegasus fly

866
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:05,715
over Dracula's castle.

867
01:01:06,515 --> 01:01:09,155
Overriding each of these worlds, however, was a basic narrative.

868
01:01:09,695 --> 01:01:13,076
Find your destiny, find your family, and protect them at all costs.

869
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:18,177
Counterposed to King's Quest are Roberta's domestic horrors, Mystery House, The Colonel's

870
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:23,318
Bequest, and Phantasmagoria, in which families are trying to kill you and homes are places

871
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:23,918
where you die.

872
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:29,060
Roberta Williams' oeuvre expresses a narrative expansiveness few other designers have ever

873
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:29,480
endeavored.

874
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:34,571
So it's 2020, and we're here to acknowledge what Roberta Williams never doubted, that

875
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:35,652
she was a pioneer.

876
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:40,976
In the years since she left the game industry in 1988, she has been reluctant to embrace

877
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:41,897
industry recognition.

878
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:46,658
But perhaps it's we who need to give her this reward more than she needs to receive it.

879
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:51,800
That we're the ones who need to say we remember because too often the industry would rather forget.

880
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:57,142
Perhaps the legacy of the woman herself does for this industry what her games did nearly 40 years

881
01:01:57,202 --> 01:02:02,404
earlier. Let us know that other stories are possible. It is my deepest honor to celebrate

882
01:02:02,444 --> 01:02:07,346
Roberta Williams as the recipient of the 2020 IGF and Game Developers Choice Award.

883
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:10,808
I just want to thank the

884
01:02:11,468 --> 01:02:17,452
Game Developers Conference for bestowing on me this year the honor, the incredible honor,

885
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:21,534
for the Pioneer Award for Computer Game Design.

886
01:02:21,934 --> 01:02:29,698
With the help of Ken, my husband, Ken Williams, one of the greatest programmers around, and

887
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:32,460
he still is, he still is programming, he loves it.

888
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:39,403
With his help and expertise, with our very first Apple II computer.

889
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:42,597
to provide the means by which we could do this,

890
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,697
we were able to design our very first game,

891
01:02:46,277 --> 01:02:48,718
Mystery House, back in 1980.

892
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:53,719
And I did design it on the proverbial kitchen table,

893
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:55,900
big pieces of paper.

894
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,581
I said I would love to have graphics if that was possible,

895
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:02,882
and rather than being a text adventure game.

896
01:03:02,922 --> 01:03:06,022
And he said, oh, that's pretty hard, I don't know.

897
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,823
But let's see, let's look around.

898
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,599
And he found something called a graphics tablet

899
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,860
that was just like a piece of acrylic

900
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,321
with kind of this magnetic arm, which

901
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:20,563
is one reason why the art and the pictures on Mr. House

902
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:21,303
don't look so good.

903
01:03:21,323 --> 01:03:24,324
It's not so much that I'm a bad artist, which I am,

904
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:25,265
but I'm not that bad.

905
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:27,505
It's that that was just very primitive

906
01:03:27,545 --> 01:03:29,386
to try to draw pictures.

907
01:03:29,446 --> 01:03:31,627
But that's the way we did it.

908
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:33,207
And people were amazed at the time.

909
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:37,549
And they were actually pictures on an Apple computer.

910
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:47,060
I finally did retire in, I believe, 1997, when we sold our company, which was one of

911
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,561
the saddest days of my life, and it was very hard for me.

912
01:03:52,661 --> 01:04:01,183
But I did, and Ken and I went into other adventures over the years, mainly we circumnavigated

913
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,123
oceans around the world.

914
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:04,944
But over those years, 17 years, I...

915
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:12,468
I created probably about 18, 19, 20 games.

916
01:04:13,168 --> 01:04:16,469
And then I also worked with some of our designers at Sierra.

917
01:04:16,509 --> 01:04:20,030
We were so lucky to have some of the best developers,

918
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,450
designers, programmers, artists, animators,

919
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,731
musicians in the industry.

920
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,692
And I was just so lucky to be able to work

921
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:30,372
with all of the talent that we had.

922
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,153
It was just the highlight of my life,

923
01:04:33,253 --> 01:04:35,633
and I'm so happy and so glad that

924
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:46,520
the Game Developers Conference decided to honor me with this very...

925
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:55,467
I'm humbled actually, I don't even have words. I'm just, I'm on and very happy and very honored

926
01:04:55,507 --> 01:05:02,893
to receive this award. And so on behalf of myself, Ken, and all the people that worked with us at

927
01:05:02,913 --> 01:05:05,615
Sierra Online, I want to thank you so very much.

928
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:12,544
The diversity in the design category this year is absolutely amazing to me.

929
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:16,106
Be a post-apocalyptic mailman, fly spaceships in a time loop,

930
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:19,929
wordsmith your way to success, exact revenge as a shinobi,

931
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:21,850
and be a jerk goose?

932
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:25,073
Yes, absolutely. Honk honk, my friends.

933
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:28,955
I'm issuing a challenge in our industry right here and now.

934
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:32,978
Can we strive to continue to be this diverse in the games that we offer?

935
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:34,759
I want to live in these worlds.

936
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,482
Without any further ado, here are the nominees for Best Design.

937
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,063

I'm extremely grateful for that.

As for thanks, I would firstly like to thank the GDC staff

959
01:07:19,111 --> 01:07:20,172
for all their hard work.

960
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:22,794

on such a short notice.

963
01:07:27,737 --> 01:07:31,397
I would also like to thank the same three people regardless of what happens in the ceremony,

964
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:36,759
so if you hear the same names later or if you heard them earlier, then well, my apologies.

965
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:43,520
Anyway, I'd like to thank Anni Leskela for all the support and encouragement over the

966
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:43,800
years.

967
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,781
I'd like to thank Niklas Nygren for teaching me a lot about motivation and how to work

968
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:50,181
when feeling unmotivated.

969
01:07:50,802 --> 01:07:54,622
And I would like to thank Lukas Meller for teaching me a lot about how to make games

970
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:56,263
and how to do the things I do better.

971
01:07:57,004 --> 01:08:00,665
Thanks to all of you and have a very nice GDCA ceremony.

972
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:01,405
Thank you.

You

984
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:49,207
There comes a time in the show where we all look at ourselves and think,

985
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,589
wouldn't it be nice if we had more things to vote on?

986
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:54,831
After all, what is an award show if not to give out awards, right?

987
01:09:54,851 --> 01:09:59,595
And hey, audience rewards is like, what, now an eight-year tradition?

Hey!

996
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:23,289
Yeah, it's strange that we are not at GDC,

997
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:26,810
but, you know, I'm feeling the energy,

998
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:29,191
and thank you so much for giving us the honor

999
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:31,131
for the GDC Audience Award.

1000
01:10:32,352 --> 01:10:36,773
And, you know, Sky has been a seven-year-long development process.

1001
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:41,915
It was not easy, and without, you know,

1002
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:43,768
our players' support.

1003
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:47,389
Without your support, we would not start that game company

1004
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:50,050
and we would not have been making these very difficult

1005
01:10:51,071 --> 01:10:52,031
but beautiful games.

1006
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:58,473

1007
01:10:58,553 --> 01:11:01,574

1008

1009
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:14,739
Making Sky is difficult, but we feel very happy that you are with us.

1010
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:18,826

1011

01:14:39,799 --> 01:14:41,981
and incredibly nice to receive

1042
01:14:42,021 --> 01:14:42,461
this award.

1043
01:14:43,642 --> 01:14:45,644
We had a lot of help in making this game

1044
01:14:46,104 --> 01:14:46,885
so we'd like to thank...

1045
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,361
our sound designer M Halberstadt,

1046
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,182
Dan Golding, who did our music,

1047
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:53,843
Kalonica, who helped define the look of our game,

1048
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,265
Sheree Davidson, who helped make our game accessible

1049
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:58,186
to as many people as we could.

1050
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:00,607
This game never would have been made without the support

1051
01:15:00,627 --> 01:15:01,487
of our publisher, Panic.

1052
01:15:02,768 --> 01:15:05,229
We would also like to thank Film Victoria

1053
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:07,250
for their support, both of our game,

1054
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,771
but also of the local scene.

1055
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:10,272
Thank you so much.

1056
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:10,932
Thank you.

1057
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:11,992
Game developers.

1058
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:12,533
Bye-bye.

1059
01:15:17,285 --> 01:15:22,792
Well, that's our show. Congratulations to all of our winners. You better properly celebrate tonight.

1060
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:27,477
And I want to give a huge thank you to Sandesh and Simon for taking a chance and inviting me

1061
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:31,902
to host this year's awards. Also, let's hear it for the video editors that are cutting together

1062
01:15:31,942 --> 01:15:37,448
this particular video. And thank you to IMA Fit for being in my house today and filming all of this.

1063
01:15:39,069 --> 01:15:44,392
So, finally, I want to thank everyone for being so patient and understanding this unusual

1064
01:15:44,432 --> 01:15:46,252
process with GDC this year.

1065
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:51,074
I hope everyone has the absolute bestest, most wonderful days, evenings, or whenever

1066
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:52,215
you happen to be watching this.

1067
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:54,495
And say goodbye.

1068
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:55,236
Goodbye.

1069
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:56,476
No, seriously, goodbye.

1070
01:15:56,536 --> 01:15:57,377
Get out of my house.

1071
01:15:57,437 --> 01:15:57,617
Get.

1072
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:57,757
Go.

1073
01:15:57,777 --> 01:15:57,997
Go away.

1074
01:15:58,197 --> 01:15:58,257
Go.

1075
01:15:58,277 --> 01:15:58,377
Go.

1076
01:15:58,397 --> 01:15:58,477
Go.

1077
01:15:58,517 --> 01:15:58,577
Go.

1078
01:15:58,657 --> 01:15:58,697
Go.

1079
01:15:58,717 --> 01:15:58,797
Go.

1080
01:15:58,817 --> 01:15:58,857
Go.
