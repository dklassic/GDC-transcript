1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,970
Thank you for that lovely intro.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:12,332
Hey everyone, thanks for coming.

3
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:17,253
Alright, we've only got half an hour so let's get into it.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,074
I'm Joshua Boggs and I'm a game designer and director.

5
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:25,774
Prior to Framed I've been in the industry for about 8 years now.

6
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:29,535
Some of that time is spent in AAA and some of it at various other studios.

7
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:32,336
I've been independent for about 4 of them now.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,175
I've been lucky enough to receive a bunch of awards or accolades, but that's not all

9
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:41,935
there really is to me.

10
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:44,977
I'm also an attention seeker.

11
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:51,921
And this talk is kind of about how that addiction for approval and recognition ultimately damaged

12
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,142
significant parts of my life.

13
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,986
I'm going to try and keep it together, so forgive me if I'm...

14
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:03,268
things get a little bit dark. But yeah, this talk is basically

15
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:06,930
for those that may be going through something similar or for

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,932
those who can see someone they care about doing something

17
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:17,056
similar. They just can't recognize it. Okay. So if you

18
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,738
don't know what framed is, framed is a puzzle game where

19
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:22,620
you rearrange panels of a comic book to change the outcome of

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,620
the story.

21
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:33,558
We've managed to achieve a fair amount. A lot of stuff that I kind of put on my bucket list of whatever I wanted to do in life.

22
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:36,679
And we managed to get a lot of attention.

23
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,662
So why did I do this? What was my goal?

24
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,823
To be honest, I don't really think I'm alone in this.

25
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,185
I was just really unsatisfied with my life.

26
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,567
I didn't really grow up in the best family.

27
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,906
I was pretty much told consistently that I could achieve anything.

28
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:07,389
In hindsight this is clearly biased and privileged, but that upbringing, that desire to be more

29
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,370
than what I came from never really went away.

30
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:16,433
So no matter what relationships or achievements I had in my life, I was still unsatisfied.

31
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,593
I always needed more.

32
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,814
I needed to fill that hole in my life.

33
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,636
I needed to be relevant, to be remarkable.

34
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,864
And it kind of all started like when I was in my teens, I used to do this little thing called the deathbed experiment.

35
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:40,469
And it's basically just like, you know, we don't like to talk about death a lot, but you can use it in a really powerful way to make important decisions about your life.

36
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:48,254
And the way it kind of works is you just fully imagine yourself on your deathbed looking back on your life, you know?

37
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:53,877
Like, what are you proud of? What hasn't happened yet? What's meaningful to you?

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,085
So when I imagine this, I just imagine myself needing to leave some sort of legacy.

39
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:06,809
I want to be remembered for pushing the medium forward that we all love so much.

40
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:09,932
So I threw myself into my work.

41
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,275
And did I achieve what I set out to do?

42
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,356
Yeah, I did.

43
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,178
I did tick off everything on that list.

44
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,963
I had every major festival and took home or was nominated for almost every award going

45
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:23,523
on the circuit.

46
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:28,119
But did that make me happy at all? Not at all.

47
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:39,469
And it's because I wasn't getting the recognition I felt I deserved, or more importantly, I felt that I wasn't getting the recognition that I felt I deserved.

48
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,353
I felt my whole life was leading to this, and I was going to achieve it no matter what.

49
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:50,999
I needed more. I was getting praise that I needed, but I just wasn't satisfied with it.

50
00:03:54,266 --> 00:04:02,808
So, rewind just really slightly. We first flew to Japan and submitted to IGF China and Tokyo Game Show

51
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:05,909
and that was kind of like the beginning of the addiction, I guess.

52
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,650
What should have been a boost in confidence became the start of an addiction.

53
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,331
An addiction to approval and external validation and attention.

54
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,984
I thought I was prepared for it, but I didn't really realize that the destination had changed.

55
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,347
It was no longer like a ride to the top, it was a ride into hell.

56
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,170
And I was hooked.

57
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,194
I was finally being recognized by people I'd respected and looked up to for so long.

58
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:38,078
And you can see the signs of it in the previous slides and if you saw my other talk as well,

59
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:40,700
that focus on awards all the time.

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,323
You know, I lie to myself when I say that it's all for the PR, but it's not really

61
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:45,764
what it's for.

62
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:52,000
I want people to see how good we are, well, I guess how good I am.

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,521
I need the recognition, the validation, the attention.

64
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,581
I need to be relevant.

65
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:06,003
I wanted to be the next big thing, and I wanted that by any means necessary.

66
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:13,004
The goal originally came from a place of good intentions, to be respected.

67
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:17,509
You know, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

68
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,691
Ultimately, like many artists, I just want to be known and respected for what I create.

69
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,313
I want to build a legacy. That's what I need.

70
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,174
I need to be remembered when I'm gone.

71
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,375
I don't feel I'm alone in that.

72
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:35,138
We all feel that we need to leave some part of us on this earth when we're gone.

73
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,580
And I confuse that with fame.

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,881
But I imagine that's a significant reason we all create.

75
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,516
If you're really honest with yourself, why do you create games?

76
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:54,358
Once upon a time, fame was bestowed on those who earned it for saving lives or heroic deeds.

77
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,920
Today fame is more of a form of currency, it's a social currency.

78
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,721
And like any form of currency, it distinguishes the classes of people.

79
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:07,123
It defines the class of its social media citizens.

80
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:11,064
It defines who is influence, who is power, who will be listened to.

81
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:17,965
and we're addicted to it. You can see this in almost every post someone makes that features

82
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:23,188
themselves or tweets curators specifically to get as many likes or retweets as possible.

83
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:32,232
Just sort of everyone crying out to be noticed. We are basically a generation of creators

84
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:34,433
crying out to approval for our parents.

85
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:42,955
And I did it because I felt that validation would fill me with

86
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,215
some sense of satisfaction.

87
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:49,996
And one thing about perceived success is that it always seems

88
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,357
greater from the outside than it is on the inside.

89
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,557
On the inside, all you can think about is how you're not doing

90
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:55,837
enough.

91
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:59,918
You put on that facade that you're happy and satisfied.

92
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,739
You look in the mirror and you put on the mask, that happy face

93
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,260
that you need to greet everyone with, that friendly demeanor.

94
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:12,491
You put it on because without it, you just won't succeed.

95
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:17,636
You tell yourself it's for the PR, hoping that someone will believe it.

96
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:23,161
But at the same time, the expectations of yourself and your teammates at this point

97
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,522
become unrealistic.

98
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:29,607
You chastise yourself for not being front page everywhere, for not doing more.

99
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:36,291
You fool yourself into this childish fallacy that if you just try harder you can achieve

100
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,912
anything, that everything is in your control.

101
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:41,833
So you continue.

102
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:44,494
You continue to push yourself.

103
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:50,397
You continue to lie to yourself that it's for the game, that it's for PR.

104
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:54,158
But deep down you know what it's really for.

105
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,281
You know the real reason you're projecting your own unrealistic expectations onto others.

106
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,888
Why you've pushed everything else in your life to the side.

107
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:08,789
The real reason your game is so awarded prior to release.

108
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,370
Why you've got a spot on the silver screen before the main film rolls.

109
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,951
And why you've lost sight of your values.

110
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:17,591
Why you need another drink.

111
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:20,372
It's not because you worked hard for it.

112
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,693
It's definitely not because you deserve the success either.

113
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:25,933
It's because you're an addict.

114
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,534
But it doesn't really matter.

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,841
Because all you can think about is that next head of validation.

116
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:38,486
When people talk of cost, they often talk about the time they

117
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:42,469
spent building a company or a certain product or a game or

118
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:49,255
anything really. They talk about the dinners they missed. And

119
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,977
that is valid. That is a valid sacrifice.

120
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:59,486
For a lot of late entrepreneurs and people who really throw themselves into their work,

121
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,507
it's not really what they're talking about.

122
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,991
What people really mean when they talk about what they gave up to ensure they succeeded,

123
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:11,413
what they're really talking about is that they sacrificed themselves.

124
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:18,297
They lost sight of those values that made them who they were, what they hold themselves

125
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:21,019
up to, what they hope to pass on to others.

126
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,019
They gave them up to succeed, to tick that goal off their list.

127
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,461
And I did the same.

128
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:35,249
I turned my back on everything that made me strong.

129
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,636
My skills I discarded for more relevant ones.

130
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,699
My values I threw away so that I could...

131
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:53,811
Become someone who can maybe fulfill that dissatisfaction and emptiness I have in me.

132
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:00,977
This is your brain on attention.

133
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:06,002
You submit to every show you can, knowing that no matter what happens, you can only

134
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,002
possibly feel worse.

135
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:12,487
If you win or are recognized and you get your hit and you manage to maintain your feeling

136
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:12,868
of normalcy.

137
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:17,979
If you don't get mentioned at all, you crash.

138
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,902
You're flooded with feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, and failure.

139
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,985
And the culture in our scene breeds this.

140
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,526
The independent scene does breed this.

141
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,790
Everyone is congratulating you and reaffirming that what you're doing must be right.

142
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,751
So you continue.

143
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,413
You fall deeper into that vicious cycle.

144
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:42,037
And indie scenes across many art forms are breeding grounds for this kind of behavior.

145
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,038
We're told it's necessary to succeed.

146
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:49,359
You know, how will we get people to give us money for our work if they don't know who we are?

147
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,300
We get fame confused.

148
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,380
Fame does not come before virtue.

149
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,181
Fame does not get bestowed before success.

150
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:05,162
There's a really good quote by this person called Daniel Borstein about it.

151
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:06,082
And he says,

152
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:09,823
The celebrity is a person who is known for their well-knownness.

153
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,503
They are neither good nor bad.

154
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,452
Great, nor petty.

155
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:16,994
They are the human pseudo-event.

156
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,159
And we like to think that as artists we're complicated,

157
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,299
you know, we're deep.

158
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,421
But we're really not.

159
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,244
We're the kids screaming for more attention.

160
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:31,526
We're driven by feelings of inadequacy,

161
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,048
desire for relevance.

162
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,950
We're rewarded for never maturing.

163
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:38,532
And we're paid to indulge in our habits.

164
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:43,657
And myself, I was very guilty of this.

165
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:45,737
I trembled over others to reach the top.

166
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,238
Lots of, I guess you could call allies and enemies

167
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,979
or acquaintances and colleagues.

168
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,141
But friends, real friends, not so many.

169
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,601
Some of us are friends, yes.

170
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,802
Some of us are very good friends,

171
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:00,782
some of you in this room.

172
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,124
But to many people, you're an asset,

173
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,364
a utility to help them reach the top.

174
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,285
It's labeled as business or hustling.

175
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:15,516
But when people use these terms in a non-business sense, when they apply them to, you know,

176
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,697
friends getting together, it highlights their intentions.

177
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,998
It highlights their goals and values.

178
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:24,899
More than anything, it highlights how they see themselves.

179
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,781
Why do they do this?

180
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,302
Well, they're addicted too.

181
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:34,923
They need that head of validation because they're not going to get it from themselves.

182
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,645
They need to move up the ladder to achieve what they're truly after.

183
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,046
And what they're after is that attention.

184
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,851
And I did this too. I'm very guilty of that.

185
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:49,694
And I've probably done this a lot worse than many others have.

186
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,718
So in the fall of 2014, Fane was finished.

187
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,741
And I sacrificed so much for this.

188
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,743
And in the end, like, despite everything we achieved,

189
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:04,066
despite achieving virtually everything I'd set out to do,

190
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:08,129
I still felt empty. It still meant nothing.

191
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:13,676
My whole life had been leading up to what I thought would bring me happiness, but it

192
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:14,456
just didn't.

193
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,477
I felt worse than ever, in fact.

194
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,819
I kind of just lost my mind.

195
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,500
I lost some of the closest people around me.

196
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,164
I neglected friendships and deserted family members when they needed me because I needed

197
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,584
to get that fixed for myself.

198
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:38,528
I neglected all of my relationships, but really, before all of that, I deserted myself.

199
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,126
I changed, you know, not for the better.

200
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:48,829
I became something I never wanted to become and in doing that I just ended up losing or

201
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,550
giving up everything else around me.

202
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,152
I sacrificed what makes me who I am.

203
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:00,515
And there are times I wish I could take it back.

204
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:05,017
I wish I'd treated and valued those around me better than I did.

205
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:07,438
I wish I had the strength and...

206
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,598
insight to see what I was doing to myself and those around me.

207
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:22,565
So with Jack and Jimmy by my side I kind of soon followed what was a year long downward spiral of

208
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:32,111
self destruction. It was fueled by denial, anger, resentment, regret, and an unhealthy

209
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:36,934
dose of alcohol. I drank literally every day.

210
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:38,945
It's not an exaggeration.

211
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:44,788
From shipping until the end of 2015, I drank literally every single day.

212
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,850
And I blamed everyone.

213
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,211
Everyone else but me.

214
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,573
I blamed my parents for not staying together.

215
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,795
I blamed my friends for needing me as much as they did.

216
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:02,297
I blamed my teammates for not living up to my unrealistic expectations.

217
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,722
I blame those that had my back for not noticing what was really going on.

218
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,764
I wish I saw my family more.

219
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,166
Was it all worth it?

220
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,167
It wasn't.

221
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,609
Did everything achieve or satisfy what I needed to achieve?

222
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,810
Fuck no, it didn't.

223
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:33,752
Didn't achieve what I needed because what was I really seeking to achieve?

224
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:40,806
You know, you can say it was the awards or the respect, but like I said, it's the validation,

225
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:42,567
the attention.

226
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,870
Things that no matter how much you receive will never be enough.

227
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:57,695
The issue with satisfaction, sorry, the issue was that satisfaction was not tied to my internal

228
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:02,257
sense of values anymore, but to external validation and attention.

229
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:07,224
And it's really easy for us to fall into that trap as creators.

230
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:10,848
Because that's the only objective measurement we really have.

231
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,234
So, will I change anything?

232
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:19,357
Of course.

233
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:23,120
You know, I sacrificed myself.

234
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,762
What I held dear.

235
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:31,853
The things that got me to where I was, my values for success, I threw away my sense

236
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:37,316
of self so that the public image of Joshua Boggs would appear greater than it really

237
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:37,676
was.

238
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,157
And it worked for a little while.

239
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,059
I felt good in the beginning.

240
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:52,842
I was getting more gratification by being associated with particular people and using

241
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:54,383
them to further my own means as well.

242
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:00,650
It's really bad saying, I knew exactly what I was doing.

243
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:08,573
If you saw my previous talk at all, you maybe would have known that I'm quite good at reading social systems and people inside them.

244
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:16,417
So, with all that said, you know, how did I get out?

245
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,158
How did I turn it around?

246
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:27,462
Well, as I began to lose myself, my insight in myself, my understanding of who I was changed dramatically.

247
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:34,567
Lots of running away from my problems, leaving cities and a lot of drinking helped, for a

248
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,288
little while at least.

249
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:40,830
But a year later I'm kind of happy to finally say that I have found some sense of happiness

250
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,330
in my life.

251
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:47,033
I've never really sought happiness, so I've only ever strived for success.

252
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,356
But that pursuit had destroyed me and I was still unsatisfied.

253
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,938
Particular people who stood by me helped me a lot.

254
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:04,071
A lot of acceptance of what I've done wrong and lots of therapy have brought a greater

255
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,291
understanding about myself.

256
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:13,335
And it's really hard to accept help, particularly with mental issues, because your mind is the

257
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:13,736
problem.

258
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:18,978
And as creators, it's really hard for us to understand that, because we trust those

259
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:21,560
instincts so passionately, right?

260
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,921
They are what make us great at what we do.

261
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:27,663
But it also lies to us.

262
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:36,103
Schopenhauer once said, an artist never is happy, but spends their whole life in striving

263
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,124
after something which they think will make them so.

264
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:43,545
They seldom attain their goal, and when they do, it is only to be disappointed.

265
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:48,727
They are mostly shipwrecked in the end, and come into harbour with mast and rigging gone.

266
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:56,889
I remember when I was at EA, right, there was someone there who was leaving, who I really

267
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:57,490
looked up to.

268
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:01,373
I asked them why they were leaving, like why were they giving up on their dream, they were

269
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:02,874
leaving the games industry altogether.

270
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:09,435
And they said something that I find I think more and more about, and it's, they said the

271
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:14,316
difference between dreams and reality is that a dream can't really be lived, right?

272
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:18,777
If it can be lived, it's too narrow, and if it can't, it shouldn't be a goal.

273
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:24,458
Rather than dream, you should wake up and build a life that really fulfills you.

274
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:28,209
And a dream is just an illusion.

275
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,370
Don't ever tell people you are living the dream.

276
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,971
All it proves is that your dreams are shallow.

277
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:38,714
Being a superstar or an indie sensation doesn't mean a goddamn thing when you have nothing left.

278
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:46,438
So, like I said, after being in the darkest and lowest point of my life for a year, I sought help.

279
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:52,461
No person is an island and if my issues are stemming due to my need for approval of others,

280
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,182
I'm also going to need the help of others to get out too.

281
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,563
I'm going to state right now also that if you're going through this yourself, please

282
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:01,283
seek help.

283
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:11,110
If you notice someone on your team or a friend going down this path whose goal is set to

284
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,654
becoming famous or acclaimed, please point them towards this talk or get them help.

285
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,778
Tell them that those awards don't mean anything.

286
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,992
Because if it's unreasonable to judge someone poorly based off of their lack of achievements,

287
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:32,956
it stands to reason that you shouldn't also judge someone highly based off their achievements,

288
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:33,216
right?

289
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:37,139
And when you embrace this idea, goals kind of become meaningless.

290
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,843
So rather than set goals, set what I like to call an un-goal.

291
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:48,508
And an un-goal is really just a goal that's not really a goal.

292
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,090
It's more of a value.

293
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,357
Goals are a way to measure our achievements, measure our values.

294
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:58,299
Our values stick with us and represent us as people,

295
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,941
but the only way we can really measure that as creators is by achieving goals.

296
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,685
The problem is, however, that it's very easy to replace your values with your goals.

297
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,067
You hear about this all the time, only in a different language.

298
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:14,150
You hear about selling out, losing yourself, corrupt.

299
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,493
Achieving goals doesn't prove or disprove your value as a person.

300
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:22,376
That is to say, it doesn't really measure your value or your worth as a person.

301
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,661
Values can't be achieved or ticked off, they can only be lived.

302
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,185
Really, we all just want to be remembered for our values.

303
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,007
I don't want to be remembered for my achievements anymore.

304
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,808
I want to be respected as a person and I want to be

305
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:43,190
a loving and caring person to those around me.

306
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,992
I don't want to make games for fame or attention or anything so short-lived.

307
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:51,394
I want to make games to share a part of myself with everyone.

308
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:57,828
to speak and listen to humanity and the generations to come who will be here when we're not.

309
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:06,876
So one thing I've kind of learned in therapy recently was different to the deathbed experiment.

310
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:11,220
The deathbed experiment was focused a lot on your own bubble, your own internal measurements,

311
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,745
on goals and achievements. Other people and the meaningful relationships in your life

312
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:17,726
are never really considered.

313
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:20,794
The funeral experiment is just slightly different.

314
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:24,558
It just asks, what will your loved ones say about you at your funeral?

315
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,384
And it's different because the funeral experiment is based on character.

316
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:35,488
It asks what lasting mark you will leave on those around you.

317
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,690
Did you make anyone's life better?

318
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:38,911
Did you help people?

319
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:40,533
Are you a good person?

320
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,476
It asks how you will really be remembered.

321
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:50,969
Interestingly, this happened to me kind of out of the blue.

322
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,849
Um...

323
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,231
So just in case you don't know, um...

324
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,632
Kojima at some point at the end of 2014

325
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,953
name-framed his game of the year.

326
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:02,274
And for me,

327
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:04,595
it meant a lot.

328
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:05,555
Um...

329
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:07,856
This was the one person who

330
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,217
kind of, like, inspired me,

331
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,918
you know, as a kid to make games.

332
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,819
To try and push things forward.

333
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,363
to be authentic in what I create, and whose dedication and focus shape the values that

334
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:24,844
would become me as a person.

335
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:33,289
So to have that sort of connection and have your career come full circle in that way,

336
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:39,272
it was something that I finally felt hopeful about.

337
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:43,115
It reminded me of my core values again.

338
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:48,289
Made me finally not want to kill myself, really.

339
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,092
It was more important than any kind of laurel or any award nomination.

340
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:55,373
I wouldn't give it up for anything.

341
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:01,315
So, should you really chase your dreams?

342
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,557
It's kind of a trick question.

343
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:07,398
What are your dreams really?

344
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:12,200
If we really look inside ourselves as independent creators or artists,

345
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,041
no matter whether you're independent or not, really.

346
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,121
I'm going to wager that our dreams are to be very similar to things that I saw.

347
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:24,003
We want respect. We want validation and acknowledgement from people.

348
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:30,245
Which is really kind of just other words for fame. The desire to be remembered.

349
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,607
However, to achieve those goals you need to become a more public figure.

350
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:42,889
And by doing so that changes you from someone with a private set of values to a public persona.

351
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:47,159
Suddenly everyone feels they have the right to comment or critique or praise your decisions

352
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:47,800
and achievements.

353
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,382
This changes your goals, it changes you.

354
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:57,125
Feels good to have that attention and so by extension your goals no longer match your

355
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:57,925
internal values.

356
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,648
When you achieve those goals no satisfaction is gained anymore.

357
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,530
It's just a head of validation and ticking something off an arbitrary list.

358
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:11,713
So was it all worth it?

359
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:16,434
And again, no. It wasn't worth it at all.

360
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,677
Did I achieve everything I sought after?

361
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:23,199
Initially, I did.

362
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,400
But did it make me happy?

363
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,362
Just not at all.

364
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:32,485
Because ticking a goal off your list will never bring you real satisfaction.

365
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:36,628
Would you still seek it if social media wasn't as big as it was?

366
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,191
I'm betting the desire wouldn't be so large if we rewinded time ten years.

367
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:44,643
Which leaves us with that one question again.

368
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,085
Why do we seek it out?

369
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:52,168
And again my answer to that is for fame and attention.

370
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,652
Social relevance and respect among those pairs that we look up to.

371
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:04,156
And I don't know if I'll ever properly be able to forgive myself for feeling that way

372
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:10,060
and for what I kind of sacrificed for being so resentful and hateful of other people

373
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,041
who were really just there to support me.

374
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,481
I don't know if I'll ever really reclaim that youthful hope again.

375
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,045
But maybe all isn't lost.

376
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:25,008
Maybe I can make it worth it if...

377
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:29,831
Maybe I can make it mean something if there's some way to warn others.

378
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:34,175
To...

379
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:38,959
Really give meaning to what I'd lost.

380
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:43,282
So, was it all worth it?

381
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:50,651
Well, if it helps anyone here today, I say it is. Thank you.

382
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,527
I don't know if we have time for questions.

383
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,091
Two minutes. If anyone asks questions.

384
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:26,238
Otherwise, we don't need to.

385
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:42,479
I'm wondering if your experience or your addiction affected how you saw other independent

386
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,059
developers.

387
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:49,764
If you saw them more as competition or as idols, you know, when other people are getting

388
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:50,905
awards and things like that.

389
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:57,149
Yes, the question was how did that addiction affect how I saw other people, right?

390
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,712
And yeah, it definitely did taint things.

391
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:10,007
Not necessarily like, you know, they won something and I didn't, but more just you look up to

392
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:16,050
them and you sort of are trying to constantly do better to try and be remembered and that

393
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:22,552
does cause a sort of negative influence on you.

394
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:23,573
So yes, it does.

395
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:40,315
Hi, you said that if you are going through this too, that you should get help and I was wondering if you could elaborate, like maybe, if you mean like therapy and if so, a specific kind of therapy?

396
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:54,244
I can't really like give out medical advice or anything, but, and everyone's kind of different, so, just, I mean even if you just start by telling people around you, you know, what you're going through and

397
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:59,906
That's one of the great things about this community is, like I would never give this talk anywhere else.

398
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:04,730
I give it here because I know that we're all a community and we can all help each other.

399
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:16,399
So it's not necessarily like any specific kind of therapy, it's just being able to actually voice that and have other people support you.

400
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:17,981
Thank you.

401
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:24,731
When you said you kind of lost your sense of self and your values, how did you reconnect

402
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:28,193
with yourself and kind of figure, find yourself again?

403
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:31,876
Yeah, I think stopping drinking is a good one.

404
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,361
Yeah, I mean, alcohol, like for some people, makes them like further depressed and it definitely

405
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:39,882
did that to me.

406
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:45,646
But I think it was just a lot of like accepting.

407
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,762
What I had done helped a lot in that.

408
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:56,567
And I did seek therapy, which has only just kind of now slowly made me feel like I can

409
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:57,087
go on again.

410
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:08,009
I don't really have a question, but more just wanted to say thank you for giving this talk.

411
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:13,254
I really applaud you for being able to use the platform that you achieved through Framed

412
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:18,859
to talk about this, which I think is something that's universal to everyone who has a natural

413
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:19,880
drive and ambition.

414
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,004
So I can imagine that this was tough to do and thank you so much for speaking about this.

415
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,244
Thank you.

416
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:25,885
Thanks a lot.

417
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:27,646
I think that's it.

418
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:28,026
Sorry.
