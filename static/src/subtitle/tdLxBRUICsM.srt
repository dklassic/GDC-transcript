Hi, my name is AurÃ©lie. I'm a gameplay programmer on For Honor.

2
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:11,895
I've been working at Ubisoft Montreal for about five years now,

3
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:15,015
and I'm really excited this year because I get to talk at GDC.

4
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:20,916
I'll be giving a talk aimed mostly for designers and programmers,

5
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:25,477
gameplay programmers, about a gameplay system that we worked on on For Honor

6
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:30,578
that enables the designers to create and iterate on their gameplay ideas

7
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,618
without having to go through a programmer.

8
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:36,274
I'm so excited to share all this information with you.

9
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,742
I'll see you on the battlefield!
