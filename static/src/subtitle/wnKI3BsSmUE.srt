1
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:17,150
Welcome everyone and thank you for joining on the Friday of GDC.

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,351
No easy task.

3
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:31,140
I actually wasn't sure how many folks were going to make it, but then I started thinking maybe this is kind of like when a grocery store puts the important stuff all the way in the back and you have to like navigate your way.

4
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,670
So I'm hoping this is the important part of GDC.

5
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:40,052
And yeah, hopefully you're able to take away some cool insights from it.

6
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:45,174
So identifying indie, a study of who plays what and why.

7
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:54,397
So I'm Phil from Humble Games, which is the publishing arm of Humble Bundle, which some of you may be familiar with.

8
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:59,479
And a little while back, we did a study alongside our partners at Interpret.

9
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,211
about indie gamers.

10
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:31,151
And yeah, I think it's also really nice to be able to put some data behind the voice of indie gamers and really be able to continue to deliver experiences that surprise and delight them.

11
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:56,498
So before we get into the findings themselves a little bit about the research that we did, we did both quantitative and qualitative research, so surveys and focus groups, and we surveyed over 4,800 respondents across ages 18 to 45, across six countries, including the US, Germany, and Brazil, amongst others.

12
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:03,826
And all of this was with the goal of understanding indie gamers and specifically people that buy indie games.

13
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,608
And so you might be thinking, well, how did you define indie games?

14
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:09,829
Which is an excellent question.

15
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:15,512
And actually a question that we asked as well, and it could probably be its own entire separate talk.

16
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:22,255
We saw a lot of responses ranging from size of the team to budget of the game.

17
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,448
to whether or not you have a publisher.

18
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:31,715
For our purposes, we found, at least for premium titles, that Pricepoint was a pretty good proxy for a lot of those things.

19
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:35,458
And we also provided examples to survey respondents as well.

20
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:45,906
But indie buyers, we wanted to learn more about them and specifically who they are, what is their ideal indie experience, and then how do they buy.

21
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:58,602
And so we started out with who they are and while we did collect demographic information, I think the more interesting piece of it is more about their habits, their attitudes, their motivations.

22
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,365
So that's kind of where we started this whole journey.

23
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:08,392
And to dig into it more, we actually separated our respondents into three different segments.

24
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:16,456
And this is a really important slide because I'm going to reference this throughout the entire rest of the presentation, so good one to focus on.

25
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:19,918
But we segmented our respondents into three groups.

26
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:29,043
First, regular indie buyers were folks that had purchased five or more indie titles within the prior 12 months from when the study was run.

27
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,553
Light indie buyers purchased 1-4 indie titles in the prior 12 months.

28
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:43,904
Traditional game buyers bought no indie titles in the prior 12 months, but purchased at least one AA or AAA title.

29
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:56,403
Actually, 40% of the respondents had purchased at least one indie title within the prior 12 months, which I thought was really cool to see.

30
00:03:56,463 --> 00:04:00,907
It's a pretty significant audience, and I don't know that I would have guessed that beforehand.

31
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,929
So that was really nice to see.

32
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,454
But I actually want to dive into the habits of each of these gamers.

33
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:16,120
And we're going to start with traditional gamers, just so we can set a foundation and compare and contrast against indie buyers.

34
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:23,004
So looking at traditional game buyers, they play both PC and console.

35
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:30,067
And I should mention that this study is largely PC and console focused, so not a lot of mobile reference throughout the rest of this talk.

36
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,667
So just a good note to have.

37
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,589
They game for about 12 hours per week.

38
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:44,633
And on the right-hand side, you can see some of their top genres, including things like shooters, open-world action, action-adventure, sports, battle royale.

39
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:52,619
And then on the bottom right, you can see how they index any genres where they may over index when compared to indie game buyers.

40
00:04:52,699 --> 00:05:01,706
So in this case, sports being a genre where they over index anything over 100 means they over index if it's over 120, that was statistically significant.

41
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,294
Now let's take a look at Light Indie Buyers.

42
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:09,441
Again, these were 1-4 indie titles in the prior 12 months.

43
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,906
This group is heavier PC players.

44
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:16,313
We still do see they play console as well, but skew a bit more towards PC.

45
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:22,252
the game for about 20% more per week when compared to traditional gamers.

46
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,796
And then top genres are actually really similar to what you saw in the last slide.

47
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:36,966
With one exception, we do see that RPGs creep into the top five here, coming in at the third most popular genre or most played recently.

48
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,210
And then on the bottom right, you see a lot of genres that

49
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:48,637
are typically more associated with indie titles, things like roguelikes, metroidvanias, collectible card games.

50
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:54,999
This group is way more likely to play those games and those genres than traditional game buyers.

51
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,502
They still don't make it to the top five of their overall genres played, but definitely way more likely than traditional gamers.

52
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:06,990
And then lastly, regular indie buyers.

53
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,954
These were folks who had purchased five or more indie titles in the prior 12 months.

54
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:16,217
This is the heaviest PC playing group of the entire audience.

55
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:21,282
They game about 50% more per week when compared to traditional gamers.

56
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:33,132
And again, on the right-hand side, you can see top genres played really similar, with the exception RPGs jumping to their number one most played recent genre.

57
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:43,220
And then on the bottom right, you can see, very similar to the last slide, just kind of on steroids, they're way more likely to play a lot of these genres that I mentioned previously.

58
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:51,402
So what we did then was we took each of those three groups and we asked, OK, how many AAA games do you buy?

59
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:53,003
How many AA games do you buy?

60
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:54,823
And how many indie games do you buy?

61
00:06:55,563 --> 00:07:06,716
So going into it, we kind of had this thought that maybe indie gamers are only playing indie games or mostly playing indie games and they're not really playing a lot of triple or double A stuff.

62
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,183
Turns out that this data says, at least in Western territories, that's not the case.

63
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,665
These folks are avid gamers across the board.

64
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,487
They actually buy more AAA games than traditional gamers.

65
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,308
They buy more AAA games than traditional gamers.

66
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:29,672
And they also buy quite a few indie games, which I think if you've seen a lot of people's Steam libraries, you can attest to this fact.

67
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:37,203
But also looking at light indie buyers, it was a similar case but a lot less pronounced than those regular indie buyers.

68
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:39,286
They do play AAA games.

69
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,688
They also play AA games.

70
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:44,453
Again, just a lower quantity than those regular indie buyers.

71
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:53,185
And then traditional gamers buying both AAA and AA titles, and by definition, they're not buying any indie games.

72
00:07:53,425 --> 00:08:08,392
And we did ask about that, and we'll talk about it more in a couple of slides, but kind of the short answer there is they view AAA and AA as higher quality and better value than indie titles, and they generally like playing big franchises.

73
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,886
OK, so this is an eye chart.

74
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,629
I will try and break it down for you a little bit.

75
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:21,093
So we asked a bunch of questions about the attitudes of each of these gamers.

76
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:28,159
And you can see on the bottom, there's a few questions where the respondents or the three segments are really close together.

77
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,102
So they have very similar views on some of these questions that we asked.

78
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:36,906
So for example, gaming is a laid back activity that I use for unwinding.

79
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,470
preferring games where I can explore areas in the order that I want.

80
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,872
These were common things amongst all of our respondents.

81
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:48,514
So there actually are a decent amount of similarities.

82
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:53,478
But let's jump into or drill into some of the differences.

83
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:57,701
So the first three items on here, gaming as a key part of my identity.

84
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:11,402
Regular indie buyers were more likely to view gaming as a key part of their identity, whereas traditional gamers kind of view it as just one of the things that they do, and light indie buyers kind of splitting the difference there in between.

85
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:25,329
Having a preference for playing a variety of genres and franchises, all three groups had a preference for that, but you can see it's much more pronounced with regular indie buyers as compared to those traditional buyers.

86
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,825
And then lastly in this section, playing with friends.

87
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:41,733
So regular indie buyers were more likely to be okay playing games that their friends are not playing, whereas traditional gamers are more likely to be playing games that their friends are playing.

88
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,855
Again, with light indie buyers kind of splitting that difference in between.

89
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:54,361
And last slide in this section is we asked how each of these three groups would describe indie games.

90
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,662
So indie games specifically.

91
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:11,365
And you can see regular and light indie buyers really similar across the board, maybe a little more pronounced for regular indie buyers, but very likely to describe indie games as things like unique, experimental, innovative, passionate

92
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:20,765
And then you can contrast that to traditional gamers who are much more muted in their responses across the board on kind of all of these descriptors.

93
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:28,927
And while it wasn't super common, you do see some traditional game buyers that tend to view indie games as lower quality.

94
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:34,348
And again, this speaks to the fact that I mentioned earlier that they're not purchasing any indie titles.

95
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:39,749
So that's a little bit about who these gamers are.

96
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,251
This next section is kind of the bulk of the talk here.

97
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,232
What is their ideal indie experience?

98
00:10:46,612 --> 00:11:01,456
And I do want to caveat before we go into this section that there's a lot of information here, and I don't want the takeaway to be that my game needs to have all of these elements or all of these aspects to succeed, because I think that's very much not the takeaway.

99
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:07,098
I would argue it actually should be more about trying something different and innovative and unique.

100
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:12,695
But this is a good glimpse into general preferences for indie gamers.

101
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,236
So keep that in mind when we're going through this section.

102
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:22,297
So this slide is looking at gaming aspect priorities.

103
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:26,578
And in the blue, we asked indie gamers why they play all games.

104
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:30,499
And in the red, we asked traditional gamers why they play all games.

105
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,339
So this is all games.

106
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,859
This is not specific to indie games.

107
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,900
Basically, why are you playing these games?

108
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,720
Right off the bat, you can see there's some similarities across these groups.

109
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,882
Story and narrative is first and foremost the number one driver.

110
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:50,044
This is something that we've seen across the board with a lot of studies that we've done.

111
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:51,745
It's a pretty consistent result.

112
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:58,548
We'll talk about how it might actually be different for indie games in a little bit, but story and narrative are important to both groups.

113
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,402
Gameplay controls and feel also really important.

114
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:06,264
And then amount of content is also important to both groups.

115
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:11,866
Although, again, we'll talk about that a little bit more when we look at indie games specifically.

116
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:15,708
A couple of key differences.

117
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:22,930
So indie gamers are more likely to focus on innovation and uniqueness when they're playing all games.

118
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:28,793
And again, when we talk about indie games specifically, you'll see that number jump quite a bit.

119
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,392
And then graphics and art.

120
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:39,277
It's important to both groups, but traditional gamers put a much heavier emphasis on graphics and art than indie game buyers do.

121
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:47,442
OK, so this slide is taking indie game buyers specifically.

122
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,784
And in the blue, we're still looking at why they play all games.

123
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:54,707
But now in the yellow, we're actually looking at why they play indie games specifically.

124
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,575
And so there's a couple things that kind of remain the same.

125
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,256
Story and narrative still important.

126
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:01,976
Gameplay controls and feel.

127
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,997
But I want to point out a couple of the differences.

128
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:17,361
So innovation and uniqueness, it was important before, but now it actually skyrockets to be the number two driver for gaming aspects in terms of indie gamers when they play indie games.

129
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:18,702
Similarly,

130
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,882
expression and creativity, that jumps quite a bit.

131
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:27,890
And then the third one I want to call out is amount of content, which I felt was a little interesting.

132
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:35,441
So it's still important, but it actually is de-emphasized in importance when these gamers are playing indie games.

133
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:48,848
And I think these three sections kind of tell a little bit of a story when gamers are playing, or when indie gamers are playing indie games, they're not necessarily there because they want an endless experience.

134
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:51,189
They're there for something that's different and unique.

135
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:55,551
And remembering back to that earlier slide, they play a ton of games.

136
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,192
They're probably playing multiple games.

137
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,453
at the same time.

138
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:07,701
So having the ability to kind of beat a game and check it off your list, that was actually something that we found indie gamers found satisfying.

139
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,879
We also looked at a bunch of theme preferences.

140
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:23,487
And going back to my earlier caveat, this is not saying if you have a theme in a certain area that is one way or the other, it's a good or bad thing.

141
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:24,448
This is not predictive.

142
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:26,590
But this is general preferences.

143
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:31,074
So we asked each of the three cohorts, which themes are your favorite?

144
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:32,895
Which themes do you find overused?

145
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:37,840
And I won't go through all these, because you'll be able to reference them online later.

146
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:51,216
but just a couple call outs so fantasy and sci-fi those were the top themes across all the cohorts but you can see it's more pronounced again with regular and light indie buyers

147
00:14:53,976 --> 00:15:04,123
And then in terms of overused themes, post-apocalyptic and warfare, indie buyers were more likely to say those themes were overused as compared to traditional gamers.

148
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:14,490
Again, I can think of many successful warfare theme titles, so this is not prescriptive about purchase behaviors, but rather kind of stated preferences.

149
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,542
And then there's a bunch more here.

150
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,662
I won't go through all of them.

151
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:25,046
I did highlight superhero because that is pretty prevalent in today's media.

152
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:38,594
But you can see regular and light indie buyers more likely to view this category as overused, whereas traditional gamers are more likely to kind of see it as their favorite as compared to indie buyers.

153
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,711
All right, this is the last slide in this section.

154
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:50,035
It is a pretty dense slide, so I'm going to try and break it down and keep it digestible.

155
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,899
But we asked indie buyers, what are your ideal features when playing an indie game?

156
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,442
And this also goes back to what I stated earlier.

157
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,565
This doesn't mean that your game has to have all these features.

158
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,847
Otherwise, it's doomed to failure.

159
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:04,527
That's not the case.

160
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:08,910
So story and narrative, we talked about how important that is.

161
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,194
Indie gamers like seeing original IP with deep storylines, and they also like this idea of nonlinear storytelling.

162
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:24,377
So it doesn't have to be a cinematic or traditional kind of cut scene style of storytelling.

163
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:32,021
It can be nonlinear world building, maybe something you might see in some of those genres I mentioned earlier, for example, Metroidvania.

164
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:37,263
The ability to tell a story in a different way goes a long way with this audience.

165
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:44,906
Innovation and uniqueness, they really like the idea that designers took a risk.

166
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:51,329
And even if it doesn't 100% pay off, just the fact that you took a risk is really important.

167
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,632
I will say it's better if the risk pays off, but just the idea that you took a risk will go a long way.

168
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:22,634
The other thing here is that taking a risk doesn't mean trying an entirely new genre necessarily or kind of revolutionizing a particular genre or theme, but it can be taking one unique aspect of the game, whether it's a mechanic or storytelling, and putting your own spin, trying something a little different.

169
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:28,756
We've seen that just even the fact that you're trying something really goes a long way with these gamers.

170
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:47,897
In terms of controls and modes, there was a preference for third person perspective, and also a slower pace that allows for time to kind of plan things out, as opposed to traditional gamers who did have a bit more of a preference for that kind of fast twitch reflex.

171
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:51,458
Again, single player over multiplayer.

172
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:55,279
This does not mean that if you have a multiplayer game, it can't do well.

173
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:56,980
Of course, that's not the case.

174
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,241
But just a general preference, again, for indie gamers towards single player.

175
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,433
If you do go multiplayer, the mode that popped the most was online co-op.

176
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:12,137
That was more so than things like online PVP or local co-op.

177
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:22,143
In terms of graphics and art, there was a preference for stylized art styles with bright and bold colors.

178
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,646
2D or 3D were both good in these gamers' books.

179
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:30,409
If you do go 2D, the idea of it being hand-drawn was compelling to this audience.

180
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:41,984
And then in terms of audio, we saw that the music and the soundtrack can be a really big differentiator and was probably the most important thing over things like VO or sound effects.

181
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:52,195
Creativity and expression we saw in an earlier slide was something that popped when these gamers came to indie games specifically.

182
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:58,696
So any opportunities to build in expression, things like character customization will go a long way.

183
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:14,888
And then also having the ability to develop a unique play style and maybe approach a problem in a different way, not only a one-size-fits-all solution, but having the ability to figure things out in different ways resonates with this audience.

184
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,851
And then lastly, amount of content.

185
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,633
So we talked about it a little bit before.

186
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:30,598
There was a preference for a vast world to explore and longer play sessions as compared to shorter ones.

187
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:39,463
And then I realized there's a little bit of dissonance with this last point because I said earlier, amount of content is less important when you play indie games.

188
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:41,844
And now here we're saying, yeah, but can we have 20 to 100 hours?

189
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,526
of content.

190
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,469
So I am aware of the dissonance there.

191
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:52,113
To me, the way I read that is more content is always going to be a good thing.

192
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:55,335
No one's ever going to complain that your game is too long.

193
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:02,621
I think just the idea that it's not, it doesn't have to be an endless experience.

194
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,802
They want to focus on

195
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,527
those creativity, those innovative aspects, that's okay.

196
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:12,809
So content's still important, but it's not going to be the top determinant of someone playing your game.

197
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:28,716
All right, and the last section here is diving into a little bit more about how do they buy, so purchase habits and behaviors of indie buyers in each of the three groups.

198
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:44,895
So we did look at monetization models, lots of different monetization models, probably even more than we have listed here, but we did look at some of the more popular monetization models over the course of the last several years in gaming.

199
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:51,860
And not a huge surprise here, but people kind of had a preference for fully paid upfront games.

200
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:56,924
That preference was more pronounced with regular and light indie buyers.

201
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:11,181
But then free-to-play, we actually do see that the indie audience is okay with free-to-play, especially if it is cosmetic-only MTX or even Battle Pass or Season Pass.

202
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:21,268
Where you start to see a little bit more aversion is where you get into free-to-play, either with advertisements or with gameplay affecting microtransactions in the game.

203
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,172
And then purchase timing.

204
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:32,755
So I just stated that indie gamers do have a preference for fully paid games up front.

205
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:37,778
This is looking at when in the lifecycle of your game they are likely to purchase.

206
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:47,865
And you can see between regular and light indie buyers, they're actually less likely to purchase right at release as compared to traditional gamers.

207
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:54,469
And they're more likely to purchase during a future sale, whether it's an initial sale or a deep sale later on.

208
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:57,330
And I think there's a couple of reasons for that.

209
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,752
So first it goes back to how many games they're playing.

210
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,794
They have a ton of stuff and they physically can't play all of them at the same time.

211
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:07,435
So they're OK waiting a little bit more.

212
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:11,217
And then I think the second thing is price sensitivity.

213
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:17,840
We actually also asked about kind of if there's a sweet spot for pricing your game.

214
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:25,866
And certainly there are exceptions, but we did see between $15 and $25 US was kind of a sweet spot.

215
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:29,289
When you go below, there can be questions about quality of the game.

216
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,672
Although again, there's games that price below that that have done really well in their

217
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,352
Great games.

218
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:40,556
And then if you go above 25, we do see a little bit more of a focus on content.

219
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:44,538
So you're starting to compete with some of those double and triple A titles.

220
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:49,701
And so expectations around amount of content will go up as that price point does go up.

221
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:57,205
The last thing I want to mention on this slide is, you know, traditionally in the industry and certainly

222
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:03,128
jobs that I've had, there's been a lot of emphasis on launch, and very understandably so.

223
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:06,430
You want to do the best you can, come out of the gates as strong as possible.

224
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:26,444
I think this is nice to see this data because it does say that even if you come out of the gates a little bit slower than you had initially anticipated, there are still opportunities down the road to gain a bigger audience, especially if you're updating your game or continuing to improve your game.

225
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:30,386
Having that in conjunction with the sale can bring a lot of people in down the road.

226
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:38,499
And then lastly, I kind of want to look at a sample path to purchase.

227
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,262
This would be for an indie gamer buying on PC.

228
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:46,146
I know a lot of folks are PC-first or centric.

229
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:56,677
So we wanted to look at how do gamers discover games, how do they research them, and ultimately what makes them pull the trigger in terms of a purchase decision.

230
00:23:58,218 --> 00:23:59,658
First, where do you hear about a game?

231
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:01,979
YouTube, super influential.

232
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,339
We see Steam and Family and Friends.

233
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:13,942
And the one thing to call out too with Steam or really any first-party platform is there was a lot of discoverability when you partake in a platform sale.

234
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:23,904
So if it's a platform-wide sale or a theme sale, there's actually a lot of discovery that happens because players will kind of be looking for a specific genre and may stumble upon your game.

235
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:28,502
And then conducting research.

236
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:33,684
So I think anecdotally, a lot of us might have guessed that gamers like to see gameplay.

237
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:36,585
And it's nice to put a little data behind that.

238
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:47,769
But our research did kind of confirm that gameplay is really important when it comes to conducting research, as well as things like screenshots and official trailers.

239
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:55,914
And then lastly, when they actually decide to make the purchase, what is really impacting them?

240
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:58,095
Again, it goes back to gameplay.

241
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:07,500
I think if you're thinking about where do you want to spend marketing dollars, focusing on gameplay videos is always going to be a good choice to consider.

242
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:15,684
Sales and discounts we talked about on the last slide, but that's another great way to kind of convert people and get them over the hump.

243
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,270
And then lastly, player reviews.

244
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,353
I haven't mentioned it a ton yet, but quality is still really important.

245
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:36,361
And we did find that having evangelists and other players who are supporting your game and reviewing it highly, that can be a really influential factor for a purchase decision.

246
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:43,223
So those are kind of the big takeaways.

247
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:49,307
I do want to just quickly recap each of the three areas that we talked about just so you can kind of see the big points.

248
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,590
But indie buyers, who are they?

249
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,232
So gaming is a key part of their identity.

250
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:59,696
But they don't only play indie games, they actually play a ton of games.

251
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:08,643
And when they come to play indie games, they are looking for a different experience than what they might be looking for with AAA or AA.

252
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:17,371
They're looking for something that's more innovative, more creative, maybe takes more risks than you might typically see with those bigger titles.

253
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,799
And so to that point, don't be afraid to take a risk.

254
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:32,962
It doesn't have to be reinventing the wheel or revolutionizing an entire genre, but it could be focusing on one specific aspect, trying something new, putting your own twist on it.

255
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,723
Creative storytelling goes a really long way.

256
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:43,045
And it, again, does not have to be a super expensive cinematic or cut scene.

257
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:47,967
It can be building the world and lore in different unique styles.

258
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:52,456
And then lastly, those artistic touches can go a long way.

259
00:26:52,496 --> 00:27:02,505
We talked about some of the different art style choices, as well as that music and soundtrack that can really elevate a game and kind of tie the experience together for gamers.

260
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,050
And then purchase habits, so back to basics.

261
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,471
Fully paid, upfront games was the preference.

262
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:17,052
Free to play is becoming more and more acceptable, if done right.

263
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:32,135
And even though fully paid is kind of the gold standard for these folks, patience is still a virtue because they're playing lots of games and you still have the ability to get people into the funnel after your initial launch.

264
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:33,238
with me.

265
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,018
So that's all I had for you.

266
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,219
Thank you everyone for making it on a Friday.

267
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:55,002
I know it's been a long week, but I hope everyone has safe travels and just a couple of housekeeping things.

268
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:58,063
So one, I think you should have had your badge scanned on the way in.

269
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,565
Please let them know what you thought.

270
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:03,446
If it was terrible and you never want me to come back, that's okay.

271
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,247
You can tell them.

272
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,028
If it was good, you can also tell them that too.

273
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:08,549
So thanks everyone.

274
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:12,951
I don't think I have time for questions right now, but I will stick around outside in case anyone wants to chat.

275
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:17,437
so
