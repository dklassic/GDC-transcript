1
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:05,759
My name is Jeremy.

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:08,041
I'm a development manager at Riot Games.

3
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,464
I'm part of the champion team on League of Legends.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,527
Now League is a multiplayer competitive game

5
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,289
where players select a champion

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,491
and then duke it out five v five.

7
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:22,073
Today what I'm gonna share with you

8
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:23,815
is how we create those champions,

9
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:26,697
the kinds of challenges that we face as a team,

10
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,919
as well as some of the learnings

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,140
that we've had along the way.

12
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,853
And I just want to acknowledge right at the start,

13
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,116
30 minutes is a super short amount of time

14
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:36,956
to accomplish that.

15
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:39,739
So I'm going to move pretty fast,

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,762
but I'm going to do my best to save some time for Q&A

17
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:43,182
at the end.

18
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,005
And I also want to propose that this

19
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,827
can be the start of this conversation.

20
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,869
I'll leave my contact info up at the end.

21
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:50,970
If you guys want to keep talking,

22
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,813
I'm more than happy to after this presentation.

23
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:55,852
All right, so like I said,

24
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:57,453
I'm a member of the champion team.

25
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,114
Here's a recent photograph of us.

26
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:01,995
And when I look at this photo,

27
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:04,356
I think two things immediately.

28
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,256
One, I'm a terrible photographer

29
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,198
who can't get everybody into the frame

30
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,779
and everyone's blinded by the sun that they're looking at.

31
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,440
But I kid you not, this was literally the best photo

32
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,721
that I had out of dozens to review.

33
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,063
So that's as good as I got.

34
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:25,200
The second one is, it really just sort of strikes me

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,102
how lucky I am to be able to present this information

36
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:29,263
that I'm about to share with you.

37
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:32,965
I'm really honored to be the one to give this presentation

38
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,526
because this is not my work alone.

39
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,567
This is a work of many people.

40
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,328
So I just want to acknowledge that.

41
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:45,072
I think what we lack in our photogenic ability as a team,

42
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,633
we make up for in other ways.

43
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:52,184
And one way in particular is our dedication to our mission.

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,725
On Champion Team, our mission is to engage

45
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,686
and excite players with champions that deliver

46
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:01,107
innovative and resonant experiences.

47
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:04,668
I think innovative is pretty explanatory,

48
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,670
but I'm gonna spend a minute or two talking about

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,131
what we mean by resonant champions in just a moment.

50
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,521
And you know, this mission has changed over the years.

51
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,862
We haven't had this forever.

52
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:18,525
The needs of players have evolved.

53
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,687
The needs of our organization have evolved.

54
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:22,408
And so our mission has as well.

55
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,691
But something that stayed very consistent at Riot

56
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,434
is our desire to have empowered teams.

57
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,957
Empowered not just from a creative perspective,

58
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,679
but that's super important.

59
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,161
also empowered from a process perspective.

60
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,164
Basically, we believe that the best people

61
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,986
to figure out how to achieve this mission

62
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,268
is the team itself.

63
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:45,789
So that's what I'm gonna focus on today.

64
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:48,831
How does our production process sort of support us

65
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,092
in getting to this mission?

66
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,035
I'm not really gonna get into our creative process much

67
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:55,536
or our design thinking.

68
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,938
I wanna let you know if that's something

69
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,918
that you're interested in.

70
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,901
There's a talk tomorrow morning with Greg Street.

71
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,143
I think it's in North Hall, 10 a.m.

72
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,384
Definitely check that out.

73
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:08,125
He's design lead on League of Legends.

74
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,907
If that's something you're interested in, go see his talk.

75
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,906
On League right now, we have 134 champions.

76
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:21,114
And for players of League, investing time

77
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:23,577
on one of these champions is really meaningful.

78
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:24,859
It's a competitive game.

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,881
You're playing to win.

80
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:26,902
And so.

81
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:33,198
We really want to make sure that when players are committing their time and resources into a champion,

82
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:36,941
that we're giving them a really resonant experience back.

83
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:41,425
And that means from the first game that they play on a champion to their 300th,

84
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:48,211
we want that champion to have a deep and meaningful and fun and interesting experience for you.

85
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,907
And unfortunately, there's just no formula

86
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,107
to creating innovative and resonant champions.

87
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,588
I wish that was this presentation,

88
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,248
where I could be like, and here's the formula,

89
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,188
presentation over.

90
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,089
Unfortunately, not the case.

91
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,369
Here's a few champions that really resonate with me,

92
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,790
and that I personally really like.

93
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,130
But we have found that even though there's no formula,

94
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,411
you know, there are some things that really do help support

95
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,231
us in achieving our mission.

96
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,011
That's what I'm gonna talk about.

97
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,717
First, I want to share some of the challenges

98
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:19,739
that we have as a team.

99
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,964
And I think that these are challenges

100
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,048
that are pretty universal to our industry

101
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:27,171
and really to any creative team.

102
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,413
So as I go through these,

103
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,737
ask yourself if you've heard these before.

104
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:35,317
The first challenge is, are we there yet?

105
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,598
This sort of question on a team that bubbles up

106
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,479
from time to time of, do we have what we need

107
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:42,599
in order to move forward?

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,640
Do we know what done really looks like?

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,621
How long should we be brainstorming?

110
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,121
How long should we be in production?

111
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,702
And what this illustrated for us was that

112
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:55,363
we were lacking some clearly defined deliverables as a team.

113
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,124
And the second challenge that we face is,

114
00:04:58,644 --> 00:04:59,324
that'll never work.

115
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,510
So there are times when you do wanna hear that on a team.

116
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,985
Maybe you're trying to implement a new technical feature,

117
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,766
and so that's a great conversation to have,

118
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:10,807
if it's going to work or not.

119
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,568
There are times you don't want to have that conversation.

120
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:17,509
Maybe you're into brainstorming or in a really R&D mindset.

121
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,450
And what this illustrated to us is that, as a team,

122
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,572
we really wanted to be able to have a shared mindset.

123
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,252
Because one of our biggest challenges

124
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:30,394
is moving from an R&D mindset into a production or execution

125
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:30,834
mindset.

126
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,555
We're doing that constantly on Champion Team.

127
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,236
There are times when we have six champions in development

128
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,937
at once in different phases.

129
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:41,138
And so aligning on what we should be thinking about,

130
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,979
what kinds of conversations we should have,

131
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,840
was really important to us and a challenge

132
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,680
that we wanted to solve.

133
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,637
And finally, let's not do that again.

134
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:53,358
No matter how awesome a champion development process

135
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,418
we've had, there's always, I would say,

136
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:57,878
a dozen times at least where we do something

137
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,739
and we're like, man, can we not do that again?

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,539
We'd all sit down and we'd say, yeah,

139
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:02,679
we're not gonna do that again.

140
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,700
And inevitably, we would do it again.

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,900
And so what this illustrated to us

142
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,301
is that we lacked a sort of system

143
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,341
that helped us capture our current learnings

144
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,961
for our champions that would help us

145
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,862
for our future champions and really make sure

146
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,262
that we weren't making the same mistakes again.

147
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:22,224
we realized that these aren't the worst challenges

148
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:23,644
to have as a team, right?

149
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,945
But altogether, they were sort of sucking up

150
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,666
some creative energy on the team.

151
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,786
And that brings me to the first learning

152
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,027
that I want to share with you today,

153
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,968
which is, as a team, we discovered

154
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,389
that structure empowers creativity.

155
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:43,088
We are pretty wary of process on Champion Team,

156
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:44,349
and I think with good reason.

157
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,950
We don't want things to get in the way

158
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,612
of our creative process and being innovative.

159
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,715
But when the lack of structure starts sucking away

160
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,716
some of our energy from being creative

161
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,737
and into sort of like the process stuff,

162
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:58,598
that's where we sort of draw a line.

163
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,500
And so the question for us,

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,641
and this is where that asterisk comes in,

165
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,943
is really like how much structure and what kind?

166
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,960
Because what we found ultimately has worked best for us

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,442
as a team is defining a very basic framework

168
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:15,343
to operate from.

169
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,285
And this gives us like a foundation to stand on

170
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,226
so that we can focus our creative energy

171
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,707
on innovating on top of it.

172
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:26,030
So we realized we needed a framework.

173
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,532
And so we started to create one.

174
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:29,673
And here's how we did that.

175
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,022
As a team, we talked about what are the natural moments

176
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,984
in a champion's development life cycle.

177
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:38,325
There were some pretty natural sort of like beats

178
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,027
that we would go to, and we called these phases.

179
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,089
And then we asked ourselves, what are the right goals

180
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,970
to have during each of those phases?

181
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,752
And we wanted to create goals that felt crisp

182
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,714
and clear enough that we could say,

183
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:53,956
are we able to achieve this in order to move forward?

184
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:58,218
Finally, we created a list of all the components,

185
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:01,100
all the deliverables, all the things

186
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,543
that we're gonna go into achieving that goal.

187
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:06,686
And this is essentially our framework.

188
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:10,669
And if it looks simple, I'm glad it is super simple.

189
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,851
And that was one of our goals.

190
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,874
We wanted to make something that was easy to create,

191
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:18,937
easy to understand, and easy to update.

192
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:23,043
But as simple as it is, it's given us a ton of benefit.

193
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:24,503
And so I want to sort of highlight

194
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:25,544
what those benefits are.

195
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,805
The first for us is clarity.

196
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,526
We don't ask anymore as a team, are we there yet?

197
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,166
Because we know where we're at, and we

198
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,207
know what deliverables we still need to achieve,

199
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,487
and we know what our goals are.

200
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,388
The second benefit we've gotten from this is scalability.

201
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:46,137
As a team, we're now able to quickly align

202
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,859
on what mindset we're in and what phase of production

203
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,061
we're in, no matter which champion we're talking about.

204
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,903
And it's also helped us with our partner teams

205
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:54,844
outside of champion.

206
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,705
And I'll give you an example of what that looks

207
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,086
like in just a few minutes.

208
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,069
Finally, flexibility.

209
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,932
So because this is sort of a simple framework,

210
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,614
we're able to quickly update it, add deliverables,

211
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:11,137
remove deliverables when we're making a champion so that it

212
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,518
helps us for our future champions.

213
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,814
It's really the combination of all of these benefits

214
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,676
that's helped us become more creatively empowered as a team.

215
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:21,938
But it's also helped us become more autonomous,

216
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,320
which I think is like a nice side benefit.

217
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,782
You know, we're really able to hold ourselves accountable

218
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,724
to hitting these goals and to completing these deliverables

219
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,325
because we define them.

220
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:37,048
So here's what our framework looks like.

221
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,874
This is the Champion Framework,

222
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:43,318
and it's essentially a big list of everything we need,

223
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,100
when we need it, and why.

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,545
And I'm gonna take you through a case study

225
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,006
of one of our recent champions

226
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,769
that sort of walks us through

227
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:54,332
how we really use this framework.

228
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,402
And I have some examples of the deliverables

229
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:00,484
that we go after in each phase.

230
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,305
I'm not gonna talk about all the specifics.

231
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,666
In some of our phases, there are over 50 deliverables,

232
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:08,288
and it would just be too much detail

233
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,430
and really dry and take forever.

234
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,032
So, before we get into that case study,

235
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,573
I do wanna take you through the basics

236
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,255
of how we think about champions,

237
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,336
the sort of core of every champion.

238
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,818
Each champion has what we call DNA, which is the design,

239
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:30,321
the gameplay, narrative, the lore or personality,

240
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,383
and the art, the audiovisual experience.

241
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:36,765
And so the combination of all three of these elements

242
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:40,108
that create strong, resonant champions.

243
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:42,329
And when these are really, really unified,

244
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,571
when these elements really support each other,

245
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,752
we call that thematic cohesion.

246
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,562
And thematic cohesion is a really important ingredient

247
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,223
in achieving a champion that resonates with people.

248
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,585
Everything just sort of feels right,

249
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,946
from their gameplay, from their story, from their art.

250
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,669
And I said I wasn't gonna talk too much

251
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,909
about our creative process,

252
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,590
but I do wanna mention briefly that.

253
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,836
On our team, good ideas can come from any one of these angles.

254
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,477
We've had some great champion concepts start

255
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,698
with a gameplay mechanic pitch.

256
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,399
But we've also just as often have

257
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,900
started from an awesome sketch from an artist that

258
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,801
illustrates a champion we've never seen before.

259
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,482
Or from a short story from a writer

260
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,843
that takes us to a place in our universe we've never been.

261
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,559
And it's that kind of creative versatility

262
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,080
that's really important to us.

263
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,782
And so we needed a framework that had flexibility

264
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:37,883
as a core benefit.

265
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,486
All right, so I'd like to introduce to you

266
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:44,347
the case study that I'm gonna take you through.

267
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:48,370
This creepy, gorgeous fellow is Jin the Virtuoso.

268
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,011
He's one of our recent champions.

269
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,732
And I wanted to talk about Jin today

270
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:56,775
because he's a great example of being thematically cohesive.

271
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,817
And he's also resonant with players.

272
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:03,701
But also the framework that we built and that you just saw,

273
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,343
a lot of that was developed and informed

274
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:07,484
during Jin's development.

275
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:12,888
Before Jin was known as Jin, he had a code name internally.

276
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,509
And that code name was Deadeye.

277
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,272
So let's go all the way back to the beginning.

278
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,785
of our first phase that every champion goes through,

279
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:22,606
and we call this phase Discovery.

280
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,467
Here's some early sketches of what Deadeye look like

281
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:26,268
right at the beginning.

282
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,689
And our goal in Discovery is to create a pitch

283
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,271
that's clear and concise and gets the team really excited

284
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,512
about making this champion.

285
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,614
And the first thing we do in every champion's development,

286
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:39,974
our very first deliverable,

287
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,555
is called the Opportunity Space.

288
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,895
we found that it helps us creatively

289
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,337
to have some like guide rails up

290
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,640
as we're searching for that new, innovative champion DNA.

291
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,022
Having a specific place to start looking is really helpful.

292
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:57,705
And so the opportunity space we defined for Deadeye

293
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:00,608
was we knew we wanted to make a marksman champion.

294
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,309
This is a gameplay role.

295
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,132
We knew we wanted to deliver on a gameplay mechanic,

296
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:07,413
this fantasy of

297
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,594
long-range sniper, sharpshooter gameplay.

298
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,697
We have some champions that do this in League already,

299
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:16,359
but none that really excelled at it,

300
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,060
and so that felt like a good opportunity

301
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,001
for us to go after.

302
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,825
And third and finally, from a narrative perspective,

303
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:24,647
we wanted to make a champion

304
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,689
with a dark and sinister personality.

305
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,372
That's not something we had done in quite a while,

306
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,473
so we were excited about that.

307
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,667
And so through the discovery process,

308
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,971
the team is iterating and we're creating new ideas

309
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:38,112
and throwing out ideas.

310
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,534
And here's an example of one of the sketches

311
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,237
that we sort of aligned at at the end of the discovery phase.

312
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:45,219
And I wanna share with you the first pitch

313
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,100
that we had as a team.

314
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:50,674
Our pitch for Deadeye was, he's a mysterious, robotic,

315
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:53,796
bounty hunting, sniper, cowboy guy.

316
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,679
And I totally, in retrospect, see

317
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,442
how this is not a particularly clear nor concise pitch.

318
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,624
But our framework really helped us out here,

319
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:06,487
because it allowed us to say, hey, we all

320
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:09,349
are on the same page here in terms of our mindset

321
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:10,270
and what our goal is.

322
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,292
We know that we don't have to overwork this concept

323
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:13,632
right now.

324
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,676
We're all aligned that this is just our first draft,

325
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:18,458
and it did get us excited.

326
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,322
So we were able to move into our next phase of development,

327
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,904
which we call ideation.

328
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:28,031
And our goal in ideation is to take that concept,

329
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,115
refine it, but then also back it up

330
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:32,357
with an in-game prototype.

331
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,086
And we create these in-game prototypes

332
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,127
by sort of Frankensteining together old models

333
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,268
and abilities from previous champions

334
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:43,469
and visual effects and sound effects

335
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,210
and we cobble them together and we try to squint

336
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,871
and create a gameplay experience that we can say,

337
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:51,712
yes, this is fun, this is new, this is interesting.

338
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:54,313
We found there's just no substitute

339
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,533
for an in-game experience.

340
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,471
One of the ways that we really validate

341
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,492
and hold ourselves accountable to proving that

342
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:03,534
is that we have a deliverable in ideation

343
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,555
that we call pattern lock.

344
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:06,896
This is a design deliverable.

345
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,158
And pattern lock has a bunch of things in it,

346
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,799
but one of them that's really key

347
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,561
is this idea of identifying the strategic identity

348
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:15,342
of the champion.

349
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,304
Essentially, why would you bring Deadeye to a game

350
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:19,405
versus 133 other champions?

351
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:22,936
And we have to prove that out.

352
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,817
We also want to lock and understand deeply

353
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:28,497
three out of the five core abilities on that champion.

354
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,278
So we set a pretty high bar at this early stage

355
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,078
for making sure that we really understand

356
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,579
from a design perspective,

357
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,859
what's gonna make this champion fun, interesting.

358
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,740
A lot of our champions never make it out of ideation.

359
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,321
But Deadeye did.

360
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:45,441
And so we moved into our next phase,

361
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,182
which we call pre-production.

362
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,593
Pre-production is, I think, the hardest phase for us as a team.

363
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,175
And it's hard because we're sort of straddling

364
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,617
two different mindsets at the same time.

365
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,520
We're still in sort of an R&D phase in a lot of ways.

366
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,803
For example, you can see this blue proxy model.

367
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:08,465
This is a quick model that we create and put in the game

368
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,948
based on concept art that helps us get a sense of the silhouette

369
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:13,409
and the overall shape.

370
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,250
And we're making them taller and shorter

371
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,693
and changing all sorts of things to get the right feel.

372
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,295
But we're also in kind of a production and execution

373
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,296
point of view as well.

374
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:26,318
And you can see that in the middle concept image

375
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,079
where we're really trying to refine

376
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,261
explicit details on the costuming

377
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,362
and really lock down some decisions there.

378
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,899
And our goal here is to come out of pre-production

379
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,442
with a really clear pitch and plan

380
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,084
for how we're gonna build this character

381
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:44,786
in our next phase, which is production.

382
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,489
And because this phase is so difficult for us,

383
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,751
we have a lot of interim deliverables

384
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,273
that we've created along the way as a way of sort of helping.

385
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,895
And this helps us keep moving forward,

386
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,136
making sure we're on the right track.

387
00:16:58,423 --> 00:16:59,824
And before we get into production, though,

388
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,706
I want to share with you our final pitch for Deadeye.

389
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,589
I literally copied this out of an old PowerPoint

390
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:07,129
that I found.

391
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,432
We have a log line, which is Deadeye

392
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,473
is a mysterious Ionian drifter.

393
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,095
We've got a mission statement.

394
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,077
We've got these things that we call pillars, three pillars.

395
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,959
These are creative touchstones that we

396
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,582
use on the team to help us understand what's in

397
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,043
and what's out on the champion.

398
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:29,037
The three pillars that we had for Deadeye

399
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:29,978
are artist and killer.

400
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:34,562
So this is the sense that like he sees beauty in death.

401
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:36,463
That's a core part of his character.

402
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:38,325
Deliberate action.

403
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:43,129
Deadeye is super precise and explicit and specific

404
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,451
with what he wants to do.

405
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:46,713
And we wanted to really sell that

406
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:48,594
and make sure that that came through in his gameplay.

407
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,698
Finally, the lie.

408
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,919
This helped us understand his motivation

409
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,740
and what kind of personality he has.

410
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,300
Why does he wear a mask?

411
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,801
What's underneath that mask?

412
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,022
And it's the combination of all of these deliverables

413
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,542
together that helps the team align

414
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,003
on what we're trying to make.

415
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:09,204
I think ultimately what we ended up making for Deadeye

416
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:12,845
or for Jin was a character that really excelled

417
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,706
at this idea of a deliberate artisan killer.

418
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,341
But we couldn't get to that level of specificity right away.

419
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,481
We have to build alignment and understanding.

420
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,502
And to do that, that takes a lot of work.

421
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:26,583
There's these deliverables here,

422
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:28,083
but there's many others as well.

423
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,244
And that brings me to the second learning that we've had

424
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,405
that I wanna share with you now.

425
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:39,589
which is that for us, our hardest work is before production.

426
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,732
And in a way, we have our framework, ironically,

427
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:43,873
to blame for this.

428
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:47,917
You know, we've front-loaded more and more of our work

429
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:50,499
and more of our deliverables before we get into production.

430
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,343
Over the years, we've learned that the later we make changes

431
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,664
and the later we do some things,

432
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:58,006
the costlier and more painful it becomes,

433
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:00,629
especially when we start building final assets.

434
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:05,083
And so because those changes become exponentially harder,

435
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,384
we've decided as a team that we want

436
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,385
to invest in tackling these things early.

437
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,547
Our average champion production schedule is nine months.

438
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,128
And that's just on average.

439
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,369
And so for a lot of our champions,

440
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,430
before we ever make a final asset,

441
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,352
it can be five months in previous phases.

442
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:26,314
And we found that that actually has a lot of value for us.

443
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:30,396
All right, so let's get into production.

444
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,270
Production is not easy.

445
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,611
I know that I said our hardest work was before this.

446
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,133
Production's an exciting time.

447
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,074
Everyone's working on different assets,

448
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,454
we're integrating them all together,

449
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,595
we're seeing how they feel,

450
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:47,056
and inevitably there's some changes that we wanna make.

451
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,997
But because we've done some due diligence before this,

452
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,078
we can usually roll with those changes

453
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:53,739
without impacting our overall schedule.

454
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,517
And ultimately, our goal for production

455
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,098
is to get the champion in a content-complete state

456
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,319
with enough polish that we can start videotaping

457
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,740
and creating video content to show players.

458
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,681
And we do this because we want to engage and excite

459
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,241
our players with new champion content.

460
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,922
But we also want to release this content

461
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,943
before the champion comes out so that players

462
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,284
can get an understanding of what's coming

463
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,524
and what are the abilities here.

464
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,634
I wanna share with you one of the new features

465
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,135
that we needed to build for Jin.

466
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,658
We needed to create a new UI HUD element.

467
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:31,661
A core part of Jin's gameplay is that he has four shots,

468
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:34,523
and then he needs to take a pause and reload.

469
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,385
We needed to be able to communicate this mechanic

470
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,986
to players in a really clear way.

471
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:42,689
Unfortunately, we don't have any interface designers

472
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,671
on the champion team, or anyone that was like,

473
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,612
really that skill set.

474
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,814
And so we had to partner with another team,

475
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,736
and this is where that scalability thing comes into play

476
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:52,817
that I was talking about earlier.

477
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:56,680
Our framework really helped create an easy partnership

478
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,222
with our other team, because we were able to say,

479
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:00,723
hey, here's where we're at with Jin,

480
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,144
here are the goals that we have,

481
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,486
here are the deliverables that we need along the way,

482
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:05,947
how can we partner with you

483
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,929
and add your deliverables into this process?

484
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,772
And it's awesome that this helps us work and align

485
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,892
with other teams as well.

486
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:15,213
And as a result, our newer champions

487
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:17,514
have more new features than ever before.

488
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,376
So we move into our next stage from production,

489
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,656
which is post-production.

490
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,372
This is when we released the champion.

491
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:29,354
And I think in order to really explain how this works,

492
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,395
I should tell you a little bit about how League of Legends

493
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,157
delivers new content to players.

494
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:37,259
So we try to release a new patch of content

495
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,840
every two weeks worldwide.

496
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:41,442
But before that patch goes wide,

497
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,684
we upload it to our PBE or public beta server.

498
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:48,287
And players can play the PBE server and give us feedback.

499
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:51,949
And so for us on Champion Team, releasing a champion

500
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:53,611
isn't like a singular moment in time.

501
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,633
It's actually the process of many weeks.

502
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,337
And we're taking feedback.

503
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,841
And one of our biggest goals is to release the champion

504
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:04,884
in a healthy, awesome state, and definitely in a balanced state.

505
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,567
And so I apologize.

506
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,570
Let's get up some of this content.

507
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:15,286
So we've created what we call a balance mitigation plan.

508
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:19,150
This plan has a bunch of different balance outcomes

509
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,092
and scenarios that can come to pass

510
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,695
and all of the things that we're gonna do to address those.

511
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,618
Now those balance concerns really often never come,

512
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,922
but we found that it has helped us do that exercise

513
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,584
that if something does happen,

514
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,706
we're able to quickly react to it.

515
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:37,820
And if you play League, you may challenge me

516
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,707
on Jin's balance currently, and I encourage you

517
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:43,314
to give that feedback directly to Greg Street tomorrow

518
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:44,196
if you go to his talk.

519
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,806
So after post-production, we're in our final phase.

520
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,267
This is called sustain.

521
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,207
And this is where Jhin currently is,

522
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:56,808
and all 134 of our champions live.

523
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,589
And we have some clear deliverables at this phase.

524
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,490
You know, we archive all of our development assets,

525
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,671
we set up some partnerships with our other teams

526
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:06,791
in League of Legends,

527
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:08,552
and how we're gonna support Jhin in the future.

528
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:12,353
And we hold project retrospectives with the team.

529
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,740
But overall, we're really still trying

530
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,381
to figure out a good goal and good deliverables here.

531
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:21,222
And that leads me to the final learning that I want

532
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:22,163
to share with you all today.

533
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:25,184
And that's our framework's never done,

534
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:27,005
and it always needs improvement.

535
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:28,985
And if you create something like this,

536
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:32,827
I'm betting yours will also be in this situation.

537
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,068
But ultimately, that's OK.

538
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:39,590
This framework is cheap to iterate on, cheap to create,

539
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,391
and it encourages that constant iteration.

540
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:47,259
And what we found as a team is that the more that we work on this,

541
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,940
the more we get benefits like scalability and clarity.

542
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:57,842
And it gives us a stronger and stronger foundation of which to stand on as a team,

543
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:02,523
which in turn has given us more and more of creative energy

544
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:09,145
to focus on delivering innovative and resonant champions to League of Legends players.

545
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:13,634
I want to thank you all so, so much for coming to this talk

546
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:14,814
and for your time.

547
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,397
Thank you.

548
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:23,737
That's my Twitter.

549
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:26,298
If you want to send me tips on how to take better team photos

550
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:29,459
or give me feedback or continue talking about this,

551
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,779
please feel free.

552
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,401
And I think we've got five minutes for Q&A.

553
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:37,651
So I apologize, I can't really see you, but go ahead.

554
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:37,851
Hello.

555
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:38,352
Hi.

556
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,955
So I have a question about your framework.

557
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:42,477
You mentioned the different phases.

558
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:44,961
And I wanted to know if they are time-boxed,

559
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:48,105
like you have a specific time to reach these phases,

560
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,748
or it's more like you iterate until.

561
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,549
you're ready to go to the next phase?

562
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:53,269
That's a good question.

563
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,230
So the question was, do we have a time box

564
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,331
on each of these phases?

565
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,371
And the answer is, kind of.

566
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,432
We have some best practices that we found over the years

567
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:05,693
of like, it should take us about this amount of time

568
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,274
in discovery and about this amount of time in ideation

569
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:08,834
and so forth.

570
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,575
But these are just guidelines.

571
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,096
We've had, I would say all of our champions

572
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:16,217
have broken some of those guidelines at some point.

573
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:19,158
And we just use that as a way of kind of gut checking ourselves

574
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:19,738
where we're at.

575
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:20,844
Thank you.

576
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,545
Question over here.

577
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:27,366
What's your rate of atrophy between these different phases?

578
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,446
Like you sort of said, a lot of champions

579
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,127
don't make it to the next step.

580
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,647
How much are getting lost along the way at each of those steps

581
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:35,047
roughly?

582
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:35,728
Yeah.

583
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:36,748
A lot.

584
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:40,029
So it's kind of hard to keep track of that data specifically.

585
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,489
I will say that we cycle and churn through stuff

586
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,550
in discovery pretty frequently.

587
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,930
And we have this concept that we call iceboxing.

588
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:50,856
So if a champion isn't moving forward and not getting

589
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:53,256
traction, we put it in the icebox,

590
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:56,897
which means we've got a kind of backlog collection of concepts

591
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,337
that we can pull from in the future.

592
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,418
But are you losing them later steps also?

593
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,179
Or once they reach a certain point,

594
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,399
do they always go all the way through?

595
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:08,560
It's pretty unusual that we lose a champion after ideation.

596
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,021
And the main reason for that is because we

597
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,001
have some really hardcore design deliverables in there,

598
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:15,582
like pattern lock.

599
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:16,402
Thanks.

600
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:17,202
Yeah, take care.

601
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:19,029
Hi there, thank you.

602
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,315
I just wanted to ask, regarding champion reworks,

603
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:24,800
do you happen to find yourself starting at earlier points

604
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:27,165
in the process, or do you tend to get a little bit

605
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,228
of a head start due to that?

606
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:30,606
Is that the question?

607
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,407
Oh, great.

608
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:31,707
OK.

609
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,049
So the question was about Champion Reworks,

610
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:35,730
and do we use the same framework?

611
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,272
So was that the question?

612
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:39,793
More or less, yeah.

613
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:44,436
So Champion Updates is actually a sister team, a partner team

614
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:45,317
to Champion.

615
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,920
They use a similar process, but not exactly this framework.

616
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,603
There are a lot of similarities for how we work on the teams,

617
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:56,345
but I don't want to try to give specifics on their process.

618
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:57,486
Thank you.

619
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:01,473
He might have already answered my question,

620
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:02,954
or you might have already just answered my question.

621
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:05,815
But so you guys don't handle the maintaining of the champions?

622
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:07,036
That's another team that does that?

623
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,779
So the question is, do we handle maintaining the champions

624
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:12,039
or not?

625
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,380
It depends on your definition of maintaining.

626
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,602
So we have a responsibility and a commitment

627
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:19,243
to players and to our organization

628
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:22,965
that we will continuously take care of our champions.

629
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:25,807
And so when bugs come up or certain issues,

630
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:28,068
the champion team is accountable for making

631
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:28,708
sure they're resolved.

632
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:34,012
There are other teams within the League of Legends organization

633
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,535
that look at things like visual game updates for their large

634
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:41,698
scale reworks, as well as specific balance passes.

635
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,740
We do things like roster updates.

636
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,942
Essentially, there's a lot of teams working on champions,

637
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:48,563
and we're just one of them.

638
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,666
Okay, and how do you handle scaling out?

639
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,469
So obviously the more champions you have,

640
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:54,552
the harder it gets to actually handle

641
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,413
all of these different things.

642
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,597
So how do you handle scaling out your team?

643
00:27:57,637 --> 00:28:00,241
Do you just grow exponentially the more champions you have?

644
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,782
OK, so the question is, how do we scale?

645
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:06,883
Or what are the challenges around scaling as the more

646
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:07,724
champions that we have?

647
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:12,045
I think that that kind of gets at the heart of the challenges

648
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,086
that we have around our current sustain phase.

649
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:16,127
The more champions that we have, the more

650
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,708
we need to just double down on our commitment

651
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:19,809
to maintaining them.

652
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,370
We are still trying to figure that out.

653
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,651
Thank you.

654
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:25,311
Yeah, thank you.

655
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:32,739
I've noticed that some champions come out with these really elaborate videos and, you

656
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,642
know, comics and all that kind of things, and other champions kind of just come out.

657
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:43,528
Is that considered as part of the design process, to say, you know, this champion needs this

658
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:47,572
video to kind of explain their lore so you understand them, or is that kind of added

659
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:48,513
later in the process?

660
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:54,293
The question was, you know, how do, how does the sort of like supplementary and then sort

661
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:57,720
of promotional content work for releasing new champions?

662
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,100
It's, my response is, I feel like gonna be long-winded,

663
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,241
but I'm gonna try to just cut to the chase,

664
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,842
which is there's another partner team that we have,

665
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,662
Champion Publishing, that partners really early with us,

666
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,403
and like how can we best tell players

667
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,504
the story of who this champion is,

668
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:17,365
and is the most effective tool to do that a comic,

669
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,906
or is it a video, or is it an interactive website,

670
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,246
or Easter eggs, or stories?

671
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,887
We're always like trying to innovate

672
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,107
and think of new things to do there.

673
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,610
So the process starts really early,

674
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,816
and we partner with another team on that all the way.

675
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,957
All right, thank you.

676
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:33,358
Thanks.

677
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:36,442
All right, I think we're at time.

678
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,086
Thank you guys so much for coming today,

679
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,549
and please hit me up if you have any other questions.

680
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,551
Thank you.
