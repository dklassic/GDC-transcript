1
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,357
The next session is still grooving,

2
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:09,077
game dev life set to live music.

3
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:10,638
Please welcome Teddy, Daniel, and Ben.

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:10,738
Ben.

5
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:10,798
Ben.

6
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:10,858
Ben.

7
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:10,938
Ben.

8
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,118
Ben.

9
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:11,979
Ben.

10
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:12,419
Ben.

11
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:12,759
Ben.

12
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:12,819
Ben.

13
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:12,919
Ben.

14
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,079
Ben.

15
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:13,399
Ben.

16
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:13,559
Ben.

17
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:13,860
Ben.

18
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,060
Ben.

19
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,200
Ben.

20
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,260
Ben.

21
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,380
Ben.

22
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,480
Ben.

23
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,900
Ben.

24
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,080
Ben.

25
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,420
Ben.

26
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,161
Ben.

27
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,861
Ben.

28
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:24,524
Ben.

29
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:24,845
Ben.

30
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,753
The textures are fucked.

31
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:36,853
What?

32
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,715
The textures are fucked.

33
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:43,559
These are not words you want to hear an hour before your game releases,

34
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,379
but here we are,

35
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,881
at Glitch City, Los Angeles,

36
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,763
an indie co-op studio,

37
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,064
11pm, March 30th, 2016.

38
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:54,508
The night we release Hyper Light Drifter

39
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:56,129
to 24,000 Kickstarter backers

40
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,152
and the rest of the world.

41
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,513
And the textures, they're fucked.

42
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:07,094
My fellow designer and coder Bo Blythe has been making a build, the final version of the game for release.

43
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:09,415
But Bo has been trying to make a build all day.

44
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:14,496
The thing about developing a game for three years is that your game gets big.

45
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,437
Ours did. So big in fact that it got too fat for Game Maker,

46
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:22,078
the otherwise great 2D game engine we used to make Hyper Light Drifter.

47
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,071
For reasons we don't understand, sometimes when we build the game, some sprites go missing.

48
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,332
They're gone.

49
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,452
Shrug.

50
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:34,794
So we just press the build button again, wait 20 minutes, and we pray.

51
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:40,256
This is a talk about prayer in game development.

52
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:47,138
Hi, I'm Teddy, toddy doof deef, professional gamesman from indie game Hyperlight Drifter,

53
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,999
now a creative director at NotIndie Square Enix Montreal.

54
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,654
And I'm fucking with you, this is not a prayer talk.

55
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,615
But it is about game development.

56
00:01:56,615 --> 00:02:00,816
The beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega of projects.

57
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,317
How and why we make them.

58
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:08,859
Next to me is Daniel Rosenfeld, C418, musician and composer of Minecraft.

59
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:12,600
On my other side, artist and developer Ben Swindon.

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,061
Tonight, as we try to make a build, Hyper Light is at an end.

61
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,530
Finishing games is the hardest part of making them.

62
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,611
Taking a project to completion sucks.

63
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,672
Making menus, beating bugs, exploring the edges

64
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,392
of your design, and then wrapping it all up

65
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:27,872
in a play-tested package.

66
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:31,933
If you're worried about those textures of ours, don't be.

67
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,394
While I was introducing myself,

68
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:38,115
the next build that Bo built worked just before midnight.

69
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,676
We have our game, 1.0, but it's 3 a.m. now,

70
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:43,277
and we still haven't clicked the magic button to release.

71
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:49,025
We're waiting for an inexplicably slow upload to finish to a partner's FTP,

72
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:53,207
and we can't contractually launch on Steam until it's done.

73
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:53,768
So we're waiting.

74
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:58,410
Three years of game development, climaxing in an upload progress bar.

75
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,491
How did this happen?

76
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,392
We're three hours late, and our backers are tweeting.

77
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:01,772
Fuck.

78
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:02,392
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

79
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,013
Why is it so tight?

80
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:05,174
Well, it's always tight, isn't it?

81
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:08,396
When you make a schedule for your game,

82
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,737
you fill that schedule with the things you want to put into it,

83
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,238
because you will always want more things than you can have.

84
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:17,972
So you just accept that, set a release date, and work backwards.

85
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,333
A lot of things at the end are polish.

86
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,395
Polish is complicated. Yo, let's talk about it.

87
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:27,017
Polish is not always the right priority.

88
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,519
We love polish in games because it makes them shine.

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,362
Playtesting to refine clarity and maintain a flow state for players.

90
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:36,484
Fixing game-breaking bugs to avoid frustrating crashes.

91
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:39,566
Iterating on art so that it's at the peak of your craft that you're able to achieve.

92
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,447
Those are all good things, right?

93
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:49,213
And usually the sign of a game that was planned poorly is glaring lack of polish because they ran out of time.

94
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:55,097
It looks cheap or glitchy, or the online servers crash, or the difficulty curve has frustrating spikes, or you can get stuck.

95
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,980
Here are a list of games that some of those apply to.

96
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,922
Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Hyper Light Drifter.

97
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:05,205
Respectively, they were glitchy, glitchy, and you can get stuck.

98
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,527
But people kinda like those games.

99
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,088
Maybe not the last one as much.

100
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,738
Here's the truth, you pick your battles.

101
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,801
Just like you can't add every feature, you can't perfect all the polish.

102
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,764
And I'm a proponent of less polish, more love.

103
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,645
Not no polish!

104
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,246
Sloppy craft is bad craft.

105
00:04:21,246 --> 00:04:26,291
Playtest, fix, refine, but keep an eye on what you're giving up with every little piece you polish.

106
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,413
Leave room for the love.

107
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,135
The love, as I call it, is the little things.

108
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:35,744
touches you want to add for years of production, but you've never had time.

109
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:38,965
And you won't, unless you take time. There came a moment in our final month when I

110
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:43,806
had to choose between fixing a rare bug and finally building the Dash Challenge,

111
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:47,428
a little mini-game inspired by Super Mario RPG that I'd wanted to put in our

112
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:51,829
game since the beginning. So guess what? The bug stayed and I made the challenge,

113
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:56,391
and it's the single piece of our game I hear the most about from fans.

114
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,892
Some hate it, some love it, some love to hate it, but they remember it, and no one

115
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,012
has mentioned that bug.

116
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,078
Trade polish for love.

117
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:06,080
That's what your players will remember.

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,603
And what they remember is all that matters.

119
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,344
Shortly after this polish rant began,

120
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,105
our 3 a.m. upload finished.

121
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,547
Our friends from Glitch City have stayed

122
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,629
way past midnight in solidarity,

123
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,210
silent support of our Panic production.

124
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,953
We call Casey Hunt, our wayward teammate,

125
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:24,074
to get him on the phone for the big moment.

126
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,796
Everyone in the studio gathers around

127
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:28,938
as Alex Preston, our leader, prepares to push publish.

128
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,080
Button pushed!

129
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,605
Everyone hugs and takes selfies.

130
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,286
Well, everyone hugs and I take selfies.

131
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:38,226
Bottles of booze appear like magic,

132
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,587
and with an indescribable release of tension,

133
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:41,867
we pop champagne.

134
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:41,967
Pop!

135
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:47,668
It comes bubbling out onto a poolside deck

136
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:48,769
one month later.

137
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,949
The location changed, but the people remain the same.

138
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,630
I've told all my friends I'm leaving Los Angeles

139
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,070
to go to Square Enix.

140
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,291
To say goodbye, I've invited them to a Palm Springs Airbnb

141
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,092
to drink, talk, swim, and drink.

142
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:05,451
The sun shines through palm trees on pool chairs filled with game developers,

143
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,757
the brilliant and loving people I've called friends for seven years.

144
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,479
I'm still.

145
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,806
Usually I'm an explorer, I'm thirsty for the new, new places, people, projects, and perspectives,

146
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:20,631
but as a side effect, I have a hard time appreciating the present.

147
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:24,451
But in this champagne moment, I'm glad I'm doing just that.

148
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,232
New is good, but new is shallow.

149
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:30,353
Along this poolside, I'm surrounded by people I love, trust, and lean on.

150
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:34,773
It takes time to wade into the deep end of person.

151
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:35,053
Wink.

152
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:38,934
That was a sex joke.

153
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:42,315
Two years ago at GDC, I rejected the term work-life balance.

154
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:42,675
Still do.

155
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,775
Work and non-work life can both be restful,

156
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,756
but I think that what we mean by this is that we need variety.

157
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,061
Making things and consuming action and inaction

158
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:56,843
Like your life your games need this balance of depth and variety for hyper light

159
00:06:56,843 --> 00:07:02,205
We spent the first half of production on depth the core combat dashing slashing guns

160
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:06,687
We wanted to nail that before building the drifters world

161
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,968
But while the depth of hyper lights core mechanics is crucial

162
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:16,130
That's not the heart of the game and I've come to distrust the term core mechanics. We're gonna talk about it

163
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:22,514
This term has its uses. In building a game, it's important to understand your primary interactions.

164
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,438
Your core mechanics are the ones around which your variety will be based.

165
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,641
They're the source of depth.

166
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:30,084
But, in practice, I find it misleading.

167
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:33,729
Core mechanic implies that it's the core of your whole game, and often it's not.

168
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,381
We promised a preview of Hyper Light Drifter to our Kickstarter backers,

169
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,843
and one year after the campaign, we were preparing to deliver that demo,

170
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:45,405
but as we approached our release date for the preview, we realized...

171
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,466
we had deep core mechanics, but a shallow core.

172
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,987
We looked at our Kickstarter video, and then the demo we'd made,

173
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:52,889
and we didn't see the connection.

174
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,190
Yes, our core mechanics are combat, but looking at that video,

175
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,771
you see the true core of our game is the world.

176
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:01,313
The feeling of being that drifter, the empty spaces, haunting tones,

177
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,914
and ruined, forgotten depths.

178
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,775
So we delayed the preview a week.

179
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:09,716
put our heads back down, and developed the variety of moments that would enrich our world

180
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,736
and form our real core.

181
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,457
Alex spent time on environmental set pieces to enrich the world to give it the history

182
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:18,578
it begged for, to suggest a purpose to all that killing and dashing.

183
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:23,720
And don't get me wrong, we designed the Drifter's combat with the character and the message

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,040
in mind.

185
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Powerful.

186
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,620
Fragile.

187
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,020
Medicated.

188
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:31,323
Core mechanics are important and should serve your larger theme, but don't confuse them

189
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,244
for the true core of your experience.

190
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:37,386
They are the bedrock, the foundation on which you build the game, but people stand on a

191
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:40,968
foundation and look up at the flying buttresses.

192
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,009
Only you will know the work you put into making that floor sturdy and level.

193
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,230
They'll remember the buttresses.

194
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,172
I'll remember this.

195
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:49,632
Poolside.

196
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,452
Champagne.

197
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:51,113
Friends.

198
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,394
Hours from my desk and my laptop.

199
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:53,954
Friends.

200
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:55,955
Gathered in sun-shielding cabana.

201
00:08:56,738 --> 00:09:01,422
We're doodling Earthworm Jim from memory to test who best remembers the 90s.

202
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,944
FYI, Brendan Chung draws a brilliant Earthworm Jim.

203
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:11,069
The most important thing I've learned since releasing Hyper Light Drifter is not the value of rest, but the value of focus.

204
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:15,653
I'm all over the place, I'm always working on separate projects, I bet you are too.

205
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:20,041
You can do a lot of things. You can explore. You can get that variety.

206
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,462
But you can only get one thing at a time.

207
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,403
So when you work, work. When you rest, rest.

208
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:27,764
When you party, party.

209
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:29,525
I say it once a month and I forget it once a month.

210
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,046
Put your phone on do not disturb.

211
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:35,128
The people I respect most for their productivity have their phone mooned 24-7.

212
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:41,591
A few weeks after this Palm Springs doodling, I will move to Montreal and begin my next game.

213
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:44,192
I did not rest between Hyperlite and Square Enix.

214
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,633
Not enough. I know that.

215
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,570
It was a choice I consciously made and had to suffer the consequences of,

216
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,092
but at least I did that with full knowledge of the sacrifice, and when I did rest, I rested.

217
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:59,754
As we get ready to sketch our various interpretations of Sonic the Hedgehog,

218
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:05,236
I feel a sudden pang of regret and melancholy. I pull out my phone and send a text to a friend

219
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:08,877
whom I haven't seen in months. There has been a rift between us that needs un-rifting.

220
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:13,567
We exchange a few emotional messages before I decide to resume my focus.

221
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm here with these friends, in this place, one thing at a time, Teddy.

222
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,433
I tear myself away, put the phone down and look up at an unfamiliar sky,

223
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,093
half-filled by a Canadian mountain.

224
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:32,535
Two months, countless goodbye tears, coffees and drinks have gone by.

225
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:35,837
I'm in Montreal, at a table in a lounge at Square Enix,

226
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:39,378
looking out the window as I hunch over a Muji B6 notebook.

227
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,883
Gone are my nights of Hyper Light bug fixing and release marketing. I'm back at the beginning.

228
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:49,906
A blank page and the hunger to put a new game concept onto it. I've been sitting at this table

229
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:55,530
a few hours a day just writing, working through thoughts, ideas, purpose. Did I say finishing

230
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,732
things was the hardest part of making them? Fuck finishing, starting things is the hardest.

231
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,315
At the end, you're so good at making that game, it comes naturally.

232
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:05,196
I'm a professional Hyper Light drifter maker.

233
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,283
But at a new beginning, it's all new.

234
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:10,743
I'm a rookie again, no idea what I'm doing,

235
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,863
and it's even worse because I know what it feels like

236
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:14,604
to know what I'm doing.

237
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,284
To fill a blank page with the right project

238
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,865
is to fill 100 pages with the wrong projects.

239
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,985
You splash your palette of life experiences,

240
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,945
cultural references, and personal taste

241
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,706
onto a canvas in different combinations,

242
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,606
hoping they result in the image of a game idea

243
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,506
that's new, that means something to you,

244
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,667
that is worth putting out to the world,

245
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,027
begging for the time and attention of thousands of people.

246
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,530
Speaking of thousands of people,

247
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,631
I run into a lot of friends who say,

248
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,771
hey, congratulations on Hyper Light Drifter.

249
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:45,533
I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, I'm sorry.

250
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,153
And I always respond, don't worry about it.

251
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:48,854
There are so many games to play.

252
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:53,256
Like too many, really, we should all just stop making them.

253
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:56,177
And I'm joking, but there's a lot of art out there.

254
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,378
If you make a game, you release that game,

255
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:01,779
and if the impossible dream happens and you're a success,

256
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,681
you'll be providing more lifetime to the world

257
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,601
than you took from it.

258
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,488
Hey, let's do math.

259
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:10,869
Nine of us made Hyper Light Drifter.

260
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:14,251
Let's average our time commitment at three years each

261
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,491
and account for weekends off.

262
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:19,974
That's 19 years spent making Hyper Light Drifter.

263
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,835
If you use public data from Steam Spy,

264
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:25,517
you'll learn that people have spent 387 years

265
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:28,419
playing Hyper Light Drifter.

266
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,839
That's a 20 times multiplier.

267
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,281
That's a sick combo and that's eye opening to me.

268
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:37,998
When you dream of having a successful game, you're asking for so much responsibility.

269
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:42,900
As game developers, it's easy to disregard our own profession when we look at friends,

270
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,722
siblings, heroes who spend their days fighting political injustice, healing the sick, or

271
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:48,983
teaching children.

272
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:52,284
Because we don't save lives, but I think we provide life.

273
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:56,666
Not all of life, hey, don't spend your whole life playing games, and don't encourage others

274
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:01,248
to, we all know that, but still, we play a part in filling the lives of the world.

275
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,226
So how do you want to fill them?

276
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:07,407
I can't tell you how to come up with ideas, I can't even tell myself, but I can tell you

277
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,248
how I filter ideas.

278
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:14,070
As I sit in Square Enix, headphones on, caffeine in my blood, I evaluate ideas through two

279
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,790
lenses.

280
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,430
Lens one.

281
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,969
What experience does this provide to the lives of others?

282
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:24,294
And do I want to be responsible for a 20x multiplier on time spent in that pursuit?

283
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:29,178
Your game doesn't have to be about love or faith or politics, it can be joyful, simple, fun.

284
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,620
But you choose what type of fun.

285
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,923
That's your impact on the world, your responsibility to your players.

286
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:35,132
Lens 2.

287
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,755
What will this express of my life, my tastes,

288
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:40,376
and those of my teammates?

289
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:43,257
After all, each teammate puts a lot of life into a game.

290
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,739
One of our teammates moved to Montreal from France

291
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:46,999
to work on the game.

292
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,682
Another from New York for a concept that I chose.

293
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,043
There's more to their lives than our daily game dev,

294
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,504
but still, that's a responsibility to yourself

295
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:58,006
and to your team.

296
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,287
My first new teammate is Renaud Bedard,

297
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,288
joyful programmer from Fez and below.

298
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:07,388
He visits my window-side table, waves in the corner of my eye with a friendly greeting

299
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,528
to let me know the latest iteration of our prototype is ready.

300
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:17,430
I tell him I'll be right there, and turn back to my view of the mountain.

301
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,971
Sun has hit the horizon now, and I stare into a blinding god ray.

302
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:26,392
The light sweeps mercifully out of my eyes, music pumps through high-mounted speakers,

303
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:32,553
artificial fog fills the room, the fanfare of the Game Awards is in full effect.

304
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:32,913
Whoa.

305
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,667
Another Vonnegut time jump, cool.

306
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,649
Great GDC talk, Teddy.

307
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,650
Thanks, man.

308
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,330
Keep going, though.

309
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,371
Okay.

310
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:45,253
More months fly by, and I'm sitting

311
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,975
in a Los Angeles theater for the Game Awards.

312
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:51,098
It's surreal, and I and my hyperlight buds sit in a row,

313
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,240
nominated for two awards next to incredible games

314
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,241
like Firewatch, Inside, and Uncharted 4.

315
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:58,344
As a trailer for another world premiere

316
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,906
booms through the dark theater, I ponder awards.

317
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:08,557
Awards. Man, I've had a lot of time to think about award nominations because they didn't come at the end.

318
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:12,681
They didn't come as a climax to our years of production that came months later,

319
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,224
when I'm trying to move on, and the rush is gone.

320
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:19,187
I'm at that new beginning, trying to move forward and avoid the shadow of our recent success.

321
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:24,793
People say, don't do it for the awards. Don't do it for the money. Don't do it for the praise.

322
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:28,196
Common wisdom says they're not fulfilling at all.

323
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:32,296
Mmm, bullshit? Like, they're fucking great.

324
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,738
Emotional, confusing, but great.

325
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:35,258
To a point, right?

326
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:38,261
I'll tell you what I tell myself.

327
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:41,323
That it's okay to dream about an award.

328
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:43,625
We're up for GDC and IGF awards for Hyperlite.

329
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:48,589
And if you are too, I hope we beat you.

330
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,511
I mean, like, I hope we all win, but we won't.

331
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:53,914
Does that make me a bad person for caring?

332
00:15:55,905 --> 00:16:00,649
It's okay to thirst after a high Metacritic and a glowing review in Waypoint or Polygon,

333
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,653
because the respective experts and your peers feels really good.

334
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,616
I won't overrule how you feel about your own game.

335
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:09,016
It won't.

336
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:13,440
The critiques you have about your own game and how you want to do things differently

337
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,840
next time.

338
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,240
But...

339
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,750
The dream in the back of your head.

340
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,252
Behind the design and the love of the craft and the faith in the project,

341
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,575
that feeling that, hey, I kind of, like, want a trophy? Maybe?

342
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,217
If you work your ass off and get lucky, because it takes both,

343
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,078
it'll be exciting! The reward will reward!

344
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,761
But that's all it'll do, right? It'll be great.

345
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,362
And then it'll be over.

346
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,503
But that's true of a lot of things.

347
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,745
So don't make games for the awards, but it's okay to hope for them.

348
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:45,689
The night I find out about the nomination, I got congratulated by Square, and then I

349
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:50,512
texted my family, and they texted congratulations, and then I went home, and I made dinner, and

350
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:54,855
I panicked, because I felt like I should feel more than I was feeling.

351
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:59,479
In my spiral, I texted Alexander Bruce, creator of Antichamber and a truly caring human being.

352
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:03,402
He told me, awards are like a birthday.

353
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:06,704
People will celebrate it with you, but they can't really care like you do.

354
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:10,047
That doesn't invalidate your birthday, it just means you can't expect the world to

355
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:10,607
feel it with you.

356
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,638
More lights in the theater!

357
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,479
Another Game Award is presented and accepted.

358
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:21,565
As the show goes to commercial, I wonder what Renault and the team are doing back at Square.

359
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,928
I'm reminded of the time I saw Renault.

360
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,096
Me, sitting in a chair like this one, looking up at a stage like the one in front of me.

361
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:31,618
In 2008, I attended my first GDC, and consequently my first IGF awards.

362
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:37,121
I'd been making games here and there for a couple years, and the parade of nominees on stage was inspiring.

363
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:43,345
The handsome Andy Schatz announced a winner, Fez, and there was Renault on stage with Phil to accept the award.

364
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,807
I remember so clearly thinking to myself,

365
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:52,811
I want that. I want to make a game that's special like that, and feel what it must feel like.

366
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:53,331
Next year, I said.

367
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:55,901
GDC 2009. I'll be on that stage.

368
00:17:55,901 --> 00:18:01,785
I spent the next eight IGF awards suffering from that ambitious goal.

369
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,868
Ambition is good, passion will push you forward and improve your work, but patience...

370
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:09,091
I'm working on that one, it's not my strong suit.

371
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,452
But finally, here I am at the Game Awards.

372
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:14,615
A different theater, a different prize, but that dream came true.

373
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,357
Well, we lost, but for the record, it actually does feel like an honor to be nominated,

374
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,399
but also fuck dishonor too, fuck that great, great, great game that beat us.

375
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,885
But sitting among my friends in that theater, it feels like a flying buttress, a moment I'll remember.

376
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:31,568
I look up at the stage, and there I am.

377
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,831
Here I am, hi! Here we are, GDC 2007!

378
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:40,196
A week where the world of games comes together to talk, drink, dance, learn.

379
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,298
To celebrate what we do and strive to do it better.

380
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,943
This talk teeters on the edge of emotion and information.

381
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:49,247
Tangible takeaways are important because this show can feel like a blur,

382
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:52,791
and it's hard to say what will stick with you in a week or in a year.

383
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,993
So let's backload some hot tips.

384
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:54,794
Seven tips from Teddy.

385
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:57,037
A rapid-fire, faster, nano-talk series.

386
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:00,021
If I can fit enough in, maybe Megan, Simon, Kelly, Akira, Jonathan,

387
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,022
Ryan will let me do it again.

388
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:09,438
One, start Game Feel from day one. It's immediate, like music. It's emotional. Everything that moves, feels. Characters, menus, dialogue boxes.

389
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:15,340
If it doesn't feel good, you might throw out a good idea because of subconscious bias against bad Game Feel.

390
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:23,982
Two, retweet yourself. Don't feel guilty. There are a lot of tweets! And most of your followers missed it the first time, so get that evening bump on the morning tweet. It's cool.

391
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:28,037
3. Invest in a good pair of headphones or get your studio too.

392
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:34,239
If you care about 1080p and 60fps, why the fuck are you listening to the sound and music from laptop speakers or earbuds?

393
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:39,101
4. Catherine is the best persona game ever made. Don't at me, go play it.

394
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:43,003
5. This week at GDC, put your name tag on the right, not the left. The right is right.

395
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:46,965
Anyone you meet is looking at your right when they meet you, when they go to shake your right hand.

396
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:52,547
A name tag on the right is easier for your new friend to peek at, to memorize your name, without looking like they're staring at your chest.

397
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,668
Six, assume every woman you meet this week is a developer.

398
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:56,908
She's not with someone, she's with herself,

399
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,069
and you can probably learn from her.

400
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,730
Seven, yeah, right, duh.

401
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,490
Seven, ask for help.

402
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,931
Now that I'm a creative director with a fancy name,

403
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,271
I struggle with remembering that, yes,

404
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,491
I'm responsible for leading a team,

405
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,072
but no, I don't have to have all the answers.

406
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,072
It's easy to get siloed when you're under pressure

407
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,793
in any role, but ask for help, ask for input.

408
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:14,414
Make it cooler together.

409
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,214
Okay, takeaways.

410
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,435
I'll tweet those next week.

411
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:18,595
I'm TeddyDeef on Twitter.

412
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:19,955
Daniel C418, Ben is Ben Swinton.

413
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:21,336
They're on my pinned tweet right now, it's great.

414
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:23,149
So here we are, we're at the end.

415
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,592
Nearly a year from those textures being fucked and that game being released.

416
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:29,474
Two years since I last stood on this stage.

417
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:31,435
Eleven years since I made my first video game.

418
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,817
And here I am, still making games.

419
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,959
Here we are, gathered, still groovin'.

420
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,421
When talking about game dev life over drinks with friends,

421
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:42,584
I've often said that this work is like life in the fast lane.

422
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,066
You spend years moving over into that lane,

423
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,228
and then you decide how long you gotta go fast.

424
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,534
how long you can before you drift right and exit, slow down, pull off somewhere, buy a house or something, and...

425
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,215
hey, I was wrong about that.

426
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,084
Yeah, I work more than I relax.

427
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,264
I'm intense about everything.

428
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:00,545
That's just my style right now,

429
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,185
but that's no value judgment.

430
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,206
Take any line you like.

431
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,807
Drift back and forth from left to right.

432
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,687
It doesn't matter how fast you move at any given time.

433
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:08,928
It doesn't matter what lane you're in.

434
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:11,849
It matters what road you're on and the turns you take.

435
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,590
Because busting your ass for a vapid game

436
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,210
with no point and no joy and no heart

437
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,951
and no personal investment is way less productive

438
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,512
than a slow and gradual pace on a game that you feel,

439
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,793
that you feel you need to make.

440
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:26,878
That you hope will add to the world and if you're being paid by someone else to work on a game and you feel like

441
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,481
It's not doing that do your best to make it better

442
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:34,526
And remember that you can use this time to improve your craft for the time you'll find for you for a project you love

443
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,187
It will come

444
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:39,451
So this wasn't about prayer, but I have faith in games

445
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:45,097
a young dumb powerful medium my window to the world my privilege and responsibility

446
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,262
So here's my goodbye.

447
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,743
I promise to make games that strive for meaning,

448
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,243
to inspire or heal, let players escape,

449
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:53,484
or get players involved.

450
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:56,385
I'll suffer imposter syndrome, but not get buried by it,

451
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:57,925
because when people give me a compliment,

452
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,846
I'll fight the urge to refute it in my head

453
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:03,067
to destroy the good they're giving me.

454
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:05,767
I promise to use my great privilege and luck

455
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:06,428
to pull other people up.

456
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:09,068
I won't squander it, I'll wield it to fuck shit up,

457
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,169
destroy it, and build it back up

458
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,029
to make this industry a better, safer,

459
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,630
more diverse, more mature one.

460
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,210
That's it.

461
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,650
Thank you.
