00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,649
Hello, welcome to another virtual talk.

2
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:12,491
This is Cutting Apart the Diegetic Interface

3
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,893
of Hardspace Shipbreaker.

4
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:18,375
I am Vidhi, a game and UX designer from Vancouver, Canada.

5
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,538
and I'm currently working at Blackbird Interactive.

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,299
I've been with the studio for over two years now,

7
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,542
and in my time, I have worked on a couple of different projects,

8
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,403
the first one being Minecraft Earth.

9
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:32,745
On that project, I was a UX designer,

10
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:35,687
and currently, I work on Hardspace Shipbreaker

11
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:36,788
as a game and UX designer.

12
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:41,825
Today I'll be talking about Hardspace Shipbreaker's

13
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:46,148
recent UI redesign and how we made a decision

14
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:49,050
on our design approach and how we landed on it.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,092
I'll talk about our approaches application

16
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:55,495
on a handful of screens, the HUD, the death experience

17
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,576
and the habitation module.

18
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,598
I'll also discuss the challenges faced

19
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:02,340
and finally the learning outcomes in the game

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,901
and from this experience.

21
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:13,398
For those who don't know, Hardspace Shipbreaker is an award-winning physics game where you play as a blue-collar worker in space,

22
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:17,701
where you're cutting apart and salvaging ships, all while being in zero-g.

23
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:23,444
We're a fairly small team of about 30 people and have been in early access for over a year now,

24
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,186
and that's how long I have been on this project.

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:30,949
Like everyone on the team, I too have to wear multiple hats.

26
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,708
And I've been a part of the game's design

27
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,770
in a handful of different disciplines,

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,570
UX, game, and narrative design.

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,351
This game is one of the first of its kind

30
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,352
and it has carved its own genre.

31
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,094
So let's look at the game.

32
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:42,894
My name is Weaver.

33
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,636
I'll be your eyes and ears when you're in the yard.

34
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,877
Used to be a cutter myself

35
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:57,243
until there were some complications.

36
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:16,188
Let's get to work.

37
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:59,286
So narratively, this game is set in the future, where Earth is in a pretty bad shape and humans

38
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:04,850
have terraformed and moved over to other planets. Since you can't quite afford a ticket to safer

39
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,974
planets, you take on this job with Lynx, which is an evil corporation. You take on a job as

40
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:14,557
the salvager or cutter and it comes with a hefty debt.

41
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:19,411
So with each ship that you salvage, you essentially pay off your debt.

42
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:24,455
Now of course, there's endless fines and fees that you have to pay to live, and they just

43
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:29,940
kind of keep piling up, but I mean, what else do you expect from an evil company that's

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,622
all about capitalism and profits?

45
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:35,284
So let's get into the game.

46
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:40,228
When you begin the game, the first thing a player experiences is this contract screen.

47
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,811
It's perhaps one of my favorite experiences in the game.

48
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:47,248
Similar to forms that you may have filled in your life,

49
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:50,311
you're filling out another corporate bone dry piece

50
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,653
of paperwork.

51
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:56,378
Set in this cold, damp looking room, you sign your life away.

52
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,881
You never really read the terms and conditions.

53
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,103
You look at your food options.

54
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,444
They're all quite dismal.

55
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:05,411
But this interaction immediately sets the tone

56
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,656
for the rest of the game world, which is it's dark,

57
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:13,620
it's corporate, and it's so real that it kind of hurts.

58
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,263
So this experience became the template

59
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:20,727
or the standard of the experience that we wanted to apply

60
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,829
to the rest of the screens in the game,

61
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,471
which in the form when I joined the team wasn't the case.

62
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,261
So while preparing for the redesign,

63
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,224
the first thing we had to identify were the constraints.

64
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,186
The first one is short timelines.

65
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:37,507
Since we are in early access,

66
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:40,449
our release cycles range anywhere

67
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,191
between one to three months,

68
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,973
which is not a whole lot of time to make large changes,

69
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,996
while you're also making changes to other facets of the game

70
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:52,258
like tools, ship, and tech.

71
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,719
So we had limited dev time

72
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,301
when we were looking at the UI redesign.

73
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,793
We also had limited design time.

74
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:03,776
I was the only person kind of in charge of this revamp,

75
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,978
and I was also in charge of other things in the game,

76
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,199
just like everybody else on this team.

77
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,141
So we had to be strategic

78
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,282
with how we approached this redesign

79
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:15,004
and how much time and effort and resources

80
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,285
we could put behind it.

81
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,509
Now, the game is set in a pretty interesting and expansive world,

82
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,070
as I just kind of mentioned before.

83
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,672
But with our releases, we're introducing the story

84
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,593
and other characters into this world.

85
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,095
And we're doing this mostly through talking heads

86
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:35,497
or very text-heavy messages that players receive in the game.

87
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,978
And this is because of our limited resources.

88
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,779
We don't have a budget for cut scenes, quick time events,

89
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:47,041
3D modeled characters that could potentially be animated.

90
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,002
So we realized that the UI would have

91
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:53,824
to do a lot of the world building heavy lifting.

92
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,204
And that led to the challenge.

93
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:00,046
How do we add depth to the story through the game's UI?

94
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,674
We wanted to not only redesign the interface

95
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:09,458
to make it more usable, it was very much made by devs

96
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,700
in the past, but we wanted to make the experience

97
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,222
more immersive and embedded into the game world.

98
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,844
We wanted to build a mental space for the player,

99
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,125
for this company that they're working for,

100
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,726
and the world that this game is set in

101
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,528
all through the game's UI.

102
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:30,913
So that's the kind of the point of this talk, is to show how you can accomplish or what you

103
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:36,818
can accomplish when user experience design, game design, and narrative collaborate from

104
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:44,104
the very beginning to find inexpensive solutions to building a game world. In our case, this was

105
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,406
purely an outcome of necessity.

106
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,261
because of our limited resources, as I just mentioned,

107
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,862
but it helped us understand and finalize our approach,

108
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:56,243
which is a mostly diegetic approach to the game UI.

109
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,584
And I'll kind of expand on that throughout the talk.

110
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,845
But what we really wanted to do

111
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:03,126
was use every screen in the game

112
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,247
or every opportunity in the game

113
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,267
to build a sense of presence for the player

114
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,328
and make it more immersive.

115
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,529
Now, I might interchange between those two terms,

116
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:12,790
game presence and immersion,

117
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,530
but this is what I'm really referring to.

118
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:18,558
For those who don't know, diegetic is a term used across media,

119
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:23,707
and what it really means is an element that exists.

120
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:28,775
both for the audience or the player, as well as the characters within the world.

121
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:35,319
It's one of the four types of UI in games, and we heavily leaned upon this UI style.

122
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,743
So from the example before, the contract screen is not just a 2D UI element,

123
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:45,505
but it's rather contextually and physically placed in the game world,

124
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:50,127
where both you as the player and the character in the game world interact with this interface.

125
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:55,744
We identified four pillars that we wanted to take

126
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,786
or hit with our design approach.

127
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,888
First one being information architecture.

128
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,070
This game is very information-dense

129
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,513
and all mostly condensed into a single screen,

130
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:08,276
and it often became a point of contention for our players.

131
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,958
So we wanted to ensure we built a clear hierarchy.

132
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,463
We wanted to make large amounts of information digestible.

133
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,132
The second being gameplay.

134
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,773
So we wanted to use these screens to direct players

135
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,175
to complete or hit design goals in the game.

136
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:28,297
As the game is developed, so have the goals within the game.

137
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:31,919
So we had to work as a unit, all designers together,

138
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,580
to identify these new goals

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,521
and how we can guide the players

140
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,883
to those goals through the UI.

141
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,944
Usability, bit of a no-brainer

142
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:43,625
as someone who is looking at interfaces day in, day out.

143
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,756
We obviously wanted to hit some of the basics,

144
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:52,260
readability, usability, and navigation,

145
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,662
but this is really not a usability talk,

146
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,404
and I don't want to focus on that.

147
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,986
What I really want to talk about is integrating

148
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:02,689
that last element of the story and the narrative in.

149
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,092
What we really wanted to do was build game presence

150
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:10,296
through the game's interface, and that's the approach,

151
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:13,178
and that's the real point of this talk today.

152
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,272
Now to take this approach, two sections of design

153
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:20,434
had to work together, one impacting the other

154
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,274
and vice versa.

155
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:25,457
Oftentimes, they are two separate factions in a studio

156
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:28,779
and they don't get to be so closely integrated.

157
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,940
So I thought I would be very much like the Spider-Man,

158
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,501
pulling these two ends together.

159
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:34,302
I'm so cool.

160
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:35,523
I'm so smart and strong.

161
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:38,164
But in reality, that's kind of what

162
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:40,045
my experience was mostly like.

163
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,466
I definitely felt like that cat.

164
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:45,605
And I especially felt like this cat

165
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,786
when we were addressing the densest screen of our game.

166
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:53,528
And that game, and that screen, sorry, is the HUD.

167
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,389
So before I show you what we got to, where we are today,

168
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,991
let's look at the very first HUD of the game.

169
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,892
Because this HUD set the seed

170
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,353
for the rest of the experiences.

171
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,814
So what you're seeing here is the first prototype

172
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:08,474
of the game.

173
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,596
It was an outcome of a game jam within the studio.

174
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,304
What you're seeing on this HUD is something that's truly diegetic.

175
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:20,667
As the player's head moves around,

176
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:24,551
the camera moves to mimic your head shaking or your head moving around.

177
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,213
And I'll kind of play this again for you to see.

178
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,439
Of course, it's a little janky. It's a prototype.

179
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,721
But theoretically, it's very cool. It's very novel.

180
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:35,384
But it definitely has some obvious usability concerns.

181
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,446
You have UI components being cut off.

182
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,628
You have text kind of being burnt on the edges.

183
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:45,333
And this would be considered a truly diegetic approach, right?

184
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:50,697
Something that is the suit that is on the helmet

185
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,358
of the suit of the cutter.

186
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,600
It's on that glass, and it's kind of displayed

187
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,441
onto this glass.

188
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:59,948
So as much as we walked away from this concept

189
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,310
because of usability reasons

190
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,053
and the amount of information we'll have to show,

191
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,816
this seed was set pretty early on.

192
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:10,219
It had to be a helmet,

193
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,221
and it had to be displayed on that glass.

194
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:16,306
This is the HUD that the game launched with.

195
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,388
It is not the HUD that you have in the game today.

196
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,749
What you're seeing is you in the bay.

197
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,250
This is where majority of the gameplay takes place.

198
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,012
You're holding a grapple, or you'd be holding another tool,

199
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:31,415
and you begin cutting, or you begin salvaging.

200
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:34,817
The HUD is still a display on the helmet,

201
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,199
but it's less responsive to movement,

202
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,980
as we just saw in the example before.

203
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,082
The biggest difference between these two screens,

204
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,123
and of course, the styling difference isn't a whole lot,

205
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:47,425
but the main thing I want you to focus on

206
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,766
is the amount of information.

207
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,122
packed onto the screen in a single interface.

208
00:11:53,122 --> 00:12:02,205
And I want to walk you through the four pillars that we had

209
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,846
and how we address them in this HUD.

210
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,627
But first, let's look at all the information on the screen.

211
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,514
So, in this situation, you're inside of a ship

212
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,376
and you're cutting,

213
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:17,660
and the biggest UI element you're seeing is this work order.

214
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,883
It tells the player what they need to salvage

215
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,964
when they're in a particular shift,

216
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:24,947
and it takes the majority of your screen space.

217
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:30,489
Here you're seeing your tool information displayed in four vastly different locations,

218
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,471
even though it all pertains to the single tool that you have in your hand.

219
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:38,575
The temperature, the durability, the ability to navigate to other tools,

220
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:42,638
and on the top left, you're seeing the tether count,

221
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:47,422
or it would be the demo charge count, depending on the tool in your hand.

222
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:50,584
But to see information about a single object,

223
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:55,088
a player would have to look kind of all the way around the screen to gather that information.

224
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,535
not particularly ideal.

225
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:03,136
Here you see highlighted your stats, your oxygen meter,

226
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:06,137
and the timer of your shift.

227
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:10,758
Some of these elements need to be replenished multiple times

228
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,439
within a shift.

229
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,399
They're quite vital and important for a player

230
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,140
to look at when it comes to moment-to-moment gameplay.

231
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,524
And questionably, some of the more important UI components

232
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,487
are these two, where you have your object information,

233
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:27,252
where a salvage item goes, and the pressurization state

234
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:28,072
of a room.

235
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,494
That's important.

236
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:32,217
If you begin cutting in a pressurized room,

237
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,520
you will blow up and die.

238
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,721
So don't do that.

239
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:36,061
Not good.

240
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,151
And the last thing I want to kind of bring focus to here

241
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,331
is the subtitles.

242
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:45,632
You'll see them overlaid on top of other UI elements,

243
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,833
making neither the UI elements nor the subtitles

244
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,894
particularly legible.

245
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:54,114
What I haven't even done here is highlight the notifications,

246
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,875
the hazard warnings, and other UI elements

247
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,716
that appear on the screen from time to time.

248
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,922
But the idea I'm trying to kind of convey across

249
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:06,563
is that there's a lot of information on this one screen,

250
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:10,543
and it is scattered, and there is no clear hierarchy.

251
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:12,784
So this is the new HUD.

252
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,204
Visually, a whole lot less cluttered,

253
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:15,944
but let's break this down.

254
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,865
These are the two HUDs side by side

255
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:26,106
for you to see the major differences

256
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,267
at the first glance.

257
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,202
So let's go through the four pillars that I mentioned earlier

258
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:35,284
and how they impact the redesign.

259
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,885
The first one being information hierarchy,

260
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,646
or information architecture, sorry.

261
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,120
We laid out every single UI element

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,681
that had to be displayed onto the screen

263
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:52,102
and identified what is the most important information that

264
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,582
will impact the player from moment to moment

265
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:57,963
in the gameplay and find an optimal position

266
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,064
to place that on the screen.

267
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,984
So you wanted to reduce any clutter that

268
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:07,445
could be where the player is cutting or looking at the ship.

269
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:12,747
And we wanted to keep those core pieces of UI bits of information,

270
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,869
so your tool info, object info, talking heads,

271
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:20,050
and your stats close to that center, so close to the bottom center,

272
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,891
reducing the cognitive load for the player.

273
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:26,593
It's the central cutting zone, if you will,

274
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,875
and all kind of grouped together in the center and the bottom center of the screen.

275
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:39,960
We use this screen, this is just another example of the same new HUD, just to show other elements that appear on the screen from time to time.

276
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,868
We wanted to use the screen to train the players to build a muscle and visual memory.

277
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,452
So if something flashes on the left,

278
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,370
you're getting a notification.

279
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,271
So that's a part of your feedback loop.

280
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,053
If something flashes on your right,

281
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,514
it's going to be your hazards,

282
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,996
and you'll see an example of that moving forward.

283
00:15:57,996 --> 00:16:01,739
We've reclaimed real estate

284
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:06,363
by moving the tool information into one succinct location

285
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,205
and introducing a radial menu,

286
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,887
condensing the swapping between tools

287
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,610
into one spot that's hidden off the screen.

288
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,260
Several usability concerns have already kind of been addressed through this,

289
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,321
but the one I want to bring your focus to,

290
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,162
because this is not a usability talk, as I mentioned earlier,

291
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:28,043
but the one component I wanted to bring your focus to

292
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:31,764
as a primary example is the talking head.

293
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:38,526
As we build this game out, we're adding new characters in the game.

294
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:41,586
So for players who may have turned their audio off and...

295
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:45,106
that does hurt our audio team. It hurts their heart.

296
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:48,049
But for players who may have turned their audio off

297
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,772
or players who may have visual or hearing impairments,

298
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:55,335
we have ensured no UI elements overlap each other.

299
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:59,819
We've also added the character's portrait,

300
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,923
and we've reduced or removed any post effects

301
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,544
from the talking head to ensure

302
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,266
that that is particularly legible

303
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,847
at any given point in the game.

304
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,450
Now, I do want to say an accessibility pass

305
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,773
has not been done for this game yet,

306
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,435
but is planned and in the works.

307
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:24,542
To hit the design goal pillar, or the gameplay goal pillar,

308
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:28,686
I mentioned the work order, the big UI component on the screen.

309
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:36,448
Not only did it take a lot of real estate, it told or it held the player's hand and told the player

310
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:42,314
what they had to do on every ship, even though that wasn't truly the case. It added to a quota system,

311
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:46,118
but it made the player, it narrowed the player's focus.

312
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,785
So while working with other designers in the team,

313
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:54,389
we moved away from a work order to a salvage bar,

314
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,190
which told the player how much of this ship

315
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,113
they had salvaged and how much they had destroyed,

316
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:02,515
incentivizing not just salvaging the entire ship,

317
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,518
but incentivizing a sense of exploration,

318
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,360
which is something that was kind of missing

319
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,941
previously from the screen.

320
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:13,084
So we used the UI to add that sense of exploration.

321
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:19,329
But that did mean, or it came at a cost of retuning and reworking the progression and the economy,

322
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,211
which was spearheaded by another designer on the team, Jason Barth.

323
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:30,497
This is a particularly big feat and could honestly warrant an entire talk of its own,

324
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:33,300
but I'm not going to focus on that.

325
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:41,340
Luckily, we are in early access, so we have access to players through our Discord, Twitch,

326
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,370
Twitter, to give us feedback, and we get to see the impact of some of these decisions as we're making them.

327
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:56,014
So the goal for this interface was to make it as realistic as possible

328
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:58,056
and embed it into the game world.

329
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:01,098
We were heavily inspired by fighter pilot jets,

330
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:07,082
and we wanted to use those as an example to build a sense of expertise,

331
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,043
that when a fighter pilot looks at this,

332
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:11,625
they know what they're looking at, but a layman wouldn't.

333
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,808
So how do we condense information, tell the player that they're an expert,

334
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:18,910
but also explain it to them in case they ever get lost?

335
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,313
So we tried to build that emotion of an expert,

336
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:27,275
of the fact that this is displayed onto your helmet,

337
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:32,498
through the effects in the game.

338
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:35,340
So, I'll give you an example here.

339
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,382
Narratively, Lynx doesn't give you the nice fancy tech.

340
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,025
That's reserved for the upper class.

341
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:45,468
But rather what you get is the retrofitted hand-me-down tech

342
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,189
called Trevorware Tech in the game,

343
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:50,292
named after one of our great devs on the team.

344
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:55,364
So here's an example of your HUD kind of reacting

345
00:19:55,364 --> 00:20:00,444
to the external forces when you are cutting the ship,

346
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:05,926
really embracing the fact that this screen is on your helmet.

347
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:10,286
It is not modern technology, and if you take damage,

348
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,767
so does your helmet, so does your suit.

349
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:16,147
We've also added stylized elements like brackets

350
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:19,788
and acronyms to bring the player closer

351
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,448
to the fighter pilot feel.

352
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:27,542
Now there are elements on this HUD that are not truly diegetic.

353
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,182
And this is, I'm going to address that now.

354
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:32,443
We've crossed bounds of the glass from time to time.

355
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:36,884
But this, and there's UI elements that probably wouldn't exist,

356
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,604
and for sure would not exist on a fighter pilot HUD.

357
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,485
But this was a conscious decision that we made.

358
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:46,986
To ensure that we made room for every element in the game.

359
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:52,776
And we tried to bring the player back into that sense of presence

360
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:58,620
using the post effects and audio, as you saw in the slide before,

361
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,842
to set that or to sell that realism.

362
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:07,326
Those things become particularly apparent when a player comes

363
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:10,408
closer to death. And honestly, speaking of death,

364
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:15,371
there are many ways to die in this game. Death is a big part of this game,

365
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:15,811
actually.

366
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,645
And that became the second focus.

367
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:21,047
It's another golden opportunity that we

368
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:24,068
found to apply the same approach, the four pillar

369
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:26,830
approach, to the death experience.

370
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,833
That's what we're going to talk about next.

371
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,714
What a segue, almost like I planned it.

372
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:37,036
So narratively, when you die, there

373
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:38,957
and honestly, there's many ways to die in this game.

374
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,275
Lynx takes your genetic sequence and they clone you.

375
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:47,420
And as it turns out to this corporation,

376
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,706
cloning is much cheaper than surgery, recovery,

377
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,067
antibiotics, I don't know.

378
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:59,961
So we needed the players to really feel and understand that they're disposable,

379
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:03,262
they are expendable in the eyes of this evil company that they're working for.

380
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:07,923
And this is the version of the death screen that the game launched with.

381
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:12,325
What you're seeing here is a screen fading to black, text.

382
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,735
with letting and kerning problems for the UI-minded folk, I am aware,

383
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:23,723
this text appearing on the screen telling you how you died, a demerit that's been added,

384
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:29,189
and a funny quip. But it didn't really do it justice, and it didn't really sell that emotion

385
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,272
of, oh, I'm pretty expendable to this company.

386
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,740
So this is the new death experience.

387
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,861
You've died of asphyxiation, and what you see now

388
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:41,441
is being completely cloned.

389
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:45,182
What you're hearing is your guts completely being moved

390
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:48,143
and your genetic sequence being stored and rebuilt

391
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:54,724
to really sell the sense of you're not even you anymore.

392
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:58,945
And we use the metaphor of a real life health and safety

393
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,265
work report akin to the contract screen

394
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:02,265
that you saw before.

395
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,396
to tell the player how they died, what they can do to improve this gameplay,

396
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:16,203
and we've kept the funny quip and the finger stamp because your identity is kind of tied to that.

397
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,763
This not only paved the way for a more interesting death experience that added no more than 10

398
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:30,125
seconds to the gameplay and got the player back into the game as soon as they finished,

399
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:36,267
but it influenced the onboarding experience which is something that kind of came in last minute

400
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:40,188
because the death experience already existed where what you see now,

401
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:45,230
and this is a little bit of a spoiler alert so if you want to experience this look away,

402
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,831
uh you get brutally killed in the first few minutes of the game.

403
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:57,798
where the company takes a genetic sequence, it stores you and then rebuilds you from the ground up.

404
00:23:57,798 --> 00:23:59,259
The sounds are pretty cool.

405
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:15,491
Along with this at the end of the sequence is a list of all the fees that are now added on to your

406
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:15,951
charge.

407
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:19,007
when you begin working for this company.

408
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:25,516
So that's how we impact the death experience.

409
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:26,337
But that's not all.

410
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,200
The last thing I want to show you

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,803
is the habitation module or the HAB.

412
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,492
In our latest update, we've redesigned this.

413
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:36,854
We've called it the Employee Terminal.

414
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:38,795
But what this is is it's your home.

415
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,438
This is where players can take a break from cutting,

416
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,279
when they can upgrade their equipment,

417
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,783
see messages, look at data drives, see that progress.

418
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:50,885
And we often use the screen to move the story forward,

419
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:54,628
where you have characters talk to each other.

420
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:54,728
So...

421
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,131
Traditionally, and this is what the game launched with,

422
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,214
is a 2D utilitarian interface with what

423
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,316
looks like an image in the background of what

424
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,778
the app could potentially be, interfering with the text

425
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:10,761
and with the interfaces as you navigate through the mall.

426
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:15,465
So this is the latest update. It involves an entirely new HAB.

427
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:22,749
It represents a monitor or a terminal that you're interacting with using the same Trevorware tech.

428
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:26,512
We've addressed the visual styles, the fonts for readability.

429
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:31,335
The user flows have been updated for a handful of these submenus.

430
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:38,181
But most importantly, we wanted to embrace that concept of real-world metaphors to enhance this immersion.

431
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,742
An example of this is the data miner screen.

432
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:45,984
So thematically, this is a piece of rogue software that you've been given.

433
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:51,867
And we wanted the player to feel like they're doing something they probably shouldn't have.

434
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:55,808
It's a combination of stylized UI, post effects, and audio to sell this.

435
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:58,709
But we're not stopping here.

436
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:04,650
In our latest update, we've got the 2D UI, but we have plans of taking this even further.

437
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:09,190
Like the fan art we often receive about the three-dimensional Hab,

438
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,213
what we're working towards is a three-dimensional Hab where players can go and interact with monitors.

439
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:20,875
Again, most akin to that contract screen. But for now, that's classified.

440
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:27,598
So, to recap. There's a lot to recap. With every screen you've seen here,

441
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,005
And for the screens we intend on working on in the future,

442
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:34,026
we have taken this approach.

443
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,629
We've tried to hit these four pillars

444
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,071
to build not just usable interfaces,

445
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:43,614
but rather add a sense of story into the game world

446
00:26:43,614 --> 00:26:47,157
and a sense of presence in an inexpensive manner.

447
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:50,840
This wasn't easy, and that there were challenges.

448
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:55,910
The first one is, I'm emotionally attached to everything,

449
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,491
so can you please change it, but also maybe don't?

450
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,152
The game's been in development for over five years

451
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,753
and players have had it in their hands for over a year now,

452
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:07,533
which means there's a lot of emotional attachment

453
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,714
and a lot of biases already formed.

454
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:15,993
So to introduce design changes meant having to work within a predefined box,

455
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:21,759
but having to ground every decision that we made in UX theory or in design theory to be able to

456
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,786
really sell it because people are invested and have to be okay with a little bit of pushback.

457
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,624
Because we're in early access and because of our limited budget,

458
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,447
we don't really do a lot of user testing.

459
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,609
Early access is good.

460
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:42,413
You get a lot of direct contact with players.

461
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,815
But what you're not getting is a formalized method

462
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:47,117
of collecting information and feedback.

463
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:52,204
I would highly recommend for you or for anybody

464
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,565
to push user testing onto that project as soon as possible.

465
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:58,625
We have now begun formalizing user testing sessions

466
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:02,326
on a weekly basis with the team.

467
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,727
And it's still a biased method, but it's

468
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:06,547
a step in the right direction.

469
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,888
But it has been a pretty big challenge

470
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,028
that I've had to face.

471
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,474
The last one is data turnaround time.

472
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,378
We do collect telemetry,

473
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:17,724
but by the time we have a release,

474
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,067
the telemetry data becomes.

475
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,131
kind of substantial, we're knee-deep into prepping the next release and the one after that has

476
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:30,532
already been mapped out. What this means, and this late into early access, what this means is we have

477
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:36,753
to negotiate with our producers what goes in and what doesn't and where something's going to get

478
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:42,555
compromised. So Jessica Klein, our executive producer, gave a talk this morning where she

479
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,995
talks about this one-in-one-out concept.

480
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:49,539
where if you're going to address a new task,

481
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,200
you're going to add a new task,

482
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,061
you're going to have to take that time away

483
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:54,582
from somewhere else.

484
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:55,763
And this meant a balancing act

485
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:58,825
and to have to really think both granularly

486
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:03,849
and holistically when making this decision.

487
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,811
Some of the learnings and opportunities

488
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,374
from this experience.

489
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,715
UX and games worked.

490
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:21,037
closely together. They sat at the exact same table. And I kind of, rarely, but no, I did feel like

491
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,900
Spider-Man. Having both...

492
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:29,657
in the same room at the same time meant influencing the game holistically and not in silo.

493
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:34,660
I have worked on games where I've had to be in one department of the other,

494
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:42,185
but having the ability to leverage all components, the game, the story, and user experience design,

495
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:47,628
what you're really doing is building emotion for players and that's incredibly valuable.

496
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:53,056
Especially with the constraints that I mentioned earlier,

497
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:57,858
this became an inexpensive and innovative way, I guess,

498
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:01,620
to introduce story and to build that presence into the game

499
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,921
through the game's UI.

500
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:07,742
We leveraged not just UI, but also effects and audio.

501
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:10,344
And I understood that value very strongly

502
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,464
through this experience.

503
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,988
It was just plain fun.

504
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,168
I don't know what to tell you.

505
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,569
I've worked in both departments separately,

506
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,930
but this was an incredibly fulfilling experience

507
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,991
as a creative.

508
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,833
And now I find myself thinking always holistically.

509
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,574
I can't make a design decision purely

510
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:33,655
without considering the UX implications or vice versa.

511
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:34,916
And I think that makes,

512
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,737
that has helped me become a better designer,

513
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,498
but it's also helped impact the game in a positive manner.

514
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:47,072
And this also builds an opportunity for this game

515
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,612
to build that world,

516
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:52,174
to potentially even build a franchise if they ever chose to.

517
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:57,077
It's really building a canvas for this game and the future.

518
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:59,818
The UI becomes a part of the world

519
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:04,421
that players now expect when they see this game.

520
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:07,542
So this has been our approach to the game's UI.

521
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:11,494
Hopefully, you can find this useful for your project

522
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,836
in building experiential design, especially for smaller teams.

523
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:18,538
Thank you so much for your time.

524
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,802
And don't forget, death is a fresh start.

525
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:25,063
Feel free to contact me.

526
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,885
I'll be here for a Q&A session.

527
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,885
Thank you so much.
