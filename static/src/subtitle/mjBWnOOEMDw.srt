00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:09,142
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to day two of GDC Showcase.

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:14,825
I'm Brian Francis, a contributing editor at Gamasutra.com and maker of things here at GDC.

3
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:20,387
Today's super special guest for our Ask Me Anything session is Obsidian Entertainment's

4
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,168
Kari Patel. Kari, would you please introduce yourself?

5
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:27,890
Hey, Brian. Thanks a bunch for having me. It's really great to be talking to you today.

6
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:32,272
My name is Kari Patel, and as Brian said, I work at Obsidian Entertainment,

7
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,853
where I am a game director and a senior narrative designer.

8
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,648
I joined the company in 2013 to write for Pillars of Eternity, wrote for the White March

9
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:44,591
expansions, I was co-narrative lead on Pillars of Eternity 2 Deadfire, then I went on to

10
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:48,352
write for The Outer Worlds and I directed our first expansion for that game, Paralon

11
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,774
Gorgon, and I'm currently directing an upcoming title from Obsidian.

12
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,835
So again, great to see everybody here today.

13
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:58,771
Awesome. I have played a lot of those games and I have really enjoyed my time with them.

14
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:03,417
But let's get this show on the road. You've got questions, she's got answers, I'm just the rando

15
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:07,883
in the middle who can relay questions from A to B. Go ahead and start submitting your questions via

16
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:11,968
the question tab in Swapcard's chat function. Are you tired of hearing the word question yet?

17
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,652
You can ask questions about Carrie's work on The Outer Worlds, Pillars of Eternity, or just her work as a writer, narrative designer, and game director in general.

18
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:23,753
Y'all have already put some good questions in chat. Let's do this.

19
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:29,555
Okay, and that's the point where I scroll over and go grab the questions that I've been looking at.

20
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:35,417
I really enjoyed this question, so I want to start with this one from Lake Watkins.

21
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,679
Lake Watson says, Hi Kerry, thanks for the AMA.

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,901
They are curious what tools or techniques you use for player modeling in your games.

23
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,983
Do you identify player psychographics or use some other approach?

24
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,484
I actually knew Obsidian has a decent model for this, so I was

25
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,665
I wanted to throw this one up top because it was pretty sophisticated.

26
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:56,067
By which you mean like who we think the player

27
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,508
who we think the player is trying to play in the game?

28
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,462
I think identifying different player types, you know, like explorers, story nerds, combat nerds,

29
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:06,783
like that's a very shorthand rough example I would use, but yeah, I think that's where the

30
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:12,427
question is going. Yeah, so for that I think the first question is what kind of game are you making

31
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:17,069
and what are the fundamental design pillars of that game, you know, and that is sort of the

32
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:22,112
first filter for, you know, what kind of player base, what kind of player type you're really

33
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:22,872
trying to serve.

34
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,521
You know, for a lot of the games, like, we're mostly known for RPGs,

35
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,184
with a lot of story and a lot of reactivity and a lot of player freedom.

36
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,948
So, our model for a lot of those types of games is a lot of tabletop role-playing games.

37
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,010
So, you know, we try to...

38
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,173
we look at the things that players seem to get the most out of that,

39
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:46,135
like they get a lot of character interaction.

40
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,577
They get the sense of a really big reactive world to explore

41
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:51,999
that gives them lots of options for how to solve problems.

42
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,365
Lots of tools that they can use.

43
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:58,591
And again, a high degree of reactivity to how they use those tools.

44
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,795
Meaningful and interesting characters to interact with.

45
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,237
So I think a lot of the...

46
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:07,717
The player types we assume like we know there are people who want to go fight things.

47
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:12,520
We know there are players who want to explore and immerse themselves in a really deep, well-realized

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,140
reactive world.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,763
And we know there are players who really care about story and character and companions.

50
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,825
And they want to get to know everybody in the world, talk to everybody.

51
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:27,289
So you know, knowing that those are I think kind of the three, the three big content draws

52
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:27,890
of our games.

53
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:34,000
We try to set them up in such a way that players can approach that content in whatever way

54
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,541
and with whatever focus we want.

55
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:36,482
Tremaine Williams.

56
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,483
Tremaine, thank you so much for hanging out with the Showcase.

57
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,584
I've seen you in a bunch of chats, just wanted to give you a shout out.

58
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,008
Tremaine Williams wants to know, when building an open world game, how do you determine how

59
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,309
big is too big?

60
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,690
How do you deal with dead space between points of interest?

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,720
Oh, man.

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,822
I mean, there are a lot of ways we can do this.

63
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:57,445
It's, you know, obviously an interesting environment for the player to traverse,

64
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,648
you know, combat encounters in between banter with your companions,

65
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:05,290
you know, but sometimes a little bit of dead space is OK.

66
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,732
Like if the player is always moving from one encounter to the next,

67
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,593
you know, from one bit of banter to the next,

68
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:15,476
there's not really a moment to just sort of slow down and appreciate.

69
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,438
And also anticipate where you're headed.

70
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:24,651
And I think this is where just like playtesting and again, understanding like what is the

71
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,353
pace of the experience you're trying to offer is really important.

72
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,754
Because again, you do want a little bit of quiet space.

73
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:35,796
Some of the most fun I've had in The Witcher 3 and in games like Breath of the Wild is

74
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:39,358
just sort of getting from one point to the next and kind of having this goal in mind

75
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,639
of I see something in the distance, I want to get there.

76
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,380
And I know it's going to take me a little bit of time to get there and I'll run into

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,720
a few surprises.

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,501
But I'm going to keep trying.

79
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,061
I'm going to keep running.

80
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:45,601
So, thank you for watching.

81
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:46,281
And I'll see you in the next one.

82
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:46,442
Bye.

83
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:50,229
Because I am interested in this world and I don't know what I'm going to find next,

84
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,190
the process of getting there is fun.

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,051
Right on.

86
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:56,973
Our next question comes from Katie Setoff.

87
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:00,556
Katie would like to know, as a narrative designer, do you ever run into trade-offs

88
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,737
between storytelling and engineering limitations?

89
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,638
If so, how do you balance those concerns?

90
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,022
Yeah, I mean, I think engineering limitations,

91
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:13,325
I think that's an issue for just about every design department.

92
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,308
And fundamentally, I think you do

93
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,350
have to start from the perspective of what is possible

94
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,173
and what are the tools I have at my disposal

95
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,275
and what are the constraints that I have to abide by,

96
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,558
rather than saying, let me just do what I want

97
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,799
and make it someone else's problem to make it work.

98
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:33,041
So I mean, again,

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,621
This can relate to how often or how many cutscenes you can use,

100
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,162
you know, sort of the graphical fidelity of conversations.

101
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:48,144
And I mean, honestly, there are a lot of gameplay constraints as well that play into this. Like,

102
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:52,865
are you playing a game where you can kill every NPC? Because if so, that's something that you

103
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:57,407
have to adjust for in the way you tell stories and the alternate avenues you offer to players.

104
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,388
Is this a game where we are going to automatically pull players into

105
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:17,844
Any conversation they encounter or do we allow players to opt in again, in which case, you know, you have to have to think about how those players are going to get have a good experience, even if it's not necessarily the golden path experience that you are primarily designing around.

106
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:23,245
So I mean, I think, yes, engineering limitations can be a bit of an issue.

107
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:30,928
But I think the bigger thing to think about for narrative and again, for any design department is just what is the level of freedom you're offering players?

108
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:41,672
You know, what sort of gameplay tools do we have as designers and are we offering players just to make sure that the experience that you're trying to set up actually plays well with the game that you're making?

109
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,747
Right on. Kirstie Logan Fowler is asking a question that I would consider one of the most loaded questions I hear from narrative folks, but we're going to go for it.

110
00:06:51,107 --> 00:07:00,576
What kind of structure do you use? Heroes Journey, 3-act structure, 5-act structure, and does it differ between games and different types of games? I just heard a bunch of knives being unchiefed somewhere.

111
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:02,337
Yeah.

112
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:09,097
I'm not really, I don't know, I'm not a huge believer in any one of those structures being like,

113
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,919
the right way to tell stories, the right way to tell game stories.

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,302
The way I look at tools like that is, if it is a useful framework for you to think in,

115
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:24,064
and for you to think about story and pacing and escalation and character arcs,

116
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:29,887
then go ahead and use it. But I think that, you know, when you get into writing a

117
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,893
Writing a story to fit a formula rather than using a framework to help you create and pace your story,

118
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:44,577
I think you're putting the cart before the horse. We do tend to write a lot of our story overviews

119
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:49,420
and our story briefs with three-act structure. I've definitely done that and I've seen a number

120
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,242
of other people at Obsidian use three or even five-act structure. But again, it's less about

121
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:59,185
saying, oh, we have to follow this very rigid formula around our acts and more just

122
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,653
Let's think about the phases and the developments and the major beats that players are going to go through.

123
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:10,874
And what environment is the player in now?

124
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:12,975
What are the big problems in front of them?

125
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:17,837
What are we trying to pull them towards at each of these different phases of the story?

126
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,581
With a more open world game, with something where you're offering players lots of freedom in what they do and how they explore.

127
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:32,764
Again, you have to keep in mind, they may not follow the story beats the way you are intending them to.

128
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,446
So again, you cannot, you can't necessarily engineer.

129
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:41,277
The perfect 3X structure for like every player who goes through Prim to get to New Vegas

130
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:45,399
and also every player who fights through, you know, the Death Claws on the other side

131
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,000
to get there.

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,943
But you do have to understand that players may choose that other experience and they

133
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,986
still expect to have a good time even if they understand that they're, you know, by choice

134
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,068
skipping out on some of the other content you've laid in front of them.

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,102
Mm-hmm. I'm going to roll two questions together.

136
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:05,285
Noah Denny asks, how would you suggest a high school student

137
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,066
to get a career in the video game industry?

138
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,389
Connor McClaskey is also asking, what is the number one mistake

139
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,991
you see beginners who want to get into a narrative design career make?

140
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,153
Those are both kind of career starting questions.

141
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:16,975
I figured I would throw them both in the pool at once.

142
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:20,978
So you could formulate the answer that you see covers that topic.

143
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:24,421
Yeah, I'd say for getting into the games industry,

144
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:28,839
However you can, which isn't super helpful.

145
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,126
And the thing is, we're such a young industry, and it is developing so quickly that even though

146
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:44,413
I joined a little more than seven years ago, my experience was I applied to an online opening,

147
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:48,436
interviewed, did a narrative test, and got the job.

148
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,175
That is certainly not how many of my colleagues have gotten in.

149
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:56,996
Many people have gotten in through other studios

150
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,077
where they garnered other experience.

151
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:01,579
Or if they wanted to get into narrative design

152
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,560
or a different role, they maybe started in something else.

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,102
Like QA is a common entry point for a lot of people.

154
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:11,524
But honestly, if you can get into another design role,

155
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:14,105
that's often one of the most narrative adjacent

156
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,926
if you want to get some of that experience.

157
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,807
So I think...

158
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:29,905
Understand which of those roles you're targeting, but be open to adjacent roles that may still

159
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:36,848
allow you to get more experience, and also allow you to show that you are a capable person who can

160
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:44,811
learn and address challenges as they come at you. It's obviously very important. As far as mistakes,

161
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:51,041
I think one thing is just not honing writing fundamentals enough.

162
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:57,686
I think fortunately, we're getting to a point where game narrative and narrative design

163
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:57,926
is...

164
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:04,920
You know, becoming enough of an established discipline that you don't hear as much anymore like, oh, well, it's good enough for games.

165
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,822
Like, you know, no, we expect quality.

166
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:21,112
And so, you know, honestly, just basic sentence level, you know, being able to write strong, error free dialogue that is mechanically correct, that conveys a sense of character that.

167
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:24,813
that implies things without over-explaining them,

168
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,860
and also, honestly, that gives players- well, for an RPG in particular.

169
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:33,567
that gives players sort of hooks to establish their own role

170
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:34,788
and involvement around.

171
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,630
Like, you know, the least interesting conversations

172
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,253
in a lot of RPGs are the ones where an NPC is telling you

173
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,715
their very detailed backstory and your options are basically,

174
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:46,476
uh-huh, listen, go on, yes.

175
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,179
You know, the more interesting ones, I think of like improv,

176
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,641
where as a player, you're presented with a scenario

177
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,984
or confrontation or, you know, a question of some kind

178
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,885
and you are interacting with this other NPC.

179
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,197
And you're sort of expressing yourself as a character in this world through your interaction with them.

180
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:10,942
Gotcha. When you brought up that example of the character reading backstory and you're

181
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:16,847
and the only examples are, tell me more, I thought of that My Dinner with Andre interactive

182
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:21,291
game joke from The Simpsons from like the 90s or something and how they beat Telltale to that

183
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:26,616
format. Anyway, that's too deep of a joke. Jung Shang Lin would like to know, in the outer worlds

184
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:31,740
is there any notable difference in terms of your approach to narrative design compared to Pillars

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,401
of Eternity 1 and 2?

186
00:12:34,440 --> 00:13:00,951
Um, yes. So and some of this may be a little, maybe fairly micro. I mean, one big thing is in the Pillars games, you know, those were top down isometric games where you were very zoomed out from the player or from from the characters on the screen. And so, you know, that definitely limited what we could show happening on screen. But it also meant that we had a bit more freedom to use descriptive prose to describe someone's

187
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:07,243
Gesture, expression, describe kind of what they're doing within like a believable sort of bubble around them.

188
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:20,150
With The Outer Worlds, you know, obviously we want to, you know, write dialogue and then use, you know, gestures and facial animations to show those shifts in emotion and to show characters actually

189
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,144
doing things in the world. Which, you know, in some ways, and maybe this is also because,

190
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:30,587
you know, I come from a background writing novels and short stories, I did really miss that ability

191
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:35,471
to write descriptive prose and to let that do some of, you know, some of the storytelling,

192
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:40,414
heavy lifting, and also just some of the, handle some of the emotional beats, you know, of someone

193
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:46,218
who is saying one thing but emoting another. Because that's obviously very hard to do.

194
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:51,721
You know, even with very, you know, unless you're, you know, performance capturing everything.

195
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:57,705
So that was one big difference. And I think the other was just sort of the understanding,

196
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:03,488
obviously, of who the player is and what, what sort of range of characterizations we're letting

197
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:09,291
them embody in the world. Again, pillars drawing a bit more from tabletop. We tried to widen that

198
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:14,194
range a bit and we say, you know, you are the watcher and this is the context for which you

199
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:14,414
have.

200
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,672
Unique insight and abilities in this world and, you know, why you can help people solve these problems that they have.

201
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,352
But, you know, again, trying to follow that tabletop formula.

202
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:28,993
We have a variety of dispositions and a variety of, you know, skills.

203
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:35,615
And so we want to make sure that however you are sort of building yourself accordingly, that you feel you can express that character.

204
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:41,396
For The Outer Worlds, we still wanted to take a pretty light touch in terms of assuming who the player character is.

205
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:57,559
You know, as an outsider, they don't actually have a role, you know, like the Watcher that gives them a really, really unique skill set, except that they are an outsider to a world where they can sort of see the absurdity of it just because they are not of it.

206
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,841
But yeah, you know, one of the big models for who the player character is in that world was

207
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:11,602
Mal Reynolds from Firefly. You know, the idea of someone who's not a saint, not a villain,

208
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:19,705
someone with sort of a morally gray spectrum who can embody either end or some range in between

209
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:20,945
as the player wants to.

210
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:27,918
Ellen Ducarpe asks one of my favorite questions in here, which is, as a narrative designer,

211
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,482
how much say do you have in things like item and weapon descriptions,

212
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:34,207
or anything that could be considered systemic that adds to the narrative as a whole?

213
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:39,377
So at Obsidian, we do try to, you know, and this is different at every studio.

214
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:44,538
I should also say that at Obsidian, narrative designers and writers are the same role.

215
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,239
Many studios separate them out.

216
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:46,719
We do not.

217
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:52,621
We try to integrate a narrative pretty early in our process because, you know,

218
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:57,142
again, it's, it's really just about making sure that we have a, a world that feels

219
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,223
cohesive and.

220
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:02,999
you know, a story that feels reflective of the game the player is actually playing.

221
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,322
So, you know, narrative designers will tend to have a lot more,

222
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:14,105
a lot more authorial control over anything that is like a quest item

223
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:17,187
or, you know, obviously a note or a readable in world.

224
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:21,309
We aren't always quite as closely involved with, you know,

225
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:23,770
things like weapon descriptions,

226
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,211
especially the stuff that is a bit more systemic.

227
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:30,494
That's the kind of thing where it honestly just sort of depends on your staffing where

228
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:34,176
you might have your narrative designers do a pass on that stuff later, but

229
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:40,820
because it is a bit less closely tied to quest content that the player is likely to be playing,

230
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,924
it's not quite as necessary to have a really detailed writing pass on this particular sword.

231
00:16:49,894 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm going to go to a question from Joshua Garcia Sheridan who wants to, he's kind of asking about Pavarti from The Outer Worlds.

232
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,144
Their question is, what sort of pitch was presented for the inclusion of an asexual character in The Outer Worlds?

233
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:05,126
Were there any arguments conducted in the course of that application?

234
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:12,873
I know that writing belongs to a couple other writers on the team, but if there's anything you'd like to throw in about like, you know, Obsidian deciding to add an asexual character to the game.

235
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:15,492
And also in the context of, for those who don't know,

236
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,273
that this character does have a full romance arc,

237
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,114
even though they're asexual, which is,

238
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,254
that seems totally obvious

239
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:22,555
if you're familiar with asexuality,

240
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,336
but I can see why that's not obvious at first blush.

241
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,917
Yeah, so Parvati was written by Chris Lutwal

242
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:31,378
and Kate Dollarhyde, who did an incredible job with her,

243
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,819
also got a little bit of supporting writing

244
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:33,819
from Natai Padar.

245
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,782
She was concepted before I joined the outer worlds.

246
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:41,022
But I mean, you know, we...

247
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:49,797
I think where that character started is just wanting to give her a very authentic and sort

248
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:52,198
of emotionally resonant experience.

249
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:58,380
Because Parvati's arc is about, you know, she's from this small town and she gets out

250
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,101
of Edgewater and gets to finally see the rest of the galaxy.

251
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:03,742
And part of what makes her so interesting is that...

252
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:11,210
She's so kind and pure and good in a world that is corrupt and cruel and nasty.

253
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:20,216
And there's this, you know, I certainly, you know, when I first played those early builds, I was like, well, how is this character going to react, you know, when she gets out there?

254
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:27,741
And also, how do we make her how do we make her feel like she is part of the same world when she is so clearly different from it?

255
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,523
So, you know, I think just.

256
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:39,063
Giving her a story and a quest that related to her sort of embracing and accepting more of who she is,

257
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:46,268
that led her to an authentic and emotionally fulfilling relationship. Again, even in a world

258
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:55,694
that does not seem to place a lot of value on those. I don't recall any specific discussion

259
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,997
about her as an asexual character. It's like, oh, should we? No, it's like,

260
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,915
This is who the character is and this is the story we're telling about her.

261
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,016
And so we just want to tell it well.

262
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:15,059
Getting off topic from Adderall's characters, Stephen Morosola would like to know, how do

263
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:19,341
you handle or deal with writer's block if you or anyone on the writing team has experienced

264
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,182
it during development?

265
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:27,245
Well, so one thing, sometimes honestly it helps just to move on to a different task

266
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,145
or a different piece of content if you can.

267
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,486
I know I have a tendency to try to.

268
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:34,035
You know, kind of bang my head against a wall trying to solve one problem.

269
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:38,539
When sometimes the best thing to do is just step back from it and let those details marinate in

270
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,904
the back of your mind as you're doing something else. Another technique I like to use, especially

271
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:49,368
if I really do need to get some quest or character writing done, is even if I'm having writer's block

272
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:54,372
around, you know, who that character is, what makes the conversation with the player character

273
00:19:54,432 --> 00:20:00,457
interesting and engaging, I generally at least know how and where the conversation begins.

274
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,471
And where we need to get the player by the end of it.

275
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:17,217
And so sometimes I like to do something that I think of as a rough pass, which is it's, you know, it's not, it's not purely placeholder text as in, you know, Sanjar says this or Sanjar tells player to go here.

276
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,837
It's, you know, it's.

277
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,592
It's just sort of, it's something between that and, you know, an actual invoice writing pass.

278
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:28,813
And it's just, it's kind of, it's what other writers I think talk about when they say turning

279
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:32,333
off your inner editor, where it's like, this doesn't have to be good, this doesn't have to

280
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:38,815
be final, this just has to let me explore a way to get from A to B without worrying that I'm setting

281
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,896
anything in stone and without worrying that this is what, you know, people are going to review

282
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,676
in another week. And sometimes, honestly, just

283
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:50,120
Getting that structure out there lets me return to it later and then see,

284
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,943
oh, well, here's some clear beats and arcs and moments that are happening,

285
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:58,467
you know, even in this, you know, roughed out version that I can build on and have fun with.

286
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:03,071
Or, oh, okay, well, now that the work of sort of structuring this out at a high level is done,

287
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:07,774
now I feel like I have a bit more room to think and play with what makes it fun.

288
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:24,137
Gotcha. Philip and Icek would like to know when a concept of a game is created at the very beginning, before, or during pre-production, what questions do you usually need answered to establish the pillars or main points for the core game idea?

289
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,239
I mean, hmm.

290
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:33,342
I mean, I guess it's, you know, what kind of, what kind of, I guess the biggest question

291
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:35,963
is what is the experience that you want players to have?

292
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:40,644
Like you know, what is, what is your elevator pitch of this is why you're going to play

293
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:44,464
the game and this is, this is the promise of what we're offering with it.

294
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:52,086
I feel like you almost, you start with the very, the very focused, well, the very high

295
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:54,486
level stuff and you sort of build out as you go down.

296
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,567
So you have that experience and you know, then you say, okay, well.

297
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:03,404
You know, they're basic things like, OK, well, what platforms are we offering this on?

298
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:04,904
You know, what's what's kind of the genre?

299
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,845
Is this an RPG? Is this an action? Is this somewhere in between?

300
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,905
You know, what kind of setting is this?

301
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:13,486
Is this sci fi? Is this fantasy? Is this, you know, an existing IP?

302
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,247
And, you know, kind of as you build out those questions,

303
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:19,768
you're also thinking about I think the pillars are

304
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:24,109
one of the things that should come very early in the process

305
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,730
because, you know, your pillars are.

306
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,591
The design goals and elements that support that basic experience.

307
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:37,035
And you may massage how you frame them, how you word them.

308
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:40,717
And as you're building out the specifications of the game,

309
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,538
you may need to take a couple of checkpoints

310
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:45,820
and say, OK, are these specifications,

311
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,202
are these different features that we want to invest in,

312
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,163
is this still reflective of?

313
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:56,199
The core experience and the pillars that we are saying support that core experience.

314
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,925
Does that answer the question?

315
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:00,316
I'm super excited.

316
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:03,097
The GDC podcast is going to be recording live later on.

317
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:29,303
And they're going to be recording with Derek Yu, creator of Spelunky and Spelunky 2.

318
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:34,565
So Cari, before we go, if they've got more questions for you, where should they send

319
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:34,785
them?

320
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:35,825
Where can they find you?

321
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:37,125
Or Obsidian in general?

322
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:39,406
Not literally, but on the internet.

323
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:39,786
Sure.

324
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:40,186
Right, right.

325
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:44,107
You can find me on Twitter at Cari underscore Patel.

326
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:47,348
And you can also find Obsidian on Twitter at Obsidian.

327
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:49,052
Adam Sidney, gotcha.

328
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:50,973
Okay, questions until the end.

329
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,694
What would you say is unique for the medium

330
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:54,695
when it comes to writing

331
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,316
as opposed to traditional prose fiction?

332
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:57,937
I love that question because you mentioned

333
00:23:57,977 --> 00:23:59,257
you've done prose writing as well.

334
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:00,678
That comes from Peter Varga.

335
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,480
So I think, and again, this sort of varies depending on,

336
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,262
I, you know, my game experience has been on RPGs

337
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,464
and on RPGs specifically that offer the player

338
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:13,525
a pretty wide latitude in who they are in the world.

339
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,527
So with that in mind, I think the biggest,

340
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:20,585
The biggest difference is just understanding who the protagonist is.

341
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:25,108
You know, in a novel or any other piece of prose fiction, obviously you have

342
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,792
a very carefully choreographed arc that you're sending that main character on.

343
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:31,253
You know the beats they're going to hit.

344
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:32,754
You know how they're going to react to them.

345
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:37,117
And you were telling a story around that when you were writing an RPG

346
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:39,419
like Pillars of Eternity or like The Outer Worlds.

347
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:45,969
You have beats that you know the player is going to hit, but you want to offer the player some room

348
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,853
in expressing how they feel about those beats and how they want to react to them.

349
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:56,220
And so there's, it's actually pretty exciting, like it's a lot of fun to look at a particular

350
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,823
moment and think, well, this is how I feel about it, but how might someone else feel about it?

351
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:00,444
And

352
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:12,230
You know, what touch points and what thematic reflections can we offer elsewhere in the game to just sort of prepare the player for this moment and give them a new context in which to think about it?

353
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:21,654
Gotcha. I love this question from Zeyad El-Badrawi. I'm going to tweak it slightly, but Zeyad, I just

354
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:25,815
wanted to say I really like it. Zeyad wants to know, how do you go about constructing a narrative?

355
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:29,677
Do you start with an idea, a question, a theme, etc.? Is there a different process you go through?

356
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:33,799
For me, a big part of that question, I guess, is what inspires you as a writer? What gets you

357
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:37,280
energized? Where do those good ideas and good story moments come from for you?

358
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,927
Gosh, um, man, they can come from a lot of things.

359
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:45,389
Like I, I do think it's important, you know, as, as a writer, honestly, as, as

360
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:50,631
a designer of any kind in games, as a, as a creator in any kind of media, um, to

361
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:55,774
consume widely, you know, don't just play games also read books and watch movies.

362
00:25:55,974 --> 00:26:01,037
And don't just, you know, play the genre you make, like try other things as well.

363
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:06,019
Um, I do think it's important to, you know, kind of get outside of a very narrow

364
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,320
lane and, you know,

365
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:14,380
draw inspiration from and experience the variety and the options that other media and other genres

366
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:24,344
offer you. I get inspired by great characters and by really evocative settings. And so, for me,

367
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:30,667
finding works of fiction that offer me those things keeps me creatively engaged.

368
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:36,766
Gotcha. We're going to close out with our last question for the day coming from Kirstie Logan Fowler.

369
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:41,029
Kind of going to spring word off of our discussion about Pavarti from earlier,

370
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:45,893
Kirstie Logan Fowler is asking, how do you approach diversity and representation in your writing?

371
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,858
You know, trying to be as inclusive as we can about, you know,

372
00:26:54,232 --> 00:27:02,458
Who the player is, who the player might be, and the world that we're setting our story in.

373
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:06,821
Be inclusive. And also, I think, obviously, getting outside of tropes,

374
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:10,563
getting outside of stereotypes. I think just being very mindful about

375
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:14,966
what your first impulse is and then asking, well, why is it this?

376
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:25,288
If your first thought is, well, the knight character is obviously this guy who looks like this.

377
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:29,333
It's like, well, but why? It's not that we can't have that character in there.

378
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:34,279
It's not that he can't be a knight, but it's just, is that popping into my head for the...

379
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,403
Is that the first thing popping into my head because there's some real meat there?

380
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:51,548
Or is it just because that's the first place my brain went because it's a thing I've seen a dozen times and what I'm really doing is just sort of riffing off of a very, you know, commonly seen trope and example.

381
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:58,952
So, again, I think be mindful, dig deeper, be compassionate with the characters you write and the stories you tell.

382
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:03,594
It doesn't mean everybody has to have an every you know, everybody has to have a happy ending.

383
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,456
But it does mean that we treat our characters in their stories with.

384
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:09,002
and emotional nuance.

385
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:10,303
Roger that.

386
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:14,007
We're going to do a rapid exit, but that's it for today.

387
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,189
Thank you all so much for joining us.

388
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:16,609
Stick around.

389
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:17,430
There's more great stuff.

390
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,491
Carrie, thank you.

391
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:20,092
Can't wait to see what's next for you in Obsidian.

392
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:20,413
Thank you.

393
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:21,594
Bye, everyone.
