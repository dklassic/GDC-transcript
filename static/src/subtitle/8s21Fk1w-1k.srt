1
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,900
Right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to reveal a secret about GDC you may not be aware of,

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,386
and that is that every year, at random, they pick one speaker who has not received any valuation forms,

3
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,909
they take them out into Yebubwena, and they shoot them in the back of the head.

4
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,038
So please, for my children, fill in the evaluation forms.

5
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:34,601
The second thing that we are required to say is that your mobile phones,

6
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,843
you're the noise makers, please turn them off. I'm of a nervous disposition.

7
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:43,125
If I hear a sudden noise from the audience, I may leap from the stage and that will end badly.

8
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:51,450
Welcome, hello, I'm Alexis Kennedy. I run Failbetter Games which is a studio in London

9
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:58,032
and we're an indie studio. We're up from four people in 2014 to 16 people now so that puts us

10
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:05,373
kind of firmly the mid-sized indie and what I'm going to talk about today is going to be most

11
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:13,095
useful to you if you are either a studio of about that size or looking to be a studio at that size.

12
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:18,256
I want to make this clear, there has never been any successfully substantiated

13
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:20,537
allegation of cannibalism against our studio.

14
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,737
These things are subject to libel actions.

15
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:24,198
We made a game called Fallen London.

16
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:31,400
It's a web-based narrative thing that's been around for years

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,440
and we're best known at the moment for a game called Sunless Sea.

18
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:42,003
Sunless Sea made using a bundle of techniques that are very popular and successful in indie

19
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:46,124
studios, which I'm calling open production because I like things that sound like buzz

20
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:47,425
phrases.

21
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:53,147
Kickstarter, early access, paid betas, getting feedback from the community early, interacting

22
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,067
directly with your community.

23
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:03,390
They're not for everybody. I think they're great. I spoke to Justin Ma from Subset Games earlier

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,533
today and he said he thought the idea was horrible and he couldn't imagine doing it. I can't imagine

25
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:14,375
doing it any other way so this really is about finding what fits with your studio's way of

26
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:14,715
working.

27
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:20,419
And money is always available from somewhere.

28
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:25,063
If the idea of working this way appeals to you, then do it.

29
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,425
If it doesn't appeal to you, look somewhere else to find funding.

30
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:32,868
There's a bunch of really specific good and bad things about building games

31
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,330
in front of your community with your community's collaboration.

32
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:41,422
Before we made Sunless Sea, we were in a terrible place.

33
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:45,524
We were four people, we'd be doing bits of client work.

34
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:48,405
I just had to lay off three of my friends.

35
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:53,948
And Fallen London, our own game,

36
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,488
was not making enough money to pay the bills.

37
00:02:55,488 --> 00:03:00,170
So Sunless Sea was a bit of a Hail Mary pass.

38
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,751
I don't play American football,

39
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,291
so I may have used that completely wrongly.

40
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,452
It was a bit of a last desperate roll of the dice.

41
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,944
We were going to go bust by the end of the year.

42
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,906
We'd never made an actual video game.

43
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:13,808
All our work had been web-based stuff.

44
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:18,073
Browser-based traditional web development.

45
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,875
We'd never built a Unity game.

46
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:34,192
We thought we probably could, we thought we knew enough about game design and world building, we thought we could make a go of it, we built a prototype to make sure we could, but it was very uncertain, and it worked out.

47
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:46,757
So this is not an epoch-making headline success, but it is a solid indie success that most studios of our size would be very pleased with. We fucking were.

48
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:53,840
And the key thing is, this is a very tenable success.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
If you are working in a team of two, or three, or four,

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,782
if you are wondering whether it's ever possible to make a living making video games,

51
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:06,044
there's a bunch of stuff you can do, there's a bunch of opportunities available to you

52
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:09,125
that allow you to do this sort of thing.

53
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:15,144
Couple of points I want you to take away above everything else.

54
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:20,247
This is our loop. We build stuff, we listen to our community, we build more stuff.

55
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:26,031
So first of all, we've been around for four years when we started building Sunless Sea.

56
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,672
And we were, as I said, in a dire place.

57
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:34,957
We didn't have much money, we didn't have many resources, but we did have four years worth of community.

58
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:40,300
If you've been working on your own, even if it's only for six months, let alone if it's four years.

59
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:45,636
You have built up a backlog of people who know you and know your work.

60
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:49,419
When you issue the call to Kickstarter, we'll come out and help you.

61
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,562
Or the call to Early Access or any other kind of open production mechanism.

62
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:57,526
Even if you feel like you've been plugging away and getting nowhere,

63
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,606
you have been getting somewhere.

64
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:02,790
Having a community is almost as good as having money in the bank.

65
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,193
You can't spend them, but they will help you.

66
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:12,798
And they'll help you in terms of feedback, they'll help you in terms of spreading the word, which is hugely important.

67
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:17,460
They'll help you in terms of keeping your morale high in the dark times.

68
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,102
So if you've been struggling, you haven't done nothing, you've just not got there yet.

69
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,304
And the other thing I want to talk about is sustainability.

70
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:31,907
When we made 100 grand out of Kickstarter, we felt like we had all the money in the world.

71
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:37,769
Our monthly studio burn team and rent is now about Â£60,000.

72
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:42,551
So, all the money in the world doesn't last very long.

73
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,672
Burn is much lower then obviously.

74
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,953
But if you're an indie team and you suddenly get a giant chunk of cash,

75
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:54,915
even if it's a giant chunk of cash after Kickstarter and the credit card companies have taken their cut,

76
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,436
it is just the beginning of your journey.

77
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,357
Same thing with the game launch.

78
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:02,718
We sold 40,000 copies in the first week of early access.

79
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,642
far outstripping our most optimistic projections

80
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,991
because our optimistic projections are pretty conservative.

81
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,177
But again, that was just the beginning of our journey,

82
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:14,539
that the money we made from that

83
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,300
wouldn't have lasted long.

84
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,322
And if you are running an open production process

85
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:22,044
for a game, if you're making games for an audience,

86
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,206
you want to bring the audience with you into the future.

87
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:27,128
You want to build a studio that will survive

88
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,589
the next two, three, four games,

89
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,551
and you want to have an audience that will help you

90
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,553
and trust you as you build those two, three, four games.

91
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:50,417
Here are six things. These are all challenges or problems or techniques we found to deal with some of the specific issues of open production.

92
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,660
And this is, I think, probably the most important of those.

93
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,140
Marketing.

94
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:02,236
I bet a lot of you in this room think of like flossing.

95
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:04,158
A lot of you don't, a lot of you have been around this mill.

96
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:08,322
But marketing is a thing you do at the end of your game production cycle

97
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,564
in order to make sure that people actually buy it.

98
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,026
It's not. It's not.

99
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:17,691
The window of opportunity when an indie game could just get on Steam

100
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,933
and sell through sheer luck is over.

101
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:25,490
the chances that your game will be so brilliant it will get picked up

102
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,511
uh... become world headlines and spread through sheer word of mouth

103
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,712
it is possible

104
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:32,072
but it's a very low chance

105
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:35,313
uh... this yellow text is a

106
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:37,334
very pungent quote from my director of communications

107
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,015
and uh...

108
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,576
I would say something slightly different

109
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:44,717
uh... I would say you would not put out a game

110
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,057
without debugging it

111
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,718
that would be criminal and stupid

112
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,759
you shouldn't put out a game without marketing it either

113
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:57,048
And when I say the indie checkbox, what I mean is that a lot of folk, and I've been guilty of this in the past, God knows,

114
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:08,179
read all the genuinely valuable advice on the Gama Sutra, five things you absolutely must do if you're an indie game company post,

115
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:14,405
do those five things, sell 300 copies, the game disappears in the dark without a screen.

116
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,581
And then you see one of those fucking heartbreaking posts on Gamasutra that says

117
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,163
we sung a year of our life into this game and nobody heard of it and nobody found anything.

118
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:25,544
So it's not enough to send out some press releases at the end and feel like you've

119
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:31,327
done your job. You need to be thinking about how to explain your game in a sentence or two

120
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:36,509
from the get-go. What makes a hook? What the central creative core of the game is?

121
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:37,729
And how to express it to other people?

122
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:43,685
and you will iterate your new game all the way through.

123
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:47,748
One of the things that open production allows you to do is iterate on marketing as well.

124
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:51,430
You tell your community what you're going to make, and there you go.

125
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,510
Huh?

126
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,611
And then you fix that.

127
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,473
When we first talked to our community about Summer Sea,

128
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:59,534
we talked to a very small number of core fans.

129
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,742
and we said it was going to be 2D Elite with steamships.

130
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,403
And nobody under the age of 40

131
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:09,464
or outside the UK at that time had heard of Elite.

132
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,425
Now you have because of Elite Dangerous,

133
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,346
but then it was completely novel.

134
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,727
So we took Elite out of the pitch.

135
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,948
And one of the advantages of doing open production

136
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:23,129
is you expose your proposition, your hook,

137
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,770
to gradually large numbers of people.

138
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,431
In our case, it was core fans,

139
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,031
then larger core fans we tested our Kickstarter message on.

140
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,653
then Kickstarter backers, then early access people.

141
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:37,799
And every stage we had the opportunity to learn and change our message

142
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,843
before we went full launch and before we were stuck with whatever we dealt with.

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,535
And the tagline of Sunless Sea is lose your mind, eat your crew.

144
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:51,779
That came quite late in development, just before early access I think.

145
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,122
We didn't get to there without getting a lot of feedback from our community

146
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:57,285
and working out what appealed to them about the game.

147
00:09:57,285 --> 00:10:01,709
And lose your mind, eat your crew, we hear again and again people saying

148
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,492
you know, as soon as I heard that, you had me, I bought the game.

149
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:13,500
The community, this is a point that Raph van Lierop made in his talk last year about Long Dark,

150
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,383
another very successful, in fact much more successful early access game.

151
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:29,209
Your community can give you feedback on your game, on your messaging, on your design, on your game experience,

152
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:33,811
and that feedback is absolutely essential. It's as essential as the funding they can give you.

153
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:38,744
But they will also try to tell you how to fix it.

154
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,346
They know when something is wrong.

155
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:43,488
If your community tells you something is wrong

156
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,010
and you don't listen, you're probably blind.

157
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,012
But if your community tells you they know what's wrong,

158
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,574
they might or might not be right.

159
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:54,335
If your community tells you how to fix it,

160
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,099
then they'll almost always be wrong.

161
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,960
It's your job as developers.

162
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,051
to work out how to fix it. It's their job to tell you when they don't like it.

163
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:08,192
So never confuse the two. They're not an advice council,

164
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,653
they're a canary. They tell you when things are broken, they don't tell you

165
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:11,053
how to fix it.

166
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:24,129
exposed our game to ever larger numbers of players of community. So we started out with about 30,

167
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:30,271
we went to about 100, then we hit Kickstarter, that grew the community, then the Kickstarter

168
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:37,893
took off, that grew the community again. But in the very beginning we told our early community,

169
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:42,154
our core community, and we told them that Kickstarter was coming. So first of all,

170
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:51,404
If you are thinking of running a Kickstarter, and nobody should be in 2016 thinking of doing this,

171
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,486
if you're thinking of running a Kickstarter and not telling anybody about it until the day,

172
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:58,229
bang your head against a wall until the desire to do that goes away.

173
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,333
I don't think anybody is still doing this, but statistically somebody is.

174
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:06,938
We did it with our first Kickstarter and it's preposterous. As soon as you run a Kickstarter,

175
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,102
start a Kickstarter, the clock is running. You've got 30 days to make all that money.

176
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:14,166
What a shame to fail and ground you from the finish post. So tell your community.

177
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,084
that you're going to be running a Kickstarter.

178
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,007
Tell any friendly press contacts you have

179
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,508
that you're going to be running a Kickstarter.

180
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,030
I know it's very hard to get press to listen

181
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,970
to anything about Kickstarters.

182
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,472
If you have contacts, use them.

183
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:27,393
Tell them when it's going to start

184
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,675
and make sure that on the day,

185
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,977
like seven minutes past the point where you hit the button,

186
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:32,818
you have pledges on there.

187
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,381
Because nothing succeeds like

188
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,904
the indication of a future success.

189
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,726
If people are pledging, other people pledge.

190
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:48,370
And what you want, specifically what you want, is to have people posting this image on their

191
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,251
forum of choice on the internet.

192
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,912
This particular one.

193
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:56,034
Once you see this, you know you have a valuable proposition.

194
00:12:56,034 --> 00:13:02,958
So build your chosen kettle, tell people up front, gather their enthusiasm, be ready to

195
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,199
unleash hell when you hit the Kickstarter button and you get that.

196
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,260
This.

197
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,082
How many of you went to the Darkest Dungeon talk yesterday?

198
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:16,407
Okay, enough people that I'll skip over this somewhat.

199
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,911
The Darkest Dungeon, guys.

200
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,890
made an amazing game with kick-ass design

201
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,653
and they found a problem with the design halfway through development

202
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:29,814
and they fixed it

203
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:34,818
and the fix was necessary and it was very painful to their community

204
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,679
and their community went absolutely batshit

205
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,861
they held their nerve

206
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,885
and they kept going, they didn't listen too hard to their veterans

207
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:48,048
that was the right thing to go do and that's why Darkest Dungeon has gone on to sell

208
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,871
nearly a million copies and has undergone tremendous critical acclaim.

209
00:13:54,871 --> 00:14:03,074
Sunless Sea. We didn't do quite as well on that. One of the problems of Sunless Sea

210
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:08,276
is that if you die you start over. That's okay, that's fine, it's a little bit of a

211
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:13,498
roguelite with permadeath, but the experience of starting over means going

212
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:17,520
through the same content over and over again. There's not much randomness at the

213
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,860
beginning.

214
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:22,628
Big design flaw, I own that, it made the game much less than it could have been.

215
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:27,933
And the reason we didn't realize how big a problem it was, is that we were listening to the veterans too much.

216
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:35,460
People were talking about the end game experience, people were talking about how, what it was like when you played through most of the content.

217
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,742
We forgot to focus on the early game experience.

218
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:42,234
Your veterans will be the most vocal people on your forums and in your feedback.

219
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,697
They will really care about the game. They supported you from very early on.

220
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,700
You should listen to them, but you should not listen to them too much.

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,805
You should bear in mind, they're not going to be new customers ever again.

222
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:54,909
They're not going to give you unbiased feedback.

223
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:57,752
And you think you know this. We thought we knew this. We thought we'd adjusted.

224
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:04,573
Think harder. Assume it's always going to be easier to overrate than you can.

225
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,754
Really don't listen to them too hard.

226
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,154
Kickstarter itself. So here are the obvious benefits.

227
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,575
A chunk of backers. A chunk of money.

228
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:15,737
A third of our backers came through Kickstarter.

229
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:19,898
I'm not sure what the figures will be these days. Now it's a couple of years on.

230
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,519
But Kickstarter is a marketing platform itself.

231
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,020
So you can, if you get a staff pick, and if you've got a good pitch, you'll probably get a staff pick.

232
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,860
Get a good chance of getting new backers.

233
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:34,081
Once we crossed about 50 grand, I don't know what the number would be these days,

234
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,983
once we crossed about 50 grand we started getting press coverage without needing to chase people.

235
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,526
So once your Kickstarter is a success, if you actually start raising enough people to pay

236
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:48,731
attention, then the press stop ignoring you as one of another million Kickstarter projects.

237
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:53,495
You can get that far, it makes a big difference. And of course we got lots and lots of early

238
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,177
feedback on design which is vital. But the less obvious...

239
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,018
less obvious benefits of Kickstarter.

240
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:05,219
We got, as I mentioned earlier, early feedback on the message.

241
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:09,221
So we didn't just go with our first-pass marketing message and put it out there.

242
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,422
We listened to what people said worked and we changed it.

243
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:17,885
We were forced to explain what our vision for the game was very early on

244
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,326
and then forced to stick to it. Now this is a double-edged sword.

245
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:25,179
I've heard a lot of people in the last couple of days say they would hate that.

246
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:28,701
And for some studios, creative process, it doesn't work at all.

247
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:35,345
For us, it did. For us, it kept us honest because I am scatty and prone to run after new, shiny ideas.

248
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:37,407
And it was very beneficial to have that.

249
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:44,031
But if you go on Kickstarter and commit to a vision, you are stuck with that vision for the foreseeable future.

250
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,024
The other thing that's an unalloyed benefit, it's not a double-edged sword at all, and I can't overstate it enough,

251
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:52,309
if you've been labouring in the dark for months with no money,

252
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,553
suddenly 4,000 people want to give you money, that is wonderful.

253
00:16:55,553 --> 00:17:02,582
Feedback on design, very quickly, that was our change in the combat system.

254
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:08,379
This was our equivalent of Darkest Dungeon's difficult balance change.

255
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:12,800
We went from the combat system on the left to the combat system on the right.

256
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,801
Very late in development, cost a couple of months, very difficult, very painful, absolutely

257
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,942
worthwhile.

258
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:24,763
Lifted the game from people going the combat's awful to people going the combat's okay but

259
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:25,424
a bit meh.

260
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,404
And you know, I'll take that.

261
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:33,446
Two things about that. First of all, again, something that's come up a lot in the last few talks

262
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:36,228
is the difficulty of making major feature changes in early access.

263
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:41,091
So I think of it like this. You have goodwill that you spend like currency from your community.

264
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:45,495
If you treat them well, if you treat them honestly, then you accrue more of that goodwill

265
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:49,938
and you can spend it on major feature changes. But you can't do it wildly. Doesn't mean you

266
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,901
shouldn't do it at all. Just make sure you have the goodwill in the bank and be ready

267
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:57,384
to cushion them when you go through. Stretch goals.

268
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,079
I hate stretch goals.

269
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,603
I think it's very easy to get focused on that number that's like a score, the funding total

270
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:09,608
at the end of a Kickstarter at the expense of making the game and to make promises about

271
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:14,011
expansions or platform ports or other things you might want to do.

272
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:18,795
You get 20 more grand funding, that will disappear in a month, in six months you've got a very

273
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:19,055
small team.

274
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:23,439
There are two kinds of stretch goals that I'm in favour of.

275
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,761
One is things you're secretly going to do anyway.

276
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,943
The other is things that cost almost no money

277
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,803
and are cool and attract attention.

278
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:31,243
Like this.

279
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,064
So I know one of our backers

280
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,084
paid three and a half grand

281
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:34,584
in order to get this ink on my leg

282
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:35,605
and that cost me 60 pounds.

283
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:35,985
And that's a bargain.

284
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:59,538
So if you can find stretch goals that are interesting and low cost,

285
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:04,000
then do them. Otherwise, think very carefully before committing to promises for the future.

286
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,061
The ending first.

287
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:10,164
The common wisdom is that narrative in early access doesn't work.

288
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:12,505
For us, it did.

289
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:16,527
We did well in early access, we did better in full launch.

290
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:21,115
And I think the reason that this worked better for us is that we did the ending first.

291
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,976
This is a good rule for writing generally if you're doing content,

292
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,877
but it's particularly important in early access.

293
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:29,278
The moment we launched the game, people could finish it, unless they found a bug.

294
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:33,500
But, in theory they could finish it, they could actually achieve a victory condition.

295
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:40,163
So you could get to the end and then over the next year we blocked in all the content in the middle.

296
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:43,784
So people could play the game through to the end, then come back and find more content.

297
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:49,106
And also they could trust us. It didn't look like we had just started writing a story and

298
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:53,427
we're going to make it up as we went along and work out what to do when you got to that point.

299
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:56,828
So if you're going to do a content-based, narrative-based Kickstarter,

300
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:02,276
always make sure you have an ending that you understand

301
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,638
you can always change the ending

302
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:09,302
if you have a better idea a year on, you can change it

303
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:13,646
but it's better to have an ending than no ending

304
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:19,261
Your team will go nuts obsessing on every item of feedback if they can

305
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,742
and chase them out of the forums.

306
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:24,424
Give them like 20 minutes to read the feedback and then say,

307
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,285
no, come on, you can look at it tomorrow.

308
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,887
Slap the rest of your team if you see them looking.

309
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,928
Make a joke of it, put them in the naughty corner,

310
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:34,270
but protect them because people get really hung up and really down on it.

311
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:40,542
If you have a community manager, a communications director, anybody like that to help filter stuff, that's obviously much preferred.

312
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,844
And, educate your community to answer.

313
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:44,064
So, if...

314
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:50,429
People... lots of people come to the game and say, I don't understand Sumnersea at all, I die constantly, it's really hard.

315
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,592
Our community would say, yes, it's supposed to be hard, and then teach them how to go through it.

316
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,954
And that would save our time responding to people.

317
00:20:56,954 --> 00:21:01,417
So put the effort into educating your community so they can do your job for you, in that respect.

318
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,699
And don't tell people more than they need to know.

319
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:09,359
If you've got your Kickstarter running, if you're putting out a new update every month or two,

320
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,481
people can see there's recent activity, people can see what you're doing.

321
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,763
They do not need to know every detail of your roadmap.

322
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:19,285
We taught people a lot and they didn't remember most of it and it took a lot of effort.

323
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:23,147
So make sure you can show it's a live project but don't go nuts trying to keep them up to date.

324
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:29,790
We did, we had a completion chart. We had like a bar graph of 10 things

325
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,913
with 70% complete, 80% complete. A tiny minority of our players ever read it.

326
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,913
Valve is also funny about this kind of thing in early access these days anyway, so I wouldn't recommend doing that.

327
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:48,839
Always, when you are releasing on a new platform, especially as indie devs who might not have done this before,

328
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,142
do some sort of soft launch or some sort of limited beta beforehand.

329
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:58,946
We did our backers beta on Humble Bundle, it was a good experience,

330
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:03,489
but there were problems with the process that we found and fixed when it was still not an issue.

331
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:10,953
We did early access on Steam. My god, I'm glad we did early access on Steam before the full launch because the

332
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:16,916
Back end of Steam. I can't say too much because obviously valves ninjas will drag me off the stage, but it's a bit like

333
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:23,218
Going inside the monolith in 2001 a space odyssey. It's very confusing. Make sure you you practice things up front

334
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:30,779
And this, if you do well, if you do well, if you're a delicate creative soul, and many

335
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,521
of the people in this room are, I certainly am, make sure that you are ready to be supported

336
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:41,583
by your friends and your team, where you suddenly look around and see that you've succeeded

337
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:46,045
and the project you've been working on for the last 6 months, 12 months, a year, 12 months

338
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:50,027
a year, 12 months, 2 years, has finished and you don't know what to do with your life.

339
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:52,748
Make sure that somebody's there to catch you in your fall.

340
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,969
It sounds like a nice problem to have.

341
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:57,190
You're successful, you get depressed,

342
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,632
but even a fairly minor success,

343
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:01,113
you get the post-project blues.

344
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,154
Quick follow-through at the end.

345
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:09,217
So, we learned a lot from open production,

346
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,578
and we thought very hard about

347
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:13,039
how to make that work in our production process,

348
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,601
both in the future for other open production projects,

349
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,221
and more generally.

350
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,402
I'll skim through these, I'm short of time.

351
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:27,807
Vision is the most important thing. Again, there have been several really good talks about it this year.

352
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:33,832
I particularly recommend the Red Hood guys, Darkest Dungeon, Creative Direction, talk if you find it in the vault.

353
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:39,316
If you have a consistent creative vision, it means that your team understands you.

354
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:43,099
You're not sitting there on your throne waiting for people to bring you concept art and say,

355
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,822
not that one, it needs to have more shush.

356
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:51,366
and your community understand it, your community can tell you whether they like it or not

357
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:53,548
and you have a ready-made message for marketing.

358
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:54,409
So double down there.

359
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,352
This is what we said we wanted in Sunless Sea from day one.

360
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:02,476
Every single creative decision we made, every technical decision we made,

361
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:05,479
every marketing decision we made, made reference to that.

362
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,143
Points of light in the darkness, the possibility of imminent death.

363
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:13,888
The sense of being something tiny and alone, a rocking ship of a boat on a giant, dark,

364
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:14,808
hungry ocean.

365
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:16,929
The sense of coming home again.

366
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:18,710
All that stuff.

367
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,630
Find your creative direction.

368
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,051
Stick to it like a facehugger.

369
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:22,231
Culture...

370
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:29,313
What I wanted to do was say something about studio culture without any of this stuff.

371
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:34,155
I've never heard anybody say, we're not passionate about games, we hate communication, excellence

372
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:34,935
is really bad.

373
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:40,438
So some really specific stuff that might not work for everybody, but work for us.

374
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,679
This is our guiding principle.

375
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,760
Safety first, then fun, then profit.

376
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,641
When I said at the beginning it's important to think about sustainability, that's what

377
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:48,501
I had in mind most.

378
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:55,204
Every decision we make about what games to build and what to do next, we think about

379
00:24:55,204 --> 00:25:01,546
the long-term financial viability of the studio, then we think about how much fun it will be

380
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:02,506
to do.

381
00:25:02,506 --> 00:25:03,407
And after that...

382
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,095
we think about how much profit it will make,

383
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:10,157
because I never want to look four of my friends in the eyes,

384
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:11,917
three of my friends in the eyes,

385
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:14,358
and tell them they've lost their jobs ever again.

386
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:18,960
So if you're an indie studio,

387
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,480
if you're not a funded startup,

388
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,381
if you're an indie studio that is trying to make

389
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:25,202
a buck day in, day out,

390
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:27,443
you are often going to have to make decisions

391
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,563
that are temperate of the expense of decisions

392
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,844
that might potentially pay off big.

393
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:36,869
We have a very clear studio identity, that second paragraph. I mean that's really specific

394
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:42,654
But our audience know what we like and they come back to and respond to it. So I

395
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:45,757
This doesn't work for everybody, but I recommend

396
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:51,061
Having a consistent studio identity and making all your games fit that mold

397
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:54,925
Some people are wildly creative and want to do a different thing

398
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:58,568
With every project. I salute you. We couldn't do it. This really worked for us

399
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,832
and we are visible to our community. I protect my team

400
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:06,354
and my communications director protects our team

401
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:10,917
from the community but they know who we are, they know our names, they often know

402
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:14,820
when we've worked on individual bits and this humanizes us and it means that

403
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,803
we can pass back attaboys from our community.

404
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:20,984
Slack, who's using Slack?

405
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:26,908
Yeah, God it's terrifying, it's everywhere.

406
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,929
It's really good, it's just awesome.

407
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,349
If you're not using it, it's a chat application

408
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,750
that's very good at integrating other streams.

409
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,470
This is what you use for tracking support.

410
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,171
Our Zendesk tickets, our Twitter responses,

411
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:43,892
forum responses, Reddit posts, and the SummerSea subreddit,

412
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:44,872
all this goes in one channel.

413
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:50,538
Everybody can see it. We chase people out of it if they're obsessing about it.

414
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:55,303
People can comment on it snarkily in real time without users seeing it.

415
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:58,507
But it gives us one place that allows us to track community directions generally.

416
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:01,731
So that's a really revelatory tool.

417
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:05,395
Other stuff, very quickly, production things.

418
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,054
Where we ended up after Summer Sea was two week sprints.

419
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:17,040
Month long sprints were too sloppy, week long sprints were too crazy.

420
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,066
We don't do sprint retrospectives because we find that after two weeks people don't really have

421
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:28,690
enough new things to say. At the end of every month we do a review of what we've achieved and not.

422
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,834
Tech and content, we're a very content-driven studio.

423
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,595
We have a full-time writing team.

424
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,636
So we have writing tasks and tech tasks.

425
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:38,617
They use very similar processes, but not entirely similar.

426
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:42,198
Tech, we really focus on a Google Sheets

427
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:45,739
spready with estimates.

428
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:51,921
Content, we use something much more like a Kanban board.

429
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:57,623
We originally had a Kanban board and a spreadsheet for

430
00:27:57,623 --> 00:27:57,803
both.

431
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,523
we found that the two together

432
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:02,483
often are a bit surplus.

433
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,963
So trim down your production tools

434
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:05,164
to the ones you're actually using.

435
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,445
This, right, I want to leave you with this.

436
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:10,986
This is what I posted on Slack

437
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:12,266
just before we launched Summer's Sea.

438
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,927
Some people have no choice but to crunch.

439
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,329
If you have any choice about crunching,

440
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:21,249
crunch is bullshit.

441
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:23,651
I've only been a game dev for seven years,

442
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:24,611
but I've been in tech for 20 years.

443
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:27,473
And the data are in.

444
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:28,454
It's really clear.

445
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:31,576
You can work overtime for a week, two weeks,

446
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,197
and you see a boost in productivity.

447
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:34,738
You work overtime for four weeks.

448
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:39,265
eight weeks, six months, your productivity drops.

449
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,345
You end up getting less out than you would.

450
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:45,067
Maybe you're a prodigy and you can work as an indie

451
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:48,688
in voluntary crunch for six months at a time,

452
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:49,448
10 hours a day, 12 hours a day,

453
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,549
and get good value out of it.

454
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,370
Statistically speaking, you can't.

455
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,991
Statistically speaking, your ability to evaluate

456
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:00,652
your own work and spot the defects you put in your work

457
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:03,173
drops as you work overtime.

458
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:05,593
So just statistically speaking.

459
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:10,736
Working overtime for extended periods of time is usually bullshit.

460
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:13,377
It limits your ability to find other answers.

461
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,658
If you get to the end of a Kickstarter, or towards the end of a Kickstarter,

462
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:21,260
and you find you're running out of money and you can't do enough,

463
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,321
do not work overtime for more than a handful of weeks,

464
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:27,362
and compensate your people with time off if you do.

465
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:28,823
Find things to cut.

466
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:33,385
You will understand your game much better at the end of the process than you did at the beginning,

467
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:34,965
so you know what you can get away with cutting.

468
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:39,499
Find other ways to do it. Look for other funding processes, anything like this.

469
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:43,701
If you just think, I'm going to work 16 hours today, tomorrow, next week,

470
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:46,622
you'll burn yourself out and you'll make a worse game because of it.

471
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:47,662
Conscious bullshit.

472
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:47,943
One more thing.

473
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,991
Open production goes both ways.

474
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,013
We wanted to build a community that will feed back to us.

475
00:29:56,013 --> 00:30:00,597
We're also trying to build a modest ecology of indie devs

476
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:04,560
and would-be indie devs who work with us to make games

477
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,402
and to teach them what we've learned

478
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:07,462
and to learn from them in turn.

479
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:09,804
We've got two people in our incubation scheme

480
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:10,685
at the moment.

481
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,587
We've funded one of them.

482
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:13,888
We've just announced Fun Better,

483
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:14,949
the end of the second line there,

484
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:19,813
a very small funding initiative for narrative-driven games.

485
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,054
We're talking up to 20 grand.
