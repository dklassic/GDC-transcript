1
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:05,703
All right, so I'm Kate Compton, and without further ado,

2
00:00:05,743 --> 00:00:08,106
I'm gonna talk a lot about procedural content generation.

3
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:11,209
I'm sorry, this is gonna be a total speed run today.

4
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,552
There were just way more things I wanted to put in here

5
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,734
about procedural content generation than I had time for.

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:17,356
And so there's zines floating around.

7
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,458
I printed out 80 of them, which was clearly not enough.

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,601
So I'll put those up online too.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,642
Yeah, so a little bit of, oh, so today's schedule.

10
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,023
I'm gonna give you, I'm calling it the IKEA catalog

11
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,204
of PCG techniques, what all of them are,

12
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,884
why you might want them, how much they cost,

13
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,504
and whether they look good next to your sofa.

14
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,265
And just the catalog of that.

15
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,565
And then I'm also gonna give you some PCG MSG,

16
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:43,166
easy, cheap additives to improve all your PCG,

17
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:43,686
whatever it is.

18
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,066
Oh, and the slides are up there.

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,070
So this talk is kind of for anybody who has heard or is thinking, hey, we should have

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,373
some PCGs in our game.

21
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:54,817
I hear they're really cool.

22
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:56,200
We should definitely PCG our game.

23
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:00,172
So a little bit about me, I've been doing procedural content

24
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,613
for 15 years or so.

25
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:04,154
It's hard to tell at this point.

26
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,094
I did five years on Spore, I did the planets,

27
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:07,955
and some SimCity.

28
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,835
I've done five plus years of a PhD,

29
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,416
and show no signs of actually graduating,

30
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:13,436
in generative games and creativity tools.

31
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:16,897
And I also made Tracery, which I talked about last year,

32
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,418
which now has close to 4,000 active bots

33
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:20,998
generating weird stuff online.

34
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,627
I make a lot of generative art bots, games, art tools, and more.

35
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:32,691
And I really like to write about and teach other people how to make PCG without losing

36
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,111
their heads.

37
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,372
It can be a really difficult thing.

38
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:37,894
So I've done a ton of procedural content generation work.

39
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:43,821
Are my, oh good, the GIFs aren't running on my computer,

40
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:45,203
so I'm glad that they're running up there.

41
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,306
So yeah, these are a couple of the things

42
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:48,928
that I've made, various procedural content,

43
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,032
Fox of Butterflies in VR, and then just recently

44
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,055
I made a train jam game that's a generative train.

45
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:58,478
So about a year ago I made this interesting blog post.

46
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,859
So a lot of people tend to ask me,

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,601
especially people just starting off in games,

48
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:04,383
like how do I do procedural content?

49
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,365
What are some good resources that you would suggest

50
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,446
for me just starting out?

51
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,788
Like I know nothing about PCG, where do I start?

52
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,069
So I started writing up a blog post,

53
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,471
and four hours later it was 4,000 words,

54
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,272
and I published that about a year ago.

55
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,074
And people found it really useful.

56
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,215
So if you get lost in this talk,

57
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:21,535
you can go back to that blog post.

58
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:24,478
And it says everything I'm saying here, but much slower.

59
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,913
So yeah, okay, I imagine people in this room

60
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:29,974
want to generate something,

61
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:31,454
or have been told to generate something,

62
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,114
or are generating something for their game.

63
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:35,895
And you know, there's games like Minecraft,

64
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,156
which generate their terrain,

65
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,736
famous games like No Man's Sky,

66
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,417
which generate all sorts of different things,

67
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,357
even Dwarf Fortress, which generates, you know,

68
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,978
drunken cats falling down in a pub,

69
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:48,058
and other such things.

70
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,720
But there's also, so those are kind of some famous examples,

71
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,002
but there's also a lot of not famous indie examples

72
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,583
that use PCG in all sorts of ways.

73
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:57,144
It's not just terrain.

74
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,807
So there's Pip and Bars, it's as if you were playing chess,

75
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,708
which gives you different ways to stroke your beard

76
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:03,769
while you think of chess moves.

77
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,051
Dietrich Squinkiefer's Mr. Darcy Dance Simulator,

78
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:09,033
where Mr. Darcy insults you in generative ways.

79
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:13,376
Ultima Ratio Regna, which generates everything.

80
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,975
Strange Thinks works, which are strange generated museums

81
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:18,475
and whatnot.

82
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:22,638
Even things like Panoramical, which these games often

83
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:23,919
walk the line of, is it a game?

84
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:24,619
Isn't it a game?

85
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,460
There are generative spaces that you

86
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,881
can explore in different ways.

87
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,484
And even sometimes games generate game rules themselves.

88
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:33,645
So this is Yavalath.

89
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:37,987
This is Cameron Brown's project.

90
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,404
made a system that could generate game rules,

91
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,065
and then he made a player that could play arbitrary games,

92
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:47,306
and he had those virtual players play

93
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,806
thousands upon thousands of games

94
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,407
until he found one that was pretty well balanced,

95
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,207
and then he shipped that,

96
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,668
and you can now buy this in game stores.

97
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,428
But title is also generated.

98
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,450
But despite the fact that this is the,

99
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,071
this is the, where are we now?

100
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,132
Game Developer Conference, yeah, it's been a day.

101
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,373
You can also generate all sorts of things

102
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,573
that are not games.

103
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah, so there's places that generate fabric and fashion, art projects.

104
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,642
Here's a bot-generated skirt that I made.

105
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,544
I'm much better at bots than I am at sewing, but this is still a pretty good skirt.

106
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:37,408
There are games from museums, like the Victorian Albert made a wig generator.

107
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:41,504
Things that are half creator, half game,

108
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:43,005
like Tokaboka's hair salon.

109
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,688
And people are generating all sorts of stuff

110
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:50,831
from poetry to music to cocktail generation.

111
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,833
A lot of that goes on at the International Conference

112
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:54,574
on Computational Creativity, to give a shout out

113
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,595
to one of my other communities.

114
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:58,437
So you can generate darn near anything.

115
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,279
So, and there's also all sorts of reasons

116
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,220
to want to generate stuff.

117
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,402
Big stuff, small stuff, little stuff, complex stuff.

118
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,083
For all sorts of reasons.

119
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,324
It increases Twitchability, it looks cool, it's funny.

120
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,042
And so yeah, there's no wrong way to do PCG.

121
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,264
And often, like, little tiny small stuff

122
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,064
is the best way to start.

123
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:18,667
There are lots of...

124
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,629
Oh, so lots of generative content

125
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,211
uses, like, extremely sophisticated and brilliant AI.

126
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:26,794
And there's plenty of talks about that here.

127
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:29,055
A lot of that fails anyway.

128
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:33,347
Some of the best generative content is really simple stuff.

129
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,488
And this is why kind of the goal of this talk

130
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,490
is to say PCG for anything, or for anybody.

131
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:43,333
For everybody, don't caffeinate before your talk.

132
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,155
So up on the right hand side is one of the most famous

133
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:49,136
examples that's been made with software that I made.

134
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,157
This is Tiny Care Bot by Jomni Sun,

135
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:53,819
which has 50,000 followers, maybe 60,000 by this point.

136
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,660
And it just tweets out little generative things

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,481
about how it loves you and you should drink more water.

138
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,520
So you don't have to get complex.

139
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,581
Sometimes emotional design is the most important

140
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:05,682
complex part of generativity.

141
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:09,244
So anyway, let's get started.

142
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,846
So yeah, so you want to generate something.

143
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,426
These are kind of the rough steps

144
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,166
that you're gonna go through.

145
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,407
You're gonna understand the design space,

146
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,268
enumerate your constraints, understand the process,

147
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,769
pick a generative method, and iterate and be flexible.

148
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:23,269
This last one is actually kind of hard,

149
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,470
and where the biggest groups will fall down the most.

150
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:28,591
So on Spore, we worked really hard.

151
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:31,872
We spent years making these incredible generators.

152
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,265
then there was no time to iterate on them.

153
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,426
Even in five years, you get all your technology working,

154
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,906
it's doing well enough, and at that point,

155
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,066
you have to put it in a box and ship.

156
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:43,907
But if you're willing to be flexible,

157
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:44,847
and a lot of indies are,

158
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,987
or if you're making a game jam game,

159
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:50,008
you can often kind of follow your generator where it leads.

160
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,289
A lot of the silliest generators

161
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:53,809
that were made with Tracery, my tool,

162
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,810
are things that people just tried out once

163
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,570
because it seemed like a stupid, funny idea.

164
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,511
Look up Endless Screaming, which is a bot

165
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,831
that just endlessly screams on Twitter.

166
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,150
So a lot of the things that are really great about this

167
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,492
are the things where you try it out

168
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:09,473
because it's a stupid idea,

169
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,135
and then you just follow the stupid idea

170
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,576
when it seems to really be working,

171
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:15,460
if you have the flexibility to do that.

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,761
But so imagine you do want to design something.

173
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,043
So these are kind of the first three things we'll go into.

174
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,805
First, this is a silly question, but what are you making?

175
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,647
There's a lot of different things you can make with this.

176
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,409
So once you've figured out what it is that you're making,

177
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,190
and be really specific with this,

178
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,831
the more specific a thing you're generating,

179
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:33,992
the better you can make a generator.

180
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:35,954
I cannot write a novel generator.

181
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:40,297
I can write a trashy urban romance fantasy generator,

182
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,458
because that's got more constraints,

183
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,220
and I can actually start describing what that is,

184
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,220
but I can't describe a novel.

185
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,905
Then you're gonna, well, so in Spore we called this

186
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:49,986
making an artist in a box.

187
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:53,531
Because you're teaching an algorithm how to make art

188
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,533
like an artist, and then back in the day when we used

189
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,596
to sell games on these shiny plastic discs,

190
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:01,421
you actually had to put your virtual artist on a disc,

191
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,103
put it into a box, and then mail it to Busby.

192
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,265
And so on Spore we had this guy named John Simino

193
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:09,646
who is a Disney animator, and we hired him.

194
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,127
And the designers of the Spore creature creator

195
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,848
sat down with him and over the course of many, many,

196
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:17,129
many hours, carefully talked to him about,

197
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,389
so if you're designing a creature, what do you do?

198
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,972
And they you know they didn't take any answer at face value

199
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:27,176
They asked him to dig further and further into it where he ended up talking about like how he draws a bean shape

200
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,179
And that kind of sets the character of the the creature and then he

201
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,044
Hangs a mouth on it and that sets kind of the the way that the creature is looking we ended up implementing all this in

202
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:39,487
Spore and the sport creature creator was notoriously really really good

203
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:43,530
And I think that was because they asked an expert about how he does things

204
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,020
So I'm gonna talk to you a lot about additive

205
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,160
and subtractive methods today.

206
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,002
So you're gonna build up a space of good stuff,

207
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:50,862
remove bad stuff.

208
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,204
There's gonna be some possibility space,

209
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,145
which is how many things are in your space,

210
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,006
and expressive range,

211
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,507
which is how interesting the things are.

212
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,649
There'll be link dumps throughout this talk.

213
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,270
Here's some more information on constraints

214
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,690
if you want them.

215
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,511
This is in your zine.

216
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,193
And Mike Cook is giving a talk on this constraint stuff

217
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,274
tomorrow at the Tech Toolbox,

218
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,135
so ask him about that.

219
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,956
So part one, the IKEA catalog of generativity.

220
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:13,798
Why you might choose each one.

221
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,577
So here are a number, I think this is six,

222
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,477
I'm good at counting, six different

223
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:21,878
kind of categories of methods.

224
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,498
And the thing you'll notice about all of these

225
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,358
when I go into them is,

226
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,859
TCG is often presented as like this magical thing.

227
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:29,979
We thought really super hard,

228
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,940
we have this algorithm with a capital A,

229
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,561
and we're gonna show you a lot of really shiny screenshots

230
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,441
of what that outputted,

231
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,901
but you could never build it yourself.

232
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:38,721
A lot of these are really simple,

233
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,322
especially in their base case.

234
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:42,422
You can build very simple things with them,

235
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,443
you can build them very simply,

236
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:44,383
you don't have to get complex.

237
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:46,654
So the first one is tiles.

238
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,215
Many of you have probably played Diablo 2.

239
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:49,376
I lost a lot of years to that.

240
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,118
Things like Spelunky,

241
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,261
even other tile-based generative games like Civ.

242
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,524
We forget often that tile-based maps are pretty common.

243
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,243
What tiles work well for?

244
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,905
So tiles are, you have a chunk of,

245
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:04,068
like you have a number of chunks of things

246
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,432
and you can then socket them together to form a map.

247
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:09,715
So you can imagine kind of like the settlers of a Catan board.

248
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,398
They work well for things you can break up

249
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,180
into equal-sized regions,

250
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,283
and where the tile-to-tile placement

251
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,685
doesn't need to be constrained.

252
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,547
You can have anything next to anything else

253
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:20,427
and it's pretty much gonna work

254
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,088
so you don't have to write more complex code for that.

255
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:24,229
But they also work well when you can get

256
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,550
kind of some emergence from the placement of the tiles.

257
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:29,752
If I have mountains next to a good resource in civilization,

258
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,753
there's some interesting gameplay that emerges from that.

259
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:34,163
But this is actually one of the oldest forms

260
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,424
of procedural content generation.

261
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,705
There's tarot cards on the right, which are a tile.

262
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,827
Like, you can think of cards and tarot cards

263
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,809
as tile-based procedural content for games.

264
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,671
If you shuffle your deck of solitaire and you put it down,

265
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,793
you've now procedurally generated the game board

266
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,134
that you're going to play a game of solitaire on.

267
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,736
And then on the left is one that I really like,

268
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,158
which is also one of the first cases of IP infringement.

269
00:10:56,858 --> 00:11:00,900
Mozart's publisher made this interesting piece,

270
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,381
it's called Dice Music,

271
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,802
and you have a number of bars of music,

272
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:05,883
and then you have a lookup table,

273
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:06,543
and you roll dice,

274
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,424
and you reassemble a nice little polka

275
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:09,465
that's never been played before.

276
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:13,187
So this is PCG that goes all the way back to like 1740.

277
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,289
So, you know, it's not just games.

278
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,621
So grammars, grammars are one of my personal favorites

279
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:21,742
because I have this language called Tracery.

280
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:22,683
I have zines for Tracery,

281
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,024
if anybody wasn't at my talk last year.

282
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:26,045
Self-promo.

283
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,967
But these are for when you wanna recursively

284
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,528
make things with other things.

285
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,811
So, there's some SVG artwork

286
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,252
and some little story descriptions

287
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:38,733
that I made recursively with Tracery.

288
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,711
So, Tracery and other templating systems,

289
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:46,935
you have a recipe, and maybe this is a sci-fi story

290
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,316
generator I made, where it's what are the different

291
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,258
pieces of a sci-fi story, all the way down to,

292
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,099
okay, now I need an alien name, what are the different

293
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,060
parts of an alien name?

294
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,803
There's a syllable, another syllable, and another syllable.

295
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,005
So you are recursively defining something.

296
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,847
And you end up usually getting a bunch of modular parts

297
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,568
that you can reuse.

298
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,169
So I use the alien name generator,

299
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,705
a bunch of other things in a lot of my work.

300
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,987
Tracer.io is where you can get more information about that.

301
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:16,429
There's also things like L-Systems,

302
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,309
which you may have heard of.

303
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:18,790
The one on the bottom right

304
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,071
is a procedural L-System generator that I made,

305
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:22,692
but there's also things like Context-Free Art.

306
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,535
This is a subsection of Grammars where it's draw a line,

307
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:33,379
pick out an angle, separate, draw new lines for each of those,

308
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,479
pick out an angle, and kind of recurse that way.

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
So grammars are all about sort of this top-down structure.

310
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:41,621
There's also some neat stuff that's

311
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,581
been done with what are called replacement grammars.

312
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,142
So this is if you have a dungeon that's a straight line,

313
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:48,283
and you would like it to not be a straight line.

314
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:51,563
This is Joris Dorman's work, where

315
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,384
he made Zelda dungeons by taking a straight line

316
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:55,824
and then perturbing it in different ways.

317
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:56,305
So you know.

318
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,086
put a door and a key.

319
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,008
All right, now if you've got a section that has a key,

320
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,609
you can hide that key behind another door,

321
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,491
and you can recursively apply these.

322
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,794
He recently just published his indie game,

323
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:09,037
which is called Unexplored, which uses this technique.

324
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,479
You can definitely learn more about this from him.

325
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,720
He's really good at this.

326
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,223
He actually used to be in academia and then went indie.

327
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:18,666
So he's got both the academic, heavy research focus,

328
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,688
but also a really great indie sensibility.

329
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,634
So distribution, distribution is put down a bunch of stuff.

330
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,275
This is maybe some PCG technique that we've all used.

331
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,595
You have a level and you dump a bunch of stuff on it

332
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:31,856
until there's stuff in your level.

333
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,116
It's really complex.

334
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,697
You can do that just by having random numbers.

335
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:37,938
But the trouble with random distribution

336
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:39,358
is that it looks crappy.

337
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,399
Actual random, like very few things are actually random.

338
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:44,580
It clumps strangely.

339
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,901
And so often real distributions are hierarchical

340
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,721
and clustered and they maintain spacing.

341
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,151
Even when we make fake gardens, we often preserve this technique.

342
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:58,372
So here's a Japanese garden where you can see that there's hierarchy and clustering.

343
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:01,614
There's certain kinds of trees in the sand and other kinds of trees in the rocks.

344
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:04,328
And so when I was on Spore,

345
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,309
it's kind of we built up some folk knowledge

346
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,529
about what makes that look good,

347
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,829
because we did a lot of procedural distribution on Spore.

348
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,770
And here are three terms that I like.

349
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,970
You can confuse the heck out of your art director.

350
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,291
One is called Barnacling.

351
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,832
This is when you have a large object in your world.

352
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:22,012
There should be medium-sized objects around that,

353
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,713
and very small objects around those,

354
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,713
and you can kind of go as fractally deep as you want.

355
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,213
And sometimes they're the same kind of object.

356
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:28,854
Sometimes they're different objects.

357
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,674
You can see the monument on the right

358
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:32,595
has all sorts of little rocks around it.

359
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,595
And this makes things look natural.

360
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,536
It makes them look like they're supposed to be there.

361
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,357
And No Man's Sky does this as well and supported it too.

362
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:45,018
There's footing where when two things intersect,

363
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,358
there should be an awareness of them intersecting.

364
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:49,999
If you stick a tree into the ground,

365
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,599
look the next time you see a tree.

366
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,499
It'll have dirt piled up around it.

367
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:54,980
It might have some twigs poking out.

368
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,500
Even when you stick a wall into a floor,

369
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,241
there's like a little rubber gaskety thing,

370
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,462
even on this really minimalist architecture.

371
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,630
If you don't have that, things don't look like they belong.

372
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:10,533
And then greebling is, this is a Star Wars term.

373
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,655
The reason that Star Wars looks different from Star Trek

374
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:14,895
is because it has so much texture.

375
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,797
And so when George Lucas was going to Tunisia

376
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:19,418
to film one of the Star Wars,

377
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,559
he had a box full of things that he would glue

378
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,581
onto other things, and customs made him label it,

379
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,781
and he labeled it greebles.

380
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:27,323
And so gluing things to other things is called greebling.

381
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:33,667
There are lots of like mathematical ways to do distribution properly. You can look these up

382
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:38,772
I usually just use a grid and offset it a bit because I'm lazy, but there's an official support way to do it

383
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,978
Parametric, this one is also really fun

384
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:44,218
because you can do a lot with it.

385
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:48,019
So a lot of these can be combined

386
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,179
into different hybrid methods,

387
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,540
but parametric is, oh, are you gonna play?

388
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah, now it's playing, okay.

389
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,541
So here's a little demo that I made

390
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,781
of a parametric generator where I have this flower

391
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,102
and this is an L system that I mentioned

392
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:02,342
on the previous slide, but the parameters of the L system,

393
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:03,643
like how much the flower's gonna spread

394
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:04,663
and how much the color changes,

395
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,784
are all defined by 32 different parameters.

396
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:09,644
So I have 32 different parameters.

397
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,286
and put those through an algorithm

398
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,387
and out pops a little flower.

399
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,168
This is handy because there's,

400
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,130
you can actually model this as an n-dimensional cube.

401
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,352
So if all of my sliders go from zero to one,

402
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:23,495
I have this, if I had like a two-dimensional flower

403
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,395
of like height and width,

404
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,097
each point on that square would be a different flower.

405
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:28,959
If I have a 32-dimensional cube,

406
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,701
each point in that 32-dimensional cube is also a flower.

407
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,542
But you can do all sorts of fun things

408
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,744
like actually do random walks through your content

409
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,205
and animate things that way.

410
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,371
And this is something that I did with that.

411
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:41,031
Wait.

412
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:42,813
Oh yeah.

413
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,335
So often things that use this are like

414
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,476
the spore morph handles.

415
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:51,200
And I believe somebody who's in the No Man's Sky team

416
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,941
can call me out on this.

417
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:53,962
I think No Man's Sky did this with their creatures as well,

418
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,243
where they were largely parametric.

419
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:56,925
That they were just a bunch of sliders

420
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:58,586
and a space of creatures.

421
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,628
A space of space creatures.

422
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,661
Oh yeah, so here's the slide where I talk about that.

423
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,782
Like yeah, you can model this as an N dimensional cube.

424
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,783
You can actually do procedural,

425
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:11,945
what is it called?

426
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,366
Genetic algorithms.

427
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,447
And there's a bunch of cool stuff

428
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,628
that you can learn about that.

429
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,369
You can also do really bizarre things,

430
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,651
like you can take your possibility space,

431
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:22,651
your n-dimensional cube,

432
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,633
and actually run computer science algorithms

433
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,194
to regionalize it in certain ways.

434
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:31,617
Find particular items in that space that are interesting

435
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,559
and then make those as collectibles.

436
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,761
And so there's a project called Petals from UCSF

437
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:38,602
that does some really awesome things with that.

438
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,330
Interpretive, this is a really cool one.

439
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,710
It says you start with some input,

440
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,631
you run an algorithm to process that data

441
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:45,512
into some other data,

442
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,153
and you're basically complexifying stuff.

443
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:48,754
Spore did this.

444
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,215
That's the official Spore skeleton on the right,

445
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,637
which is what the user was actually making,

446
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,759
and that we interpreted it into the thing on the left.

447
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,860
So there's a lot of information

448
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,841
about the Spore pipeline there.

449
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:04,798
So this is a pretty common issue to have.

450
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,442
And often, as a body is moving through space

451
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:10,662
or as you're doing hand tracking,

452
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,064
you'll end up getting lines of motion.

453
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,046
What do you do with those lines of motion?

454
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:18,368
You can interpret them in different ways.

455
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:19,950
So here's the spore pipeline

456
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,692
and how that interpreted things, I think, I hope.

457
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:24,453
Okay, there we go.

458
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,431
And yeah, so we took the skeleton,

459
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,832
we made metaballs around that,

460
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,953
we took the metaballs, we sliced that into UV maps,

461
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,574
we did animation over the right,

462
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,235
and then we did painting on the left.

463
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,056
So this entire pipeline basically starts

464
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,937
from this thick skeleton of points and edges.

465
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,119
And then eventually get a creature out of it.

466
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,499
There are all sorts of things

467
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,760
that you might want to decorate in this way.

468
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,681
You know, obviously hand tracking would be really cool,

469
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:49,621
body tracking.

470
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:53,447
There's nothing you can do to have a human artist

471
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,708
draw stuff for each body,

472
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,989
but maybe you can have a digital artist

473
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,530
draw stuff for each position of a body.

474
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,272
And then of course things like maps in the real world,

475
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,513
like Pokemon Go, or maps of your living room

476
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:03,874
in augmented reality.

477
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,916
How are you gonna decorate these things?

478
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,457
Well, parametric, or sorry, not parametric,

479
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,219
but interpretive stuff is there for you.

480
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,780
So there's a lot of examples of this,

481
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,120
and I'm kind of running already behind,

482
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,401
so I won't go really deep into them.

483
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:17,304
But there's things like Perlin noise,

484
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,586
and you can change Perlin noise in different ways.

485
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,689
So this is taking the absolute values

486
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,750
to get that nice crease.

487
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,533
Here's taking a polar offset of Perlin noise

488
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,054
so you get the nice waviness.

489
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:34,154
There's a lot of geometry algorithms,

490
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,916
so Voronoi and Delaunay are different ways

491
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:40,377
to triangulate stuff, and you can make cool regions

492
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:41,978
out of just having a bunch of points

493
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,538
and then triangulating them in different ways.

494
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:45,900
I've used this to do a couple of maps

495
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,701
for space games that I was working on and never shipped,

496
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,822
and then there's also an island game that I made

497
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:53,483
using these techniques as well,

498
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,085
so Delaunay and Voronoi, they,

499
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,334
figure out the closest regions to each different point

500
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:00,455
and then they figure out the connections

501
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:01,115
between those regions.

502
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,817
So it's a really cheap, fast way to make maps.

503
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:05,059
And there's good algorithms for this.

504
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,942
There's things like constructive solid geometry,

505
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:09,564
extrusion revolution.

506
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:14,049
These are different ways of adding and subtracting stuff.

507
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,612
And you can use that to draw curves along things.

508
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:19,695
Here's a pendant generator that I made for 3D printing.

509
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,551
But you can also use it in games.

510
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:25,114
So I need to make some geometry that fits this curve.

511
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,237
These are often very difficult.

512
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:28,859
These are mathematically heavy.

513
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,722
But even in things like Photoshop and Tilt Brush,

514
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,604
this is how they take a curve

515
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,787
and they extrude interesting stuff along that curve,

516
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,048
whether it's texture or geometry.

517
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,061
And then Metaballs are making blobs out of stuff

518
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,122
and then you can do stuff with that.

519
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,204
And I believe, but I'm not sure

520
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,685
that this is how Oculus Medium works.

521
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,388
There's also a whole weird category

522
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,710
of like fractals and mathematics stuff this way.

523
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,952
These are low control, hide weirdness

524
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,753
and not suitable for most games,

525
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,595
but there's a group that does,

526
00:20:58,255 --> 00:20:59,937
a couple of people who do things like Miyakaguri

527
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:01,858
and HyperNOM that do interesting things

528
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:04,140
with impossible spaces with generative methods.

529
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,346
One of my favorites, just because I super love particles.

530
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,847
You gonna play?

531
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:10,308
There we go.

532
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,730
I really like particles and particle simulations.

533
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:15,553
So remember how I told you you can decorate a curve?

534
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,455
Well you can use particles to generate those curves

535
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,017
and then decorate them in interesting ways.

536
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,338
So here I'm drawing some flowers

537
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,959
with just a particle simulation.

538
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,201
And they look pretty and they're kind of fun to watch.

539
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:27,163
This is also how Spore worked.

540
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,285
Spore, we did a lot of our texturing

541
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,509
with particle simulations that would then drag textures

542
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,671
or kind of dredge out rivers behind them

543
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,712
as they moved to a planet.

544
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:43,013
These also really go great with, wow that's such a slide.

545
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,133
They go really great with user input.

546
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:49,334
So I've got my hands and the one on the bottom left

547
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,855
is I'm not sure where I was going with this game,

548
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,275
but you wave your hands and there's birds

549
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:53,515
that flock around it and the birds leave

550
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,076
behind watercolor trails, so you're kind of like

551
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,636
painting with a giant swarm of birds.

552
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,077
I don't think anybody else has done that

553
00:21:59,097 --> 00:21:59,837
with the Leap Motion yet.

554
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,174
But there's also things like cellular automata,

555
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,396
agent-based simulations, physics simulations,

556
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:07,798
so things like Dwarf Fortress and the indie game Bad News

557
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:10,700
have just massive simulations of little people

558
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,682
living their lives and they use that to build,

559
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,805
to procedurally generate towns with massive history.

560
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:18,947
Yeah, and,

561
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,390
oh okay, there's animation, nevermind.

562
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,792
Yep, so some animation for you.

563
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,983
All right, subtractive methods, on to the next thing.

564
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:29,724
So you've made a lot of stuff.

565
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:31,505
Some of it's good, some of it's not.

566
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:33,966
Again, we had this problem on Spore

567
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,006
where some of our planets were good

568
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:35,947
and some of them weren't

569
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,508
because we didn't have time to iterate.

570
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,129
And so the way we hacked that was we,

571
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,471
well, I, went through a bunch of the planets we generated

572
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:45,092
and saved the seeds of the ones that were good.

573
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,273
And if you have seeded random number generation,

574
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:49,975
you can then input the name of the algorithm,

575
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,816
the seed that you're gonna do, and get the same content.

576
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:53,517
So you can actually.

577
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:55,739
to kind of whitelist a certain number of content.

578
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:56,940
It's often faster to do that

579
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,481
than to make a proper algorithm.

580
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,683
Never worry about doing it the right way,

581
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:01,684
just do whatever way works.

582
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:05,227
This kind of leads to something called generate and test,

583
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,409
where if you can write an algorithm to judge quality,

584
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,792
you can then generate stuff and throw it away.

585
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:17,177
You have to be careful with this because if your algorithm is too loose and your constraint is too high,

586
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:19,798
you can generate forever and never actually accept anything, so you can hang.

587
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:23,860
So it's always better to do ranking prioritization versus throwaway.

588
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,861
And never use a fun equation.

589
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,561
Ask me later what that means.

590
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,904
You can also computationally explore the possibility space.

591
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,525
This is loosely called search.

592
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,227
You can brute force search,

593
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:39,150
like find me the tallest creature that my stuff can make,

594
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,852
or find me a level that has these properties.

595
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:43,974
You can just grind through a bunch of levels

596
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:45,775
and search for the one that's good.

597
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:48,337
But you can do it in a slightly more sophisticated way

598
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,598
with things called hill climbing.

599
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:51,519
Genetic algorithms are a version of that.

600
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:55,964
those in particular work best with parametric models.

601
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:58,310
There's also a little thing called constraint solving.

602
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:02,365
So you probably know of this from IK solving,

603
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:03,606
of I have a limb here and a here,

604
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,228
figure out where the limb should be in the middle.

605
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,490
There are ways to describe other problems.

606
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,672
So the one on the right is a little murder mystery

607
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,673
generator that I had, where it was things like,

608
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,416
you know, somebody is jealous if there's a love triangle.

609
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,138
If somebody's jealous, they have a motive for murder.

610
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,140
Give me a house full of 15 people,

611
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,541
five of which have the motive for murder,

612
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:25,882
one of which committed a murder,

613
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:27,803
and which was not in the line of sight of anybody else.

614
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:30,665
And there's solvers for this.

615
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,306
Don't ever write your own solver.

616
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,189
If you find yourself writing a solver,

617
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,130
this is often the way that really cool

618
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,072
indie projects never get shipped.

619
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:43,756
It's the Northwest Passage of indie.

620
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:45,237
So be careful when you see that.

621
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:48,099
So yeah, congratulations, you've made a generator

622
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,041
with a possibility space of really cool artifacts

623
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,282
and good expressive range.

624
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,222
You win, right?

625
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:54,044
No.

626
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,005
So making use of generativity.

627
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,306
So you have a really great generator.

628
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,402
Maybe you can generate many things,

629
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:02,703
but they're all mathematically unique,

630
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:05,164
and you loudly argue to your players

631
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,504
that they're all mathematically unique,

632
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:08,065
and no, they're not actually all the same thing,

633
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,466
but they aren't perceived as being unique,

634
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:10,626
and is this a problem?

635
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:12,527
I call this the 10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem.

636
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:16,168
And Michael Cook's got a really great article

637
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,449
on what that meant for No Man's Sky score,

638
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,790
but also for us as indies.

639
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,016
But I think that sometimes it's a problem

640
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:23,917
and sometimes it's not.

641
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:25,919
So there's different kinds of generative content.

642
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,140
Some of it's in the background.

643
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:28,882
If you have a bunch of trees,

644
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:30,564
it's okay if they're not all unique.

645
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,709
Sometimes you just want perceptual differentiation,

646
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,710
but I can tell that those aren't

647
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,512
all the same identical tree.

648
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:39,574
They don't look like clone stamps of each other,

649
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,296
but they're not super unique.

650
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:44,179
Sometimes you need things that are a little bit more unique,

651
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,760
that there is perceptual uniqueness,

652
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,202
so I can tell that the trees in this region

653
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:48,583
are different than the trees in that region.

654
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,084
And then there's also characterful.

655
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,947
The test for that is would you write fanfic for this object?

656
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,569
If you would write fanfic for the generated object,

657
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:56,570
which I would for some of the stuff

658
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,611
that's coming out of my generators,

659
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,814
the best one I ever got was an angry nun in a wedding dress

660
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:02,536
from one of my patron generators,

661
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:05,258
and I've written fanfic for her in my mind.

662
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,534
I really like this, there we go.

663
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,175
I really like this scene in the Matrix

664
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:13,397
because it's technically in canon,

665
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:14,757
it's a procedurally generated scene

666
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:16,178
that somebody has made in the Matrix.

667
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:18,080
And the whole point of the scene

668
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,601
is that you're looking at the woman in the red

669
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,082
and you don't notice the threat around you.

670
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:23,103
The funny thing that the Wachowskis did with this scene,

671
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,264
I don't know if you all know this,

672
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:25,605
is everyone in the scene,

673
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:26,766
aside from the one in the red dress,

674
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:27,846
is twins and triplets.

675
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:32,252
So they managed to get perceptual differentiation

676
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,534
without perceptual uniqueness.

677
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:36,317
So even there, they're understanding

678
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,359
that you have the characterful woman in the red dress,

679
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,682
but you can have some kind of repeated stuff in the infill.

680
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:44,928
So knowing kind of how interesting your PCG has to be.

681
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:47,398
All right, I'm coming almost to the end.

682
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,300
This is one of my favorite ones.

683
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,261
Ownership is so important.

684
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:54,284
Oh my god, ownership is a huge deal.

685
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:58,068
I call this the Victorian Explorers phenomena,

686
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:01,451
which is if you have a big, wide, open, expansive space,

687
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:06,235
allowing people to find interesting bits of this space,

688
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:09,238
bring it back to their friends, label it with their name,

689
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:10,719
and then hold it up in front of their friends

690
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,761
and say, look how cool I am for finding, like,

691
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:14,935
Smart Blatts squirrel.

692
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:17,976
You see this a lot in European museums.

693
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:20,858
So, let players take credit for your generativity.

694
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:23,339
Spore did a really great job of this.

695
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,260
Like, we promoted the heck out of players

696
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,101
who had made content that was technically

697
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:29,162
in the possibility space of our thing.

698
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:30,623
We could have found it if we'd looked hard enough,

699
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:33,004
but instead we promoted the heck out of the players

700
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,665
and gave them little awards

701
00:27:34,705 --> 00:27:36,286
and let them even make rewards for each other.

702
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:40,168
And there's games that are doing really great jobs of this.

703
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:41,088
So, like Dwarf Fortress.

704
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,089
does a really great job of letting people

705
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:47,970
find the interesting content,

706
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,652
so go digging for the interesting content,

707
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,613
and then Half of Dwarf Fortress is played

708
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:52,794
on these storytelling boards

709
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,356
where people then present their content that they found,

710
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:58,139
tell the story, curate other people's content.

711
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,822
So let your players become creators, curators, and retailers.

712
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,484
It should go without saying that this is amazing for Twitch.

713
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:07,506
Let people self-promote using your generated content.

714
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,377
And yeah, finally, data structures.

715
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,339
These make your life easier.

716
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,260
Tracery is entirely, like the tracery generators

717
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,481
are a JSON format.

718
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,462
You wouldn't think that this matters,

719
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:22,583
except that JSON is a really safe format.

720
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,544
So when I released tracery, somebody was,

721
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,545
George Buckingham was able to make Cheap Osmium Quick.

722
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,888
which takes arbitrary JSON that Yahoo's on the internet

723
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:32,190
have posted, runs that on his Node server,

724
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,571
somehow it doesn't break anything,

725
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,593
and then posts that to Twitter.

726
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,975
You can't do this with arbitrary JavaScript,

727
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:39,176
although I invite you to try,

728
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,518
and invite me, I'll have popcorn.

729
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,121
But with JSON, this is actually possible.

730
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,883
This also allows you to do things like A-B test generators,

731
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,485
release new generative content safely.

732
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:51,847
And then also visualize your generators.

733
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,789
A couple years, I think last year maybe,

734
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,311
there was a talk at the Narrative Summit

735
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:58,274
by a group of guys who had done a game called Icebound,

736
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,137
which is a big generative narrative project.

737
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:04,401
And during their project, they had made a whole bunch

738
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,564
of really fascinating visualization for.

739
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:10,567
have we written enough content to cover this particular situation?

740
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:14,030
What are the different places where we could get to from this content?

741
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,433
And so they made themselves visualizations of how troublesome certain things were and

742
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,034
how much left they had to write.

743
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,536
So that's a really cool thing you can do there.

744
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,734
So yeah, in review, here's this.

745
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:29,076
Allow users to claim ownership, where that, et cetera.

746
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:31,417
But this should be in your zine.

747
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:33,878
And if you're still interested in PCG,

748
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,018
there's a ton of PCG going on here.

749
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,519
I even forgot to put one up on this slide

750
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:39,000
that's the tech toolbox tomorrow.

751
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,500
So here's the PCG sampler menu of various,

752
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,221
like GDC talks on PCG in various areas.

753
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:52,828
And yeah that puts me at exactly almost exactly time. So I'm going to leave this here, and I think we have 19 seconds for questions

754
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:05,113
Yeah, we have time through for one question if you have a question come up to a mic in one of the aisles

755
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:18,398
So I guess I get the one question, how often do you create something that's awesome, but not performant that doesn't run fast enough?

756
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,119
Generally, how do you deal with premature?

757
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,800
Optimization is the root of all evil, but

758
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,472
So the question was, what do I do if I get something

759
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:30,834
that's awesome but not performant?

760
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:32,415
I find another use for it.

761
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:34,957
So the thing that made that generated skirt,

762
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:36,719
it's actually pretty slow,

763
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,620
but how often do I have to run a thing

764
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,943
that I'm going to then send out to print a generative skirt?

765
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,245
That can actually run quite slowly.

766
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,548
The performant stuff, be aware of it.

767
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,385
Yeah, that's a tough question.

768
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,866
I don't actually have a good answer for that.

769
00:30:52,946 --> 00:30:55,448
Honestly, the simplicity versus good design,

770
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,649
a lot of the stuff that really makes PCG pop,

771
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,611
like this ownership stuff, that doesn't take frame rate.

772
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:05,973
So do really clever design around simpler stuff,

773
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:08,434
and you will, people don't notice the depth

774
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:09,835
of the generator often,

775
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:11,996
but they do notice the design around it.

776
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:14,637
Okay.

777
00:31:14,677 --> 00:31:14,977
All right.

778
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,957
And I'll be outside in the hallway,

779
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,108
and then go to the speaker wrap-up room if anybody wants.
