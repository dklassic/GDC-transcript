00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:13,864
Hello GDC!

2
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:13,924
Hi!

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,366
You guys look fantastic, how are you doing?

4
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,839
The chatter means you're having a good time.

5
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:23,460
Wonderful.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,503
All right, before we settle in, just some quick words to get y'all started.

7
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:33,088
A reminder that this is being recorded by a very nice camera that's much nicer than whatever you have.

8
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:38,232
So please refrain from videotaping, but I will encourage you to take pictures, as you'll see.

9
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:43,396
I won't be doing questions after, but I will be in the handy wrap-up area just outside.

10
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,317
So let's get going.

11
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:51,796
All right, so before we get started, here's kind of our agenda for what we're going to talk about.

12
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:57,679
Today we're going to start with, surprise, a theater history lesson on the idea of the modern ensemble.

13
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:05,883
Then we're going to talk about how to put it into action, and we'll close with a common language to start getting an interdisciplinary group together to tell stories.

14
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,828
So again, before we get started, two things.

15
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,230
We'll be discussing spoilers for these titles and more.

16
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:16,433
Second thing, keep your camera ready for still pictures.

17
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:17,193
No videos.

18
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:17,994
I'm looking at you.

19
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:24,999
For slides where there's a lot of text or a critical slide, there's a camera up in the corner to let you know to take a picture of this for later.

20
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:27,805
And now for me.

21
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,066
Hi, my name is Allison Lures.

22
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,127
I'm an associate narrative director and theater artist.

23
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:43,450
I trained in performance and devising for theater at Western Washington University and performed unscripted theater professionally for about 13 years or so, while also working as a game dev.

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,252
I was on the creative lead of world building at Wizards of the Coast and worked on everything from Magic the Gathering to Baldur's Gate 3.

25
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:55,394
And now I am an associate narrative director for seasonal content on Destiny 2.

26
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:59,235
But I am not here to talk about what we make.

27
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,136
I'm here to talk about how.

28
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,998
Why did this skip ahead like so many slides?

29
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:05,678
Oh my god.

30
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:06,799
All right.

31
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:15,322
So, the story of the ensemble starts with the true story of how a medium was changed by changing how it was made.

32
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:21,525
We begin, as all dangerous ideas do, with two art nerds complaining about brunch.

33
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,953
It happened inside a busy restaurant in Moscow on June 22, 1897.

34
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:30,335
At 2 p.m.

35
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:40,243
that day, two men, Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich Danchenko, sat down to discuss the state of Russian theater, which was in a heinously dismal state.

36
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,652
Theater of that time was a lot.

37
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:53,399
Melodramas were popular at the time, so the style is kind of like, imagine if Nick Cage's style of acting was the peak of performance.

38
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,344
It wasn't performers inhabiting a character so much as performing emotions.

39
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:05,710
And it was built around the star system, where entire productions would be spun up around one single actor.

40
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,632
Again, very Nick Cage.

41
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:12,154
And when productions were made, it was kind of in siloed pieces.

42
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:17,056
So the set designer would get the gist of the show and reuse something in storage.

43
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:21,798
Costumes might make a custom piece for whoever that star is they're building around.

44
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,620
But everyone else kind of gets what's on wardrobe already.

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,601
And staging, I got it.

46
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,541
Great idea.

47
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:32,323
Give us one flat line so we can see everyone's face.

48
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,544
Nick Cage style, no depth.

49
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:37,265
Again, just kind of thrown together, right?

50
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:50,887
And worse, theatre in Moscow in 1897 was funded by the ruling class, and their tastes, even when they weren't terribly informed, built and determined what theatres rose and fell.

51
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,091
Sounds kind of familiar to our industry, right?

52
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:08,939
In Stanislavski's own words, Vladimir, like me, thought the theater situation hopeless, for the brilliant traditions of the past had degenerated into a plain collection of easy technical devices.

53
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,282
The theater was in the hands of dilettantes and bureaucrats.

54
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,365
I think we all know a few dilettantes and bureaucrats, too.

55
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,800
The conversation at the restaurant was so electric it continued late into the night.

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:31,163
Stanislavski and Nemerovich wanted to make sure that actors and designers were central to the theater, both actors and designers.

57
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:45,970
They mapped out their values and emerged with a foundation for revolution centered around an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity in favor of creating something collectively with a set group of interdisciplinary artists over time.

58
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,193
They started their brunch at 2pm and they talked until 8 the next morning.

59
00:04:52,794 --> 00:05:04,098
One year later, the Moscow Art Theater was born, and in Stanislavski's opening speech, he urged his friends and colleagues to dedicate their lives to creating, quote, the first rational, moral, and accessible theater.

60
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:05,158
And it was.

61
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:20,363
Their ensemble survived investor changeovers, the October Revolution, even Stanislavski having a heart attack on stage, and the troupe disbanded after 90, nine-zero years after it was founded.

62
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:30,217
What Stanislavski and Nemrovich Denschenko created that Wild Night in 1897 was a radical manifesto on how they wanted to work.

63
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:38,083
They wanted a cross-disciplinary group of individuals, so a director, playwright, designers, performers, to collaboratively create new works.

64
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:44,607
And they wanted to work over many years of time, not just one-off projects.

65
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:47,088
And each discipline bore equal weight.

66
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:56,174
The sets were just as important as the costumes, were just as important as the blocking, were just as important as the script, because they were all contributing towards the same holistic work.

67
00:05:56,974 --> 00:06:07,184
and when I say work, it's a capitalized W. The work is the final product, cool, but more importantly, it's the method of creation and collaboration.

68
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,629
For this method of ensemble creation to function, the work had to be prioritized.

69
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:16,873
The final product, sure, but how it was made was what matters.

70
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:26,129
So departing theater and returning to games, for the most part, the game industry is already kind of structured this way.

71
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:33,091
Studios of roughly the same people work on many projects over many years, sharing the same common goal.

72
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:40,214
Think how this contrasts with the film industry, right, where each movie has a different group of people who work on it.

73
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:41,074
They change in and out.

74
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:47,180
But rather than working as a holistic ensemble, we usually work in silos.

75
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:54,770
Art, design, narrative, audio work separately, with each silo responsible for their own kind of separate thing from the others.

76
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,939
And there's a lot of stirm and drang even at this conference over who should start their part first and who should follow.

77
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:09,633
and inside those silos are pyramids with everyone working to support one voice at the top.

78
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:16,675
And usually it's that discipline's director, right, who is in an additional pyramid supporting the vision of a creative director.

79
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:22,637
So how do we go from creating game stories where everyone's supporting one voice

80
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:34,872
to creating stories with a system where not only is everyone contributing and supporting everyone else, but individual expertise is also shining through to create something holistic.

81
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:47,843
So how do we create as an ensemble without it combusting into constant argument, or one person steering everybody else, or devolving into design by committee, blah?

82
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:56,166
Working as a true ensemble requires a shift in values that everyone has to buy into to make it work.

83
00:07:56,846 --> 00:08:10,389
The most challenging hurdle, that one in blue, the notion that each of these other ones touches, the one that isn't just faced at the start but every single day, is relinquishing control, especially as the director or the lead.

84
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:17,351
But what is gained in that trade-off is security, trust, and the freedom of shared ownership.

85
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,211
So let's break down these values.

86
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
Be kind, not nice.

87
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:27,561
This is the most powerful rule of engagement.

88
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:32,503
Nice withholds opinions to not cause strife or make anyone upset.

89
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,704
It shuts up to protect others' feelings.

90
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:44,208
But kind knows that we can give and take critical feedback without dealing damage, that it's more cruel to let opinions fester and not be shared.

91
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,200
Next up, make a case.

92
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,124
I don't believe in design by committee or democracy, but I do believe in design by conversation.

93
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:58,208
So if someone disagrees with the group and cares passionately, but the rest of the group is aligned, we make space.

94
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,489
And at the very least, hear them out.

95
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,111
This is how we resolve disagreements.

96
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:07,494
And if the idea isn't convincing, then the rest of us are kind.

97
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:15,179
And whoever is assigned to call the shots, and there should be someone who is assigned to call shots, even in this structure, is the one who lets them know.

98
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,701
Everyone gets a fair shake.

99
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,083
And violent choices.

100
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:25,848
The majority of poor collaborative experiences happen because someone refuses to make a clear choice.

101
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:29,491
You circle the drain and wander way out of goals.

102
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,913
It's a miserable and uncertain place.

103
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,015
And I say violence because violence is decisive.

104
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:41,080
It is a decision that, when it's made, it negates all other options and clears a path forward for everyone.

105
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,469
Now, as you work, listen for when the time calls for a violent choice.

106
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,553
Make it and stick to it.

107
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,477
That's how we can keep momentum.

108
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:53,524
And then Will and Grace, not the TV show.

109
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,826
Will is the courage to speak up.

110
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:01,890
It's to put out an idea, to identify that no one is doing anything and take initiative.

111
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:10,737
And Grace is accepting what the ensemble wants, letting your ideas go, supporting what the work with a capital W needs.

112
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:15,160
Every creator must be able to balance both when working collaboratively.

113
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,882
Next, you aren't your ideas.

114
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,624
Preciousness is dangerous.

115
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:23,026
It's fearing not taking feedback.

116
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,787
It's holding on to an idea simply because it is yours.

117
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,649
It's creating while holding on to shame.

118
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,891
I tell our writer's room, we love bad art.

119
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:34,273
We love unfinished garbage.

120
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:35,394
We love trash.

121
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:38,216
Show me your worst writing you've ever done in your life.

122
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:44,442
because if you bring it when it's in that stage, when it's a thumbnail, then we can give the most helpful feedback.

123
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,948
And we do that to emphasize that you aren't your ideas.

124
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:53,813
You have the grace to let go of a cool idea when you can tell it isn't going where the work is.

125
00:10:54,514 --> 00:11:02,000
And an important value of this as well is that an old phrase I learned when I was in college is theater, not therapy.

126
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:07,225
Know the difference between making something for an audience and making something for yourself.

127
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:12,689
Because the first is a powerful gift and the latter puts your heart on the firing line.

128
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,835
And finally, hold yourself accountable.

129
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:18,336
This is the most important one.

130
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,957
This is the most important value.

131
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:24,540
You are responsible for your own boundaries and your own attachment.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,404
You need to know when to speak up and when to lead with your idea and when to back off and know when your idea isn't fitting.

133
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:38,167
Unless everyone is holding themselves to the same standard, this is how we invite disharmony.

134
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:45,475
So in practice, those values are what keep effective collaboration from turning into design by committee.

135
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:50,642
We don't want everyone's ideas shoved in because that's how we lose focus and direction.

136
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:54,026
It's how we make a final product that doesn't say anything.

137
00:11:54,767 --> 00:12:01,812
But design by collaboration prioritizes the work, which, remember, is both what we make, but more importantly, how we make it.

138
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:07,475
We listen to what the work wants and are using will to introduce ideas and grace to let them go.

139
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:10,958
And most importantly, again, there's still a shot caller here.

140
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:21,905
Like, even though we're working in a very flat structure, when we hit this, like, 5% of the time when we can't make a decision, one person needs to be able to go, yep, we're doing that one, to make sure that things move.

141
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:29,429
So finally, in our values, and most radically, sear this sentence into your brains.

142
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:34,535
Environmental storytelling isn't a strong enough way to describe what I'm talking about.

143
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:37,958
Every discipline is a vector for story.

144
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,564
Every game dev is capable of telling a story through their discipline.

145
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:48,148
And when I say story, and here's a free story definition, we were just asked for those.

146
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:51,270
When I say story, I mean it in the absolute broadest way possible.

147
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,992
Story as the perceptual ability to see and understand logic systems as an arrangement of collected information.

148
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:58,473
Whoa, it's a crunchy one.

149
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:06,957
And when I talk about narrative in this talk, I'm referring to the discipline responsible for implementation of story through dialogue and systems.

150
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:12,240
Narrative is something narrative does, but story is something all disciplines can do.

151
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:20,306
So to reinforce that idea, our high-level stories should be broken by the leads of every discipline working together with the writers.

152
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,971
Bring in your design leads, your art leads, your audio leads, your cinematic expert into that writer's room.

153
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:33,477
This probably sounds alarming, but having lots of different brains from the very start in that room will build holistic stories.

154
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:38,362
It also means early buy-in and a sense of ownership from all of those different people.

155
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:44,768
It prevents table flipping and seagulling later when you tell them what the story is, because they were already in there.

156
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:55,238
And most importantly, narrative first, or design first, is a fallacy, because great games are made as a marriage of both disciplines, and they move as one.

157
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:01,680
So now we've got all these different people in a room and we're sharing the same values.

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,784
Now how do we build together using a common language so that we can all share and communicate?

159
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,548
Our sister medium of theater already figured this out.

160
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:18,455
So let's learn from them and apply the lessons from immersive physical performance into immersive digital performance.

161
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,286
meet Mary Overly.

162
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:27,048
She was an American choreographer, a dancer, and an experimental theater artist.

163
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:32,550
The big question that she asked was, what are dance and theater made of?

164
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,431
Visual art has a vocabulary to describe it, but performance did not.

165
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:44,575
So when Mary was dividing up the parts of dance and theater, she didn't divide them by choreography, set design, audio design, lighting design, costuming.

166
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:52,259
She didn't see set design as separate from movement or lighting as separate from costuming, but all of them serving a single experience.

167
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,780
So what she made was called the viewpoints.

168
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:04,887
Mary later collaborated with my hero, American director Anne Bogart, in the 1980s, and they continued building on this idea of the viewpoints.

169
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:11,097
The two worked together, and Anne built on the ideas that Mary overly established when she formed her own ensemble, City Company.

170
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:18,893
So what Mary and Anne created was a way to talk about story in an interdisciplinary way.

171
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:30,442
They understood that the parts of theater that aren't the script and the set design and the lights and the blocking, it's all one final holistic experience that we hinder ourselves by thinking that they're separate.

172
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:41,192
And so the vocabulary they created is a way for every discipline that we know to be able to talk to each other and express story in unique ways that suit everyone's talents.

173
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:50,238
So this is vocabulary to teach across your teams, because as you'll see, it encourages us to think about story using every tool in our toolbox.

174
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:52,639
All right, here we go.

175
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,921
We'll start with space.

176
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:01,965
So space, and the viewpoints, by the way, are broken down into three categories of space, shape, and time.

177
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:11,552
Space is unique to performance and to games, because both are mediums built around immersing the audience or player in a shared space, physical or digital.

178
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,410
First up is architecture.

179
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,613
And by architecture, I mean the structures that define the space we occupy in the game.

180
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:25,036
So everything from trees to buildings to rooms to dungeons, in the viewpoints, it's all architecture.

181
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:30,100
So the Horizon series shines when we see familiar architecture in unfamiliar ways.

182
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:38,545
And the moment when we swim through the Vegas Strip and emerge at the very end is stunning because it allows the moment to breathe with the architecture.

183
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:43,127
Here, that architecture, that shared environmental space is our reward at the end.

184
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:47,290
And it's a wonderful visual metaphor for the life that we brought back to the desert.

185
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:50,412
Spatial relationship.

186
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:58,844
This means the distance between objects in the space, so the player to other NPCs or to enemies or to the architecture.

187
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,527
Spatial relations conveys a relationship, right?

188
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:08,774
In this frame from the first few minutes of JFO, who is Cal in relation to that star destroyer?

189
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,337
We know that they are connected from this framing.

190
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,945
and that the empire is represented as a dominant figure, but very distant and far away.

191
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:23,936
It literally towers over the landscape and thus over Cal, both physically and from a storytelling standpoint.

192
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:30,348
topography is the path a player travels or a character traverses.

193
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:35,069
So what stories can we convey through the paths that we travel?

194
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:41,091
In season 19 of Destiny 2, there's a secret quest that leads to a very special surprise.

195
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,912
Paw prints in an area lead away from the main action.

196
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:50,593
And they follow down and away, then really the fuck out of the way.

197
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:58,996
And at the end, if we got rid of all the security drones, we gained access to find a very sweet robot dog at the very end.

198
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:06,038
That path, that distance, that topography we traveled tells us that this exodog was supposed to be a secret.

199
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:16,821
The computer that runs this place was built to build war satellites, and at the very back of the longest path, we find the heart that computer kept safe from the world.

200
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:22,802
Now for descriptions of visuals with an emphasis on bodies.

201
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:23,343
Yay!

202
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,663
Characters in space.

203
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:40,029
Shape is the contour or outline of bodies in space, the shape of the body itself, or relating to others or the architecture.

204
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:44,471
So think of lines and curves, angles, either stationary or in motion.

205
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:46,813
So how do we tell stories with shape?

206
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,496
The cool thing is that it doesn't have to have an inherent meaning.

207
00:18:50,956 --> 00:19:00,144
So here's a screenshot from Immortality, where we see Ambrosio on his knees, leaning at the same heavy angle as the last tree in hell.

208
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:11,353
The relationship between these shapes, these two bodies, tells us who's clearly in charge here, and that Ambrosio and the architecture are telling us that Ambrosio belongs here.

209
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:13,645
just

210
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,569
Who the fuck is she surrendering to?

211
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:39,749
That's a scary moment.

212
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:47,772
Another unique to games example of gesture is the gestures we ask the player to do in the physical act of playing our games.

213
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:54,655
So how impactful is it in this very same game where the player strums their controller like a guitar?

214
00:19:55,455 --> 00:20:00,417
And what changes when later in the game we lose some fingers and we can't play the same way?

215
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:05,499
It's a lot more powerful when the player is using gesture to tell that story.

216
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,056
Finally, the spicy stuff.

217
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:12,141
Telling a story with time itself.

218
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:21,240
Tempo is how quickly or slowly an action occurs by the player, the NPC, or an aspect of the environment.

219
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,043
So we can think of tempo as really fast, right?

220
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:28,826
Like twitch-based play, hordes of enemies, like rapid, rapid action.

221
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:34,511
But there's a whole other side to tempo that games have a hard time wrapping its head around sometimes.

222
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,253
What story is told when we go slow?

223
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:43,498
What story do we convey when we want a player to control their pace and ask for stillness?

224
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,239
Ghosts of Tsushima does a great job of playing with tempo.

225
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:55,602
We shift back and forth between moments of charged action and intentional stillness, then bursting into action once again.

226
00:20:56,222 --> 00:21:09,006
Our samurai is a master of control, and we as players inhabit that play through that control, keeping a lid on it in actual physical play and purposeful stillness before exploding with directed action.

227
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:12,527
This time, the gameplay is the character.

228
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:23,112
Duration is how long an event occurs over time, how quickly, how slowly we can stretch out and manipulate time.

229
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:29,399
How long the player or NPC maintains a particular movement, tempo, or gesture before it changes.

230
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,263
So our instinct as designers wants to say, well, players don't want to spend a lot of time doing nothing.

231
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:39,064
But what happens when the duration is the point?

232
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:43,326
Pentament is a game about history, what deserves to be called it.

233
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,848
And my favorite moment of the game is a moment where nothing happens.

234
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:56,192
Rather, it's a moment at the tavern near a dramatic conclusion where everyone in town gathers to listen to traveling musicians performing a song for Christmas.

235
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,794
The gameplay stops.

236
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:13,991
The characters settle down to listen, and it's a moment of reflection, a pause to look at every single character on screen and know that we're about to make a choice that ruins one of their lives.

237
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:29,073
Kinesthetic response is the player's or NPC's spontaneous reaction to a motion that occurs outside of themselves.

238
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:32,876
So it's an instinctive response to an external stimulus.

239
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:39,322
What can we do to elicit a gasp, a laugh, or a cough, or an exasperated ugh?

240
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:44,165
And how does instinctual responses in our characters and players tell a story?

241
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:49,248
We can also write scenes built around our characters' involuntary reactions.

242
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,188
Characters are alive.

243
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,289
I was about to say they're human.

244
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,790
They're not always human, but they respond because they're alive and living in the world.

245
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,792
And it's infinitely more interesting to watch somebody sneeze than it is to watch them say a prepared line of dialogue.

246
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:08,295
So the wand is a great example of kinesthetic response because the first time we meet her,

247
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:21,185
We feel her first, like in your hands, and then we hear a strange noise, and if we rewind it, out of nowhere, a smash edit comes, and we can't help but startle that the startle happens for two reasons.

248
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,087
One, that's a fucking solid jump scare.

249
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:28,091
And in terms of the story, it's the gasp of waking up.

250
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:29,632
It's alertness.

251
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:37,078
It's a mirror of the narrative revelation that in this story, there's someone else just behind me the whole time.

252
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:42,149
And finally, repetition is one of my favorite tools.

253
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:48,411
It is repeating an action, motif, visual design, music signature, or a line of dialogue.

254
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,894
Now, at the end of the game, Control, you're put into a dreamlike situation as an office worker.

255
00:23:54,274 --> 00:24:02,897
You're flooded with basic tasks, making copies, tying up coffee cups, emptying bins, and the repetition hammers home the titular concept of the game.

256
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:08,079
Your actions and thought patterns have shrunk your world down to a small number of actions.

257
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:17,888
And finally, repetition is one of my favorite tools.

258
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:22,993
It is repeating an action, motif, visual design, music signature, or line of dialogue.

259
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:25,785
Thank you for suffering that bad joke.

260
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:32,012
Repetition can also connect unlike ideas to change its meaning.

261
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:41,762
So you press X to kill humans like tons of times in Last of Us Part 2, but why is that repetition different when you press X to kill a dog?

262
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:47,511
It hits different because the action is repeated, but the context is altered.

263
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:53,540
That repetition and the juxtaposing discomfort we feel as a player is the story.

264
00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:11,514
So now, zooming way back to the start, we can imagine being in that writer's room, in that story intensive, working alongside our design director, our audio director, our art director, using a shared language now where we can say, hey, we want this story thing to happen.

265
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,816
And now there's a vocabulary for that design director to go, I can play with tempo to communicate that.

266
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:20,583
or our art director can go, I've got a good idea for the architecture for this one.

267
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:25,372
And now we can start to play off of everyone else's strengths to tell something.

268
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,166
All right, get out your cameras.

269
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:36,193
So I am going to put up a couple of slides with just like a pile of questions to help open up conversations about each of these.

270
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:43,438
So yeah, here's questions you can ask yourselves to start playing with the viewpoints as you tell your stories across disciplines.

271
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:49,343
So when you and all those different brains are breaking the story, you could ask, how does the power

272
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:49,863
All right.

273
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:09,653
Are our gestures realistic or expressive?

274
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:15,157
What is the contour of an NPC in relation to that architecture and what does that mean?

275
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,398
What gestures are they using?

276
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:19,560
How do they know we can see them?

277
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,582
Do their actions change, whether they're public or private?

278
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,844
How might that change what they do and what does that convey?

279
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:28,665
And last one, I swear.

280
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:33,969
Most importantly, communicating with all the viewpoints demands that we use all the tools in our toolbox.

281
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:42,456
If we are a medium where the player experiences time at the same rate as the content, then why shouldn't we use time to tell a story?

282
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:44,798
What does it mean when we encourage stillness?

283
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,740
What story do we convey when we speed up the actions?

284
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,623
Or use gameplay to tell us about how a character feels?

285
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:52,364
That's incredible.

286
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:55,535
So here we are.

287
00:26:56,036 --> 00:27:11,101
We have an ensemble, each with a different expertise, able to do what they do best while still being part of a holistic whole, communicating in the same language to express it in individual ways, working together to create one incredible story.

288
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:22,846
And with all that vocabulary, those tools, those values, you now have a way for an ensemble of game developers to start thinking like Stanislavski and Nemrovich-Denchenko did.

289
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:30,180
because when they prioritized how they made things, it changed their entire medium.

290
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,223
The ensemble of Moscow Art Theater made work in this style that is called realism.

291
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,684
It was a cool fad at the time.

292
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:41,286
It's the idea that art should imitate life.

293
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:45,108
It should embody it, not just imitate it.

294
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:54,232
That every part of the production should talk to each other, with set design that feels part of a story, with acting that acts like people behaved, with words like how people talked.

295
00:27:54,553 --> 00:28:02,657
And that trend of realism that their ensemble embraced and made famous in theater carried into a new medium of the time, cinema.

296
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:06,169
and even a century later, games.

297
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:17,935
The reason that realism still has a hold on our movies, our theater, our games, is because a group of artists in 1897 decided to work the way they wanted to.

298
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:22,518
And what they can teach us, we can carry forward here into our medium.

299
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,320
How we work is just as important as what we make.

300
