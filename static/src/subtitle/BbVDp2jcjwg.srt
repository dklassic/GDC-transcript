00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:08,487
Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:10,648
I'm Toby Hines. I'm the lead character artist

3
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:11,989
at Sony London Studio.

4
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:15,370
Just before we get going, I just need to remind you

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,291
that you'll get an email about a quarter of an hour

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:20,193
after this talk, and if you could give any feedback,

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:21,553
that would be absolutely brilliant.

8
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,054
Okay, let's get going.

9
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,675
So, this talk is on the development of the characters

10
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:26,456
for Blood & Truth.

11
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:29,717
This is the new action shooter for PlayStation VR.

12
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,663
Bluntruth has been developed by Sony London Studio.

13
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,845
Our primary goal is to make groundbreaking VR games.

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,627
We released VR Worlds in August 2016.

15
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:44,569
This was conceived as a set of experiences

16
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,610
to introduce players to PlayStation VR.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,731
Anybody played VR Worlds?

18
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:51,572
Good.

19
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,313
And did you play the London Heist?

20
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:55,435
Excellent.

21
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,791
The London Heist was by far the most popular of these games.

22
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,333
We were able to analyze data in the months after we released VR Worlds,

23
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,336
and it was twice as popular as the next most popular experience.

24
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,419
Now this might have been down to just people enjoying shooting things in VR,

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,682
but the feedback we got from playtests, reviews, social media and forums

26
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:24,585
told us that players found the character interactions really immersive and fun.

27
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,939
As you can see from this selection of quotes, the experience of having characters stood

28
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,541
before you in VR and interacting with them is very powerful.

29
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:37,984
Simple things like a character handing you a cell phone and being able to take it out

30
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:43,547
of their hands have real impact in VR because you're in the same virtual world as them and

31
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,228
you're physically performing these tasks.

32
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:49,831
So to take these learnings from the London Heist and have them form the pillars.

33
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,745
of our next game became the main driving force behind Blood and Truth.

34
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:58,066
How far could we push the envelope on character interaction and player immersion?

35
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,787
This generation of VR is still finding out what works and what doesn't work.

36
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,288
But there are already a lot of rules and commandments about what you should and shouldn't do

37
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,189
that have been put forward by various people.

38
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,789
Two of the big ones relating to characters have traditionally been

39
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,710
realistic characters don't translate well in VR

40
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,391
and players don't like their avatar to depict someone else.

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,711
Let's start with realistic characters.

42
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:32,136
The consensus being, making believable characters risks straying into uncanny valley, unsettling

43
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,357
players and ruining the immersive experience.

44
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:39,601
To avoid this for the London heist, we had stylized characters.

45
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,821
Now that worked for that tone of experience which was larger than life and over the top,

46
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,283
but we didn't want that style to become set in stone.

47
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:53,086
And once we'd finished VR Worlds, we knew we wanted a grittier, more serious tone for

48
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:53,866
the next project.

49
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,009
So we were keen to investigate more realistic characters.

50
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:00,691
We felt they could work in VR, we just needed the right conditions.

51
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,055
And making highly realistic game characters is very subjective.

52
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,686
People are hardwired to judge virtual humans

53
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:12,067
with every ounce of scrutiny evolution has given us.

54
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,408
And in VR, players are naturally even more critical

55
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,388
of realistic characters,

56
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:18,089
because we're essentially fooling them

57
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,509
that we inhabit the same world,

58
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,049
and there's no filter.

59
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,730
Added to this, the higher frame rate

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,051
we have to maintain for VR

61
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,411
means we can't use the same game memory budgets

62
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,212
reserved for regular console characters.

63
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:35,487
But what if the solution actually lay in the advantages we have in VR?

64
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:40,436
If we could create characters realistic and compelling enough to be believable and immerse

65
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,662
the player through their interactions with them, they'd be less inclined to...

66
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:50,079
And if we gave the player the starring role in the story and missions,

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,582
so they were never a detached observer,

68
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:55,546
again the focus would be on the unfolding drama

69
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,970
rather than whether the eye shader or skin shader was absolutely perfect.

70
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:03,135
With this approach we felt confident about exploring more realistic characters.

71
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:07,433
Now the second rule, players don't allow their avatar

72
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:08,593
to depict someone else.

73
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,734
The theory being that a VR experience will be spoiled

74
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,496
if a human avatar is a different gender or race to yourself.

75
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,237
To avoid this, there should be no determiner

76
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,498
of race or gender visible on the avatars.

77
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,599
This is why the player wore leather gloves

78
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:23,619
throughout the London heist,

79
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,600
but we ended up with weird situations

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,281
like sitting in a pub wearing leather gloves,

81
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,061
which is a bit odd even on a cold day.

82
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:32,203
Now this makes sense.

83
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:36,502
If the premise of your game is you're meant to be you

84
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,582
experiencing something amazing or magical,

85
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,443
but for a game like Blood & Truth,

86
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,903
where you're a James Bond, John Wick style hero,

87
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:45,504
escapism and role-playing is the whole premise.

88
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,624
Arkham VR, for example, is cool

89
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,164
because you get to be Batman.

90
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,225
I'd already mentioned giving the player

91
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:54,725
the starring role to immerse them.

92
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:58,726
Blood & Truth's key pillar is be the action hero.

93
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:01,206
So we are very focused on convincing people

94
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,447
they are this person and letting them revel in it.

95
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,313
So it seemed natural to have the hands of our hero

96
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,593
represented in the avatar.

97
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:12,614
The most important thing for us was the player

98
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:15,595
gets to feel they are Ryan Marks, SAS soldier,

99
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,796
embroiled in London's criminal underworld.

100
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,458
Scanning and photogrammetry.

101
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:25,999
Making realistic game characters

102
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,200
is challenging and time consuming.

103
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,241
More and more developers are utilizing photogrammetry

104
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,202
and 3D scanning to do this with impressive results.

105
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,280
And when it came to making realistic characters of Blood and Truth,

106
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:44,024
we thought it would be great to cast, costume, and scan real actors to play the key characters.

107
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:48,828
Essentially create digital doubles and use these same actors for the mocap sessions.

108
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,533
The game is set in modern day London, so we could easily cast suitable actors and buy appropriate costumes.

109
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:02,720
As an initial test of Blood & Truth, we downloaded free photogrammetry humans from the web and

110
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,063
reviewed them in the PSVR headset to see if they held up to scrutiny.

111
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:12,767
This enabled us to see highly realistic characters in VR without spending months making full

112
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:13,267
characters.

113
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,989
They actually read really well, which was great.

114
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:22,154
Problem was, we're a central London studio with limited space, so it was impossible to

115
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:25,496
build and maintain a permanent photogrammetry capture stage on site.

116
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,823
So we decided instead to look at handheld 3D scanners.

117
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,244
These could be used straight out of the box.

118
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:35,124
We'd simply book a meeting room with suitable lighting

119
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:35,965
and get scanning.

120
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:41,146
So I did some research and organized a demo at the studio

121
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,106
with Artec scanners.

122
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,686
The character team and I scanned a bunch of clothes

123
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,427
and heads so we could assess the detail

124
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,647
that we could capture.

125
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:52,048
We also scanned some poses for clothing deformation.

126
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,042
The results were really encouraging,

127
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:56,783
so I did a pitch for our leadership team,

128
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,125
and on the back of that we were able to buy an Artec Eva

129
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,366
and a Spyder scanner.

130
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,030
Now we moved into pre-production

131
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,012
and began looking at R&D and workflow.

132
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,274
We did some tests to simulate deformation on clothing.

133
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,996
The idea was we'd scan people in various poses,

134
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,718
capture the changes in folds,

135
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:17,379
and use these in game to make the clothing

136
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,200
look more realistic.

137
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,136
Here's a video of the first test we made,

138
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,457
using normal map blends and mesh blend shapes.

139
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,439
So there's no cloth sim going on here,

140
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,280
it's all blend shapes and normal map blending.

141
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:34,422
The next step was to create

142
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:35,963
a full benchmark character model.

143
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,985
We scanned me in a suit, not for my dashing good looks,

144
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,726
but it was a good test to see

145
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,567
if we could create an accurate digital double.

146
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,358
From this, we created a fully textured and rigged character.

147
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:49,819
We reviewed it in the headset again, and it looked great,

148
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,280
the first real validation of the process we were taking.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,181
It also served to define mesh and texture budgets

150
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,782
and timings on how long these characters would take to make.

151
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,804
Then I wrote a detailed production guide

152
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:04,104
going through the workflow from start to finish.

153
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,966
This guide was then adopted and added to

154
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,046
by the character team, and we could send it out

155
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,627
to Outsource as we brought them on board.

156
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,998
Initially we planned to handle facial rigs and blend shapes in-house,

157
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,361
and we worked with the animation and the rigging teams on initial tests.

158
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:25,867
We were getting some really good results, but it soon became clear this was going to be a monumental task

159
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,751
to get the level of quality we wanted for all our key characters.

160
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:33,456
This led us to seek a third-party vendor who specialized in this field to partner with us.

161
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,260
What the facial test did achieve though,

162
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,504
was a good base head mesh and UVs,

163
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,827
which was low poly enough for our budgets,

164
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:43,450
but still looked really good in the headset.

165
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,494
We could get a third party vendor to adopt this,

166
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:49,760
for our, adopt this topology for all our key characters,

167
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,981
sorry, for all our characters.

168
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,057
Character tiers.

169
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,741
Before production, we decided to split the character

170
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,004
into two tiers based on their level of fidelity.

171
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,489
Tier one was for key characters with speaking roles

172
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,612
who the player would interact with in drama scenes.

173
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,915
Tier two were for characters the player

174
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,216
would encounter during missions.

175
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,620
Let's talk about tier two first.

176
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:16,005
These were mostly male NPCs split into different factions,

177
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:19,526
such as the Street Gang and the Militia Fighters.

178
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:23,007
Each faction had four to five gameplay classes within them

179
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,947
with names like Heavy and Maniac.

180
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,789
We received concept art to use as character look guides

181
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,870
and briefs from design on the role of each gameplay cast,

182
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,010
which also needed to inform their look.

183
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,471
These are some of the Street Gang concepts.

184
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,772
They occupy a derelict tower block in the game

185
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,832
where you have to infiltrate

186
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:42,033
and rescue one of the key characters.

187
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,898
And this is the private security faction.

188
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,559
These are highly trained soldiers you encounter later in the game.

189
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,264
We decided the best way to get as much variety as possible

190
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,505
was to create these characters using a modular system.

191
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:01,607
So upper, lower bodies and heads and headgear and hair

192
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:05,829
could be interchanged to create many NPCs from relatively few pieces.

193
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,353
We hired a costume buyer to source clothing to match the concepts

194
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:12,513
and use some of our own.

195
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,937
You may notice this turn up later on.

196
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,900
I sourced and purchased the military gear

197
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,481
from various websites, mostly Airsoft ones.

198
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:27,763
And I contacted companies such as Bates Footwear,

199
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:30,984
Crye Precision, and Mechanics to license army boots,

200
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,486
clothing, and gloves to add more authenticity

201
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:34,866
to the private security faction.

202
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:37,948
And we licensed this awesome Ronin ballistic helmet

203
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,188
from DevTac in Japan.

204
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,210
We also brought a full set of riot armor.

205
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:48,117
I tried to order this from China originally, but I discovered I needed a government permit

206
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:48,617
to do so.

207
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:52,760
I was about to give up when I found a place in the UK that had a set for sale.

208
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:54,682
It's very cool.

209
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:59,245
All the tier 2 clothes were scanned in the studio with the Artex.

210
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:03,608
They were adjusted to fit a single scan body to use as a kind of mannequin to dress with

211
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:04,109
the scans.

212
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,454
We processed the scans in Artex Studio and then in ZBrush we adjusted them to fit over

213
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:11,575
the male body exactly.

214
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,974
and then began cleaning them up.

215
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,755
I could do an entire presentation

216
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,996
on just scan clean-up best practices,

217
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,397
but I won't bore you with that right now.

218
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:21,618
With this method, we could use the same rig

219
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:22,979
for all the Tier 2 characters.

220
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,460
We also had a pool of female assets

221
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,441
created as well for pets and civilians

222
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:29,803
that also were fitted to a single body and rig.

223
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,885
For the tier two heads, we scanned some of our team

224
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,806
with the RTX, basically anybody we could find

225
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:40,027
who looked intimidating, and we brought some scanned heads

226
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,589
from the 1024 web store to add some further diversity.

227
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,210
We ran these heads through our pipeline,

228
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,692
so they all used our base head topology and UVs.

229
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,675
We handled the facial rig for tier two characters in-house,

230
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:56,796
because we only needed it to be fairly basic

231
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,456
for barks and eye tracking.

232
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:03,671
Here are some Maya grabs of some of the finished tier two modular parts.

233
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,913
So this is a couple of the street gang upper bodies.

234
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:12,157
And here's a couple of the private security pieces as well.

235
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:16,860
We later added some accessories to the drop leg character on that guy so he could carry

236
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,082
brass bags or shotgun bandoliers to add a bit more variety.

237
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,683
Tier two characters came in between 30 and 40,000 tries.

238
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,103
Our creative services department made logos and designs

239
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,285
to add color and believability to the clothing

240
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,345
of the tier two characters.

241
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:38,489
Now, tier one.

242
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,751
As I said before, tier one were key characters

243
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,353
with speaking and dramatic scene roles.

244
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,215
We received concept art and biography to use as guides.

245
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:50,698
The next stage was auditioning and casting actors.

246
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,300
Once cast, we got their measurements,

247
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,521
brought costumes, and got them in for fittings.

248
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,473
Unlike the tier two characters,

249
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,474
they would be exact digital doubles,

250
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:02,196
so their bodies and rigs were unique.

251
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,518
After searching for a suitable vendor

252
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:07,400
to create the tier one character heads,

253
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,402
facial rigs and blend shapes,

254
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,263
we chose 3Lateral in Serbia.

255
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,825
They adopted our head topology

256
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:16,007
and were pleasantly surprised how well it held up,

257
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,888
and we were really pleased with the results.

258
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:19,610
Here are some of the heads

259
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,551
before we added hair, makeup, et cetera.

260
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,415
James Arntzer, our lead tech artist,

261
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:27,798
wrote some cool eye and skin shaders and lighting tweaks,

262
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:29,919
such as being able to procedurally generate shadows

263
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,002
from eyelids and using bent normal maps

264
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,863
to remove lighting artifacts.

265
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,967
The first step of Tier 1 was to scan the actors in yoga gear

266
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,868
or tight-fitting clothing at the studio

267
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,209
while doing the wardrobe fitting.

268
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,952
We create a base body for each actor in the rig pose,

269
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,774
much as we did for the Tier 1 characters and females.

270
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:51,856
Male and female bodies, sorry.

271
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,028
This base body was then used as a ref model

272
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:56,549
to dress with the clothing scans.

273
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,630
And it also worked as a representative placeholder

274
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,511
for animation to use for mocap previews.

275
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,152
Originally, we were gonna scan the tier one characters

276
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:08,412
in costume at the studio,

277
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:10,433
but as we were taking them over to 3Lateral

278
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,273
to do head scans,

279
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,334
we decided to scan their clothing over there too.

280
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,074
The main reason for this

281
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,775
was for the clothing deformation scans

282
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:17,795
I spoke about earlier.

283
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,472
We'd scan actors in a rig pose that matches the base body

284
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:24,354
and then a set of poses to capture clothing deformations

285
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:28,557
for fold to then create fold and crease normal map

286
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:29,858
blends and blend shapes.

287
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,581
We decided on a small set of poses

288
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,803
based on the most regular movements and deformations

289
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:37,144
we were likely to see in the game.

290
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,766
Some of these poses are hard to maintain

291
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,367
while capturing with handheld scanners,

292
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,869
so using three-lateralist photogrammetry's capture stage

293
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,810
made a lot of sense.

294
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,410
Let's talk about hair.

295
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,412
Getting hair to look good in the headset is a challenge.

296
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,734
Alpha is very expensive, and polycards can get very heavy

297
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:56,515
geometry-wise.

298
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:01,198
And the headset resolution can cause scintillation or shimmer

299
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:03,239
on hair, which can be distracting to players.

300
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,782
Luckily, tier two haircuts lend themselves to being non-alpha,

301
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:09,523
as the hair was either gel-backed, partly

302
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:10,784
shaved, or crew cut.

303
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,437
For the Tier 1 hair, we created a wig mesh with no alpha on it

304
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,479
that would define the big volumes of hair,

305
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,560
and then we clad this with alpha cards.

306
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,862
Again, James wrote some cool shaders

307
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,463
that blend card intersections

308
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:26,925
and would offset hair strands to simulate depth.

309
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,388
He also worked with the graphics programmers on techniques

310
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:32,510
to minimize any scintillation or shimmering.

311
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,094
Here are some examples of the finished Tier 1 characters

312
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,375
taken straight from the engine.

313
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:42,800
This is Michelle, who's your adopted sister in the game,

314
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,081
played by Clarissa Clayton.

315
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,246
This is Deacon, who's your SAS buddy,

316
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:50,507
played by Brian Larkin.

317
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,790
And this is Nick, your brother,

318
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,633
played by Jay Taylor, wearing a familiar leather jacket.

319
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:02,776
And this is Tony, the ruthless head

320
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,779
of the rival Sharp firm, played by Stephen Hartley.

321
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,761
Tier one characters came in between 40 and 50,000 tries.

322
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:15,248
And here's an example of one of the finished clothing deformations.

323
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:18,854
This is one of the characters' t-shirts, and this is how it looks in motion.

324
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,323
VR offers unique challenges, but also unique opportunities.

325
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,605
In VR, the player is the camera, and by that definition,

326
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:52,946
free to look at whatever they like.

327
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,708
I spoke earlier about trying to keep the players focused

328
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,828
on their role in the story.

329
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,151
But with the free camera, it does give us opportunities

330
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,752
to put nice details on characters

331
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,233
that hopefully players will notice.

332
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:08,276
The avatar, for example, the avatar hands, for example,

333
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,138
are something we expect players to scrutinize.

334
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:10,778
So.

335
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:14,033
If you hold them up and flex your fingers,

336
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,835
you'll see wrinkle maps and mesh blend shapes changing,

337
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,116
so knuckles and tendons appear on the skin

338
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,818
and the skin wrinkles realistically.

339
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,299
We also created blood flow maps

340
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,221
to simulate color changes in the skin.

341
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,722
So for example, the knuckles whiten

342
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,223
when the hand is drawn into a fist.

343
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:46,519
Adding details on characters are also great storytelling devices, especially in VR.

344
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:50,362
Easter eggs that allude or give hints to the history or backstory of a character.

345
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:57,367
Adding details, players that will hopefully notice and wonder about their meaning or significance.

346
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,890
Here are some examples on the Tier 1 characters.

347
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,143
Kayla, who's one of the main adversaries in the game, has this skull and flag motif

348
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:09,287
on her leather jacket and these war-like biblical quotes tattooed on her arms.

349
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:14,411
This alludes to her covert US military past and her somewhat precarious state of mind.

350
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:19,020
Deacon, your SAS buddy, has these tattoos on his arms.

351
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,622
Members of the SAS sometimes have tattoos

352
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,323
of the regiments they were recruited from.

353
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,785
In Deacon's case, the Royal Marine Commandos

354
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:26,826
with this dagger design,

355
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,289
and the Latin motto, Acta Non Verba.

356
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:30,850
How's everybody's Latin?

357
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,791
Does anybody know what that means?

358
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,477
Actions, not words, which is a very Deacon-like trait.

359
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,279
And on his left arm, he has the flag of St. Andrew

360
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:43,881
as the actor who plays him is a very proud Scotsman.

361
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:49,445
When we first meet Deacon, he has injuries from being interrogated.

362
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:53,288
When you're reunited with him later in the game, we wanted to give the player some idea

363
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,371
of the passage of time, so his injuries have only partially healed.

364
00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:02,015
The bruises are a deeper color, and he has steri-strips on some of the bigger cuts.

365
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,799
We wanted to give Michelle a sleeve tattoo.

366
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,723
We found out the actress, Clarissa, who plays Michelle, has Filipino ancestry, so we did

367
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:12,985
a traditional tribal tattoo.

368
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:17,225
And your brother Nick wears this silver ring,

369
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,626
and you're given it later in the game.

370
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,747
And if you hold it up closely,

371
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,028
you'll see it has blood and truth inscribed in Latin

372
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,168
on the circumference.

373
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,751
We work with the tech and tools team

374
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,572
to create a character assembler and viewer

375
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:34,793
that runs in our editor.

376
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,454
We can load various tier two modular parts

377
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,014
and build a character from those.

378
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,176
And we can pick colors and change the roughness on clothing.

379
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,374
using RGB masks exported from Substance Painter.

380
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,236
We can also change the build of characters

381
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,017
to make them thinner or more muscular.

382
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,658
These characters can then be saved as prefabs

383
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:54,799
for the designers to use.

384
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,562
And we can also use this character, sorry.

385
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,265
We can also use this viewer to review characters in VR.

386
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:09,847
The headset is key to getting assets signed off

387
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,788
with the art director, animators, and designers.

388
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,829
There's a really nice tactile quality

389
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,390
to reviewing characters in VR.

390
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,432
It really feels like you could reach out and touch them.

391
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,034
And being able to lean in and check out details

392
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:21,714
is really cool.

393
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:31,742
Thanks for your time, everybody.

394
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,243
I hope that's given you some insight

395
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:34,824
into Blood & Truth's characters.

396
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,246
Before questions, I just wanna show you

397
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,447
a bit of footage from the game.

398
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,848
So you're the first people outside of the studio

399
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:41,349
to see this.

400
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,183
And just to warn you, there's a bit of strong language, so brace yourself.

401
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,830
Make sure they're looked after.

402
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,491
That American bird.

403
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:16,751
What do we know?

404
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:19,572
She's military.

405
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:20,733
Professional.

406
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:22,334
No wonder you shit yourself.

407
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,214
Yeah, you're not wrong.

408
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:26,535
No one knows anything about her.

409
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,856
It's weird. You can't...

410
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,316
Hold on.

411
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:29,957
Go ahead.

412
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:33,038
We need to talk about what we do next.

413
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,319
Give him a slap in terms of fucking behave.

414
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:36,720
He's just trying it on because Dad's gone.

415
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:38,724
No, he's gone way too far for that.

416
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,644
He's not gonna start an all-out war. He's not big enough.

417
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:42,285
Well, he clearly thinks he is big enough.

418
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:44,746
We need to push back hard or we're finished.

419
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,167
Tony's gotta go.

420
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,247
Got it. Thanks.

421
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:54,208
We know where Tony's gonna be tonight.

422
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,429
Private party at his casino.

423
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,690
Great. He might as well be on fucking Mars.

424
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,230
Yeah, he'll be surrounded by his best people.

425
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:06,092
Then the last thing he'll expect is me turning up.

426
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:09,034
No way, Ryan. You are keeping well out of this.

427
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:11,575
It could work.

428
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:12,995
No, it's madness.

429
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,176
Could you do it? I can do it.

430
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,917
Did you hear what I just said? You are not getting involved.

431
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,197
But I'm already involved.

432
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:20,698
I could be in and out of there before anyone knows what's happened.

433
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:24,519
I deal with situations and people a lot heavier than Tony Sharp.

434
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,139
Ryan's right.

435
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,860
What the fuck are you thinking?

436
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,781
Tony won't stop here. We know that.

437
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,001
Mum, Ryan's trained for this.

438
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:32,402
Anyone else, you wouldn't think twice.

439
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,142
But it isn't anyone else, is it, Nicholas? It's your brother.

440
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:35,923
Okay, okay, fine.

441
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,501
At least we know where Tony will be tonight.

442
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,664
We can keep an eye where he goes afterwards and then pick on Mumin.

443
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:42,444
Why risk waiting?

444
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:45,346
If we've got a chance to take him down, we should do it.

445
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,009
Alright.

446
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,512
But the first sign of trouble, Ryan, we get you out of there.

447
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:53,393
Of course.

448
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,015
What weapons we got?

449
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,836
Let's have a look.

450
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,011
So it goes without saying, thank you.

451
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:13,013
It goes without saying that needs to be experienced in VR,

452
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:19,195
but even that moment where the characters are talking amongst themselves

453
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:22,716
and then you speak and everybody just turns to look at you

454
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,776
when you're in the headset, it's a real kind of,

455
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:25,337
whoo.

456
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,501
And this attention is suddenly on you,

457
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:29,602
and you are suddenly just brought into it.

458
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,303
So yeah, I'm really looking forward to you guys playing it.

459
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,544
If you have any questions, please step up to the mic.

460
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:37,885
Got some t-shirts here.

461
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:41,966
If anybody wants to ask a question, you can grab a t-shirt.

462
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:44,007
Thank you, everybody.

463
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:52,622
My own here, yeah. Not only for the t-shirt, I promise, but I stepped in just a few minutes late, so I apologize if this was addressed.

464
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:59,568
But in London Heist for PSVR Worlds, those characters were already, especially for the time, really impressively detailed.

465
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:05,192
Were you using any of the scanning approaches for those characters back then, or is this an entirely new pipeline?

466
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:08,415
Entirely new pipeline. Yeah, yeah. The London Heist ones were.

467
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:13,198
I mean, you know, we'd be doing high detail sculpts in Zbrush,

468
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:14,838
but it was all from scratch.

469
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,980
So this was a, I'd used photogrammetry

470
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,001
at a previous studio when I was working on Formula 1

471
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,582
to do Formula 1 drivers,

472
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,303
but this was doing it for all characters.

473
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,405
So yeah, it was a new pipeline altogether.

474
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,866
Gotcha. And then for the scene that we saw at the end there,

475
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:31,767
was that motion captured?

476
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,758
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

477
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:37,698
Awesome. And then for the purpose of just going into this

478
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:39,699
obviously more complicated approach,

479
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,560
do you think this is uniquely kind of key for VR

480
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,880
because of the immersion and how close you are?

481
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,721
Or is this just more generally

482
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:51,101
kind of the future of all game production, would you say?

483
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:57,022
I'd like to think what we're doing is going to be a step forward than that

484
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:58,823
until you try it.

485
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,823
But when people do try it, it is...

486
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:06,071
You know, the feedback we get from people trying it,

487
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:08,373
it's really immersive and it feels like a step forward.

488
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:11,275
So not only the drama scenes, but the missions as well.

489
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:14,057
So yeah, I'm excited about it.

490
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:16,879
So I hope we're pushing the medium forward.

491
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,481
Great. And sorry, just one last quick one.

492
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,123
So for the last scene was that it was motion capture,

493
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,645
but were they simultaneously acted or individually?

494
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:26,787
Yeah, they were acting together

495
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,268
and it was facial capture as well.

496
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,029
Cool. Thank you.

497
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:38,688
Hello, I'm curious when you're dealing with a conversations dialogue between the playable

498
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:47,676
character and the NPCs, do you encounter any lessons or non-obvious lessons when the playable

499
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:53,821
character speaks, how does the player feel like it's their body doing the talking and

500
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:56,724
not just some other specter in the room?

501
00:25:57,564 --> 00:26:06,493
It's a good question. It's one we thought about a lot, whether to make the character a kind of silent Gordon Freeman or whether to actually give him a voice.

502
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:21,127
And I think to reinforce that idea that you're playing this person and to make the player think they are Ryan Marks, it felt natural to have his voice because then you are, you know, to us it feels like we're...

503
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:23,723
making the player this person.

504
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,825
You have the role-playing side of it, which I spoke about.

505
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,228
Is his voice the first voice you hear in the game

506
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,930
to like familiarize the player with like,

507
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,052
oh, when you hear that voice, that's you?

508
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,934
Or do you hear a lot of other people talk for a while

509
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,376
and then just his voice comes up?

510
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:40,158
Or do people just understand

511
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,381
and there isn't really any necessary special considerations?

512
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,483
I think there's one voice before you.

513
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:55,112
Which is a chap called Carson who's basically in a kind of interview with you and recapping events.

514
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:59,538
So he comes in, introduces himself and then you get to speak.

515
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:02,161
So yeah, that's that's the first time you hear your own voice.

516
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:02,702
Thank you.

517
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:03,503
Okay.

518
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:13,272
So, real quick question is the voice of the main character, is that modulated in any way to like,

519
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:18,856
because people's voice when they actually talk sounds different in their, when it's in their head,

520
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:24,520
if that makes sense? So do you, do you modulate the voice at all for the main character to kind of

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,902
like, you know, change it ever so slightly so it sounds like it's...

522
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:31,505
I'd have to get one of our audio guys in here. I imagine they're...

523
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,547
I nearly pushed the whole lectern off here.

524
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,169
It's not actually attached to the stage.

525
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,730
So that would have been a brilliant way to finish.

526
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:40,031
Very rock and roll.

527
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:43,854
Yeah, you'd have to ask our audio team.

528
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:46,236
Their attention to detail always blows me away.

529
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:49,299
So they may well be doing, how do you hear your own voice

530
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:49,839
in your head?

531
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,341
I know certainly when I hear this back, I'll probably go,

532
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,302
oh, I sound weird.

533
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,504
But yeah, they might well be doing that.

534
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,265
But I haven't got an answer for you, I'm afraid.

535
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:58,046
Thank you, sir.

536
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,172
Anyone else?

537
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,304
Well, thank you everybody.

538
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:07,469
Cheers.
