1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,053
I'm Alana Pierce, and if you don't know me, I'm a video game writer working with Sony

2
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:19,317
Santa Monica Studio, but I also do podcasts and charity streams and a whole bunch of other

3
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:20,598
stuff that I won't bore you with.

4
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:22,800
Mostly just thank you all for joining me here today.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,981
It's so nice to see so many people's faces.

6
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:31,005
in person, I feel like after the last two years, which have felt like an entire decade,

7
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:35,451
if I'm being honest, it's just so nice to actually see people in person.

8
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,574
Even if maybe it's a little bit weird.

9
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:41,259
It's still not really used to if I'm supposed to shake people's hands or not.

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:47,782
I hope you're all having a great time catching up on all the sessions and conversations that

11
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:50,863
I'm sure we've all been missing for the last two years are obviously really important to

12
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:51,384
the industry.

13
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:55,286
I don't want to hop on about this for too long because we've all heard about it constantly

14
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:55,846
and it sucks.

15
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:56,686
It definitely

16
00:00:57,507 --> 00:01:00,130
does feel strange to realize that you all have legs.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,597
I feel like I'm so used to seeing people on Zoom calls or Teams meetings just from here

18
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,298
up now.

19
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:11,624
It's good to remind myself that people are full-bodied and not just the webcams that

20
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:11,965
we see.

21
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:13,686
Thank you all for coming.

22
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:18,048
Obviously, a lot of things have changed for game development itself over the past two

23
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:18,269
years.

24
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:22,171
Not only have indie devs missed out on some of the incredible networking opportunities

25
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,894
that events like GDC are so helpful for, but we've also all just had to get used to our

26
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:29,095
offices also being in our homes.

27
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:32,117
I lived in a studio apartment up until November.

28
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:37,718
Let me tell you, having your bedroom, and your living room, and your kitchen, and your

29
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:42,680
office all be in one 300 square foot box is not ideal, especially in LA.

30
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,160
It was very hot.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,200
I would not recommend it.

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,021
But of course, a lot of people had it a lot worse than I did, and most developers also

33
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,923
had to get used to rebalancing their entire work and personal lives, and a whole lot of

34
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,983
games got delayed which of course happens.

35
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:02,164
Frankly, as numerous injustices have wrecked our world, I think we've all just been doing

36
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:08,469
the best that we can to support our colleagues and friends and families and communities going through a whole bunch of

37
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:14,575
difficult times right now. I do want to give a really specific shout out to the several game studios in Ukraine

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,717
Ubisoft Kyiv, 4A Games, Roommate Studio,

39
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:24,163
GCS Game World, Beat Shapers, Bestway, Frogwares and Vostok Games to name a few.

40
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,845
I can't imagine what they're going through.

41
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:36,622
Saying something like, I hope you're okay, really doesn't feel like enough by any stretch,

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,826
but I did want to take the time to acknowledge them somehow.

43
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:42,854
In any case, that is enough from me.

44
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:47,556
Today we are celebrating the developer's renaissance and the positive forces shaping our industry

45
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,937
with a series of three talks.

46
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:53,680
Our first speaker will break down how Eidos Montreal rethought their balance between well-being

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,402
and efficiency in a remote hybrid work environment.

48
00:02:56,702 --> 00:03:01,365
Joining us via live stream, please welcome David Anfossi, head of studio at Eidos Montreal.

49
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:03,806
Hello, hello.

50
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,028
Do you hear me?

51
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,009
Hello.

52
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:08,930
How are you doing?

53
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:10,523
I'm good, you?

54
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,406
Very good, glad to confirm this is live.

55
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,687
Thank you so much for joining us.

56
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:16,449
I won't take up any more of your time.

57
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,791
I'm gonna head off stage, but everybody, enjoy.

58
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,114
Thank you.

59
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:23,777
Hi everyone.

60
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:27,821
I'm David Amfossi, Eidos Montreal Studio Head.

61
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,182
Thank you for being here.

62
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,966
Just to reassure you, I have a full body, even in Zoom.

63
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:40,976
Actually, I would have liked to meet you in person, but at Eidos we have decided that it's too early to travel.

64
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:48,841
And we are actually facing a new wave here in Quebec. So be ready.

65
00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:52,303
And let's start.

66
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:58,588
So beyond the expert, I am an introvert person who needs preparation.

67
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:04,171
analysis and above all listening before being comfortable expressing my opinion.

68
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:12,376
And as you can hear I have a nice French accent. So you will understand that today I'm stepping

69
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:22,844
out of my comfort zone. Please be patient with me and let's start. So um

70
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:32,631
a bit of context why we decided to shift the organizational culture here at Eidos and how

71
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:40,413
and and what kind of results we obtained to date. So quickly on that slide as you can read I have

72
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:47,175
some experience in the gaming industry but what is important here is that I have also worked

73
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,376
in mature industries like automotive and toys.

74
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:56,054
Not that I did not want to work in the gaming industry when I finished school,

75
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:59,795
but in 1995, it was not that easy in France.

76
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:04,577
Actually, Infogrames, Atari Interactive now, refused to let me in.

77
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:06,297
Thank you, guys.

78
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,759
But in the end, it has been a chance, to be honest.

79
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,640
It has a big impact on my approach and vision,

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,381
and I hope you will see that through this presentation.

81
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,701
And here are two examples.

82
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:23,868
on how my previous experiences can influence me.

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,372
We are currently living in a period of consolidation

84
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:29,333
in our industry.

85
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,675
But the automotive industry already

86
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,038
lived through an era of consolidation decades ago.

87
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,362
I see it as an opportunity to read into the future

88
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,865
and learn from their experience.

89
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:50,611
Another example, the toy industry is a pioneer in exploiting its IPs and thus reaching a

90
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:55,016
much wider audience and amortizing its creation costs on different products.

91
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:07,057
More context about Quebec. As you can read here on that slide, all major studios and publishers

92
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:15,785
have a local branch here, especially in Montreal, with more than 200 studios. So, no need to say

93
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:23,972
that it's very tough here, and it's easy also to understand why a company culture is very strategic.

94
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:35,284
And in March 2020, when COVID-19 hit, we went the final stage here at Montreal, at Eidos-MontrÃ©al,

95
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:41,646
of our testing of a virtual desktop approach, a way to counter full employment in Quebec.

96
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:50,850
So it only took us one day to decide to switch to work from home. 500 employees deployed in two

97
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,711
weeks, even before the recommendations of the public health departments.

98
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,369
From that moment, as for the majority of the industry,

99
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:00,970
our context changed,

100
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,731
making the competition tougher than ever also.

101
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,953
There is no border anymore with the advent of remote work.

102
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:17,076
Being separated, we quickly implemented wellness surveys,

103
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:20,918
highlighting issues related to the pandemic, of course,

104
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,760
like stress, isolation, family overload.

105
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:33,327
to name these. But we also realized that we did not really know the Edossians and their concerns.

106
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:40,111
Not that we did not have employee well-being at heart, but since we were all working together

107
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:48,955
in one place, we assumed we knew each other, which is totally wrong. As a first step and

108
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:52,517
based on the results of these surveys, we implemented some quick actions.

109
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,542
Setting up studio and project showcases for more visibility.

110
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,263
Setting up a weekly studio meeting

111
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:03,304
named Virtual Beer Time.

112
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,126
Yes, before the pandemic, every Friday,

113
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,428
at the end of the day, we took to get together

114
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,609
to have a chat.

115
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,391
And we decided to replicate that moment

116
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:18,073
with the Virtual Beer Time to see each other,

117
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:21,535
to get together, to stay informed.

118
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,039
and answer questions, of course.

119
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:28,643
We also organized online sessions with a psychologist

120
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:32,026
for people who feel isolated or overloaded with family.

121
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,448
We improved insurance covering.

122
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,170
We organized a lot of activities,

123
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,332
sport, cooking, gardening activities, online activities.

124
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:47,178
So I'm very proud that we were able to act quickly

125
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,499
to implement these actions.

126
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,181
But at the end, it was not enough.

127
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:54,885
How to fix the problem of circulation of information?

128
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,726
How to get to know each other better?

129
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,167
With a studio of approximately 500 experts,

130
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,248
the observation is simple.

131
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,529
The well-being of the employees

132
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,409
and the performance of the studio

133
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,070
cannot rest on the 4 or 5 experts of the upper management.

134
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,391
It's too pressure,

135
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,732
not good for their well-being,

136
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,593
and proves to be unrealistic and ineffective.

137
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:29,897
It was time to put into practice a philosophy we had been thinking about for a couple of years,

138
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,740
an approach based on collective intelligence and accountability.

139
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,303
We needed to move from a standard organization to an ecosystem,

140
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:44,846
an environment that supports and promotes self-expression.

141
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,751
But don't forget, we were in the middle of a pandemic.

142
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,086
So is it the best time to add major changes?

143
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,849
Indeed, beyond the technical and logistical challenges

144
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,372
of remote work, it was necessary to redefine

145
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:03,773
the development methods too,

146
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,856
already involving significant changes for everyone.

147
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,360
So again, is now the best time to add major changes?

148
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,222
For us, the answer is yes.

149
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,985
Status quo is not an option.

150
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:22,080
we have to be true with the studio values,

151
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,484
which are people, courage, business savvy,

152
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,405
and continuous improvements.

153
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,628
It was also critical to resolve,

154
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,611
at least reduce our difficulty in detecting problems.

155
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:42,897
So we began our transition from an organization

156
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,598
based on common policies rules,

157
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,561
to a cultural approach based on self-expression.

158
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:57,261
But we have to start to create a workspace in which experts can express their ideas and opinions.

159
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:04,425
It may seem surprising, but the biggest challenge in this approach is to deprogram ourselves.

160
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:12,209
Forget our old reflex of control, hierarchy, old artefacts from the industrial era.

161
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,394
And there is no magic recipe. Everything goes through communication, communication and communication.

162
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:28,835
Encouragement takes initiative, promoting external and internal initiatives.

163
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:35,878
It has been key for us to show that it's not just words, but that it's reality and feasible.

164
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:41,540
So the studio has led by example by putting into practice two initiatives

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,623
that promote empowerment and autonomy. First, flexibility in working hours.

166
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:55,630
helping 77% of the employees, and workplace flexibility.

167
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:02,653
So there is nothing perfect, and it will be a long process,

168
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,234
but there are more and more initiatives,

169
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,076
and the studio management is no longer the only entity

170
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:11,077
to decide for the studio performance

171
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,398
and EdoScience well-being.

172
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,000
The EdoScience are now more proactive

173
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,021
and create working groups on their own.

174
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:22,659
and feel encouraged to participate in the life of the studio.

175
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,280
Here are two examples of progress we made.

176
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,302
Example one, as mentioned at the beginning of the presentation,

177
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:38,123
competition is tough in Quebec. So during a studio meeting,

178
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:42,384
a virtual beer time, we were discussing the problem

179
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:48,186
and Edothien decided on the spot to create a retention committee.

180
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:52,624
And it quickly grew, bringing together a dozen experts,

181
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:57,246
initiating surveys, meetings, and developing proposals.

182
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:01,928
The good thing about that initiative

183
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,909
is that no one questioned it,

184
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,430
and time, no question the initiative, sorry,

185
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,631
and the time spent by the experts in this committee.

186
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:13,693
Example two.

187
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,814
After we switched to work from home,

188
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:19,055
we detected a drop of productivity.

189
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,790
Several causes for it.

190
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,011
Working remotely, communication channels have multiplied.

191
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,812
Slack, emails, phone, Zoom, Teams, just to name these,

192
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,672
causing a lot of disturbance during the day.

193
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,654
Boundary between private life and work is now blurred.

194
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:42,255
But that way is not sustainable in the medium long term.

195
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:47,096
Stress and fatigue take over, and efficiency, productivity

196
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,117
are greatly reduced.

197
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:53,873
And like every company, we also face the great resignation.

198
00:13:56,654 --> 00:14:00,355
In this case, collective intelligence has been key.

199
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:05,177
We all work to propose ideas to improve our efficiency

200
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,117
and question our current methods.

201
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:09,998
After a month of work,

202
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:13,559
we decided to start a test with several action points.

203
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:20,529
which aims to improve studio performance and our well-being,

204
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,971
giving birth to a work program of 32 hours per week

205
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:25,751
over four days.

206
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,733
Because we all work together to find a solution,

207
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:34,035
the acceptance rate for this gigantic change

208
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,255
was extremely high.

209
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,837
We monitor the test to learn and adjust, of course.

210
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:43,339
For example, we know that we are in the right direction,

211
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,320
but there is still work to do.

212
00:14:48,189 --> 00:15:00,596
Few numbers. Approximately only 9% of Edossians are at the moment not able to complete all the work schedule for their week in four days, 32 hours.

213
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:11,322
Only 6% of Edossians are not able to have a work rhythm that allows them to finish their work week without being exhausted.

214
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:17,805
And only 7% of Edossians are less productive with this new program.

215
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,644
So at the end, it's great results.

216
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,365
I'm very, very happy.

217
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,946
It's very positive, but we still have to adjust

218
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,746
and test new things to make sure

219
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:32,447
that everyone feel comfortable at work

220
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:37,868
and have a well-balanced private life, of course.

221
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,389
So all the Eidosians have at the heart

222
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,989
the studio of performance,

223
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,590
because Eidos is an ecosystem

224
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,270
where people are linked around the same values.

225
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:53,341
valued as human beings and others send the decisions that affect them.

226
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:05,928
In conclusion, our learning shows that making the spectrum complex and heavy

227
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:11,250
by adding more managers as the company grows should not be the first action.

228
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,490
Preparing for growth by building a culture of accountability,

229
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,491
participation without silos can yield more impressive results.

230
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:26,271
There is nothing stronger than collective intelligence

231
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:29,752
and the structure and perpetual adjustment according to needs.

232
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:35,813
With an ever-increasing collective participation that

233
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,414
unites us, we continue to learn at Eidos,

234
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:40,594
explore, and test new avenues.

235
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,419
which I hope to share with you next year.

236
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,620
Quick examples.

237
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,001
Remove job descriptions.

238
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,422
Every Hello Ciento feel free to participate

239
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,863
to the success of the studio by any way.

240
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,384
Remove the management of rest holiday.

241
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,425
Why should we manage the rest time?

242
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,406
Every expert is better placed to judge.

243
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,087
Train a supportive leadership

244
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,808
for greater professional autonomy.

245
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:17,808
decentralization of budget to the experts, revise the structure toward a more agile and efficient

246
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:26,634
ecosystem, etc. etc. So we still have a lot of work as you can see. Thank you for listening.

247
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:30,797
I hope this will be useful to you and thank you very much.

248
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,572
I wanted to say thank you, David, for enlightening us as to what worked and what didn't in your

249
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:44,233
studio's journey.

250
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:46,676
Also, I could listen to that accent forever!

251
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:49,760
Thank you so much.

252
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,261
Thank you very much.

253
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:51,722
Take care.

254
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,852
So now we are going to shift gears towards addressing the social factors that affect

255
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:57,653
our daily lives.

256
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:01,596
Our next speaker will share initiatives that Sony Interactive Entertainment took to support

257
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:02,937
DE&I efforts.

258
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:07,861
Please welcome to the stage Director of Support Services and Operations and Blackett PlayStation

259
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,742
Employee Network President Davina Mackey.

260
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,348
That was awesome, right?

261
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:24,310
Throughout history, we've witnessed many examples

262
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,553
of movements when a group of people work together

263
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,534
to advance their shared ideas.

264
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:34,696
We've been affected by the Civil Rights Movement,

265
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:39,198
the Women's Right Movement, the Right to Vote Movement,

266
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,500
the LGBTQ Plus Movement, the Me Too Movement,

267
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,801
and the Black Lives Matter Movement.

268
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:51,926
All of these movements make and are making change in our society.

269
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:58,631
Every industry, every company, every employee has been impacted

270
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:05,036
by a movement at some point in time, and the video game industry is not exempt.

271
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:10,840
So the video game industry is facing its own D.N.I. movement.

272
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,604
And the news media regularly has stories about our industry.

273
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:17,627
falling short.

274
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,329
But there's an opportunity for us

275
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,210
to make a significant difference.

276
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:27,294
There are people in this room who are immersed in DE&I.

277
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:31,397
And like me, you're committed to creating

278
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,479
a better work environment that serves everyone.

279
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,422
But I've been working in this space for over five years.

280
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,864
And some of you may be brand new to DE&I.

281
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:50,184
I want to thank you so much for being here and taking the steps to become active or to

282
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,144
become an ally.

283
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:59,007
And no matter how new you are or how experienced in the field, whatever contribution you can

284
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,987
make now, it really matters.

285
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,048
See, we all face the same challenges.

286
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:07,029
How do we change our behavior?

287
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,150
How do we change our practices, our procedures?

288
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:17,308
How do we change our culture so that every employee knows

289
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:21,729
and feel that diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging

290
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:25,831
is relevant and carries weight in our organizations?

291
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,771
At Sony Interactive Entertainment,

292
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:33,173
our approach to DEN required a paradigm shift,

293
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,073
pre and post pandemic.

294
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:39,395
And I'm excited to have a discussion with you.

295
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:43,658
And I look forward to hearing your ideas

296
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,064
about your own paradigm shifts after the talk.

297
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:58,031
So looking back, our paradigm pre-pandemic was different.

298
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:03,275
Our employee networks were juiced about bringing awareness

299
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,058
about their culture to the organization.

300
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,760
We were great at planning network events

301
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,542
with ethnic food and ethnic dancing,

302
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:17,607
having keynote speakers who made us aware of current events

303
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:21,850
or taught us about key times in history for a demographic.

304
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:25,093
And we visited marginalized schools

305
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:28,095
and told students about opportunities

306
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,517
in the video game industry.

307
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,599
We donated money through our Benevity System

308
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,982
to nonprofit organizations like the Boys and Girls Club.

309
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:39,830
like girls who code and game heads.

310
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,732
And we were very successful at cultural awareness,

311
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:45,532
that paradigm.

312
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:50,014
However, there is more to DE&I than cultural awareness.

313
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:50,875
We all know this.

314
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:55,817
We have action, we must have action that moves the needle,

315
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:57,957
and that's a new paradigm.

316
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,779
So we were starved.

317
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:06,364
We didn't have much transparency or access

318
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,264
to global demographic data.

319
00:22:09,184 --> 00:22:11,545
We didn't know the number of women versus men

320
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:12,285
in the company.

321
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:15,766
We didn't know how many black or Asian

322
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,566
or Latinx employees were in the company.

323
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:24,347
And we barely knew how many people were in the company

324
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:25,687
from a global perspective.

325
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,688
And I'm talking about the general population of SIE.

326
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:31,348
So we were data starved.

327
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:36,237
The US, they had their own DE&I strategy.

328
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,540
Europe, their own strategy.

329
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,225
Japan, they addressed strategy, DE&I in their own way.

330
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:46,789
And our executive leadership was fine

331
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,931
with handling DE&I locally.

332
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:53,076
But we realized we needed a global strategy.

333
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,042
DE&I was driven through E-Net initiatives locally

334
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:05,705
and not embedded into SIE's core goals and objectives,

335
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:06,985
which are global.

336
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,395
So how did this play out?

337
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,578
Well, what we observed was there was no incentive

338
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:16,699
for middle management to advocate for DE&I

339
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,542
or even to participate or even encourage participation

340
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:21,663
from their subordinates.

341
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:26,546
And what that meant was there was no DE&I movement globally.

342
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:32,729
So pre-pandemic, there were less than 3% of black employees

343
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,151
at Sony Interactive Entertainment.

344
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,112
And at the director and up,

345
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,243
I would say that I was a pink unicorn.

346
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:45,686
I was the highest ranking black female employee

347
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,428
in PlayStation Studios.

348
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:49,930
And there was no one like me.

349
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,352
And if you take into consideration

350
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,235
all the population of SIE,

351
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:58,316
well, I graduated to a unicorn.

352
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,918
Because sprinkled throughout the organization,

353
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:03,320
there were a few colleagues just like me.

354
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:08,247
And I'm the kind of woman that once I commit to something,

355
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:09,428
I follow through.

356
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,371
So I didn't mind being a trailblazer

357
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:13,872
for our black population.

358
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,994
And I loved rolling up my sleeves

359
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,918
and being a part of the Black at PlayStation movement.

360
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:25,721
And guys, I'm sorry, I, you know, there you go.

361
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,227
The pandemic hits.

362
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,552
It's May 25th, 2020, and George Floyd's death

363
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,034
was a tragedy witnessed by the world.

364
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:45,218
Now, this was a pivotal moment for Sony and SIE,

365
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:48,180
and for most corporations across the globe.

366
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,004
You all remember where you were on 9-11

367
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:54,706
and how you felt watching what happened.

368
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:57,769
Well, I can tell you the black community

369
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,830
has a similar reaction to May 25th, 2020.

370
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:06,006
We know what we were doing and how it made us feel watching it.

371
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,607
And sadly, we didn't think anyone

372
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:13,568
would be held accountable like so many times in our history.

373
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:18,569
What was unprecedented was Sony and SIE's reaction and support.

374
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:23,410
There was a movement in external communication.

375
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,971
And SIE posted a statement on Twitter

376
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,432
denouncing systemic racism.

377
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:33,649
and violence against the black community.

378
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,912
And then they placed the hashtag at the end of that statement.

379
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,514
Hashtag, Black Lives Matter.

380
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,697
Honestly, I thought it was in a parallel universe.

381
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:45,378
It was extraordinary.

382
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,122
And then a month later, I get a call from the head of DE&I.

383
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:55,386
She said, Davina, Jim Ryan, who is our CEO,

384
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:59,509
he would like an audience with the Black App PlayStation

385
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:00,449
leadership.

386
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:05,752
We were freaking amazed and I'll put an exclamation point at the end of that.

387
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:09,596
Jim was attentive and authentic.

388
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:16,744
He listened to us and surprisingly to those who hear this, Black at PlayStation for the

389
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:23,751
first time felt like we finally could ask for what we wanted and needed without retribution.

390
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:27,234
Well, we put a strategy together.

391
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:28,917
We asked for programs.

392
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,321
We asked for sponsorship.

393
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,486
And we asked for proper funding.

394
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,088
And we got it.

395
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:36,168
Now.

396
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,487
Written as a response to George Floyd's killing,

397
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:54,749
John Platt, who was the first black chairman and CEO

398
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:57,570
of Sony ATV Music Publishing,

399
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,032
wrote an article called A Change Must Come.

400
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,793
And in addition to that provocative open letter,

401
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:09,419
He had the audacity to ask Sony board of directors

402
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,760
and convince them to donate $100 million

403
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,601
to organizations dedicated to social justice initiatives.

404
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:19,321
And they listened.

405
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:21,602
They gave the donation.

406
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:25,662
It was split amongst all the Sony subsidiaries

407
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,623
so that they could support the nonprofit organizations

408
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:31,103
of their choice.

409
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,744
And this was a life-altering.

410
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,040
situation to our movement.

411
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,261
SIE even added another million dollar donation.

412
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,463
So back at PlayStation, we leveraged this

413
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:52,944
and we facilitated a panel with John Platt,

414
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:55,505
Jim Ryan, and Tiffany Hester.

415
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,128
Now, this was pivotal because it was the first time

416
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:01,989
the black employees, globally,

417
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,309
would have a seat at the table

418
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:06,990
or get to hear from a black CEO.

419
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,630
This was amazing.

420
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,591
SIE also did something phenomenal.

421
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:17,612
They approved a Black Lives Matter theme

422
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,353
on the PS4 platform.

423
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:24,214
So imagine the fist pump, black screen, yellow piping.

424
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:26,788
PlayStation 4 platform.

425
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:30,829
This was huge and unconventional.

426
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:38,810
SIE's logo and the commitment to quality is so high that this was extraordinary for us.

427
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:43,832
But they believed in the Black Lives Matter movement and they did it.

428
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,712
And they even went further.

429
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:53,254
Guys, there are people walking around globally with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and PlayStation symbols.

430
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:56,157
Again, huge.

431
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,878
And one of the greatest accomplishments

432
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,299
of this next step paradigm

433
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,001
was the DE&I's initiative to level the playing field

434
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,122
for all E-Nets.

435
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:12,663
See, each E-Net was assigned an executive sponsor

436
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,325
who reports directly to Jim,

437
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:18,266
who can advocate on their behalf

438
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:21,227
and ensure goals, objectives, and challenges

439
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:23,168
are addressed at the highest level.

440
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,217
For example, pre-pandemic,

441
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:30,020
Black App PlayStation's executive sponsor

442
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,221
was at the senior director level.

443
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:34,323
And Jay, we love you to death.

444
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:36,765
He is now our advisor.

445
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,948
But after this pivotal moment,

446
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,849
after the meeting with Jim Ryan,

447
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,451
Black App PlayStation was assigned

448
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:48,535
the dopest executive sponsor at PlayStation,

449
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:49,876
who's director, Jim Ryan.

450
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,321
His name is Herman Holtz, and he is the head of PlayStation Studios.

451
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:58,882
And he has been an amazing all around great leader.

452
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:03,123
And I've had the pleasure of being mentored by him for a year.

453
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:04,423
It's been amazing.

454
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:09,385
Now, today,

455
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:14,546
today, our D.N.I. movement and new paradigm is global.

456
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:21,343
The DE&I global operation team, well, they're now in the US,

457
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:24,548
they're in Europe, and they're in Japan.

458
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:28,053
And together, they drive a global strategy.

459
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:31,524
Today we have data.

460
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,446
We are no longer data starved.

461
00:30:34,326 --> 00:30:37,129
And we appreciate the women at PlayStation

462
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,152
for being assertive and leading the charge

463
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:43,394
to request for demographic data.

464
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:47,857
And each ENET came on board to support this request.

465
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,940
And the Senior Vice President of Human Resources,

466
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,463
Orit Ziv, and her team, which includes DE&I,

467
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,821
They came through as promised.

468
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:00,962
We now have access to demographic data,

469
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:07,366
and having access to this allows SIE to set KPIs

470
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,947
and metrics to move the needle,

471
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:12,769
especially for those internal groups

472
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,209
who are underrepresented.

473
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,911
Today, we drive belonging.

474
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:26,579
Orit and the DE&I team organized a deep dive meeting to allow all eNets to present their

475
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,879
three-year strategy.

476
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,561
One of the goals came from Pride at PlayStation.

477
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:39,724
It was to help enhance features in our enterprise systems to allow for non-binary gender identities.

478
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:46,127
Pride at PlayStation was able to advocate for our colleagues who are impacted, and a

479
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,627
change was made immediately.

480
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,280
We can add pronouns and name designations to HR systems.

481
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,760
We have guidelines for our email signatures

482
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,141
and collaboration tools.

483
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:03,101
And this was a significant endorsement

484
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:05,542
of DE&I culture and values.

485
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:10,243
Today, we enable inclusion.

486
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:14,884
The DE&I team facilitated the first global survey

487
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,165
to define and enable inclusion and belonging.

488
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,051
for our global employees.

489
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,572
This new paradigm ensures all levels in the organization

490
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:28,132
have a voice to express how they feel,

491
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:32,473
and they are able to be their whole self at work

492
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:35,934
and still feel included or that they belong.

493
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:43,936
Go back one, please.

494
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:48,824
Sorry.

495
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:52,104
Today we work to enforce equity.

496
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:55,705
We even have a policy that encourages recruiters

497
00:32:56,165 --> 00:33:00,406
and hiring managers to execute equitable hiring practices

498
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:03,907
by including qualified diverse talent

499
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:06,727
in the pool of candidates for each interview.

500
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:10,928
Now we're at the early stages of this and it's working.

501
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:16,870
Okay, so let's take a survey.

502
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,221
What is the percentage of women that represent

503
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:24,561
the consumer base in the video game industry?

504
00:33:25,022 --> 00:33:26,982
Now, I'm gonna give you four options.

505
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:27,942
15%, 30%, 50%, or 70%.

506
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:29,803
By a showing of hands, who thinks it's 15%?

507
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:30,103
About 30%.

508
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:30,943
How about 50%? 70%?

509
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:54,276
Alright, the most of you said 50% and you're right, it's 50%.

510
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,478
And what's great, our courageous leader Jim Ryan,

511
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,520
well, he has driven change.

512
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,261
His leadership team is 50% women,

513
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,803
which represents the global consumer base.

514
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:10,105
And looking at the entire women working

515
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:13,367
in the video industry, well, they represent 30%.

516
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:15,909
So we have work to do.

517
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:20,688
And you may ask yourselves, does your executive team

518
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,788
reflect your consumer base?

519
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:26,869
And what is the percentage of women working at your company?

520
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,970
These are our eNets.

521
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,991
They're doing amazing work within their communities

522
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,612
and in collaboration with one another.

523
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:41,812
I'm gonna point out a few of them.

524
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:45,595
Vets at PlayStation, well, they partnered

525
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:48,576
with the Wounded Warriors Project,

526
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:53,819
both to raise money and help veterans find employment

527
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,420
after their military service.

528
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,462
Black at PlayStation collaborated

529
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,883
with the Black Collegiate Gaming Association

530
00:35:02,263 --> 00:35:06,585
to support 16 historically black colleges and universities

531
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:11,308
to open gaming labs facilities on each of their campuses.

532
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:13,791
This is a first for HBCUs.

533
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:22,978
UNIDOS at PlayStation, well, they are in liaison with SIE and a non-profit organization called

534
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:30,004
Latina in Tech. And they're running recruiting events that advertise open opportunities in the

535
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:37,470
Latin community. And one of our most encouraging things that I witnessed was watching API at

536
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,513
PlayStation launch their e-net during the pandemic.

537
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:45,114
they were able to provide education, trainings,

538
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:49,057
and most importantly, a safe space to process

539
00:35:49,177 --> 00:35:51,359
and protect against anti-Asian hate.

540
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,002
And finally, I wanna recognize ABLE at PlayStation.

541
00:35:56,743 --> 00:36:01,947
They joined Valuable 500 and collaborated with the DE&I team

542
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,390
to benchmark our accessibility and disability inclusion

543
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,713
through Disability In and their Disability.

544
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:20,807
Equity Index. SIE received top scores of 100 and earned the title 2021 Best Place to Work

545
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,228
for Disability Inclusion.

546
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:35,771
So post-pandemic, we're working.

547
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:37,804
in our new paradigm.

548
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:41,286
And the DE&I movement is global and strategic.

549
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:44,627
However, there's still a lot of work to do.

550
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:48,448
And I am proud to be a part of the continued movement.

551
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:52,430
We don't have a strategy fully ironed out.

552
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,652
However, I do have five points and ideas for the future.

553
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:05,729
We need managers and leaders who are aware of their bias

554
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:10,012
and can use empathy to make better business decisions

555
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:10,893
that are fair.

556
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:14,896
Now our managers and leaders are worldwide.

557
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:20,440
So to scale this effort, we will use training

558
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,542
to implement this strategy effectively.

559
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:28,421
We want to deploy a sponsorship program

560
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,644
for women in underrepresented talent

561
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:33,787
so that they have an advocate to support them

562
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:35,769
in elevating their career.

563
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:39,833
We need a rotational leadership program

564
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,775
for directors and above to give employees

565
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:45,999
a well-rounded knowledge of the organization,

566
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:49,422
which will give them a career path into leadership roles.

567
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:58,736
A great idea is a diverse studio that focuses on diverse content and has diverse talent

568
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:03,339
to design compelling stories and games that represent the consumer base.

569
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,441
And I'm passionate about number five.

570
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,132
This is a paradigm, a program that focuses

571
00:38:13,372 --> 00:38:14,913
on the future generation.

572
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:18,114
I imagine that students in the seventh grade

573
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,635
would have access to an academy

574
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,537
that has SIE quality curriculum.

575
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:28,658
And from middle school to high school to university,

576
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,879
they can select a discipline.

577
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,001
And once in university, they have access to internships,

578
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,482
mentorships, and sponsorships.

579
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:43,420
And they finish with the certification that puts them above the rest of their peers.

580
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:51,941
They then go on to attend an apprenticeship program and then land a job in the video game industry, hopefully at SIE.

581
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:06,064
There's a DE&I framework that I really like called the Merit Worthy Framework.

582
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,361
It was created by Dr. Stephanie Creary,

583
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:14,142
a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

584
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:20,744
It is an acronym that helps elevate DE&I work

585
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:23,705
in an organization, and it offers structure

586
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:27,546
on how companies can change their DE&I paradigm

587
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,287
to a merit-worthy practice

588
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:33,268
that is valued across the company.

589
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,909
And there are two topics from the framework

590
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:37,889
that I wanna point out.

591
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,954
M stands for make DE&I goals actionable, measurable, evidence-based.

592
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:47,637
So leaders, they respond to data.

593
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:48,998
We all agree?

594
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:55,583
And they should make sure that DE&I goals are inspiring, measurable, and actionable

595
00:39:55,923 --> 00:40:03,430
so that DE&I work that is expected appears attainable by everyone in the organization.

596
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,511
And T stands for...

597
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:09,623
Work as a core part of the organization

598
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:11,825
rather than peripheral work.

599
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:16,930
DE&I is traditionally nested in HR.

600
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:20,733
There are opportunities for paradigm shifts here.

601
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:24,276
So marketing is its own function

602
00:40:24,837 --> 00:40:27,199
and it's direct to the CEO.

603
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,863
Legal is its own function, direct to the CEO.

604
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,062
HR is its own function that is direct to the CEO.

605
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:41,226
And I think DE&I should be its own function

606
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,987
that is direct to the CEO.

607
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:47,190
And to take it further, the leader should have a title

608
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,513
like Chief Diversity Officer,

609
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,795
Senior Vice President of DE&I,

610
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:55,937
Head of DE&I.

611
00:40:56,958 --> 00:41:00,260
See, Salesforce is just a few blocks away from here, right?

612
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:06,613
And Laura Castillo Martinez is the Chief Equity Officer at Salesforce.

613
00:41:07,074 --> 00:41:09,098
And she reports directly to the CEO.

614
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,928
And if Salesforce can do it, so can companies in the video game industry.

615
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:32,436
When I agreed to take on this talk,

616
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:38,120
my hope was each of you would leave with one or two ideas

617
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,342
that you would think in more depth about

618
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:43,944
and apply them to your own organization.

619
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:46,565
So we have a lot of work to do,

620
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:51,669
but I am so glad that you are on this journey with me.

621
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,991
It has been an honor and a pleasure to be with you today,

622
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,713
and I am so glad that people like you

623
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:02,422
are on the DE&I movement with me. Thank you.

624
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:23,089
The whole industry is better for having people like her in it 1,000 times over.

625
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:24,609
That was awesome.

626
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,670
It's always good to highlight the importance of organisations taking a stance against injustice,

627
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,830
and we appreciate our talking here today.

628
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,391
We're going to close out our series of talks today with a story about how to elevate games

629
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:39,592
without compromising artistic or business integrity, all the while killing it with kindness.

630
00:42:39,993 --> 00:42:43,653
Please welcome to the stage co-founder of Devolver Digital, Mike Wilson.

631
00:42:55,197 --> 00:43:05,429
Hi, my name is Mike Wilson. I am here to talk to you today about Facebook. It's

632
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:08,953
worse than that actually. I'm here to talk to you about a Facebook post of

633
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:14,039
mine from the fall that somebody here read and thought I should come talk

634
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:14,279
about.

635
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,847
I don't usually give talks as I'm sure will become readily apparent to you in the next

636
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:21,387
few moments.

637
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:27,010
But I'm here because this one felt like it was maybe worth, a story worth telling.

638
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:34,553
The posting question was one that I made from my homeland of Shreveport, Louisiana on November

639
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:34,613
3rd.

640
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:43,375
from whence I came and from whence id Software came, actually, which is a big part of my

641
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,016
journey in this industry.

642
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:51,880
My post was about the fact that this little company I had helped found in 2009, Devolver

643
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,681
Digital, was somehow

644
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:57,366
not somehow, through a lot of hard work from all of my partners,

645
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:01,592
going public on the London Stock Exchange that very night,

646
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,658
or the next morning, for a ridiculous amount of money, a much bigger

647
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:09,063
level of success than we ever would have dared

648
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:09,183
dream.

649
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:14,308
You know, these days that's not such a big deal, right?

650
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:19,071
We hear wild numbers all the time and ludicrous valuations and all of this.

651
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:24,154
And what I wanted people to know in my post was what I was actually proud of there

652
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:27,156
was we had managed to achieve that level of success

653
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:32,039
without making any compromise to the values that we started off with,

654
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,200
which is, to be honest, just kindness,

655
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,003
respect for the artists who actually make games, and generosity.

656
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,749
So I thought I would take you through a little journey,

657
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,891
my journey through this industry,

658
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,093
because that's really the only one I know about,

659
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:51,135
and try to explain to you how it was

660
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:54,997
that we came to that stance as a video game publisher,

661
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:58,540
working with independent studios all over the world.

662
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,642
It's a long and sordid tale,

663
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,843
because I'm getting kind of old.

664
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:06,225
It started off.

665
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,246
in Shreveport, Louisiana, circa 1983.

666
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,948
Don't worry, I only have 20 minutes.

667
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,071
My father had just passed away.

668
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:20,352
My mom had to go back to work.

669
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:22,053
My siblings were all out of the house,

670
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:23,974
older than me, out trying to make their way.

671
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,136
And so I was spending a lot of time at home

672
00:45:26,336 --> 00:45:27,897
with the internet of the time,

673
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:30,398
which was MTV on my television.

674
00:45:31,301 --> 00:45:35,545
It's my window to all the weirdness and all the possibilities out there

675
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:37,827
that were beyond Shreveport, Louisiana,

676
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,890
which I was actively trying to figure out how I was going to get out of,

677
00:45:41,631 --> 00:45:45,234
having promised my dad on his deathbed that I would.

678
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:49,939
Well, I was thinking about developing games.

679
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:53,262
I was playing a lot of Intellivision at the time, some ColecoVision.

680
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:01,166
And while that seemed fascinating, it didn't seem very likely to make me more attractive to the opposite sex.

681
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:05,189
I was 13. This was pretty important to me at the time.

682
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:08,892
And so, it also seemed a little hard, seemed a little challenging,

683
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,093
like I was probably going to have to read some books or something.

684
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,576
Whereas on MTV, a song came out that year called Money for Nothing

685
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,518
by a band called Dire Straits.

686
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:22,941
And for those of you who get your musical influences more from this millennium,

687
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:24,082
I'll explain briefly.

688
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:27,184
The song was generally about a bunch of warehouse workers

689
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:31,207
having a laugh about rock stars with their long hair and their mink coats

690
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:32,328
not really working,

691
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:36,571
and getting their money for nothing and their chicks for free

692
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,273
as the song went in that time.

693
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:40,775
This was interesting to me.

694
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:46,000
But I was again perplexed because I was like, A, I don't play an instrument,

695
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,201
and B, that sounds pretty hard to learn.

696
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:50,582
I don't have that kind of time or discipline.

697
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:54,104
But then came Van Halen with David Lee Roth.

698
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:58,606
There was a guy who didn't play an instrument at all, barely sang.

699
00:46:58,726 --> 00:47:01,607
All he did was bounce around on the stage in front

700
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:04,869
of some very talented musicians who had worked all their lives

701
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,690
to master their craft just so that they could

702
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,372
look at his boisterous ass bouncing around in front of them.

703
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:14,576
I was like, this might be my guy.

704
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:20,340
Fast forward to my first job, not in the games industry,

705
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,301
my first full-time job was a place called

706
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,303
Daiquiri Delight in Shreveport, Louisiana.

707
00:47:24,743 --> 00:47:26,404
For those who have not been to Louisiana,

708
00:47:26,424 --> 00:47:28,065
have not experienced this phenomenon,

709
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:31,988
a daiquiri shop is basically a person in front of a row

710
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:35,731
of boozy, icy machines, pulling icies

711
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,292
and dispensing joy to the world.

712
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,937
The reason I'm boring you with my story of daiquiri delight

713
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:44,879
is because my first week there, I put a tip jar out,

714
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,422
which had never existed in the history of this business

715
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:52,064
because I guess my predecessors and coworkers

716
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:55,046
didn't feel like doing this was really worthy

717
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:58,288
of someone's gratuity given that they could not even stay

718
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,629
in the room after they got it.

719
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,669
Happy trails.

720
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,971
The important part there is that's when I learned

721
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:06,013
that not only did I not wanna work very hard,

722
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:08,054
but I wanted to make a lot of money.

723
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:11,468
So I knew I had to be an executive.

724
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:18,390
Problem is, I already had a daughter

725
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:22,632
and had married my high school sweetheart

726
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,272
and was no longer dreaming of being a rock star.

727
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:26,993
I was just dreaming of, you know,

728
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:28,593
maybe getting out of Shreveport

729
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,514
and having my daughter have a different life

730
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,194
than it seems she was doomed to.

731
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:39,497
And I, luckily after that,

732
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,961
I realized that the only person that was going to hire an executive

733
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,002
with not quite a Bachelor of Arts from LSU in Shreveport

734
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:49,643
was either myself or one of my friends.

735
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:55,065
This puts you in a place where it's much harder to both make a lot of money

736
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:59,246
as a startup executive, to make a lot of money or not work very hard.

737
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,027
I managed to do it.

738
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,688
Did both of them. It's true.

739
00:49:06,394 --> 00:49:11,336
I got a job, luckily one of my friends was one of the guys that made Doom.

740
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:17,558
He was a pen and paper artist I met in high school and he became, his name is Adrian Carmack.

741
00:49:18,418 --> 00:49:23,600
And so I was watching my friends at id Software have this success and I believed that I could

742
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,001
be part of that because they had come from the same place.

743
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:31,163
They had somehow assembled in a lake house in Shreveport, Louisiana before someone lured

744
00:49:31,203 --> 00:49:34,384
them off with 10 grand to Texas to go make Wolfenstein 3D.

745
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:39,484
My friends did quite well with that game.

746
00:49:40,964 --> 00:49:44,965
People mailed them paper checks and they mailed them back floppy disks with a full version

747
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:45,945
of Wolfenstein on it.

748
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:49,846
Before you know it, lo and behold, my friends were getting rich.

749
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:55,807
They dispatched me to this company, I'm sorry, I'm skipping ahead.

750
00:49:56,268 --> 00:50:02,029
Right after that, these same five guys decided to go ahead and make a game called Doom in

751
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,869
about six months.

752
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:06,024
This time, a lot more people mailed in checks

753
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,344
and they mailed out a lot more floppy disks.

754
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:12,766
Well, now they were getting properly rich.

755
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:16,808
It was around this time that the smiling men in suits

756
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:19,529
started to swarm around as they do

757
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:21,249
whenever a new industry is born,

758
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:26,411
especially an industry led by artists and engineers

759
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:28,832
and people that had no representation,

760
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:32,393
no guilds, no unions, still today, sadly.

761
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:40,114
So the smiling men in suits told my friends at id software that you know what that game needs to be in Walmart

762
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:48,476
And they were right they put the game. They put doom 2 and Walmart and now there were truckloads of

763
00:50:48,536 --> 00:50:51,037
Cash being dropped off at my friend's doorstep

764
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:58,400
But what they noticed was there were much bigger truckloads of cash being dropped off at their publisher GT

765
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,520
Interactive's doorstep at that same time

766
00:51:01,646 --> 00:51:06,889
Which seemed odd, since these guys really were brand new to the games business.

767
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:13,973
Their other products at the time were Richard Simmons' Deal O'Mill CD-ROM and Fabio's screensaver.

768
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,235
I shit you not.

769
00:51:17,695 --> 00:51:20,917
And then they got Doom, and they went public for a billion dollars.

770
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:26,420
And my friends at id Software were like, that seems odd.

771
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,421
You know, we're doing pretty well for ourselves, but man, those guys that have...

772
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:33,575
to just put the box in the stores really did well for themselves.

773
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:38,499
They hired me after a while.

774
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,141
There was a brief stop at this company called Duango, which

775
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,103
was a way for people to play Doom from home against one another

776
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:46,746
before you could do that on the internet.

777
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,348
I'll skip over that one pretty quickly,

778
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:51,369
but I did learn a couple of things at Duango.

779
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:53,871
One was competitive gamers are nuts.

780
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:57,474
Two was strip clubs are not really my thing.

781
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:02,880
Important things to learn as you start your business travel in 1995.

782
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:09,264
Luckily, my friends at id Software were impressed with the progress we had made at Duango

783
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:16,529
with no experience in a brand new industry and people like myself outselling franchises.

784
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,633
And they hired me at id and they explained to me that they weren't happy with their publisher.

785
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:27,536
They were pretty sure they were getting much less money per unit than they should have.

786
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,468
and they were pretty sure that these guys and their interactions with them

787
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:36,772
you know were not the geniuses behind why their game was successful

788
00:52:38,273 --> 00:52:43,077
so they put me on a plane I came on as VP marketing and distribution at id Software

789
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:46,439
they put me on a plane I put on my combat boots and I

790
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,882
I tied my mullet back into a business ponytail

791
00:52:50,803 --> 00:52:53,925
and I went to New York City to go do battle

792
00:52:54,185 --> 00:52:57,528
with these mysterious kings of industry at GoodTimes Interactive

793
00:52:59,308 --> 00:52:59,588
Yep.

794
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:05,911
And what I met there were some inspiring people.

795
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:07,993
They were inspiring in the same way

796
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,934
that I hope to be inspiring to you today,

797
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:12,435
in that they were just not that impressive.

798
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,358
Because look, if they had just been geniuses

799
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:18,678
and a bunch of Ivy Leaguers,

800
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:22,180
you know, and doing things that I could never do,

801
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,722
I probably would have slunk home and tucked my tail

802
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:27,623
and told my friends that their deal was fine.

803
00:53:28,546 --> 00:53:32,891
But I didn't, I didn't, because what I found there was a bunch of guys from the record industry

804
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:36,715
and the toy industry that had no idea about video games or how they were made,

805
00:53:37,156 --> 00:53:38,137
did not really care.

806
00:53:38,578 --> 00:53:41,621
They just wanted that sweet, sweet cash, and lots of it.

807
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:44,184
They also wanted to take credit for the work.

808
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:45,965
that my friends had done.

809
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:49,728
Luckily, my friends were some of the first to fight

810
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:51,830
for their intellectual property rights,

811
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:55,172
to put their name on the front of the box of the thing that they made.

812
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:57,995
You know, things that seem obvious in retrospect,

813
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:00,517
but were pretty against the grain at the time.

814
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:05,581
So, I set about learning what these guys were doing.

815
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:07,662
Here's the secret.

816
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:09,143
It's not that hard.

817
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,498
Publishing, sorry for anybody here that works in publishing,

818
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:17,739
or marketing, or finance, but it's not that hard, guys.

819
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,000
It's not that hard, certainly not compared to making a game,

820
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,120
or making a hit game.

821
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,361
So, I was like, these guys are, they hired a sales force,

822
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,781
they hired a PR firm, they hired an ad agency,

823
00:54:28,822 --> 00:54:31,262
they hired manufacturing, and they hired distribution.

824
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:33,983
I learned all of this in roughly a month.

825
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,390
And I just hired the same people.

826
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,531
I just hired the same companies they did.

827
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:42,872
And I went back and I told my friends.

828
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:45,734
I was like, okay, well, good news, bad news.

829
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:49,776
Good news is we can publish your next game, Quake,

830
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:50,696
ourselves.

831
00:54:51,457 --> 00:54:51,917
We can do it.

832
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:54,058
I've got all the same people lined up.

833
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:56,839
The bad news is you were absolutely right

834
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,220
and these people were taking roughly four times more

835
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,241
per unit than they should have been taking,

836
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:03,983
which did not make my friends very happy.

837
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:10,172
We did, luckily it took a year longer than we thought to get Quake out the door,

838
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:13,134
and so I had some time to actually learn what I was doing.

839
00:55:13,994 --> 00:55:19,438
And we shipped Quake shareware ourselves, we got it distributed nationwide,

840
00:55:19,518 --> 00:55:24,220
just like the big bad guys in New York with all their Fabio screensaver prowess.

841
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:29,658
And we did well enough to be able to renegotiate our deal

842
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:34,981
with GT Interactive to what was more than three times what

843
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:36,962
they had been making off Doom II.

844
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:38,363
So I had done my job.

845
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:42,345
id Software at that time did not want to become a publisher.

846
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:43,846
They were pretty good at making games.

847
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,247
They wanted to keep making games.

848
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:51,711
So I left there and went on to Ion Storm with John Romero,

849
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:54,992
which was another meant to be a powerhouse developer.

850
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:58,625
I'm going to skip over that one because it was only a year of my life,

851
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:01,646
but I did learn a couple of important things there.

852
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:07,009
I learned how disastrous the idea of what we all thought was cool

853
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:08,590
could be in this industry.

854
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,771
Because we really, we were, you know, I was 26.

855
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:16,153
I was the CEO of this new company in the top of a skyscraper in Dallas.

856
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:19,235
We all had our 90s hair and our combat boots

857
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,336
and our attitudes and our arrogance,

858
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:23,037
and it was gross.

859
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:24,638
It was gross.

860
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:30,850
But I'm so glad I went there and I'm glad I experienced the full effects of what some

861
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,894
ego can do to some bright and hard-working young game developers.

862
00:56:36,735 --> 00:56:43,101
Because I also met a guy named Doug Myers there, who I have a son named after now, and

863
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:44,462
he was the opposite of that.

864
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:49,987
He really redefined what cool was in my head and what success looked like.

865
00:56:50,765 --> 00:56:53,467
And it wasn't that he preached anything, he just demonstrated it.

866
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:57,931
He was so kind, just naturally so kind and humble and present

867
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:03,275
and made everyone that he interacted with, whether it was for days or weeks or 10 seconds,

868
00:57:03,435 --> 00:57:05,556
feel seen and appreciated.

869
00:57:06,497 --> 00:57:09,739
And sadly he passed away at a very young age,

870
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,824
not too long after that, but definitely not just me but my partners that formed.

871
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:22,263
God Games Gathering of Developers, after that, it informed all of us of sort of the goal,

872
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:23,644
what we were trying to get to.

873
00:57:25,385 --> 00:57:29,769
God Games Gathering of Developers was a holy crusade for the artist side of the industry

874
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:34,453
against these evil bastard publishers that we had struck out against.

875
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:40,919
I had now negotiated deals, renegotiated with GT Interactive, moved it over to Activision,

876
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:41,980
renegotiated there.

877
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:46,835
and then negotiated the most lucrative deal in history for Ion Storm

878
00:57:46,915 --> 00:57:48,976
with really nothing to show for it.

879
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:51,218
So I knew how far we could go

880
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:53,879
and I knew how much money there was on that other side of things.

881
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:56,221
And I was like, well, here we go.

882
00:57:56,781 --> 00:57:58,623
What if we band a few studios together?

883
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:02,926
Because most of these publishers only had one or two hits at the time anyway,

884
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:04,747
so we're like, we can make those.

885
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:11,074
And so we formed Gathering of Developers, which was sort of like a United Artists or Image Comics.

886
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:15,096
It was artists first, staking our claim in the industry,

887
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:20,199
putting out to the world what it meant to get a good deal from a publisher.

888
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,941
And we just made a lot of noise, pissed a lot of people off.

889
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:26,383
And honestly, like...

890
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:32,234
Yes, we wanted to be respectful to artists and we wanted to give them their intellectual property rights.

891
00:58:32,254 --> 00:58:37,417
We wanted to pay them fairly and we wanted to make sure they were always credited above us.

892
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:40,339
But it wasn't just because we were nice guys.

893
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:44,382
It was literally, that was the giant hole in the industry.

894
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:48,125
If any of the other publishers had been doing that, there would have been no need for us.

895
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:51,988
So, I thank you, 90s video game publishers.

896
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:57,311
I truly feel like I stand on the shoulders of shitheads.

897
00:59:06,518 --> 00:59:09,019
God games like Image Comics and United Artists,

898
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,023
well, we ended up selling out to the same evil bastards we struck out against.

899
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:22,267
What I did learn there was about sociotopy being real and about those

900
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:24,688
ideas that we typically associate with business,

901
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:28,110
you know, the idea of a shrewd business person,

902
00:59:29,771 --> 00:59:34,034
just meaning that they're going to take advantage of you as quickly as possible.

903
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,642
you know, the reason that most young people don't want to be a business person.

904
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,643
It's really hard to identify

905
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,744
heroes as business people. So,

906
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:47,045
here we were.

907
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:55,503
having fought this crusade on behalf of these developers that left Microsoft and EA and Activision and GT

908
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:59,964
to join us, risking their next projects with us, taking a stand.

909
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:09,486
And there I was, my partners and I being completely taken advantage of by some proper sharks in New York.

910
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:14,027
By the way, all of these companies that I'm naming here out loud and talking shit about,

911
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,947
I'm sure they're all wonderful people now.

912
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:18,073
This was the 90s.

913
01:00:18,474 --> 01:00:19,214
Things were different.

914
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:20,775
I had hair.

915
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:25,677
Anyway, we sold the company.

916
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:29,099
And I can tell you without hyperbole,

917
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,320
when I signed that deal, it felt like I was

918
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,821
signing my own suicide note.

919
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:38,923
It went pretty well as suicides go.

920
01:00:40,364 --> 01:00:41,325
We all made some money.

921
01:00:41,385 --> 01:00:42,625
The developers made some money.

922
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:49,104
Unfortunately, my friend Doug that I talked about died on the day that we could cash out,

923
01:00:49,164 --> 01:00:50,866
really robbing us of any joy there.

924
01:00:51,487 --> 01:00:56,132
But we had accomplished quite a bit, and we had proven that we could do it.

925
01:00:56,632 --> 01:00:59,395
And maybe we would catch our breath one day and do it again.

926
01:01:00,777 --> 01:01:02,018
Cut to a few years later.

927
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:03,860
I had taken a break from games.

928
01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:08,384
I actually went back to work at Take Two, which was really fun,

929
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:11,165
because I left in a blaze of glory,

930
01:01:11,385 --> 01:01:13,366
as you might imagine from my speech today.

931
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:16,768
And I got to learn just how well we had done,

932
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:20,770
how well it worked to treat artists with respect,

933
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,471
to ship games when they were finished,

934
01:01:22,671 --> 01:01:24,913
when the artists told us they were finished,

935
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,315
to let the artists have sign off on all the PR and marketing,

936
01:01:28,915 --> 01:01:31,436
to let the game developers choose our games.

937
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:34,598
We had eight new million unit selling franchises

938
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:39,415
18 months, two years we existed before Take-Two bought us.

939
01:01:40,175 --> 01:01:42,057
So I get to learn all that from the inside,

940
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:44,299
got out of there as quickly as I could,

941
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:48,382
and then, you know, I did what every group does

942
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:50,243
that has a good run in their 20s,

943
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:52,185
we put the band back together in our 30s.

944
01:01:52,305 --> 01:01:55,207
It's called Gamecock Media Group.

945
01:01:57,569 --> 01:02:01,533
Same principles, except our brand, our sense of humor,

946
01:02:01,613 --> 01:02:03,654
was very much about me at the time.

947
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:05,476
And I was angry.

948
01:02:06,187 --> 01:02:08,067
I was hurt from what happened at God Games.

949
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:09,427
I was angry at the industry.

950
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:10,868
I was angry that everything was getting,

951
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:13,969
this rush to get bigger and be taken more seriously.

952
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,470
Something in me wasn't, it didn't sit right.

953
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,871
Suffice to say, midlife crises are real.

954
01:02:23,451 --> 01:02:24,172
I had mine then.

955
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:28,891
And then we had an economic collapse crisis on top of it

956
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:33,855
I recommend doing both of those at the same time by the way if you're planning your midlife crisis

957
01:02:33,915 --> 01:02:38,057
Go ahead and do it on top of economic collapse. It works out better for everybody

958
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,160
But at Gamecock Media Group

959
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:49,205
While our sense of humor was sort of bullish and like you're all so dumb. We're so cool

960
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:53,588
I met this guy I hired this guy named Nigel Lowry

961
01:02:54,819 --> 01:03:00,665
Nigel Lowry we rescued from an ad agency and he wanted to work in the game industry so

962
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:05,771
badly that he wrote us a letter about it and he said, you know, I want this from the bottom

963
01:03:05,831 --> 01:03:06,452
of my peepee.

964
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:10,923
That was enough.

965
01:03:11,644 --> 01:03:12,444
We got the job.

966
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:18,591
And out of the ashes of that company, after the economy collapsed and our billionaires

967
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:22,635
panicked and pulled out our investment, Devolver was born.

968
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:28,842
With just a few of us piecing together what money we had left, doing one game at a time.

969
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:32,665
making it absolutely not about me.

970
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:35,266
Big lesson there.

971
01:03:35,286 --> 01:03:37,806
It wasn't about anybody.

972
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:41,588
In fact, we had a fictitious company spokesperson

973
01:03:41,648 --> 01:03:42,868
because we were so insistent

974
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:44,989
that this didn't become about me

975
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:46,509
or about anyone in the company.

976
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,330
It was about this mission and this way of doing work.

977
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,591
And luckily, we caught quite a tailwind

978
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:53,971
with the new wave of indies

979
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:55,732
that cropped up around that time.

980
01:03:56,612 --> 01:03:58,813
And we had a great run for the last 12 years.

981
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,895
This is all the things people were saying about us.

982
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,780
Punk rock label, Death Row Records, Sub Pop,

983
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,121
basically everything but a game company.

984
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,283
And then recently, somebody called us,

985
01:04:17,463 --> 01:04:19,805
just last week, the HBO of video games.

986
01:04:21,086 --> 01:04:22,066
Amazing, we did it.

987
01:04:24,264 --> 01:04:28,505
So to pull this back a bit, I learned on the way here

988
01:04:28,585 --> 01:04:30,226
that this talk is supposed to be about how

989
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,566
we adjusted to the pandemic.

990
01:04:32,646 --> 01:04:34,947
Devolver was already working virtually

991
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:36,847
from the time we had a company.

992
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:40,608
We were already actively supporting one another,

993
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:41,909
checking in on each other.

994
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:46,310
We had a sort of innate concern about the well-being

995
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,130
of our developers.

996
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:51,231
But it wasn't enough, because while we were having

997
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:52,152
that incredible run.

998
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,111
and working with all these tiny teams, one or two people,

999
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:58,153
that made games like Hotline Miami,

1000
01:04:58,213 --> 01:05:00,275
or Enter the Gungeon with three people,

1001
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,316
or Reigns with one, you know.

1002
01:05:03,157 --> 01:05:08,722
I found out, I had learned about depression personally

1003
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:10,303
after losing my friend Doug,

1004
01:05:10,623 --> 01:05:12,485
and losing God Games back in the day.

1005
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,787
And I had, you know, I had been to the depths

1006
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:18,250
to where some pills probably saved my life in that moment.

1007
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:23,201
And so, ever since then, I had a concern and a heightened awareness

1008
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:26,202
of mental health issues in my own family, in my community,

1009
01:05:26,662 --> 01:05:27,843
and just how common it was.

1010
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,265
In fact, I ended up losing my sister.

1011
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:35,227
Her name was Dr. Lisa Michelle Wilson, PhD.

1012
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:37,348
She was a doctor of psychology,

1013
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:40,870
and she lived with crippling depression most of her life,

1014
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,911
and eventually decided to leave us.

1015
01:05:45,558 --> 01:05:49,722
Suffice to say, mental health is first and foremost on my mind since then,

1016
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:55,026
and I came to know that several of our star developers,

1017
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:58,309
including some of the ones I just mentioned that made those hits for us,

1018
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:04,614
had become so distressed while making their game, or shortly thereafter,

1019
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:11,480
that four of them, within six months, individual stories had become institutionalized.

1020
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:19,111
Like not just I need medicine, but literally working on their game from inside a mental health institution.

1021
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:26,235
So that's when I was just like, this ride started to mean a little bit less to me.

1022
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:31,778
And it wasn't because I didn't love the Devolver family, they're the absolute best

1023
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:35,781
and nothing I ever do will be as fun as working with those guys.

1024
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:39,763
Nigel, the guy I mentioned before, really took the mission of what we were doing.

1025
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:45,415
a much kinder, more self-effacing sense of humor.

1026
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:48,578
And we had fun with the industry,

1027
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:51,000
but it was really having fun with ourselves

1028
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,842
and then making sure our developers

1029
01:06:53,902 --> 01:06:55,383
were getting rich and famous.

1030
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:58,005
But it wasn't enough anymore.

1031
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,068
And so while Devolver didn't really make any big changes

1032
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:04,710
during the pandemic, other than we couldn't tour anymore

1033
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,392
and started to really, that's when we would get together

1034
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:08,633
is all the shows we would do.

1035
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:15,954
We really started to feel the isolation and I personally was well aware that

1036
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:20,716
not only was Devolver not about me but it really didn't need me anymore if it ever did.

1037
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:25,359
Like the brand was built, the vibe was built, the games were working, the team was in place.

1038
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,261
And while it's not about me and...

1039
01:07:30,995 --> 01:07:32,577
something has to be about me, right?

1040
01:07:33,037 --> 01:07:36,259
When you're isolated and working from home

1041
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:37,440
and not seeing your people,

1042
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,221
you start to ask some different questions.

1043
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:42,523
Especially I was starting to see my adult daughters

1044
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:44,785
have some mental health struggles as well.

1045
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:49,448
So this led me to my personal adjustment,

1046
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:52,470
my personal recalibration during the pandemic,

1047
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:56,193
which was a series of events

1048
01:07:56,333 --> 01:08:00,216
that led me to announce the company I announced last week.

1049
01:08:00,737 --> 01:08:03,678
It's called Deep Well Digital Therapeutics.

1050
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:06,380
And this one's also not about me.

1051
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,963
This is a group of, I think we're up to 47 or so now,

1052
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:17,145
game developers, psychologists, neuroscientists,

1053
01:08:18,406 --> 01:08:21,348
clinicians, regulatory professionals.

1054
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:27,530
huge group of people that have been volunteering their time for the last three to

1055
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,051
15 months in service of defining a way

1056
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:34,472
where we can medicinalize

1057
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:39,473
games. And I'm not talking about gamification or edutainment, I'm talking

1058
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:43,513
about putting rails and understanding and information in your hands about how

1059
01:08:43,593 --> 01:08:45,694
games are already quite therapeutic for people

1060
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:49,975
and how a lot of people are already using them to sort of self-medicate in

1061
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:50,835
times of crisis.

1062
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:59,324
I won't go too far into that, but that's what I'm doing with my time because, you know,

1063
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:05,368
while it's not about me, what is about me and what is about all of you regardless of

1064
01:09:05,428 --> 01:09:11,753
whether you're a game developer or you work in publishing or financing or your phone only

1065
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:18,117
takes NFTs, whatever it is, what is about you is what you get up and put your energy

1066
01:09:18,157 --> 01:09:18,938
into every day.

1067
01:09:20,178 --> 01:09:20,839
And for me, I...

1068
01:09:22,665 --> 01:09:26,548
It has been such a gift to myself, to my co-workers and to my family

1069
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:30,011
to get up every day with a little bit more of a mission,

1070
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:32,173
something that matters to me, a purpose.

1071
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,996
And that's what I wish for all of you as you go forth

1072
01:09:37,097 --> 01:09:43,322
in doing battle to create the most compelling entertainment in the history of people

1073
01:09:44,703 --> 01:09:48,806
that can also, we've learned, be quite beneficial for people,

1074
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:51,308
both for those creating them and those playing them.

1075
01:09:52,535 --> 01:09:55,618
And so what we've done over the last 18 months is built a hive.

1076
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:58,721
And it's up to the indie game developers of the world

1077
01:09:58,821 --> 01:09:59,702
to bring the honey.

1078
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:04,205
Which is what right now, in this very moment,

1079
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:07,028
we're announcing our first global game jam.

1080
01:10:07,048 --> 01:10:09,330
And in conjunction with global game jam.

1081
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:13,046
where we are inviting indie developers around the world

1082
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:17,090
to learn about what we're doing and to figure out how they can participate

1083
01:10:17,771 --> 01:10:20,113
in making games that are

1084
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:25,178
scientifically beneficial for people, medically beneficial for people.

1085
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,341
Should you so choose?

1086
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:30,445
So I hope you'll accept our invitation.

1087
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:32,546
I hope you'll learn about what we're doing

1088
01:10:32,606 --> 01:10:35,466
and realize the power that you as creators wield

1089
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:38,707
and realize how you can change your own relationship

1090
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,167
with the media that you take in.

1091
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,708
Because anything we take in this much of,

1092
01:10:42,768 --> 01:10:46,529
whether it's food or water or air or media,

1093
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:48,049
it has an effect on us.

1094
01:10:48,089 --> 01:10:49,369
It has a different effect on us

1095
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:51,230
and it's different for each one of you.

1096
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,430
So I invite you to look into that

1097
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:54,891
and figure it out for yourselves.

1098
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:56,911
My name is Mike Wilson.

1099
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,172
Thank you all for your time.

1100
01:10:58,972 --> 01:10:59,592
I will see you soon.

1101
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:20,463
There's a first for everything.

1102
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,464
But that is a wrap.

1103
01:11:22,484 --> 01:11:25,484
I hope you all were as uplifted and informed as I was

1104
01:11:25,524 --> 01:11:26,705
by these transformative stories.

1105
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:29,586
For more inspiration, join us back in this room tonight

1106
01:11:29,766 --> 01:11:31,426
for the IGF and Choice Awards

1107
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:33,366
where we honour the best and brightest in games.

1108
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:35,147
Doors open at 5.30pm.

1109
01:11:35,187 --> 01:11:36,507
I look forward to seeing you all here.

1110
01:11:36,907 --> 01:11:37,728
Have a great afternoon.

1111
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:38,548
Bye!
