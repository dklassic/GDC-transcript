00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:16,509
I'm Gautier Boida, working at Square Enix Advanced Technology Division as an AI engineer.

2
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:22,150
And today I will talk about driving emotionally expressive NPC animations and behaviors with

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,290
the Designer-Friendly Pipeline.

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,291
So first I would like to thank all the people that work with me on this project.

5
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,572
So thanks, a big thanks to them.

6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:36,100
So as of today, relationships between users and characters

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,422
has been mostly unchanging.

8
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:41,987
It is often one directional from player to character.

9
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,770
And at Square Enix Advanced Technology Division,

10
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:48,215
we believe that the realization of deeper communication

11
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:49,917
between users and characters

12
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:52,700
will bring a completely new gameplay experience.

13
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,113
Our research efforts on character interaction

14
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:57,814
already brought some fruits

15
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,555
with our experimental emotional pipelines

16
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:01,996
that I introduced at GDC 2019.

17
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:06,338
This pipeline allowed our NPCs to be more aware,

18
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:07,799
expressive, and lively.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,581
Since that time, we started a new project named Wander,

20
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:15,682
where the philosophy was, gods do not play dice.

21
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,884
The meaning was that AI-based game design

22
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:20,485
should not rely on random value.

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:25,119
All the decision-making should be as natural as possible and make sense,

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,821
allowing the growth of the agent.

25
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:31,186
As such, it naturally suited the project to have this emotional pipeline

26
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:35,450
to allow NPC to have emotions, mood and have personalities,

27
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:39,915
allowing them to be livelier and enhance the player experience.

28
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,576
But this time, the challenge was to bring this pipeline to production.

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,361
And today, on top of explaining it, we will cover its adaptability to any experience

30
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:56,586
and how to balance and debug it depending on the needs of the designers, but also on the experience.

31
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:02,551
So first, what are emotions, mood and personalities?

32
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,331
Depending on the paper you are looking at, there are many definitions.

33
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,852
In this presentation, we define them in the following way.

34
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:17,995
Emotions are short-term feelings that evolve quickly over time, like joy, distress, and fear.

35
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:24,217
And mood is a much more long-term feeling that evolves slowly but smoothly over time,

36
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,938
like exuberant, depressed, and afraid.

37
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:31,252
And personalities overall define the agent.

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,114
Depending on the experience you create,

39
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:37,179
it may be either fixed or very slowly evolving over time,

40
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,942
like curiosity, shyness, and laziness.

41
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:45,329
So now, why would you want your NPCs

42
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:47,952
to have dynamic emotions, moods, and personalities?

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,921
What would this bring to your experience?

44
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,363
So first, let's take an example with our prototype game

45
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:57,864
Wonder, but without emotion, animation, or personality

46
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:58,605
and mood.

47
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,607
So in this experience, the player

48
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,588
is a little fairy that you can see on the bottom left

49
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:07,049
and give orders to this character, Pino.

50
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,830
Here, we ask to use the book.

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,272
And Pino will try to use it in the way he thinks is good.

52
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,513
However, he did have a short into it,

53
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,054
so it was not a good use case.

54
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:16,834
And the player told Pino about that,

55
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,255
but was not quite happy about it.

56
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:25,517
In this game, Pino will learn, basically, thanks to this interaction, if it's a great

57
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:28,699
use case or not, and being able to solve quests and other things later.

58
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,200
Now, we'd like you to focus a bit more on the character itself and the way he's expressing

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,741
the different things happening around him.

60
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:39,642
You can see that the walk is always the same, there is not much variation, and the face

61
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,743
is just a little smile, not changing much.

62
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:48,885
I mean, some little, of course, animation for the action, but nothing really outstanding.

63
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:55,349
So now let's have a motion, animations, mood and personality on for this demonstration

64
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,229
and do the same thing.

65
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,534
We can already see that Pinot is moving much more energetically thanks to this personality

66
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,154
he is into.

67
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:06,458
Here he was hitting the book which is not correct and we can see that the reaction is

68
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,999
also making more sense now.

69
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,705
Now I try to use a stick and we will be able to see a bit more this personality motion

70
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:17,668
like he is very in the exuberant kind of feeling now.

71
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,825
You can also see at the same time that the speech is changing based on this mood and personality.

72
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:31,533
He is quite happy about being able to actually hit a ball with a bat.

73
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:40,869
Overall personalities are a thing that evolve very slowly in this game, like about 5 to

74
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,890
10 minutes we may be able to move to one personality.

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,592
Because it's very slow, I am now going to use the debug UI to quickly change the personality

76
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:55,273
of the character and show the little variation we have added based on the different personalities

77
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:56,153
the character is into.

78
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,974
Here is a bit more reserved kind of personality.

79
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,736
And we are going to do mostly the same kind of actions this year.

80
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,857
A little variation. You can see already that

81
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:12,359
the little reactions, the way he's expressing all the little smiles that he may have on

82
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,340
his face when he's encountering objects that he likes or dislikes

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,122
is very different from the previous personality. And if you take a bit more

84
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:24,103
attention, you can see some differentiation based on the mood he's into.

85
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,164
It's a bit maybe cuter with this personality than before.

86
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,175
Here we try to use the dumbbells this time.

87
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:41,089
And I think it's quite an OK use case normally.

88
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,771
But yes, the player, for some reason,

89
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,752
said it was neither good, neither bad.

90
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,114
Lastly, we move to another personality.

91
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:48,776
And this time, we are going to show the mood.

92
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,298
The mood is basically here affecting a little bit

93
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,159
the mood for the animation of the character.

94
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,563
It was not super easy to see during the demonstration.

95
00:05:57,603 --> 00:06:00,205
So we have used the debugger to show a little bit more easily.

96
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,147
But I will come back to that later.

97
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:09,631
So, now that you have seen that, let's try to explain to you what is this emotional pipeline

98
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,494
with the different modules it has.

99
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,637
So first, the emotion module.

100
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:20,146
It is based on the revised OCC model from the paper The OCC Model Revisited.

101
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:26,945
We have chosen this model because of its simplicity and compatibility with game development,

102
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:33,707
which is not the case for a lot of these models. For instance, here, event is replaced by game

103
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:40,209
event and then it's just tree exploration based on conditions. It is also a very well-known

104
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,470
infamous model that works really well with other mood models that I will explain later.

105
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:54,814
So, for our prototype Wander, we are actually not using the whole graph. We are using only the upper part of this OCC model.

106
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:58,195
So let's take an example with a proper game event.

107
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:07,700
First, we assess if this game event is going to be a positive thing or a negative thing for the agent.

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,643
For instance, if he is hit by a ball, it's going to be a negative feeling, except if he is a masochist.

109
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:19,337
If he's eating a delicious cake, it's going to be a positive feeling, except if he has allergies.

110
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:26,000
Then, based on the category of this event, we can have consequence of events, like for instance,

111
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,663
window broke because of a ball, or my clothes are wet because of the weather, because it's

112
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:37,345
raining. We can also have action of agent, like my own actions or the action of someone else.

113
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:43,928
And we can also have aspect event, which is about hearing, smelling, or seeing something.

114
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:49,053
And lastly, we'll have a list of emotions on the last row

115
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,274
that we're going to generate based on the branch

116
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:54,416
we went into during the analysis of this game event.

117
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,738
Now, with a proper game event, so the player this time

118
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:03,200
has been hit, no, hit the ball with the bat successfully.

119
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,721
So the agent is looking at the player

120
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,482
and is feeling happy for the player.

121
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,503
So it's a positive feeling.

122
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,785
because it's the action of another agent.

123
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,385
And we are going to expel this agent.

124
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,405
We express annihilation towards the player.

125
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:19,646
Let's say now that we have a window that

126
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,327
broke due to the ball that has been hit earlier by the player.

127
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,228
And this time, it's going to be the consequence

128
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,828
of the previous action of the player.

129
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:29,869
And the consequence is something bad, we think.

130
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,749
So the window broke.

131
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,490
So the agent is going to express distress towards this window.

132
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,386
In this way, emotions are going to be

133
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,626
generated in our experience.

134
00:08:41,307 --> 00:08:44,328
This model can support up to 24 emotions in total,

135
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:47,169
depending on how much of these three you want to support.

136
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,411
Emotions can be expressed in a lot of different ways.

137
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:52,972
It can have voice sound.

138
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:55,573
It can have facial blend, as I am showing here

139
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:59,495
on top of other animations, like shame, or distress, or pride.

140
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,996
We can also have special animation and special speech

141
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,397
when we are actually expressing these emotions.

142
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:15,172
Of course, this emotional module can be adapted to any experience, as I said before, even if it's quite big.

143
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:21,309
What you have to start with is actually the very basic and minimum version of this model that we think it is.

144
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,751
These three branches with actually eight emotions.

145
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:30,734
And from here, you can actually add branches depending on what you want in your experience.

146
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:39,339
For instance, if you are dealing with a non-object to which your agent is able to guess a liking or disliking based on the item features,

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,043
then it can be interesting to add this unfamiliar aspect branch to have interest and disgust as emotion.

148
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:52,486
If interactions between AI agents themselves or AI agents and the player are one of the

149
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,849
key of your experience, then we recommend adding this related consequence branch.

150
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,513
It's basically what we call a consequence of an action of an agent.

151
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:07,098
So I will take an example to explain a little bit in detail what it is exactly.

152
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:13,323
A window, for instance, earlier, we said that the window broke due to the ball that has been hit by the player.

153
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:17,667
And at this time, we express distress towards this broken window.

154
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:24,213
Well, we know, the agent knows that this ball has been hit by the player earlier, so that's the player's fault.

155
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:29,818
So we are actually going into this related consequence branch and express anger towards the player.

156
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:35,947
And thanks to this, actually, you can also have relationships evolution between your agents themselves,

157
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:39,391
or the agent as a player, based on these emotions that are being regenerated.

158
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:47,076
Lastly, if your AI agents are able to prospect based on something happening around them,

159
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:51,560
the addition of the prospective consequence branch will give great feedback.

160
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,682
So, let's take an example.

161
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:58,146
The AI agents hear some noises in the stairs in the middle of the night.

162
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,989
The agent will feel fear that maybe an intruder may be in the house.

163
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:09,571
So the agent is courageous and decides to check what is going on in the stairs.

164
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:15,595
So he checks and sees that actually his cat was playing with the balls and one fell off

165
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,116
the stairs.

166
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,878
So he feels some relief or some kind of...

167
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:21,980
The actual consequence of this phase is something positive.

168
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,327
If we follow this model, it's going to be joy,

169
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:27,269
but it's not quite relief.

170
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,593
So we advise you, in this case, to actually add

171
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,374
these four little branches below.

172
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,997
That will add the necessary distinction.

173
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:36,759
For instance, belief, in this case,

174
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:40,643
will be expressed because it is confirmed prospective

175
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,345
and desirable consequence.

176
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,226
However, when it comes to perspective in game,

177
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:51,830
it's not, it's actually a very complex thing to do.

178
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:56,214
In Wunder, we are mostly using it on simple examples

179
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,557
where it's easy to guess what may happen in the future.

180
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:03,120
For instance, prospecting from weather-based events

181
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,642
like clouds are getting darker and darker.

182
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:12,087
So maybe it's going to rain, or a player taking an apple and going in the direction of the agent.

183
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,549
Maybe it will feed the agent in this case.

184
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,194
So overall, this model offers a lot of flexibility and allows the designer

185
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,376
to basically adjust it depending on what they want to create.

186
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:28,801
While we have covered emotion generations, there are still two unknowns.

187
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:34,665
One is emotion parameters computation, and the second is how to assess positivity of an event.

188
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:39,825
As your experience may already have many game events,

189
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:43,668
the Emotion module will actually listen to a few of them

190
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,050
that you have listed up in the data table.

191
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,833
Here we are listening to EatFood, EatByObject, and ObjectVisible.

192
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:58,030
They will have their event category, a way to compute the emotion intensity, and a way

193
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,291
to compute the duration of these emotions.

194
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:07,253
And based on this intensity function, we'll be able to assess if this event is going to

195
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:10,394
be a positive thing or a negative thing for the agent.

196
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:15,716
For instance, hit by object is going to be negative because it's minus the hit speed

197
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,196
and multiplied by the item weight.

198
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:24,741
And for HitFood, it's going to depend on the liking of the items that he is currently trying to eat.

199
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:30,186
Speaking about liking, we also have this like-dislike system in our game,

200
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:36,431
and we are actually generating liking and disliking at the same time that we are generating emotions.

201
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,871
So here, the agent has been electrified by a fence.

202
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:45,233
So we are generating distress towards this fence,

203
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,594
because it's not a pleasant feeling.

204
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:53,296
And at the same time, we are going also to add this negative effect to the fence object.

205
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:57,218
And it can have an intensity and a memorable duration,

206
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,339
if you want it to be forgettable after some time.

207
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:04,669
And on the top right, you can see that currently our agent

208
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,834
seems to like very much red apples.

209
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:13,964
OK, so now I'll move on to explaining the Mood module,

210
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,088
which is a PID model.

211
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:27,188
So the PAD model is a 3D space with three axes, P, A, and D.

212
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:31,890
P for pleasure, F for aversion, and D for dominance.

213
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,171
So how pleasant is an emotion, how intense is an emotion,

214
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:37,432
and how much control and influence the agent

215
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,133
may have over situations.

216
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:44,255
These 3D models we have inside all the emotions

217
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:46,016
that we are generating before are mapped.

218
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,200
And one octant of this model will represent one mood.

219
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,301
In this case, where shame is, we have the mood afraid.

220
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,042
And we are supporting eight different moods

221
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,102
as you can see on the left.

222
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:05,384
In the center, we have our default mood position.

223
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,085
And that is a little point that will move freely

224
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:12,086
around the space while all these emotions are generated.

225
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,633
And that's basically the PID model.

226
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:20,595
So we, despite the complexity of a 3D space,

227
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:24,638
we chose this model as it has one of the few

228
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,819
that works really well with OCC model,

229
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,320
and simple at the same time.

230
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,401
It allows a lot of expressibility

231
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:35,663
and wide variations of mood and expression.

232
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:37,844
And it's simple enough.

233
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:43,144
So, as I said, 3D may still be a problem, so we'll come back to that later.

234
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,774
So regarding the updates of this PID model,

235
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,377
when an emotion has been generating, like joy,

236
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:54,959
depending on the intensity, this point

237
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,961
will move towards the joy emotion quickly or not.

238
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,462
And then when there is no emotion anymore,

239
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,884
the agent becomes bored.

240
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:07,026
So the default mood point will go back slowly

241
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,507
towards this default mood position

242
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,288
as it got bored and bored and bored.

243
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:13,853
Now, expression.

244
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,716
Mood can be expressed in a lot of different ways.

245
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,398
It can, for instance, be expressed

246
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,740
inside the decision-making, for instance,

247
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,022
having specific goals for specific moods,

248
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,685
also having specific set of actions.

249
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:29,787
It can also influence the way the voice,

250
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,670
we can manipulate the voice a bit based on this mood

251
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,912
that we are currently doing in Wonder as well.

252
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:38,849
And we can also have a variation of base body animation.

253
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:42,275
So here I am showing a single frame of our animation.

254
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,299
And we can see that based on the mood,

255
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,882
it's actually changing quite a lot.

256
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,453
And now I'm going to play the full animation,

257
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:55,134
and we can see a bit more in detail

258
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,195
what are the differences between all these modes.

259
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,736
So right now he's in a frightened mood,

260
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,237
so he's a bit not super confident in his hit.

261
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,559
Now he starts with giving a big hit on the ground,

262
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,399
and when he's exuberant, he's actually jumping

263
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,600
and hitting at the same time.

264
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,582
And for this side, it's just a little tap on the ground,

265
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:11,303
very gentle.

266
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:17,616
So these animations give a new taste to the base animation

267
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,137
that we had, but they are not too strong variation

268
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:21,698
at the same time.

269
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,419
So they can play well together.

270
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,202
So the 3D and 3D model have some pros and cons.

271
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,363
And when it's come to adapt it to your experience,

272
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:32,584
you may want to get rid of 3D.

273
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:38,407
While 3D gives vast variations of expressions,

274
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,108
the more dimensions, the harder it is to debug and to balance.

275
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,366
Depending on the mood expressions,

276
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,768
also assets can go quickly out of hand.

277
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:47,349
Asset cost.

278
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,932
So we have to, in Wonder at least,

279
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:53,193
we have to cut it down to 2D.

280
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:56,656
And what to choose between these three combinations?

281
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:02,660
So inside this model, there is one key axis, pleasure.

282
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,482
Pleasure is basically the separation

283
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,583
between what is a positive emotion

284
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,004
and what is a negative emotion.

285
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:14,949
So it's a very important axis to have a nice variation of our game in expression.

286
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,872
So we are actually going to look at casual or dominant and choose between one of them.

287
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:26,337
And to make the choice, once they have nice expressibility in their ways, we are going

288
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:28,959
to take a look at our generated emotions list.

289
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,782
What we can see in Wonder's case is that most of the emotions are actually in the arousal positive space.

290
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,663
So we are going to have a really hard time to go into the negative part of the arousal space.

291
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:52,185
In this case, we think that arousal is a less important axis and then we decided to keep pleasure and dominance for our 2D space.

292
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,666
But it may not be the case for your experience.

293
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:59,226
We had to adapt, of course, these mood names,

294
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,348
mostly keeping the A plus names.

295
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,009
And here we are.

296
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,171
We have our 2D PID model.

297
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,934
So it has now become a DPE model.

298
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:16,276
We still have to put back our emotion from 3D to 2D, so we check the official list of

299
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:19,938
positions for this emotion inside the PID space from the paper.

300
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:27,321
And what we got is this location in the cubes, in the 2D space.

301
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:33,124
We can see that most of them are overlapping and not well positioned.

302
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:37,145
The position of them is not very well balanced in the space.

303
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:44,471
Well, it makes sense for psychology and all this research to represent exact humans or this kind

304
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:50,675
of thing. But when it comes to game, the most important thing is to have a lot of variation

305
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:57,220
of expression and to have the overall experience balanced. So we decided to actually push all this

306
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:04,046
emotion to the border in the square and that's our new mood space. We could have done also

307
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,548
in a circle around the center if we wanted to.

308
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:13,053
And here now I'm showing our experience with the UI,

309
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,515
showing the current mood, how it evolves

310
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,678
based on the different emotions that has been generated.

311
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:21,880
We can also see the emotion model at the top of the model.

312
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:26,363
And we can see that right now it doesn't feel super happy.

313
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:29,506
It is in a hostile mood, especially because the player

314
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,007
is actually not super nice to him.

315
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,969
I think it's going to be visible there

316
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,770
is a way he's walking now.

317
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,631
It's not there.

318
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:43,804
super friendly. However, based on now, he did a successful action and the player was happy,

319
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:47,765
so now we are able to go back a little bit inside this exuberant mood.

320
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:56,127
So that's how this mood and emotion generation happens in our game, and we hope it was nice.

321
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,548
So now, personality module.

322
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,313
As you can see, it's a very simple structure.

323
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:05,894
It's just UDT parameters between 0 and 1,

324
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,515
like laziness, curiosity, and honesty.

325
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:13,678
And while it's super simple, it can have, actually,

326
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:16,840
a broad way of expressing expression inside your game.

327
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,322
You can have different goals available,

328
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:21,522
depending on the personality.

329
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:24,724
Or the way the actions are done are a bit different.

330
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:28,166
Or the action available can also change for the planning phase.

331
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:41,198
For animation, we can also have strong variation. For instance, in our walking cycle, based on the personality we are into, right now, the animation is changing quite a lot.

332
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:47,544
The way of speaking, as I said before, is changing based on the personality it is currently into.

333
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:55,589
And as I've told in GCC 2019, we can also have this default mood position that changes depending

334
00:21:55,629 --> 00:22:02,391
on the personality you are into. Like if you have an angry kind of personality, you may want to put

335
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:07,912
your default mood position more in the hostile mood so that when the agent got bored, it will

336
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:10,513
go slowly back towards this hostile mood.

337
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:18,641
Now, when it comes to personality and you want to add personality to your game,

338
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:24,845
we advise to first actually choose where you want to express them and where they will have

339
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:33,031
influences. If it's just in the decision making, like in GDC 2019 for my talk, any number of

340
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:40,436
personalities should be manageable as it has only design costs and majority of the cases

341
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,377
is not going to be asset related normally.

342
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:49,382
But if it's about giving influences to animations, speech, or asset-related applications,

343
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:54,446
then it can quickly go out of hands, and that's the case for Wunder, actually.

344
00:22:55,914 --> 00:23:01,176
In Wander, we have 8 different personalities, and that's quite a number.

345
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:08,219
Personalities influence both base animation of walk, idle, or reactions, but also the

346
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,599
way the agent is speaking.

347
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,040
So that's a lot of assets to create.

348
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:15,842
For instance, we have 8 personalities with 4 modes.

349
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:21,984
and one base animation as well. So this makes a total of 33 animations to create.

350
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:27,486
That's a lot. That's way too much for what we can handle, so we decided to at least

351
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:32,308
try to cut this number down a bit. So we decided to create what we call

352
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:37,450
personalities principles, four of them, that will group actually a few of these personality

353
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:43,412
parameters together. And thanks to this, we're able to reduce the number of animations from 33 to 17.

354
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:50,016
And for us, it was enough in our case.

355
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:54,419
Of course, decision making can use these personality principles

356
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,281
if it wants, but it can also use these eight personalities

357
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,603
as before, so there is no problem with that.

358
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,866
Okay, now let's move to troubleshooting

359
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:08,608
and speak about our different debug tools

360
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:11,690
and tweaks and the balance tools that we have created.

361
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:22,583
So the first tool we have is basically personality debug.

362
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,848
We can just click on this UI and set the character

363
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:27,691
in a specific personality right away.

364
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:30,075
So if you want to test something very quickly,

365
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,257
it's very useful.

366
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:36,393
In a similar manner, we have this mood space,

367
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,634
that mood UI, where we can click into and set our character

368
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:42,115
to be in a specific mood and specific personality

369
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:46,376
whenever we want, so that we can test all the possibilities.

370
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:49,197
We can also see, weirdly right now,

371
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:52,018
but a mood heat map that is updated

372
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,058
during the world experience, allowing you to know,

373
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:58,559
basically, how the users are playing your game,

374
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,099
and if...

375
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:04,027
For old players, for instance, the moon is always

376
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:05,027
in the same area.

377
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:08,749
It's not able, actually, to move in all the space, which

378
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,129
is something you may want to know and try to fix.

379
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,751
We also have personality history that

380
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:18,252
allows us to know when personality changes happened,

381
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:20,553
what is the source, and how they evolved.

382
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:23,554
We also have emotion history that

383
00:25:23,594 --> 00:25:25,854
will list the different parameters this emotion had,

384
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,495
when they occurred, and from what source.

385
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,911
And at the end, we have the most important tool

386
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,974
that I will explain now, the emotion of all information

387
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,755
that basically computes the influence

388
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:42,298
score of each emotion on the mood during your playthrough.

389
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,201
So that's the table you can see at the bottom.

390
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:49,944
So for each emotion, we have the number of occurrences,

391
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:53,227
the average intensity, and the average duration

392
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:56,029
it has had during the whole playthrough.

393
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,510
And from that, we are going to compute an influence score,

394
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,651
which is just the sum of this intensity multiplied

395
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,451
by duration for all this emotion.

396
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,253
So how can we use this tool?

397
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:15,414
In one specific case, one of the most known problems,

398
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,214
or difficult to balance problems,

399
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:20,475
is the mood is always in the same area.

400
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:23,976
No matter what player plays, it's always there.

401
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,197
It's very hard to get away from it.

402
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:29,145
Well, if you look at this table now,

403
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:31,267
we can get a lot of information from it.

404
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:33,931
We check, for instance, first what

405
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:35,893
is the highest influence score emotion,

406
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,216
and we can see that joy is actually

407
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:42,321
influencing at least twice more than the other emotion, the mood.

408
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,424
So maybe it's too much in this instance.

409
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,183
In this case, we are going to investigate joy and see what may be the problem.

410
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:56,246
We can see that the number of occurrences of this emotion is actually almost double

411
00:26:56,266 --> 00:27:00,189
to the other emotions, so maybe we can try to reduce this number of occurrences.

412
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,253
But sometimes it's not possible because it makes sense in a game design point of view.

413
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:10,777
So we can try this time to reduce this average intensity so that it better use

414
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:14,760
this range from 0 to 1 instead of always being very high.

415
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:23,167
Sometimes it's still not enough, it doesn't make sense, so you can do a similar thing with the

416
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:27,871
duration and try to lower it a bit so that it has less influence on the mood overall.

417
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:32,365
But if everything makes sense for your design,

418
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,807
then maybe the other emotions, the counter emotions,

419
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:38,628
are not influencing the mood enough.

420
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:42,110
In this case, you want to try to boost either the number of times

421
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,551
they are apparent, or the intensity,

422
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:45,692
or the duration of them.

423
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,733
And at the end, yeah, if you're able to get an influence score

424
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:52,095
that are mostly balanced between all your emotions,

425
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:54,116
or a bit more positive, or a bit more negative,

426
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:56,257
you can do it easily and understand easily

427
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:56,817
thanks to this.

428
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:04,557
debug tool. But you have to aggregate your data with many players as players have different

429
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:09,842
personalities and ways of playing. So that's it for me today. Thank you for watching,

430
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:15,607
and if you want to contact me, here are my information. Have a great GDC!
