1
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:09,836
Can you guys hear me?

2
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:10,016
Oh, there.

3
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:11,756
It just turned on.

4
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:12,737
Cool.

5
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:15,938
All right, so I'm going to go get started.

6
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:17,778
Thanks for coming to my talk called, whoa,

7
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,979
called Clicking Too Many Slides Ahead.

8
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:23,520
It's called The System is the Message, Dynamic Narrative

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,240
in the Novelist.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,621
The slides are going to be available very soon

11
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:27,801
at that URL down at the bottom.

12
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:30,542
And that URL is also on the last slide.

13
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,083
So don't worry about taking pictures or anything.

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,803
Please silence your cell phones.

15
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:37,364
And also make sure to fill out your evaluation forms.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,953
So a quick bit about me.

17
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,596
I started my career at Ion Storm Austin,

18
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,018
where I worked on a handful of games

19
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:45,022
before going to Midway Austin,

20
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:47,125
where I worked on a game that was never announced

21
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,391
and got cancelled while Midway Austin went down.

22
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:54,361
After that, I went to 2K Marin, where I shipped Bioshock 2.

23
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,583
And after that, I went to LucasArts,

24
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,865
where I worked on a game that never got announced

25
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,907
and eventually left that game to go indie.

26
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:03,049
And I almost forgot my sign to myself

27
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,210
that reminds me to slow down.

28
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,632
So I'm going to put this up here,

29
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,674
because I really sometimes talk too fast.

30
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:09,134
So there we go.

31
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:09,535
Now we're set.

32
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:12,117
So that's a little bit about me.

33
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:14,519
And three years ago, I gave a talk here

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,382
at GDC entitled, Player-Driven Stories, How Do We Get There?

35
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,693
And I highlighted a problem where games aren't taking

36
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,077
advantage of the interactivity of our medium.

37
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:25,882
And I was kind of pushing back against the more and more

38
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:28,907
linear stories, more and more Hollywood copying type stuff,

39
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:31,491
and really pushing for the player to have more control

40
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,713
over stories and games.

41
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,000
And the goal I set forth is a story in which the player makes

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,060
influential decisions that create a unique narrative

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,121
that's not prescribed by a designer.

44
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:44,281
And by influential, I mean decisions that actually matter,

45
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,481
not just cosmetic things or not things that close

46
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,702
a quick loop after that, but really have a lasting

47
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:49,822
impact on the narrative.

48
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:52,042
And the second word I want to highlight is actually

49
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,563
that word narrative.

50
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,463
This is a cohesive series of events that form

51
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,804
a long-term, satisfying story,

52
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,064
not just isolated, micro-level events.

53
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,250
And if you want, you can actually watch that talk.

54
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,837
It's free on the GDC Vault. So if you're interested.

55
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:08,473
Check it out. But when I gave this talk, it was pretty much theoretical.

56
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,534
It wasn't related to any specific game I was working on.

57
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:14,794
It was just more of like a call to action that I wanted to see happen.

58
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:18,375
And even after I went indie, I didn't immediately start addressing this problem

59
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,256
or thinking about a game that, that dealt with it.

60
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:24,276
I actually started working on a puzzle game that I pretty, pretty quickly gave up

61
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,757
because I realized I didn't care at all about it.

62
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:29,458
And so I decided I would take a crack at trying to do something

63
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,458
with actual player-driven stories. So I moved to a new idea.

64
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,874
that just had a working title called Ghost.

65
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:36,815
And it's what eventually became the novelist,

66
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,236
but it started off as a very different thing.

67
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,236
It was six people in an ocean-side mansion

68
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,957
after one of their friends had died,

69
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,037
sort of like in The Big Chill.

70
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,818
And you did play a ghost in the house,

71
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:47,039
and you could creep around,

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,519
and you could learn about them.

73
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,220
manipulate their relationships, you could create and destroy

74
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,341
romances, make people friends, uncover past secrets, so and

75
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:55,541
so.

76
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,222
And the idea was that if I give the

77
00:02:57,222 --> 00:03:00,363
player lots of control over these six characters, then a

78
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,444
story would just magically emerge. And I sort of

79
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:05,004
built this toy-like simulation.

80
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,485
So I built a prototype in Unity, and, and I

81
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,526
got it up and running, and there was six

82
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:11,907
characters in this house. I named them after characters

83
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:14,588
in one of my favorite movies, which is Halloween.

84
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:17,068
So we had Annie, we had Bob.

85
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:18,539
We had Linda.

86
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,418
We had Annie's boyfriend, Paul, who never appears on screen,

87
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,499
so here's where Bob gets killed.

88
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:27,661
And I also had the two characters from one of the great video game love stories,

89
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:29,322
Rebecca and Tommy from System Shock 2.

90
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,683
So those are my six characters, and I built it, and it worked.

91
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:34,765
And you could, you know, make two characters fall in love.

92
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:37,906
You could create and destroy romances.

93
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:40,608
You could make people friends and stuff.

94
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,149
But it didn't really have any impact.

95
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:46,771
There was nothing to it that really had any emotional resonance.

96
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,191
There was no emotional hook.

97
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,275
There were too many characters, and you could

98
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,095
manipulate them in too many ways.

99
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:54,236
And so, numbers moved around, and you could check

100
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,816
a status screen that said, oh, these people are

101
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,516
now friends, or these people are starting to dislike

102
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:58,276
each other, or whatever.

103
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,737
But there was no on-screen meaning.

104
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,017
There was no story emerging from this.

105
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:04,758
And I realized that without enough backstory and without

106
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,978
enough context, that this was basically just a group

107
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:09,479
of systems from which no kind of actual meaningful

108
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,999
narrative would emerge.

109
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,220
Or as I called it in my 2011 talk, system soup.

110
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,757
which is basically the idea that you have a lot of stuff going on

111
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,098
and a bunch of stuff's happening,

112
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:23,860
but it has no real form and it has no real meaning.

113
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,142
So next I decided to drastically reduce the number of characters in the game.

114
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:34,114
down to three and provide a really clear context so that players would have a framework for understanding their decisions.

115
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:36,596
So three characters is kind of the lowest you can go

116
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:42,901
and still have interesting push pull kind of dynamics and I picked a family because that's something that's universally

117
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:47,465
known to everybody. You know what it's like to be a kid. You know what it's like to have a romantic relationship.

118
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,707
A lot of people know what it's like to be a parent.

119
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,728
And so even if you haven't done, you know,

120
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,410
a couple of those things, you still understand what it is.

121
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,372
So I didn't have to spend a lot of time

122
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:57,153
providing with context and backstory.

123
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:58,534
You understand immediately

124
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,116
what would make a good or bad relationship.

125
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,157
What would make a good or bad dad.

126
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,159
Um, so I kind of tried to do that

127
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,701
to address the shortcomings of that first prototype

128
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,003
and to explain a little bit more about the game at a high level.

129
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,114
It's about a family named the Caplins, and Dan is a writer.

130
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,496
His book is not going very well.

131
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,698
Linda is his wife, who's a painter.

132
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,699
And their marriage is kind of on the rocks.

133
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,362
And their son, Tommy, is a kid who just went through his

134
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,063
first year of school, and he had a really tough time.

135
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,304
He got picked on by some bullies.

136
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,146
He struggled a little bit with his reading.

137
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,568
So they've kind of come to this summer home to get away

138
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:31,030
and try to figure things out.

139
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,331
And you play as a ghost, and you explore the house,

140
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,713
and you read their thoughts, and read their memories,

141
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:36,893
and discover what they want.

142
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,935
And you uncover these dilemmas, and you actually

143
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,796
start to help them decide how to resolve them.

144
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,798
So I'm going to quickly play the trailer for the game,

145
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,038
just for people who haven't played it,

146
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,920
just to give a pretty good idea of actually

147
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,180
what you can do in the game and what

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,801
it looks like to play it.

149
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,102
So I'll just start that now.

150
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:45,498
Join Our Community

151
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,704
So that's how the game works. And I am

152
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:40,785
really, really sick of that song.

153
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:43,006
So, so the, I want to talk about

154
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,767
a couple of my goals for the game. The,

155
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,849
the high level goal was to try an

156
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:51,150
experimental form of storytelling where the relationship, where I

157
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,552
take the relationship simulation of something like a Sim

158
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:56,433
style game, but manipulate it to present it as

159
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,175
a recognizable traditional story. So you're not necessarily managing

160
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,216
meters between characters and looking a lot of onscreen

161
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,898
HUD, but you're taking those same types of dynamics

162
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,879
and trying to turn it into a story. So

163
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,959
the first step there.

164
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,822
is the abdication of authorship.

165
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,603
I wanted to abdicate authorship

166
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:13,925
and put the story in the players' hands.

167
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,047
And this is really important because

168
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:18,709
this story is about trying to balance your career with your family.

169
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,570
And that's a really big question.

170
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,831
What are the right answers there?

171
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,133
And I'd be lying if I said I knew what was important.

172
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:24,213
So...

173
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,115
My goal wasn't for the game to be a platform for my own beliefs.

174
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,417
Instead, my goal was to make it a question game,

175
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,498
not a message game.

176
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:33,278
The player doesn't give,

177
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,940
or the game doesn't give the player a specific goal

178
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,841
or judge whether the decisions are right or wrong.

179
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,282
It just lets the player make choices

180
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,143
and try to give them reasonable consequences

181
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,224
and kind of feedback the effects of their decisions.

182
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,347
So what I really wanted to do was create a dynamic narrative,

183
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,948
not necessarily a branching plot.

184
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:51,128
I wanted to create a narrative

185
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,390
that was based solely on the player's input.

186
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,215
As opposed to a branching plot where every player has the same series of events and choices.

187
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:03,421
So, I think it'd be useful to quickly establish what I mean by a branching plot.

188
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,444
A branching plot is created by a writer or designer.

189
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:11,791
And though the player does make some decisions, the events come in the same order every time.

190
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,853
So, the plot starts moving along.

191
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:18,324
And at some point, the player reaches a decision point.

192
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,484
And they're given multiple options.

193
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:22,866
Maybe they have to choose between different missions,

194
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,307
or align with one of two factions,

195
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,388
or even decide if a character lives or dies.

196
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:28,269
And this technique is used very frequently

197
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,290
in games like Mass Effect or the Bioshock series.

198
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,050
Very familiar.

199
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,671
So the player decides what they want to do,

200
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:35,953
and there are now two branches of the story.

201
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,074
And these are both authored content

202
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,394
that are based on that choice.

203
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:42,025
And the player might be given another major decision

204
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,085
along one of these branches.

205
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,467
So they decide again, and the first choice

206
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:48,389
might fold back into the branch coming from the new choice.

207
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,731
But eventually things probably fold back together

208
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:54,053
towards the end, and you're presented with one final decision

209
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:59,056
that, once you choose there, it splits out

210
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,717
to different endings for different players.

211
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:01,998
And this is frequently done on a sort

212
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:04,059
of good, neutral, or bad ending.

213
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,520
That's not the case all the time,

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,042
but it's a pretty common trope there.

215
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:14,178
And before going on, I want to be clear that this is a perfectly valid structure for a game plot.

216
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,519
I'm not, my talk is not a screed against this kind of plot.

217
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,742
I wanted to do something differently, but these plots can obviously work very well in games

218
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:26,265
and give players really memorable experiences where they make choices that are really powerful to them.

219
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:30,267
So I just want to make sure that this doesn't come off as me trashing this kind of branching narrative,

220
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,108
because I think it's fine.

221
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:38,214
But in my game, I did want to impose as little pre-authored structure as possible from, from my angle.

222
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:42,238
So instead of writing a story, and even a story with a bunch of choices,

223
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:46,582
I instead wanted to create narrative systems from which a player-driven story would emerge.

224
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:49,926
So actually a systems-based narrative.

225
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:53,009
So I made a bunch of structural decisions to try to make this happen.

226
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,052
And the first, and maybe most important one, is that

227
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,903
the chapters in the game come in a random order on each playthrough.

228
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,744
So I actually sort of burned the boats and

229
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,625
literally prevented myself from being able to author a traditional branching plot.

230
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,626
Like I could not if I tried.

231
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,746
Because when this chapter comes up,

232
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,427
I don't know if this has happened here, or happened here,

233
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,188
or what the player did here, or what the player did here.

234
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:10,348
So

235
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm not sure.

236
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,148
I'm not sure.

237
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:11,789
I'm not sure.

238
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:12,389
I'm not sure.

239
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,669
I'm not sure.

240
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,369
I'm not sure.

241
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:13,589
I'm not sure.

242
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm not sure.

243
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,370
I'm not sure.

244
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,130
I'm not sure.

245
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,714
I actively prevented myself from being able to create that kind of narrative.

246
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,555
I simply don't know what comes before or after.

247
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,959
And so that provided a lot of constraints on the actual chapter design,

248
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,682
but each chapter became sort of a self-contained building block for the larger narrative.

249
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:35,326
The second point is that I wanted relationships to be the sort of core thread

250
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:39,249
and the core connective tissue between chapters, not a series of plot events.

251
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:39,609
And finally,

252
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,736
I wanted to create a framework that's based on player values

253
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,896
as the authorship of the game.

254
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:47,357
I wanted to create something where the player has to make

255
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,957
personal decisions to create this story.

256
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:52,238
So I tried to take each chapter and make each of the

257
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:54,939
decisions the player has to make equally sympathetic from

258
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,459
the different perspectives in the game.

259
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,680
I didn't want players to get to a chapter and say, oh, this

260
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,881
is clearly the right answer, or this is the good versus

261
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,281
evil answer, or obviously I should do this.

262
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,722
I kind of wanted them to have to be sympathetic to all

263
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:07,542
characters and have to say, wow, what do I really think is

264
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,002
right here?

265
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,263
What do I think is more important here?

266
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,526
So, again, it's a question game, not a message game.

267
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:15,631
And more specifically, it's a game about trying to balance

268
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,315
your career and your dreams with your family.

269
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,598
So all of your decisions are based on making choices

270
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:23,101
that prioritize one of these things here.

271
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,483
And the high concept is essentially...

272
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,234
a game with nine chapters, each of which

273
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,954
asks you to make a decision on these axes

274
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,055
in a slightly different way.

275
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:32,595
And the hope being that you'll end up

276
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,717
with a set of relationships at the end of the game that

277
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,377
reflects your own choices on that subject,

278
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,718
and that the story is almost like a mirror to help you

279
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,459
process your own values on this specific question.

280
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,018
So I want to walk through an example chapter,

281
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,059
just to make sure it's clear how the game works,

282
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,821
so that we'll have a vocabulary going forward.

283
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,902
In each chapter, you spend time sneaking around the house

284
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,523
and trying to remain hidden.

285
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,624
And so you read things the characters have written.

286
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,891
You look at things that Tommy has drawn.

287
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,832
You read the character's thoughts to see what they're

288
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:02,413
thinking about.

289
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,755
You even explore their memories and relive past

290
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,497
conversations and past events.

291
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:09,380
And all these things help you piece together what's going on

292
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,100
in each chapter.

293
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,383
So you have a discovery phase where you uncover

294
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,263
this type of stuff.

295
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,206
And each character has their own chain of clues.

296
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:19,009
And so what you want to do is basically find enough clues

297
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,992
for each character to discover how they want to resolve the

298
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:23,013
dilemma in the chapter.

299
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,205
So to use an example of a chapter called The Show,

300
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,607
in this chapter, Linda is going to be putting on an art show

301
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:29,947
in town.

302
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,529
And she's really under the gun trying

303
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,670
to finish a last piece before the art show goes live.

304
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,354
And she's asked Dan to help her with some promo materials

305
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:40,556
and also asked if he could help her find an agent.

306
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,742
But meanwhile, Dan is behind on his own deadline.

307
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,583
His agent's writing him, he's dodging phone calls,

308
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,204
and he's got a big deadline due Monday,

309
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,466
and he's super under the gun himself

310
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,467
and doesn't have the time to do it.

311
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,449
And finally, to make matters worse,

312
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,050
he had also promised their son Tommy

313
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,431
that they were gonna go to the beach that day

314
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:58,372
and look for a conch shell

315
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,473
and just have a nice Saturday at the beach.

316
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,215
So everything has to be done that weekend

317
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,256
and there's not enough time to do it all.

318
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,378
And the game is told from Dan's perspective.

319
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:12,479
So it's presented as a series of choices like these where you can't do everything he wants to do, and you have to pick what's more important.

320
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,921
So after you uncover all the clues, you basically have to decide whether Dan should help with the promo forms,

321
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:21,082
and so Linda can focus on her last painting and kind of support her in her career.

322
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:26,063
So you see there she's thinking, you know, he could take care of those promo forms for me,

323
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,723
and that would obviously help the marriage.

324
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:29,564
Or you could look at, uh...

325
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,894
him just basically going into crunch mode over the weekend

326
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,014
and chaining himself to his typewriter to work on his book,

327
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:36,995
which of course helps his career and helps his novel.

328
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:40,595
Or he could blow off both of those things

329
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,196
and take Tommy on the beach trip,

330
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:43,676
which is good for his role as a parent.

331
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,737
So in this case, let's say the player chooses

332
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:48,597
to prioritize Dan and Linda's marriage

333
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,117
and work on the promo forms.

334
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,478
These decisions are fed back to the player

335
00:14:52,478 --> 00:14:53,958
through a series of short scenes

336
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,218
that kind of tell you the impact of what happened.

337
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,659
So here we can see that Dan and Linda

338
00:14:58,659 --> 00:14:59,880
are working on the forms together

339
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,541
and it kind of explains, I don't know

340
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,802
how easy that is to read, but it basically goes on to say

341
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,583
the art show was a big hit, the ad in the paper

342
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,584
did a lot to help that happen and it was good

343
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,546
that he helped her and it was really a big boost for her

344
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:13,487
and it was awesome that he was a supportive husband

345
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:14,967
and that's really cool.

346
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,108
However, Tommy didn't get his beach trip,

347
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:20,350
so he spent Saturday looking out the window being super sad

348
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,471
and that's kind of a bummer.

349
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:32,108
And then Dan also misses his deadline because he spent the time supporting his wife and he gets chewed out by his agent and his book kind of goes a little bit more in the gutter.

350
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:36,217
So again, the narrative's constructed from the history

351
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:39,158
of the player's choices on these specific topics.

352
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,459
And so the starting point of the next chapter, in this

353
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,480
case, would be a better marriage because he helped her

354
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,601
with the promo forms, an unhappier child because he

355
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,242
broke that promise to his kid, and a worse book because he

356
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,422
missed his deadline.

357
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:52,703
And these relationships are the spine of the story.

358
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,584
So I decided that I would build a really simple

359
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,545
simulation of them.

360
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,561
So each of those relationships is scored from 0 to 9,

361
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,102
with 0 being the worst and 9 being the best.

362
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:05,443
And at the beginning of the game, they're all rated at 5.

363
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,443
So everything comes in even.

364
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:08,724
And in the example we just looked at,

365
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:11,565
where Dan supported Linda at the expense of his work

366
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:12,845
and his relationship to his son.

367
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,809
The marriage score goes up to seven, while his career score

368
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,891
and his relationship to Tommy each drop to four.

369
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,033
And these numbers are never revealed to the player.

370
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,395
They're actually fed back through a variety of other

371
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,177
means that I'll go into a little bit later.

372
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,418
But it's important to know that this

373
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:28,299
is all under the hood.

374
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:31,902
So the relationship scores, like I said, are the

375
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,984
connective tissue that carry forward from chapter to

376
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,025
chapter in the game.

377
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,459
And the next decision that the player makes

378
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,320
will be based on starting with these new values.

379
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,580
So if you plot that change over time,

380
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,561
it basically looks like this.

381
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,141
Each decision makes a relationship

382
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,942
get noticeably better or slightly worse.

383
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:51,882
And so this little Pac-Man mouth is sort of the atomic unit

384
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:52,563
of the story.

385
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:55,363
Every decision functions on these relationships

386
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,404
one way or another, either making it pretty much better

387
00:16:58,404 --> 00:16:59,564
or slightly worse.

388
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,748
So the way this works over the course of the game

389
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,428
is that if you look at a game with nine chapters

390
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,509
and they all start at five,

391
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:08,930
this is the sort of possibility space

392
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,910
of any given relationship over the game.

393
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,371
These are the possible decisions that could happen.

394
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,692
So by the end of the second chapter,

395
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,452
any relationship in the game can actually

396
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:18,973
already reach its maximal value

397
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,093
because it's five plus two is seven plus two is nine.

398
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:23,834
So Dan's book could be the next War and Peace

399
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,515
or he and Linda could be on a perpetual honeymoon

400
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,855
or he could also be the greatest dad in the world.

401
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:30,283
So if we keep going a little further,

402
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,004
you see that from each one of these points,

403
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,866
additional decisions can be made and continue to build out.

404
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,028
And by the fifth chapter, any relationship

405
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,750
that's been completely neglected can hit rock bottom.

406
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,612
It can actually get to the worst shape possible.

407
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,793
If you have ignored that, you know,

408
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,394
either ignored his book or ignored his wife

409
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,856
or ignored his son the whole time.

410
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,358
So we follow forward, and the decisions pile on decisions

411
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,640
pile on decisions, and this represents

412
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,903
the full possibility space for any single relationship

413
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:56,463
in the game.

414
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,383
And if you compare that to the branching plot diagram,

415
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,045
it actually looks pretty impressive, right?

416
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,427
There's so much stuff you can do.

417
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:03,728
But it's actually not.

418
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:04,609
This is kind of a mess.

419
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,734
It's too granular for most of these data points to mean anything.

420
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,476
And since the numbers are never shown to the player,

421
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,198
a lot of this detail is irrelevant.

422
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:15,101
So while there might be a big possibility space,

423
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:16,963
it's very hard to tease a lot of meaning out of this.

424
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,465
And in fact, it's just a different form.

425
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,026
of the thing I was trying to avoid,

426
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:22,468
which is system soup.

427
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,769
So when I realized that, I knew the next challenge

428
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,111
was to basically take these numbers

429
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,513
that were under the hood and very granular

430
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,114
and not fed back very well

431
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,956
and overlay a lot of sort of human-readable context

432
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,958
to let players know where they were standing

433
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,899
and where these relationships were.

434
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,721
So here are some of the methods

435
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,962
that I used to feed this stuff back.

436
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:42,423
First off...

437
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:50,088
The player can basically read the character's thoughts and just see what the relationship

438
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:50,829
statuses are.

439
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,490
So here's one where Tommy is bummed out about his dad.

440
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,631
They don't have a very good relationship and so he's saying, oh, mommy said daddy's just

441
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,232
too busy.

442
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:01,073
So he, you know, things aren't going well and you can kind of read, oh, wow, that's

443
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,173
kind of a, that kind of hurts him.

444
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,994
Maybe I should give Tommy a little love in this chapter.

445
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:07,657
You can also explore the characters' memories

446
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,119
and find diaries where they react to previous decisions.

447
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:14,042
So here's a diary where Linda's really excited about how things went with her art show,

448
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:18,506
and you kind of get that payoff of how elated she is that things went well for her.

449
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:22,029
Tommy also does drawings to represent his relationship with his father.

450
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,790
So this is when things are going really good.

451
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,292
He draws happy pictures. Dad's got his arm around him.

452
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,954
Here's where things are kind of just OK.

453
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,817
They're just kind of standing there like, hey, we exist.

454
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,699
And then, uh, this is when things are going really badly.

455
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,140
His dad is like this screaming monster,

456
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,242
and he looks sad. He's giving this what-do-I-do thing.

457
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,764
So it basically shows you the different range

458
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,946
of drawings that Tommy can make.

459
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:43,466
Um, I also...

460
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,708
did a thing where there are objects left around

461
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,330
from previous chapters in the house.

462
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,711
So this newspaper clipping on the wall

463
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:52,293
only comes up if you do the art show with Linda.

464
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,035
And if you go read it, it's basically a notice

465
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,417
that says, you know, local artists or visiting artists,

466
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,358
Linda Kaplan put on a great show, blah, blah, blah.

467
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,860
So it kind of gives you a little bit of payoff

468
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,201
to remind you of your past decisions.

469
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,322
And over the course of the game,

470
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,063
these objects build up across the house

471
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:07,687
and sort of create a unique landscape of the decisions

472
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,808
you've made represented by these physical objects.

473
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,210
Another example would be.

474
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,723
If you had actually taken Tommy to the beach, that conch shell would now be on his bedside

475
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:15,667
table for the rest of the game.

476
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:21,683
Another one is that when characters pass each other in the house, they'll greet each other.

477
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:25,747
So if things are going really well with Dan and Linda, they'll have a really happy greeting.

478
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:29,450
They'll maybe talk about taking a break together or going into town to get something to eat.

479
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,753
If things are just going okay, it's a lot more perfunctory.

480
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,714
It's just like, hey, oh, hey.

481
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:37,558
And if things are going bad, they barely acknowledge each other, and it sounds really icy and pretty tough.

482
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,442
So just ambiently around the house, you can kind of hear some representations of those relationships.

483
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,668
And if things get really bad, characters will actually start locking themselves in their rooms.

484
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:50,750
So this is Tommy in his room alone playing with his toys, sad because his dad's neglecting him.

485
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,152
And Linda can do the same in her studio.

486
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,373
And there's also some scenarios where Dan can do that in his office.

487
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:01,556
And then this is my favorite one, which I don't think anyone's ever noticed in the world, but I like it.

488
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:07,479
Dan's trash can. If things are going really good on his book, there's almost no crumbled up paper in his trash can.

489
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:12,622
But as things start to go worse, it fills back in, and each chapter it kind of represents the status of his book by

490
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:15,203
how many bad pages are curled up and thrown on the floor.

491
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:18,045
And, I don't know. Now at least some people know that that exists.

492
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,818
So these things are all good at giving the player status updates.

493
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:22,299
That's good.

494
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,080
It's information.

495
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,025
The player knows how these relationships are standing, but we still don't have a story.

496
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:30,472
We still have nine flat chapters without any highs or lows, and you just sort of manipulate

497
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:33,857
these relationships, but it's just the same sort of flow over and over again.

498
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,026
And one of the key benefits of an authored story

499
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,827
is that the writer can make sure the story has a beginning

500
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:40,627
and middle and an end.

501
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,388
They can make sure to modulate the intensity of the events

502
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,008
and create some dramatic ebb and flow

503
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,049
so that the story has some structure

504
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,650
and players are kept more interested

505
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,330
and you kind of have these big events

506
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,791
and then you release with some pressure

507
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,151
and release the pressure and then build up

508
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:55,912
to another big event and basically modulate the flow

509
00:21:55,912 --> 00:21:58,033
so players don't get fatigued but they also feel structure.

510
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:03,099
And there are a lot of ways to do this, but one of the most basic is the traditional 3x structure,

511
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:08,385
which is a very simple way of creating rising and falling action over time,

512
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:10,867
and building to a climax and resolution.

513
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,711
Now, this is super, super basic. It's not innovative at all.

514
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:17,395
And a lot of writers actually advocate moving away from it and going to more advanced forms.

515
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,936
But in the case of my game, given the difficulty

516
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,737
of trying to create a narrative out of these really

517
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,297
unpredictable systems, where I don't know what order

518
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:26,618
the events are going to happen in,

519
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,979
I don't know what the player's going to choose each time,

520
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,339
I actually felt that having something

521
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,700
that's very identifiable and very recognizable in a form

522
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,580
that people get would actually help.

523
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,481
So this did not feel like the place for me

524
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,421
to try to do something weird.

525
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,562
I actually thought the game benefited

526
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,123
from having a really simple, defined structure based

527
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:43,803
on the three acts.

528
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:49,442
So the more familiarity and form I could add to the story, I felt that was better.

529
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,881
So if we look at our map of the possibility space again

530
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,442
and slice it to have three acts and a climax,

531
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,004
then we can start to see specific points in the narrative

532
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,905
and the timeline that we start to build up to.

533
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:03,166
And if we slice it into three acts,

534
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,947
we can also zero in on where those relationship scores

535
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:08,008
can be at any of these points in the story.

536
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,810
So we start to identify, I wanna punch things up here

537
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,371
and this is sort of where things can be at this time.

538
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,573
And we can start to isolate places

539
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:19,174
to put bigger and more memorable moments in the story

540
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:20,675
to try to give it those peaks and valleys.

541
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:25,402
And I used the three-act structure as a guide

542
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:27,102
to introduce more drama at known intervals.

543
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,963
And the way I did that was I made chapters three

544
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,304
and six and eight higher-stakes dilemmas.

545
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:35,865
They were generally more, uh, I don't know,

546
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,446
emotionally-involving chapters,

547
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,086
and each one of them focused on a different character.

548
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,207
And then chapter nine is the finale,

549
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,648
so it sort of has the highest stakes of all.

550
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:45,568
Um, and since the game takes place over one summer,

551
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:47,189
I felt like there was a natural rhythm to it

552
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:49,269
where I could just say, well, June is act one,

553
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,390
July is act two, and August is act three,

554
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,490
culminating with them.

555
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,067
leaving the house and going forward into the future.

556
00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:02,327
So I started to do this, but I realized, you know, maybe, so, so,

557
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:06,730
the bottle is an example of one of these high stakes chapters.

558
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,692
It's one where Dan's drinking problem is getting a little bit out of control.

559
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:14,715
His wife's worried about him. His son's upset because he's not paying enough attention to him.

560
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:17,997
And I decided to set all these high stakes chapters at night.

561
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:20,618
The game has different times of day, so I figured why not make it at night?

562
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:23,000
Make it feel more ominous. Make it feel more heavy.

563
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,340
And so...

564
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,603
I made sure to put these at chapters 3, 6, and 9.

565
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:28,445
They're still randomly selected.

566
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:30,648
There's a bucket of these, and I put a random one at each time,

567
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,010
so it's not like I really structure it that much.

568
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,692
But I just make sure that something big

569
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:36,054
happens at these key points in the story.

570
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:37,616
And I also make sure that after that,

571
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,919
it pulls from the bucket of lower stakes chapters,

572
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,781
so that you get some peaks and then a little bit

573
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:42,842
of release of that tension.

574
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,871
And in addition, this was another thing that I added

575
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,553
after a lot of playtest feedback,

576
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,474
was after each one of these high-stakes chapters,

577
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,956
you get an additional set of these narrative wrap-up scenes

578
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,677
that give you sort of a roll-up

579
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:57,459
on the overall relationship status of all these axes

580
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,781
that aren't related to any specific chapter.

581
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,903
So they take place completely off screen,

582
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:07,026
and they serve as a summary of all the choices the players made up to this point.

583
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:10,889
So it's not just, here's how people reacted to the choice you just made for this chapter,

584
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:14,011
but here's where your relationships stand based on all of your choices so far.

585
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:17,853
So, it wasn't feasible scope-wise, obviously,

586
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:20,154
to create scenes for every possible relationship score.

587
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,795
It might have worked okay at the first

588
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:22,876
because there's not that many options,

589
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:25,557
but by the second act and certainly by the third act,

590
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,578
there would literally be 10 options for both

591
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:29,839
because every relationship could be everywhere,

592
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,460
and that's completely...

593
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,201
you know, unsustainable from a scope,

594
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,084
especially from a one dude making a game in his apartment.

595
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,226
So that wasn't necessarily a problem, though,

596
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,288
because these would be so granular anyways

597
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,970
that I'm not sure the player would know the difference

598
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,732
between what's a, what's a six relationship

599
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:45,694
and what's a seven relationship.

600
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,416
So what I did was, I broke this up into bands.

601
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:53,859
that basically denoted different relationship values,

602
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:57,021
and then broke those down into, you know,

603
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:57,701
8 and 9 are good, 6 and 7,

604
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:00,583
or 8 and 9 is great, 6 or 7 is good,

605
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,104
3, 4, and 5 are bad, and 0, 1, and 2 are awful.

606
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:08,808
I broke it down into categories to kind of make them work more manageable, but also because

607
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:12,469
that way they would actually make sense to characters. You can tell the difference between

608
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:16,250
good and bad a lot more than you can tell the difference between four and five or something

609
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,831
like that. So it basically preserved the granular relationship scoring under the hood while

610
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:25,732
compressing the dynamic range of the player feedback into something that was more meaningful

611
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:28,673
to players. So here's an example of some of those scenes.

612
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,779
You start off with a little intro that says,

613
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,362
hey, the first month is done, and a lot of stuff had happened.

614
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:36,424
And then you get three scenes that

615
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:38,245
tell you the status of these relationships

616
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:40,647
based on all of the decisions up to this point.

617
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:44,150
So for example, at the end of the first act,

618
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,492
Dan sends his work in progress to his agent.

619
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:48,054
And his agent comes back and says, oh, wow.

620
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:48,794
This is really great.

621
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:49,535
This is awesome.

622
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,577
So you know that Dan's book is going well

623
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,379
at the end of the first act of the game.

624
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,681
Dan and Linda go into town for a date.

625
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,862
the date goes really well.

626
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:00,064
So you say, oh man, I guess they really are hitting it off.

627
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,686
I'm so glad I'm saving this relationship as the player

628
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,827
based on the choices I made.

629
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:07,589
But here's a story, a sad story, where

630
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:09,391
Dan took Tommy out in the woods to look for arrowheads.

631
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,112
And basically, as soon as they got there, he said, OK, come

632
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:11,853
on, we're going home.

633
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:12,733
And Tommy was crying.

634
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,854
Dan didn't care.

635
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:16,576
And so it basically says that, yeah, he's up to this point

636
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:17,898
being a very neglectful father.

637
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:20,680
And there are four different versions of

638
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,001
each of these scenes.

639
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,363
So depending on where those relationships are in those

640
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:24,603
zones.

641
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,396
then you get one of those four scenes.

642
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,958
That's a lot more manageable than 10 scenes each time.

643
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,900
And arguably, it's more readable to the player.

644
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,842
And they really explicitly tell you how things are going.

645
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:35,224
So you get these at the end of, you

646
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:36,865
have these big, high stakes chapters.

647
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,366
And then you get a roll up that says,

648
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,187
here you are in the story.

649
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:40,148
Here's where it is.

650
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:41,689
And you're like, wow, end of a month.

651
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,571
And it kind of gives you a good place to stop.

652
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,213
Like a lot of people will play an act,

653
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:48,035
and then put the game down, and play the next act,

654
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:48,815
put the game down.

655
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,342
It really did a good job of starting to split the game up

656
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:53,224
into a more definable structure,

657
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:58,448
so that there was some rising and falling action.

658
00:27:58,448 --> 00:27:58,568
So...

659
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:01,030
Once I got to this point,

660
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,352
the system was actually in pretty good shape.

661
00:28:03,352 --> 00:28:05,754
Players understood how their decisions and actions

662
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:07,155
were creating the story.

663
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:10,318
I was starting to get to a discernible narrative flow,

664
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:11,999
and there was a beginning, a middle, and an end,

665
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,301
and the players had an emotional connection to the experience.

666
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:17,931
And I was happy for a while, but unfortunately,

667
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:19,592
while the core system was pretty solid,

668
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,654
it started to reveal some limitations.

669
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:23,516
And these started to come mostly from

670
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:25,677
players' sort of natural expectations

671
00:28:25,677 --> 00:28:27,399
regarding how human beings would actually react

672
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,360
in some of these scenarios.

673
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,242
So let's take a look at a scenario where the player

674
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,764
focuses on Dan and Linda's marriage

675
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:35,065
with some focus on Dan's novel

676
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,967
and puts no love towards Tommy.

677
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,168
So this graph is going to show

678
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,410
all three relationships as they progress

679
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,092
through a given playthrough.

680
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,806
So you see them developing series of choices,

681
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,228
plus two or down one, depending on what's going on.

682
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,830
And if the player makes a series of choices

683
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,511
that gets to this point, then.

684
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,394
The marriage score is at an eight.

685
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:58,135
So Dan and Linda are madly in love.

686
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,375
Their marriage is going great.

687
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,596
They're really reconnecting.

688
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:03,377
But then you look down here, and Tommy's at a zero.

689
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,818
His dad is being terrible to him.

690
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:06,699
He has ignored him through literally the entire game.

691
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:07,639
He's neglecting him.

692
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,020
Tommy is starting to get traumatized.

693
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,701
And then I realized that I had put in these feedback

694
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:15,783
systems that I showed earlier that said how things are going.

695
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,063
And so the player actually really knows

696
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,264
what these relationships are.

697
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:21,005
And I started to see these incongruities

698
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:24,026
when things started to reach the extremes of this dynamic range.

699
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:24,086
So.

700
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:28,169
It simply wasn't realistic to have in the same chapter,

701
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,271
Dan saying, oh man, I should make Linda breakfast in bed.

702
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:33,834
And Linda saying, I hope we didn't wake up Tommy last night.

703
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:36,155
So obviously, their marriage is going really well.

704
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:38,377
But then Tommy's sitting in his room with the door closed,

705
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,859
saying, why is my dad such a bully?

706
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,821
It's hard to imagine Linda being madly in love with her husband

707
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:46,123
at the same time that he's being this awful, awful father.

708
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:49,045
So once you move to the edges of this range,

709
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:50,747
these things can start to conflict with each other

710
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,788
in ways that really started to jump out.

711
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:52,949
So.

712
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,671
Since the player has no control over Tommy or Linda,

713
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,991
then they have to have some level of autonomy in

714
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:01,872
the way that they deal with these relationships. And

715
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:04,053
so the solution I came up with was that,

716
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,194
in this case, Linda would actually speak up for

717
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,155
Tommy. And if the roles were reversed, Tommy would

718
00:30:08,155 --> 00:30:09,375
speak up for Linda.

719
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,676
So let's, let's rewind this just a little bit.

720
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:19,303
and get to the same decision point here and

721
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,864
apply these same scoring zones that I was using

722
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,484
for the, the act break wrap ups.

723
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:26,825
So we can use these inflection points as triggers

724
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,285
to know when the characters should speak up for

725
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:31,406
each other. So, for example, Linda sees that Tommy

726
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,486
has just crossed into the awful zone, like things

727
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,207
are going really bad, and she decides to do

728
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,707
something about it.

729
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:39,148
So in this scenario, instead of her wanting her

730
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:41,048
desired outcome in a vacuum, which is what we

731
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,648
saw before, she says, wow, I wish Dan could

732
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:44,609
take care of those promo forms so I could

733
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,389
work on my painting.

734
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,161
Instead, she says,

735
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,542
he shouldn't worry about those promo forms.

736
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,262
He really should take Tommy to get that shell.

737
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:52,943
She speaks up for Tommy and tells the player

738
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:54,823
very explicitly, hey, this is what I want,

739
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:55,703
but I don't want you to do it.

740
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:56,924
I want you to take care of your son.

741
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,624
So this is like a feedback mechanism in the game,

742
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,345
and it was originally just intended

743
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:04,806
to make the characters more believable.

744
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,706
But I quickly realized that I had to

745
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:08,547
incorporate those intentions back

746
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:09,787
into the simulation itself.

747
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,828
It wasn't good enough for them to just speak up.

748
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:15,168
So in a normal case, obviously if none of the relationships

749
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:16,809
are in the awful zone and nothing's been triggered,

750
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,891
then each character just wants what they want in a vacuum,

751
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,192
like we saw with Linda before.

752
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,414
But here, Linda has changed her mind and says

753
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,115
she wants Dan to pay attention to their son,

754
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:28,097
not do what she would actually normally want.

755
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:30,179
So if the player listens to Linda's request

756
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,820
and goes and plays with Tommy,

757
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,461
Tommy gets the normal two-point boost

758
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,043
that pulls his relationship back out of the awful band.

759
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:37,944
It's still bad, but it's better than nothing.

760
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,153
But the key thing is that Linda doesn't take the normal one point hit.

761
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:46,116
Which stands to reason. She was very clear about what she wanted.

762
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:49,278
And she said, you know, my desire is for you to put Tommy in front of my own needs.

763
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,281
And it would be a really bad simulation if the player got such a clear message from Linda,

764
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:57,925
did what Linda wanted, and then she still turned around and got mad at him for not doing what she wanted.

765
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:01,989
So, in essence, the simulation allows Linda to forgive Dan in conditional cases where

766
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:06,312
she had actually said, hey, you know what, what I want isn't the most important thing right now.

767
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,773
And on the flip side, if we look at the same situation,

768
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:12,117
and Linda says, you should take care of your son,

769
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:13,879
forget my promo forms, and Dan says, shut up,

770
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,501
I'm doing the promo forms anyways.

771
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,518
Then Tommy's relationship score still takes that one point hit.

772
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:20,479
It still gets worse because he still got ignored.

773
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,540
Belinda also takes the hit.

774
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,900
She gets angry about it.

775
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,081
She says, I told you, you jerk.

776
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,321
You know, pay attention to your son,

777
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,942
and you just went and did this anyways.

778
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:28,662
How deaf are you?

779
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:31,823
And there are actually conditional outcomes

780
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:33,264
for all the chapters that address this.

781
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:35,505
If you go either way in this scenario,

782
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:36,545
then in the next chapter, it's fed back.

783
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:38,026
And she says, you know, I really would

784
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,326
have liked to have help with that,

785
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,707
but I'm so glad that Tommy and Dan had a good time

786
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,187
at the beach and blah, blah, blah.

787
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:43,969
And this works both ways.

788
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:47,072
If Linda's relationship gets really low and Tommy's is high,

789
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:49,294
then he'll say, I don't want to go to the beach.

790
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:50,055
Go make up with mommy.

791
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,517
So they kind of regulate for each other.

792
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:54,339
Because since the player doesn't have direct control over them

793
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,861
in the way they do over Dan, they

794
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:58,363
have to have some level of autonomy.

795
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:01,825
I had to modify the simulation sum to account for edge cases,

796
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:06,026
and also to make sure that the simulation stayed believable.

797
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,606
And I was happy with how the players,

798
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,747
or how the characters that the player can't control

799
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:12,267
started to behave in these scenarios.

800
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:15,048
And in general, the system seemed really tight.

801
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:17,709
But there was something that still bothered me,

802
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,950
and it started causing a lot of complaints for playtesters as well.

803
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,430
And that's the fact that,

804
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,611
this is probably the biggest one that really took a lot of thought,

805
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:28,072
because the relationship system is zero-sum.

806
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:32,876
The player starts with 15 points in the system.

807
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,559
And every choice just reassigns the same number of points.

808
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,181
So 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15.

809
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,743
So does 7 plus 4 plus 4.

810
00:33:38,743 --> 00:33:42,728
So over the course of a game, you

811
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:44,550
start everybody's at level 5, which

812
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,951
is at the top of the bad zone.

813
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:47,173
That's why they're here.

814
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:48,635
Things aren't going too well for any of them.

815
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,534
And then, in a zero-sum system, the player is just

816
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,597
spending this entire game rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

817
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:59,462
So to improve one relationship, you have to make the other two worse.

818
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:02,165
And so, as you go through the game, you're just moving around

819
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,908
the same fifteen relationship points, making one score better

820
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:07,351
and the other score is worse. And so in this example,

821
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:09,193
For Dan to write a great book,

822
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:10,675
he has to be an awful father,

823
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,637
and he ends up in the exact same spot with Linda.

824
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:14,279
They're both at a five, it's kind of bad,

825
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,420
and nothing has happened.

826
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,483
So it's this really, really nihilistic viewpoint

827
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,185
from the systems design, right?

828
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:24,249
You're just saying like, wow, you just have this.

829
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:30,337
set reserve of emotional energy that you can't spread around you can't make any extra effort in life is just sort of this.

830
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:33,320
I don't know ugly thing and so.

831
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,828
Players are responding to this and I was like oh well because in my head I was just like oh this is such so simple and beautiful it's plus 2 minus 1 every time it just.

832
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:47,213
But then I asked myself, you know, when I'm mapping this to relational contexts, does

833
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:50,756
that represent real life? Is there really no way that you can have a good career and

834
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,861
have a good family? I was like, I know friends that do this. Like, I know it's not impossible.

835
00:34:55,861 --> 00:35:01,145
And I didn't think that that was the right message for the game to send. And I had this

836
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,466
realization where...

837
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:05,744
I'd done everything I could to advocate authorship

838
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:07,345
in terms of the narrative content.

839
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:08,145
I tried my hardest.

840
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,306
I'm sure I didn't succeed everywhere,

841
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:12,207
but I tried my hardest to make all these situations

842
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:13,228
very sympathetic.

843
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:14,688
You, in every chapter, you said,

844
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:16,549
oh, I can see why, you know, Linda would want this.

845
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:17,790
I would see why Dan would want this.

846
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,711
And I could see why Tommy wanted this.

847
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:21,091
And it's up to you, the player, to decide.

848
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:23,492
I tried to make that as balanced as possible.

849
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:25,693
But when I hit this problem with the zero-sum system,

850
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:27,914
I realized that I couldn't advocate authorship

851
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:28,855
from the game as a whole.

852
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:32,596
I'd only relocated my authorship from the narrative content

853
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,656
to the actual design of the narrative simulation.

854
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:38,637
And further, I created a game that was sending a message

855
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,597
that I never intended.

856
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,438
I, I built this relationship simulation,

857
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,698
and I felt like Clark Griswold when he plugs in

858
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:45,719
the Christmas lights and the house doesn't light up.

859
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,860
The system design had become the implicit message of the game,

860
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
and I was basically telling players,

861
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,021
you can't have it all.

862
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:52,941
Life is zero-sum.

863
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:53,801
You cannot win.

864
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,141
And it was this really brutal...

865
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:58,423
Bummer of a game, unintentional.

866
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:02,765
And so I'm standing there like, why are the lights not coming on?

867
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:03,906
But yeah, so it was really upsetting.

868
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:07,327
And the biggest thing is I don't believe that perspective to be true.

869
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:11,089
I believe you can put in the extra effort and have a better life.

870
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,993
people were taking this message from the game that I fundamentally disagreed with.

871
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:17,755
And I was like, oh my god, I made this, and I don't agree with it.

872
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:20,918
And I realized I was editorializing through systems design.

873
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:24,362
Like, the actual design of the system had become the message of the game.

874
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:27,285
So I knew I had to make a change, and I started talking to my friends

875
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,547
and thinking about people who actually do seem to have it all.

876
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:32,129
People who are successful at their jobs, and have a loving wife,

877
00:36:32,129 --> 00:36:33,651
and have a great relationship with their kids.

878
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:35,873
And I asked myself, how do they do it?

879
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:38,074
And the answer is actually pretty simple.

880
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,236
They just try harder.

881
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:42,518
If a parent misses their kid's soccer practice,

882
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:44,819
then they might take their kid out for ice cream the next day

883
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:46,761
or take him to a movie to make up for it.

884
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:48,922
Or if you can't make time to have dinner with your partner,

885
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:51,344
maybe you buy them a little gift somewhere in the week

886
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:53,686
or maybe cook them a surprise meal later to make up for it

887
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:56,388
and say, hey, you know, I knew I couldn't make it when we wanted to,

888
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:57,809
but you're so important, I want to show it.

889
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,610
And, you know, everybody knows

890
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,072
that you can't please everyone all the time,

891
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:02,653
but if you do those extra things...

892
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:30,198
You actually can have a good relationship over time by sort of, you know, a friend of mine said a really, a really great thing, which was the goal isn't to live a balanced week. It's to live a balanced life. So it's just an acknowledgement that you can't please everyone in every situation. If you miss a deadline at work, maybe you stay later to work on it. So you find ways to put in the extra effort to make these make these things go a little better. So that's where the compromise system came into the game and the goal I had was I wanted to.

893
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,767
map the concept of extra effort in life.

894
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:37,004
to extra effort and skillfulness in the game.

895
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,484
And so for extra effort,

896
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:40,645
I decided that the player would have to

897
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:42,126
go down a character's entire clue chain

898
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,827
and find their clue and understand what they wanted to do

899
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,528
in order to earn a compromise with them.

900
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:49,609
And for skillfulness, they had to also remain unspotted.

901
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,411
So they had to make it through the entire chapter.

902
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,772
It's a stealth game, without being spotted.

903
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,533
So you can't upset the character too much.

904
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:57,613
They've still got to be in a good place.

905
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,614
And if you do both of those things,

906
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:01,935
you earn the ability to create a compromise with them.

907
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:02,115
So...

908
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,063
Remember the scene of Tommy sitting by the window where he's sad because his dad decided to do the promo forms instead and broke the promise to him?

909
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:13,704
Well, now I implemented a system where if you discover his clue, find out what he wants to do,

910
00:38:13,704 --> 00:38:19,407
and you remain unspotted, then you get the ability to have a compromise with Tommy.

911
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:23,000
So even if he can't take Tommy down to the beach for the whole day,

912
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,664
he can at least work late and make a little extra time to take him for an hour and a half.

913
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:30,668
And it's not all that Tommy wanted, but it does show Tommy that he's loved

914
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:33,931
and that, you know, Dan is trying. He's trying to, you know, do better for everybody.

915
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:38,136
And just like Linda speaking up for Tommy in the example before,

916
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:41,459
this needed to be reflected in the simulation itself.

917
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:50,336
So in the relationship system as it stood, you know, choosing Dan and Linda's marriage would cause a one-point drop on the novel and on Parenthood.

918
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:55,240
But in the updated simulation, if the player finds a compromise that lets Dan make it up to Tommy in some way,

919
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,246
then the Parenthood score would actually stay the same and not decrease by one, which, if you notice, all of a sudden adds a point to the system.

920
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:07,230
I just think of them as happiness points because the more you have, the sort of happier you can distribute them through the system.

921
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:11,209
And so whenever you start adding points to the system

922
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,349
and using compromises effectively,

923
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,390
you can actually please everyone

924
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,551
and get a happy ending to the game.

925
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:19,673
So remember our atomic unit of every decision in the game

926
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:21,574
where something either goes up by two or down by one.

927
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,635
Well now we added in a third option

928
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:25,936
where things could also stay the same.

929
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,577
And if you spread those out over time,

930
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:30,458
you can actually have a much, much different picture

931
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,519
of the story you're telling.

932
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,520
So here's the possibility space without compromises.

933
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:37,265
here's the possibility space with compromises.

934
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:38,965
As soon as you get something to a level,

935
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:41,046
you can keep it there for the rest of the game

936
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,047
and you can always sort of preserve.

937
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,828
And again, that's not to say that this is better

938
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,548
in and of itself, but it does give the player

939
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:50,089
more opportunities to impact the narrative.

940
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,430
So in the previous system, again,

941
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,630
the player was just rearranging the same 15 points

942
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,911
throughout the game.

943
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:56,531
So at the top, you can see the totals.

944
00:39:56,531 --> 00:40:01,633
It's just the same amount of points.

945
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,494
But in the new system, if you use a compromise

946
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:04,114
in each chapter,

947
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:07,284
then you see it here for example,

948
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:10,807
the parenthood rating of 5 stayed the same instead of going down.

949
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:14,030
And so if you use these carefully throughout the whole game,

950
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,052
then you can slowly increase their happiness.

951
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,197
And by the end of the game, you've got 24 points in the system,

952
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:22,199
and you can actually have a happy ending for everybody,

953
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,520
because you manage your points, and you're a good person,

954
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,483
and you love them all, and extra effort pays off, and life is awesome.

955
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:33,086
So the compromise system, I would say, is definitely my favorite piece of message through design in the game,

956
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:37,269
because it maps a real-world inspiration, which is making the extra effort,

957
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:43,133
into a game system of making the extra effort, and being careful, and being skillful in your gameplay.

958
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,614
And it also, and it pays off in the narrative layer.

959
00:40:45,614 --> 00:40:47,555
So it kind of all comes together to create a message

960
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:49,696
that I was much more comfortable with in the game.

961
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:52,597
So at this point I had a simulation that was in line

962
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:55,019
with the message I wanted to send.

963
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,879
Players had good feedback about the status

964
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,020
of these relationships.

965
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,961
The story had a definable shape.

966
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,482
The characters responded in ways that were believable

967
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:03,862
in the edge cases.

968
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,243
And the gameplay was mapped to this idea

969
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:07,104
of relational effort.

970
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:09,345
And it wasn't easy, but with careful and skillful play

971
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:11,886
you actually could get a happy ending for every character.

972
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,239
So I felt like I'd finally gotten the lights working,

973
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,740
and was looking at my beautiful house,

974
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,481
and felt proud of what I'd done.

975
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:21,783
But it, of course, didn't quite work out that way.

976
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,344
Because I worked so hard to hide these numbers

977
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:25,004
from the characters.

978
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:26,225
And I always thought that was a good idea.

979
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:26,825
Or from players.

980
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:28,026
I always thought that was a good idea.

981
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:29,727
I never wanted you to be thinking of these meters

982
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:30,347
when you're playing.

983
00:41:30,347 --> 00:41:34,249
I always wanted it to be focused on story and characters,

984
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:36,010
and not the simulation.

985
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,212
And that ended up working against me in this case.

986
00:41:38,212 --> 00:41:39,392
So let's look at an example.

987
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:44,898
So here's a play through where so far the player has chosen the novel twice

988
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:47,500
and he's done a compromise once for Tommy and once for Linda.

989
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,822
So he's got, you know, up to 17 points in this system.

990
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:53,024
So, so far, so good. He's, he's playing it the right way.

991
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:55,507
But what if he chooses the novel again?

992
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,948
or you can't go higher than nine,

993
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:00,729
but the marriage and parenthood scores

994
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:02,589
are still subject to the same rules.

995
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,209
So all of a sudden, the player has done

996
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:06,390
what they perceive to be the right thing,

997
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,870
and what the game is saying is the right thing,

998
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,731
and yet you've actually lost a point from the system.

999
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,032
And the problem is that even players

1000
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,932
who are engaging with the game and playing the right way

1001
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,892
and trying to make the good choices,

1002
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:18,553
and even when the onscreen feedback was saying

1003
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,373
they were making the right choices,

1004
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,774
they were under the hood sort of getting failed

1005
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,874
by the system itself because there wasn't enough

1006
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,415
dynamic range in the system.

1007
00:42:26,915 --> 00:42:30,818
And even when players became aware of how the system worked at a high level

1008
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,880
and really tried to game it, you know, people were like,

1009
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,162
okay, I'll do Dan, Linda, Tommy. Dan, Linda, Tommy.

1010
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:37,264
And just try to cycle through the game

1011
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,966
and try to keep everything in balance.

1012
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:41,687
I kind of got sort of caught off guard

1013
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:44,570
by the fact that people got so emotionally wrapped up

1014
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,272
in the content of the game that they'd say,

1015
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:48,553
okay, cool, it's Tommy's chapter.

1016
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:50,094
And they get ready to go, and they're like, oh, man.

1017
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,273
I gotta choose Linda here.

1018
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:53,693
They're like, oh, I mean, because the actual

1019
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:54,954
just subject matter of the chapter

1020
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:56,295
would make them feel like, oh my God,

1021
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:58,176
I can't not take her side, even though I know

1022
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,296
I'm supposed to give this one to Tommy.

1023
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:03,638
And so they would end up, sometimes this would lead them

1024
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:05,979
to bump into the ceiling, and without knowing it,

1025
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:07,580
basically take points out of the system

1026
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,801
and make things worse, because in a weird way,

1027
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:11,962
it was bad that they were connecting emotionally

1028
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:15,264
with the material, from a purely numbers standpoint,

1029
00:43:15,264 --> 00:43:15,764
I guess, so.

1030
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:19,647
If you did this only twice in the game,

1031
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:21,268
you lost four points from the system.

1032
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:23,289
Because every time you hit the ceiling, you lose a point,

1033
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,751
but then it takes another chapter to get that point back.

1034
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:27,091
So if you do that twice,

1035
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:28,512
you can only get up to 20 instead of 24.

1036
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:31,995
And if you see there, with only 20 points in the system,

1037
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:34,136
one character still gets a bad ending.

1038
00:43:34,136 --> 00:43:36,117
So this is a huge bummer,

1039
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:38,639
because players often played the game well,

1040
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,200
and yet they still ended up with one character

1041
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,562
who had an unhappy ending, which was never my intent.

1042
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:44,723
And in fact,

1043
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:50,131
The game had kind of gotten back to where I was sending this unintentional message

1044
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:56,457
that is not what I wanted to say about life, but unfortunately, this is one that I did not realize until after the game was released.

1045
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:59,020
So I started seeing reviews and getting feedback from players saying that

1046
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,324
there's no way to have a happy ending, someone's always let down, it's this depressing thing,

1047
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:06,266
and I was confused. I was like, what are you talking about? You can make everybody happy.

1048
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:10,771
I built the game that way. It's supposed to work that way. Why are you guys playing it wrong?

1049
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:12,752
Which of course is idiotic on my part.

1050
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:15,473
But in the end I realized I had left this glitch,

1051
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:16,614
essentially a glitch in the system,

1052
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,995
that made it possible to play the game well,

1053
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:21,457
and yet have the game send the exact message

1054
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:22,717
that I had tried to avoid.

1055
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:23,798
And the hell of it is,

1056
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:25,699
it wouldn't have even been that hard to fix.

1057
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,280
Like it's, it's a very small thing,

1058
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,581
but I just didn't understand the scope of the problem

1059
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:30,702
until after it was released.

1060
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:32,383
Like I sort of, I knew it could happen,

1061
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,523
but I was like, oh yeah, but...

1062
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,485
if you just get to nine, just don't pick that one again.

1063
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:38,087
But then, that was because I was sitting here thinking

1064
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:40,049
as the person who understands the system,

1065
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:42,952
as opposed to a player who none of this is exposed to.

1066
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:45,754
And I had sort of assumed a level of familiarity

1067
00:44:45,754 --> 00:44:48,016
that wasn't actually realistic.

1068
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:49,892
That said, I can rationalize this away.

1069
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:55,096
You can argue that that scoring system is actually partially fair, because to get there

1070
00:44:55,096 --> 00:44:58,418
you do have to really zero in on one of those relationships for like three chapters in a

1071
00:44:58,418 --> 00:44:58,578
row.

1072
00:44:58,578 --> 00:45:02,641
And if you do that, you are kind of neglecting the other people, and maybe you do get what

1073
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,721
you asked for.

1074
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:07,544
And so maybe that mitigates some of the problem, even though ultimately I do think that's still

1075
00:45:07,544 --> 00:45:08,084
a flaw in the game.

1076
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:13,788
So in the end, the mistake there was just assuming that players had knowledge of the

1077
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:17,610
systems that they didn't, and that they understood it to agree that they had no way of understanding

1078
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:17,650
it.

1079
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:22,287
bad on my part. And so, despite, you know, going

1080
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,948
to great lengths to, to hide the scoring and

1081
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:28,190
making it analog, that actually worked against me.

1082
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,093
So that's a bummer. But, frankly, the more I

1083
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:34,014
think about it, cause this is something that really

1084
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:37,796
I've only been like experienced with the game since

1085
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:38,697
it came out. I think if given the choice,

1086
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:41,138
I would rather err on the side of having

1087
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,119
choices be a little more difficult and having the

1088
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,601
consequences being a little harsher.

1089
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:49,984
Because frankly, I don't want it to be too easy to get a happy ending.

1090
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:53,988
Because meaningful choices are the root of memorable experiences for the players.

1091
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:57,070
And if they're a little too harsh, that, you know, I wish they weren't like that.

1092
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,772
But that might make players think more about those choices,

1093
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:03,475
and put a little more thought into it, and connect with it a little more.

1094
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:04,716
And in life, it's hard to have it all.

1095
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:08,239
And sometimes there is a system that works against you in ways that you don't even know.

1096
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,522
So I've kind of halfway talked myself into this bug

1097
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:14,984
being a subconsciously intentional feature and not a bug.

1098
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:16,625
But it's a book.

1099
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:20,126
But the more I tell myself that, the more I'll say it

1100
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:21,686
was my authorial intent.

1101
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:24,027
And you guys just don't understand my

1102
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:26,507
brilliance and all that.

1103
00:46:26,507 --> 00:46:30,048
So anyway, I want to finish with a couple other lessons

1104
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:32,709
and conclusions that I got from working on the game.

1105
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:36,429
Creating a dynamic narrative is really, really, really hard.

1106
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,710
I thought it would be hard when I set out, and it was

1107
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,890
even harder than I expected.

1108
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:46,380
Because it's really, really difficult to take away some fundamental assumptions about how game stories are authored,

1109
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,666
and then work backwards so that the player still perceives it as the same type of narrative they're used to getting.

1110
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:55,851
Because players don't give a crap how it works. They just want to have a good story and a good experience.

1111
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:58,874
So it's on you to try to make as much of that happen as possible.

1112
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:03,159
while still doing all your weird aspirational stuff under the hood to try to make a different

1113
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,365
type of game. So it was very, very difficult. And I felt like I was constantly battling uphill to

1114
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:12,451
take these under the hood simulations and really feed them back to the player and

1115
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:17,037
construct a story out of it instead of it just being this idea of system soup.

1116
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:19,460
It also doesn't save much work.

1117
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,342
I had this naive idea when I started

1118
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:24,306
that since it was rooted in simulation character relationships,

1119
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:27,330
there would actually be less work than authoring, you know,

1120
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,894
even a branching story, even a linear story,

1121
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:31,836
because I was like, well, you know, I can take a lot of,

1122
00:47:31,836 --> 00:47:33,519
you know, advantages of, you know,

1123
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,341
procedural stuff and systemic stuff, but...

1124
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:38,749
The way that I built my story, I had to account

1125
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:40,770
for all of the outcomes in all of the chapters.

1126
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,390
So every chapter, I had to have Dan's good, middle,

1127
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,371
and bad outcome, and Linda's good, middle, and bad,

1128
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:47,551
and Tommy's good, middle, and bad.

1129
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:50,052
And with Linda and Tommy, when they speak up for each other,

1130
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:51,572
I actually had to have their conditional ones, too.

1131
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,232
So they had five outcomes per chapter.

1132
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:55,813
So I had to build 13 outcomes for nine chapters.

1133
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:59,734
And so it didn't really actually save any amount of time.

1134
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:01,914
And I bet it was a wash compared to doing this

1135
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:03,295
as a traditional branching story.

1136
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:05,835
I do think it has other advantages.

1137
00:48:05,835 --> 00:48:06,015
But.

1138
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:09,959
But it definitely didn't save me the kind of

1139
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:11,401
work that I, that I thought it did.

1140
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:13,844
And this last one's important too.

1141
00:48:13,844 --> 00:48:16,807
The feedback burden is really, really, really high with

1142
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:17,828
this kind of thing.

1143
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,752
When a game has a non-standard narrative loop,

1144
00:48:21,752 --> 00:48:23,574
and when the story reacts to player choices

1145
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:24,815
based on these personal values,

1146
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:26,898
you have to use every possible channel

1147
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:28,400
to tell the player what's going on.

1148
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,102
This was a battle that I had

1149
00:48:30,102 --> 00:48:32,244
constantly throughout development,

1150
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:34,247
and every build, you know, the first build I sent out,

1151
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:35,929
people were like, I literally don't know what's happening.

1152
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:37,431
I do not know what's going on with this game.

1153
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:38,071
I can't figure it out.

1154
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:39,032
It's a confusing mess.

1155
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:45,716
And so I added one set of things, and the next set of things, and I added the act breaks, and then I added, um, memory stuff.

1156
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:53,259
And then, like, I, I constantly was sort of backfilling to try to create enough feedback so players would even just literally understand the game itself.

1157
00:48:53,259 --> 00:48:57,521
Um, you know, when, when you're doing a, an authored plot, even a branching one...

1158
00:48:58,029 --> 00:48:59,770
you can control what the player sees and when.

1159
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,850
You can guarantee they're gonna get to this point

1160
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,411
and get this piece of narrative information.

1161
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:06,572
But when you're trying to build this out of a simulation

1162
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:07,432
like I was trying to do,

1163
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:09,392
you can't take a lot of stuff for granted

1164
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:11,073
and you can't really funnel the player too much.

1165
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,954
So you have to just basically take advantage

1166
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,374
of every channel you can to try to get your point

1167
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,475
across to the player.

1168
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:19,315
And you basically have to scrap and claw

1169
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:21,336
for every piece of feedback that you can find.

1170
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,156
So I tried to litter it all over the game

1171
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,277
and it took a lot of work to get there.

1172
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,984
But the last point is, I think it was all worth it.

1173
00:49:28,984 --> 00:49:30,867
I don't regret building the game this way.

1174
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,891
Players got really invested with the subject matter,

1175
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:37,036
and they had really, really personal experiences with it.

1176
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,901
I know it sounds like a cliche, but a lot of game reviewers

1177
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:44,742
talk about how the game made them cry multiple times.

1178
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:46,862
I get emails from players sharing

1179
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,763
their personal experiences with the game and people

1180
00:49:49,763 --> 00:49:52,803
who have reconciled with their partners over playing the game

1181
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:54,984
and making them think about how they treat other people.

1182
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:57,844
I've had people reconsider how they interact with their families

1183
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:00,365
and change their behavior based on seeing

1184
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,785
how their choices affect others.

1185
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:04,967
And so that really means a lot to me.

1186
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:07,710
And I think that those emotional responses from people

1187
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,232
really come from the fact that when you give players

1188
00:50:10,232 --> 00:50:12,354
the ability to put their own values and choices

1189
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:14,897
into a story in a real way, I think they recognize that

1190
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:16,518
and they value it and they understand it.

1191
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:19,581
And when they get that kind of personal experience,

1192
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:20,962
they know it's not something that can come

1193
00:50:20,962 --> 00:50:21,703
from another medium.

1194
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:23,325
And that really means a lot to players.

1195
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:24,706
And so I think this is really something

1196
00:50:24,706 --> 00:50:25,407
that's worth pursuing.

1197
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:29,568
And finally, I just think it's important to take risks

1198
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,109
and try to find new ways of doing things.

1199
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:33,390
Like, my game certainly is not perfect,

1200
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,471
but my hope is that people will take some inspiration from it

1201
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:41,533
and learn maybe, even if you just learned one thing from it,

1202
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:44,234
it would be cool, you know, to see people take some of this stuff further

1203
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:47,855
and continue to take games into places that only games can go,

1204
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:49,255
because it's important to take risks,

1205
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,716
even if they don't work out the way you thought.

1206
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:52,677
You can still learn a lot,

1207
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:55,618
and I learned a lot over making, over the course of this game.

1208
00:50:55,618 --> 00:50:55,658
So...

1209
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,540
You know, in the end, I'm glad I made it,

1210
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,541
and I'm very proud of it, and I hope that, uh,

1211
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:02,404
what I learned in making it will be helpful to you all as well.

1212
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,405
So thank you very much. -♪

1213
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:13,274
And I don't kno-

1214
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:14,715
I don't know if we have time for Q&A

1215
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:17,457
or if anybody has questions, but it's, you know, five o'-

1216
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,819
Oh, look. Who are you now?

1217
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:20,780
My name's Clint.

1218
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:30,406
I have one question. With regards to the compromise system, to build on your example, you know,

1219
00:51:30,406 --> 00:51:34,409
Chevy Chase has to like, I forget his name in the movies, but whatever, he has to like

1220
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,753
learn to better empathize with the people in his family and learn to see why they're

1221
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:45,016
upset or why they're not getting along with each other and he has to improve himself by

1222
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:48,199
examining himself and changing his behavior.

1223
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:53,516
working harder I think as you put it in order to fix those things and get a happy outcome.

1224
00:51:53,516 --> 00:52:02,719
In the novelist, Dan doesn't go through that process. You go through that process as a player

1225
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:08,040
but then the way you work harder is instead of by trying to be more empathetic or trying to

1226
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,380
help people with

1227
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,625
their challenge is you do it by sneaking from light bulbs and trying to not be seen and

1228
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:19,068
trying to dig down an exploration like tree to find hidden puzzle pieces. So do you think

1229
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:24,792
that there's something dissonant there or something that could be better developed in

1230
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:29,356
order to put what the player is doing when he's bringing his relationship management

1231
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:32,758
skills to bear in line with the skills he's actually leveraging as a player?

1232
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,191
I think that's a good point.

1233
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:37,973
The one thing that I would say does mirror that process

1234
00:52:37,973 --> 00:52:40,554
a little bit is the fact that you don't have to find

1235
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:42,115
everybody's clues to go through the game.

1236
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:43,776
You can, if you show up in a chapter and be like,

1237
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:44,917
oh man, I just want to do what Dan wants,

1238
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:48,319
you can just mainline his clue chain and go straight ahead.

1239
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,080
So if you decide that you want to empathize

1240
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,161
with those other people, you have to go through the steps

1241
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:53,221
of finding out everything about them.

1242
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:54,882
So you actually have to discover what they want.

1243
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:55,963
You don't just get it handed to you.

1244
00:52:55,963 --> 00:53:00,205
So I think that mirrors it some.

1245
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:01,826
And so, but that's probably.

1246
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,871
fairly metaphorical within the game like I don't know how to

1247
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:07,923
make Dan have an empathy process.

1248
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:09,764
But I do think that as a player,

1249
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:11,886
recognizing that you have this ability,

1250
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:15,749
and then having to do that extra work,

1251
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:17,050
and say, OK, not only do I feel bad

1252
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:18,811
about what happened to Linda last chapter,

1253
00:53:18,811 --> 00:53:19,432
I'm gonna really do the work

1254
00:53:19,432 --> 00:53:21,033
to find out what she wants this chapter.

1255
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,654
I think that mirrors some of that.

1256
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:24,216
But one of the weirdest things that I notice

1257
00:53:24,216 --> 00:53:25,977
is that watching people play,

1258
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:27,638
some people will earn a compromise

1259
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:29,320
and then not use them, which is weird.

1260
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,601
Because I put a lot of training to, like,

1261
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:33,383
remind you that you have them when you can use them,

1262
00:53:33,383 --> 00:53:34,844
and people are like, no, I'm not gonna do that.

1263
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:35,044
And it's like...

1264
00:53:35,205 --> 00:53:38,831
Why don't you understand that you can make people happier?

1265
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:39,091
And I'm like, no.

1266
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,114
It's very, that's a very weird thing.

1267
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:42,437
I don't know how to explain that.

1268
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:44,299
But I do think that that clue discovery process is

1269
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:45,642
some of what you're talking about.

1270
00:53:48,087 --> 00:54:02,733
Hi. I was wondering, after you've tried to create this system and decided to, like, not

1271
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:06,535
going to the authorial route and...

1272
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:28,546
And you know how when you go through, like, putting together a story where the main character really changes and has his weaknesses and goes through, like, many things to, like, have the final change, his final decision, that's very difficult to put together something that's good, that the audience will watch and will read and they'll have closure at the end.

1273
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:34,390
So, after you've tried the other route, when you see yourself working on your next game,

1274
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:38,270
are you gonna still push for that other route?

1275
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,652
Are you gonna, uh, comp... not compromise,

1276
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:44,933
but, like, try to blend both routes?

1277
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,614
How do you see that for your future games?

1278
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:50,736
Um, so just to be clear, you're contrasting, um,

1279
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:54,497
the more authorial types of linear or branching stories

1280
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:56,938
where you do see the character specifically go through that arc

1281
00:54:56,938 --> 00:55:00,680
versus, um, my... this style, which that doesn't happen,

1282
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,741
is what you're asking?

1283
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:03,862
Um, oh, the thing...

1284
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,298
I have no idea what game I'm going to make next.

1285
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:08,300
It's definitely not going to be nearly as heavy,

1286
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,923
because this is too hard to work on.

1287
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:14,707
But the name, The Novelist, is a little bit...

1288
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,330
And some of the visual metaphors of the game,

1289
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,111
where you see the words come up and be typed out,

1290
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,493
describing what happened,

1291
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:22,855
it's a pretty... It's an almost unveiled,

1292
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,677
not even veiled metaphor for you, the player,

1293
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:27,340
being the person who's going through that process.

1294
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:27,600
And so...

1295
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:29,728
To me it wasn't so much Dan.

1296
00:55:29,728 --> 00:55:34,291
It was never important to me for Dan specifically to go through that process

1297
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:37,233
because the thing I was hoping for and the thing that a lot of players found

1298
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,154
was that they were the ones who that happened to when they went through.

1299
00:55:40,154 --> 00:55:44,017
They came in with one set of assumptions and then when they started seeing the way people reacted to it,

1300
00:55:44,017 --> 00:55:47,199
they actually had to like, oh my God, maybe I should think this way

1301
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,221
or oh my God, I never really realized how strongly I felt about that or whatever.

1302
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,102
So...

1303
00:55:51,922 --> 00:55:55,007
I think that the same process happens just maybe in two different places,

1304
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:58,111
and in this game it's a little bit more personal and more metaphorical

1305
00:55:58,111 --> 00:56:01,876
as opposed to going along for the ride on a linear story,

1306
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:02,998
which can be awesome as well.

1307
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:06,042
But, yeah. Does that answer your question at all?

1308
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:06,362
I mean...

1309
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:09,080
But going forward, I honestly don't know.

1310
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,361
I mean, my bias is always towards this type of thing.

1311
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:13,923
I've just always been a very systemic,

1312
00:56:13,923 --> 00:56:15,463
like, I'm not a writer.

1313
00:56:15,463 --> 00:56:17,084
I came from a systems design background.

1314
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:19,306
I had to learn how to write to make this game.

1315
00:56:19,306 --> 00:56:22,047
Like, so this is not natural to me at all.

1316
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,369
So that's why I did a story from a nerdy,

1317
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:25,229
systemic standpoint.

1318
00:56:25,229 --> 00:56:25,629
Thank you.

1319
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:26,350
You're welcome.

1320
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:52,374
I have a question. I was wondering if you, so in the simulation it seems that in each chapter you have a decision and regardless of whom you pick like the numbers kind of go in the same, well I mean barring compromises, but what I mean is that the weight of the decisions like maybe, did you consider that there could be a decision where if you missed this deadline you might really get screwed for instance, so maybe like the score would fall more than that.

1321
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:58,945
And then at the same time, like, instead of having particular, you know, author chapters,

1322
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:04,915
that it could be sort of like a randomly drawn card event that would define some of these things.

1323
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:18,702
Yes. So to the first question, which is basically about should different chapters have had maybe different or more weighted scoring, I considered that and I thought about doing it with the major chapters, those ActBreak chapters.

1324
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:24,629
But as you see, as I explained, like the dynamic range of the system is actually pretty small.

1325
00:57:24,989 --> 00:57:29,112
And so I was like, you know, if you, like, if I had given you a three-point boost and you were at a seven,

1326
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,994
then all of a sudden you would even bust further out of, out of the system.

1327
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,996
So I ultimately shied away from that.

1328
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:36,418
There's one example, or one exception to that.

1329
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:40,781
The final chapter of the game is structured a little bit differently than the previous eight,

1330
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:42,662
and it actually does have different scoring.

1331
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:47,846
And I actually, the scoring was a little too harsh in the shipping version,

1332
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:52,790
so whenever I did an update in February, I silently made it less harsh.

1333
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,590
So, uh, so yeah, I do do that one time.

1334
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,751
It's the final ending that projects forward in the game.

1335
00:57:57,751 --> 00:58:00,012
So it is something I thought about, but I just,

1336
00:58:00,012 --> 00:58:02,652
I was scared that it would be too disruptive

1337
00:58:02,652 --> 00:58:03,673
during the middle part of the game.

1338
00:58:03,673 --> 00:58:05,353
And then, uh, I've forgotten your second question.

1339
00:58:05,353 --> 00:58:05,893
What was it again?

1340
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,814
The second question is, I suppose,

1341
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:09,634
I could probably answer it.

1342
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:11,575
I imagine that it has to do with authorship,

1343
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,316
like, that you would have had to create a lot more content,

1344
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:16,416
but that for replay value, you could, um,

1345
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,497
there would be an option of, like, each chapter

1346
00:58:18,497 --> 00:58:20,597
could be, like, a randomly drawn situation

1347
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,838
that would define some of these.

1348
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,779
Yeah, I thought about some of that too,

1349
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:26,940
and people suggested that, because the game is very rigid.

1350
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,800
It's a very rigid game.

1351
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,321
You do some stuff and you get a decision.

1352
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:32,382
You do some stuff and you get a decision.

1353
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:34,102
And it's the same process over time.

1354
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:36,703
And that's one of the valid criticisms of the game.

1355
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:39,324
And I thought about trying to do that kind of thing,

1356
00:58:39,324 --> 00:58:41,365
and actually I think that Zach might have suggested

1357
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:42,425
something like that at some point.

1358
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:44,046
I think in some of your feedback,

1359
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:44,686
I'm putting this on you now.

1360
00:58:44,686 --> 00:58:46,807
Do you want to answer this question?

1361
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:50,388
No, but some people suggested that.

1362
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:55,796
I don't even remember why I didn't do it, but I think I was just scared that

1363
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:58,659
I was trying to get away from that process of system soup

1364
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:02,422
and like having really numbersy and really

1365
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:03,963
you know, really tweaky stuff.

1366
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:05,884
I was trying to get away from that and it was very hard

1367
00:59:05,884 --> 00:59:07,866
even with the rigid structure to create a story.

1368
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:10,568
So I was a little worried that doing that kind of

1369
00:59:10,568 --> 00:59:14,171
because that's the stuff that works great in The Sims or other games like that.

1370
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:15,913
But I think it was just more that

1371
00:59:15,913 --> 00:59:17,974
I was trying to do as little of that as possible

1372
00:59:17,974 --> 00:59:19,756
for the sake of it being a narrative

1373
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,057
as opposed to being a little bit more

1374
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:24,478
Oh, I'll, I've, you know, I've got this compromise point in my back pocket.

1375
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,499
I'll just throw it to you or whatever.

1376
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:28,780
So, I just think it didn't fit with this specific game.

1377
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,501
But it's not a bad idea overall.

1378
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:31,801
Thank you.

1379
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:32,122
No problem.

1380
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:33,162
So this is, we have two minutes.

1381
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:35,103
This is apparently the last question.

1382
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:37,084
For all the ghosts that are standing in line.

1383
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,964
I have a comment and a question.

1384
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:41,185
Regarding people who don't take up compromises.

1385
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,119
I did that once when I played through and there was one time...

1386
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:44,799
You monster.

1387
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:45,119
I know.

1388
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:45,400
Well, it...

1389
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,381
Just, I was like, they're...

1390
00:59:47,381 --> 00:59:49,083
I thought, like, you guys are stupid.

1391
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:50,144
I don't want to do that for you.

1392
00:59:50,144 --> 00:59:50,624
It's just...

1393
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:51,044
I don't know.

1394
00:59:51,044 --> 00:59:54,127
Well, that's your experience and that's fine.

1395
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:55,968
Yeah, I'm not, you know, I'm not criticizing you, of course.

1396
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,250
I'm just saying, like, that was my experience when I was playing once in a while.

1397
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,912
I was just like, why do you want that?

1398
00:59:59,912 --> 01:00:00,052
No, no.

1399
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:01,213
You know, so that happened to work.

1400
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:01,933
That's good.

1401
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:02,854
You made your own decision.

1402
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:03,495
That's great.

1403
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:04,896
I was getting into it, right?

1404
01:00:04,896 --> 01:00:06,817
I was getting emotionally invested.

1405
01:00:06,817 --> 01:00:07,658
So, yeah, it's a compliment.

1406
01:00:07,658 --> 01:00:08,639
Not a bad thing.

1407
01:00:08,879 --> 01:00:11,381
But that's an answer to why that might happen.

1408
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:11,782
Oh, awesome.

1409
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:12,822
That was what happened for me.

1410
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:15,084
The question I have for you is a little bit broad.

1411
01:00:15,084 --> 01:00:16,646
I was curious if you were, I know

1412
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,147
you said you wanted to back away from something

1413
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,328
like this for your next game.

1414
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,989
But if you were to explore what would

1415
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,812
be the next step in dynamic narrative, what would

1416
01:00:23,812 --> 01:00:24,552
you kind of try to poke at?

1417
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:30,337
Well, I would try to find something that was a little less

1418
01:00:30,337 --> 01:00:31,318
rigid structurally.

1419
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:33,980
And some of that, one minute.

1420
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,461
And some of that might be.

1421
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,488
Man, one minute I just drew a blank. I had a good point too.

1422
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:43,190
So some of that could just be relaxing the structure of the game.

1423
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,731
Obviously fixing some of the issues with the dynamic range of the game.

1424
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:50,032
I would also want to have a little bit more change in the game.

1425
01:00:50,032 --> 01:00:52,513
Like one of the Nox's, like, the game takes place in one house for the whole summer.

1426
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:53,434
So that gets really boring.

1427
01:00:53,434 --> 01:00:56,355
So I think you could do interesting stuff if you put them in different situations.

1428
01:00:56,355 --> 01:01:00,196
Or if you had a scenario where someone's out of town and there's only two characters there.

1429
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:02,917
And you kind of have a little bit more variation to the experience.

1430
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:02,977
But...

1431
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:08,237
Overall, I think I would, I think I would just keep playtesting.

1432
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:12,259
And I'm a big iterative person, so I would probably just keep playtesting

1433
01:01:12,259 --> 01:01:15,520
and trying to find different little bugs and quirks with the system

1434
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,482
and try to open it up more and make it a little more,

1435
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,243
I don't know, a little less rigid, I think, would be a good thing.

1436
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:21,763
So, yeah. I think that's it.

1437
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:23,083
Zero minutes? All right.

1438
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:29,066
Thank you very much for coming.
