1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,792
Okay, it's 3 p.m. now, so I guess we'll just go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,915
So welcome to Level Design with Impossible Geometry.

3
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,458
Oh, and before we continue, if you have cell phones or sound-making devices,

4
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,980
it'd be great if you could turn them off now.

5
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:30,749
So my talk is level design with impossible geometry. My name is

6
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,870
William Cheer. I am an independent game developer based

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,891
in Chicago. A bit about myself. My background is in physics.

8
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,232
That's what I studied in school. And as a student I worked

9
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:45,353
briefly at the national institute of nuclear physics in

10
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:45,693
Italy.

11
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:50,238
in a linear accelerator lab just outside of Padua,

12
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:51,259
which is close to Venice.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,641
That's a picture of me.

14
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,744
That's actually not what my office looked like.

15
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:56,526
I was just in front of a computer,

16
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:57,788
but that's not as exciting.

17
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:01,926
After school, I actually, instead of going to physics,

18
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:04,947
I went into installation art and did that

19
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:05,928
for about four years.

20
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:08,489
So they were primarily large-scale installations

21
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:12,571
made out of balloons commissioned by art centers

22
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,692
and science museums.

23
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,373
And I did that for about four years

24
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:18,935
and basically became typecast as the balloon guy.

25
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:20,989
which I didn't want to do.

26
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,730
And I actually didn't play games before I

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,111
started my current project.

28
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,012
And I was looking for another medium.

29
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,932
I tried glassblowing and metalworking.

30
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,613
And none of them really worked out well.

31
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,133
And games, because I knew some programming,

32
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:36,994
I knew a bit of design, I thought

33
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,134
it'd be a really good medium.

34
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,455
So I started on a project to learn Unity.

35
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:42,736
I thought it would take three months.

36
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,796
It's been 3 and 1⁄2 years, and here I am.

37
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,477
So the project is called Manifold Garden.

38
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:53,219
What is Manifold Garden? It is a game. It's a first-person

39
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:59,529
exploration puzzle game. It has unusual physics, impossible

40
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,173
geometry, and crazy architecture.

41
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,688
These are screenshots from the game.

42
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:10,872
So the game, I see it as a, those are kind of like the key

43
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:14,855
features, and I see the game as a metaphor for the last 400

44
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:15,937
years of physics.

45
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:18,339
Because at the beginning of the game, you are learning how

46
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,080
gravity works.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,203
It's different from gravity in the normal world.

48
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:26,587
And by the end of it, you get an understanding of the shape

49
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,208
of the universe.

50
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:35,547
inside a room working with rear gravity to, oh, this is how the

51
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:39,729
space folds upon itself. So the key features of the game,

52
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,430
there's a lot of stuff going on in the game, but the two key

53
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,311
features I'm going to focus on for the purpose of this talk are

54
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,612
the traversal mechanic, which is gravity shifting, and the

55
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:51,574
geometry, which is 3D world wrapping. So let's talk about

56
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:52,694
the gravity shifting mechanic.

57
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:56,605
I'm sure many of you have seen this film inception and this is

58
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:59,807
a scene in the film that takes place in the dream world and

59
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:04,009
they take Paris and fold it upon itself, fold it in half. And

60
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,710
then later we see these two characters start walking up the

61
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,112
wall. And when I saw this scene, I immediately had a ton of

62
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,993
questions. I was like, okay, let's say Leo is carrying his

63
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,074
wallet and he drops it.

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,735
does it fall in the direction of the surface he's currently

65
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:21,196
walking on now, which is the blue arrow, or does it fall in

66
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,657
the direction of the surface he was previously on? How does his

67
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:28,858
wallet know which gravity field it now belongs to? And what if

68
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,639
I'm standing on the previous surface he was on and I take

69
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,360
his wallet, does it still fall in the direction of the blue

70
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,221
arrow or does it transfer onto my gravity field? The film,

71
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,321
unfortunately, doesn't...

72
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:43,103
address these issues, these very important issues, but that's

73
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:48,906
where I thought a game would be a very great medium to explore

74
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:52,888
this. Now, inception takes a lot of visuals from M.C. Escher's

75
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,269
work and that scene specifically is based on relativity. And

76
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:59,991
originally Manifold Garden was called relativity. So let me

77
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,891
tell you a bit about how

78
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,465
that gravity shifting mechanic works in the game. So we're

79
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,447
going to start with a 2D example. Basically, say we've

80
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,408
got four surfaces. Each one of them has a different color,

81
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,190
blue, red, green, yellow. And all objects in the world belong

82
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,632
to one of these four colors and they fall in the direction of

83
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:20,934
the wall. So a blue object falls in the direction of the blue

84
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:23,615
wall. A red object falls up in the direction of the red wall.

85
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,757
Green falls to the right. Yellow falls to the left. Or the other

86
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:29,238
way around. I'm looking at my computer screen. So

87
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,083
Now, not all of these gravity fields are on at the same time.

88
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,187
And which one is on depends on the player orientation.

89
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:39,089
So right now, the player is oriented this way.

90
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,891
The blue gravity field is on, and all the other gravities

91
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:42,351
are off.

92
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,993
So those objects are frozen.

93
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,695
And then the player can walk up to the yellow wall,

94
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,857
then the yellow gravity is on, and all the other ones

95
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:49,518
are frozen.

96
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,519
and so on and so forth.

97
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,540
This is, now the game is in first person,

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,461
so this is what it looked like.

99
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,542
You can see the characters walking forward,

100
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:01,984
they switch gravity, and whichever direction is down,

101
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:03,284
that surface becomes colored.

102
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,005
So the color helps the player orient,

103
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,366
and it also lets them know which gravity field they're in.

104
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,223
so that's the traversal mechanic. Now we're going to

105
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:13,665
talk about the geometry which is 3D world wrapping. So

106
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:17,428
eventually you start off in the game inside and eventually you

107
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:20,250
make it outside. And when you fall off, instead of fading the

108
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,375
screen to black or killing the player and respawning them, the

109
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,317
world actually just repeats itself infinitely. So you could

110
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,679
be, you could just keep falling forever. You do have air

111
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,381
control. So this is what it looks like in one of the levels

112
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,604
and here's another level where this is happening.

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,550
And we'll come back to this.

114
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,131
But first, the title, Level Design with Impossible

115
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:42,631
Geometry.

116
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,771
What is impossible geometry?

117
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,772
So for the purpose of this talk, we're just going to say

118
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:50,733
impossible geometry is any weird geometry that we don't

119
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,713
see in real life.

120
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,174
It is very hard to generalize.

121
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:59,515
And also, this talk is not supposed to be the guide to

122
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:00,855
working with impossible geometry.

123
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:05,356
the stuff I'm talking about, they deal very specifically

124
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,898
with the way the mechanics are implemented in manifold garden.

125
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,399
So I just want to give you guys a taste of what it's like

126
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,601
working with it, some of the problems and challenges I face

127
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,423
and some of the techniques that I found to be useful. But you

128
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:19,725
might, you know, your mileage may vary. One thing I want to

129
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:22,928
clear up is that impossible geometry is not non-Euclidean

130
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,769
geometry. I see non-Euclidean geometry kind of thrown around a

131
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,272
lot every time people see anything weird. And that's not

132
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:29,852
always the case.

133
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,154
So what is Euclidean geometry?

134
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:34,796
Euclidean geometry is just flat space.

135
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,660
So that's kind of space as we perceive it on the human scale.

136
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,482
Some of the properties are that the shortest distance between

137
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,343
two points is a line.

138
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,106
The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180.

139
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,569
And parallel lines don't intersect.

140
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,253
And non-Euclidean geometry is just everything else.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,021
So you can have hyperbolic elliptic,

142
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,002
but it's also not that unusual.

143
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:01,484
So the surface of a sphere is actually non-Euclidean.

144
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:03,185
And if you were to draw a triangle

145
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:03,985
on the surface of a sphere,

146
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,026
you would find that the angles don't add up to be 180.

147
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:09,849
And a good example of this is the surface of the Earth.

148
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,230
Now, if you were to draw a triangle on the floor right now,

149
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,191
the angles would add up to be 180.

150
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:17,513
But if you were to draw a triangle the size of a continent,

151
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,754
then the non-Euclidean properties start to show.

152
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,837
So now we're going to transition to start talking about world

153
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,281
wrapping and we'll start with 2D world wrapping. So you guys

154
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,505
probably all know asteroids, right? You're shooting asteroids

155
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,270
with a spaceship and when you get to the bottom side of the

156
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,274
screen, you're teleported to the top side and if you hit the

157
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:39,856
right side, then you're teleported to the left.

158
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:44,999
So this is actually a two-tour, so it's on the surface of this

159
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,220
and I'm going to come back and explain what I mean by this in

160
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,221
a bit. Here's an example. We see the spaceship go up, comes

161
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:55,502
back down from below. So now what we want to do is we

162
00:07:55,562 --> 00:08:00,004
actually want to make that path seamless. So we want to connect

163
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,925
the top and the bottom and the right and the left. So what

164
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:06,086
we're going to do here is we'll start up and we'll take the top

165
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,846
and the bottom sides and we'll glue them together.

166
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,795
And then what we'll do is we'll take the right and the left sides and we'll glue them together.

167
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,030
So here on the right, you can see that's happening.

168
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,851
So first we're gonna glue the top and the right side

169
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,173
so that we form a connected loop.

170
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,335
So you can see now why the ship is looping

171
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:23,936
in that direction, and then we'll glue it

172
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,157
in the left and the right side.

173
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:28,079
So now we get the shape, basically a donut,

174
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,281
and the ship is on the surface of it.

175
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:35,544
So we can see that it consists of two loops

176
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,205
in two different directions,

177
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,906
and that's how you get 2D world wrapping.

178
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,273
But we need to go deeper.

179
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,715
We're going to talk about 3D world wrapping.

180
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,017
So I explained here how by connecting the top and the

181
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:51,280
bottom sides, and the left and the right sides, this 2D

182
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,421
surface is really the same as this 2-torus.

183
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:55,423
But how do we work with a 3-torus?

184
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:58,725
So to start with a 3-torus, it's 3D, so we're actually

185
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:01,047
going to start with a box instead of a surface.

186
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,188
And in this case, what we're going to do is we're going to

187
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,350
take the top and the bottom faces, and we're going to glue

188
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,830
them together.

189
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,778
and we're gonna take the left and the right faces

190
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,099
and we'll glue them together.

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,662
And then we'll take the front and the back faces

192
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,622
and we'll glue them together.

193
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,285
How do we visualize this?

194
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,007
I don't know, it's actually, it's very hard

195
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:20,088
because it's in 4D.

196
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:24,091
But one good analogy I found is that in 2D world wrapping,

197
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,914
you are a 2D character stuck on the 2D surface

198
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:29,716
of a 3D donut, and in 3D world wrapping,

199
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,359
you are a 3D character on the 3D surface of a 4D donut.

200
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:36,675
So while it's hard to visualize the structure,

201
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,137
the 4D donut, we can visualize what it's like

202
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:41,618
to be inside the surface.

203
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,320
So let's say the Earth, we have the Earth,

204
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,602
and it's in flat Euclidean geometry.

205
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:47,903
This is what it would look like.

206
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:48,984
Now if we were to put it,

207
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,706
we've already added 3D world wrapping to this,

208
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:52,747
this is what it's gonna look like,

209
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:54,408
because the light rays are gonna loop back around.

210
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,310
So you'll see repetitions of the Earth,

211
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,932
they're all the same ones, continued infinitely.

212
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,033
And here's a version with the grid,

213
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,455
so you can see the partitions.

214
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,600
Now this is a screenshot from the game. You can see this is what it looks like.

215
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:15,330
Here is another version where the distance between the instances is zero.

216
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,733
So it just looks like one continuous building.

217
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,677
And here's what it looks like when you're falling through it in motion.

218
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:24,521
So you can see that the level just keeps repeating itself.

219
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,867
Now this leads to some very interesting physical

220
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,149
properties. For example, let's take a box and we'll drop it

221
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,110
off the ledge. Now you'll actually see that box come down

222
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,932
from above because it loops back around. And the box is now

223
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:43,635
simultaneously beneath you and above you. A lot of games have

224
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:47,637
waterfalls. This is my drawing of a waterfall. The direction

225
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,118
it goes forward and then it falls off. In our game, in

226
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,519
Manifold Garden, there actually isn't waterfalls. There's water

227
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,960
loops because that water comes back down from above.

228
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,492
Here's a screenshot of a water loop in action.

229
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,515
So you can see it basically forms one continuous strip.

230
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,139
Now a really fantastic book if you're interested

231
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,701
in this subject is The Shape of Space by Jeffrey R Weeks.

232
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,043
I actually have a copy of it, so if after the talk

233
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,104
you want to come and check it out.

234
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,746
It's written, it's like an advanced book,

235
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,548
but written for the layperson, and it really talks

236
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:17,709
about how to visualize this stuff.

237
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,175
He also has a website, geometrygames.org,

238
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,237
which has a bunch of small games to help you visualize

239
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,658
this kind of geometry.

240
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,239
There's kind of 2D examples and 3D examples as well.

241
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,801
OK, so how did 3D wall wrapping get added to Manifold Garden?

242
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:39,504
Originally, the game was all about the gravity shifting

243
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:39,944
mechanic.

244
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:42,965
It all took place indoors, and all you did was change gravity

245
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,286
and put boxes on buttons and solve puzzles.

246
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,422
the problem though was it's very hard in first person games

247
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,943
to get a sense of depth and people were having a hard time

248
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,704
seeing when they dropped the box where it was going to land. So

249
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:57,765
they said why don't you add shadows to the box. So I said

250
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:00,386
okay, I added a directional light so that you can, you know,

251
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:02,627
there are shadows. And then people were asking, well, where

252
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:07,228
is the light coming from? So I said okay, I'll add windows to,

253
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:10,409
you know, provide an explanation for the source of the light. And

254
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,890
as a result of the window, people were able to see the

255
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,310
outside.

256
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,734
This wasn't intentional on my part. I just built a bunch of

257
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:21,195
rooms together in one scene. However, everybody was very

258
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:23,916
excited about what was going on outside and they were asking,

259
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,897
hey, can I go outside? And originally I didn't want the

260
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,537
player to because it would add all this complexity, but

261
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,658
everybody kept asking for it, so I allowed them to go outside.

262
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:35,499
This was also at a time when I introduced the edge detection

263
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:35,819
shader.

264
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,440
Now this of course introduced the problem of players falling

265
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,301
off the world. And the one thing I did not want to do was I

266
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,342
didn't want to add invisible colliders. Because there are

267
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,643
some games that have it and it's very frustrating. You want to

268
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:50,523
explore and it's constantly preventing you from going to

269
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:54,245
places. And I also wanted everything you can see in the

270
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,786
world that you can get to. Because I remember playing Sky

271
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,526
Rim and one of the most magical moments in that game is when you

272
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,367
see a mountain in the distance and then later on you're

273
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,308
actually on that mountain. So...

274
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,421
So I couldn't put anything in the sky, because that meant I'd

275
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,922
have to create additional content.

276
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:15,186
And I got this problem of a very blank sky, which is very

277
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,789
boring, and I added a skybox, and it just looked absolutely

278
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,209
terrible.

279
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,812
However, at some point I realized that by introducing

280
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,154
3D world wrapping, I've sort of solved all those problems,

281
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,796
because now I can have things in the sky, and it's not new

282
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,398
content, and I can allow the player to get there.

283
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,220
And yeah, it's not new content, because it's the

284
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,660
same thing.

285
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,442
So it solves the blank sky problem.

286
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,563
It ensures that everything you can see is still a place that

287
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,183
you can get to.

288
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,005
And it's also just a much more interesting level in general.

289
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:46,686
So these are some of the early screenshots of the game when I

290
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,707
introduced world wrapping.

291
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,007
And this is one of the earliest

292
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,268
implementations in motion.

293
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:55,330
It is very slow here, but you can see.

294
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:59,695
in this case you've got the button, you press it, it drops

295
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:04,778
a box, and then you jump off the ledge. And what you'll notice

296
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:08,040
in this implementation is that the distance between instances

297
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,002
is very large. It's very clear where one instance begins and

298
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:16,925
where another ends. This fall is going to take quite a while,

299
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:22,429
but basically it repeats. So we're going to continue on. Let's

300
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:26,211
just watch it through. Okay, we've landed.

301
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:31,026
Now, when I introduced world wrapping, it created a lot of

302
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:34,148
unexpected solutions to previous problems, which is very nice.

303
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,692
This is an image by M.C. Escher, a cubic space division.

304
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:44,316
And the original inspiration for the game was I wanted to

305
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:47,199
make a game based on M.C. Escher's works, and I wanted to

306
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,220
put this level in the game.

307
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,242
Now, here's an implementation of it in July 2013.

308
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,904
So this was before world wrapping got added.

309
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,082
World wrapping got added about a year and a half into the development.

310
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,546
Now when I made this level without world wrapping it was actually very painful to play so

311
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,869
the game, the level basically consisted of all these lattices that repeated

312
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:07,930
and you

313
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,511
went in and you just had to find an exit. So very simple.

314
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,742
But the problem was, it was very hard to orient yourself

315
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,326
because everything, basically all parts of the level

316
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,728
looked the same, and also if you fell off

317
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,070
the lattice structure, you landed on the floor.

318
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,833
And there was a floor because it took place in a room.

319
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,397
And then it was just like very tedious walk

320
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:30,798
to get back up to a lattice.

321
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,663
Another problem was that in order to make the level look

322
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,966
interesting it had to have a certain scale. But any increase

323
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,649
in scale resulted in an increase in navigational complexity. So

324
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,151
I played it a bit and it just really wasn't fun and I got rid

325
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,673
of it. After I introduced war wrapping all those problems went

326
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,375
away. So this is December 2015.

327
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:59,896
And now you can see the, so one of those boxes is one instance

328
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,318
of it, and you can go to any of those instances.

329
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:02,938
It doesn't matter.

330
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:06,340
So in this case, what happens is it removes,

331
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,941
you do not need to orient yourself.

332
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,442
There is no way, there is literally,

333
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,703
it is literally impossible for the player to get lost

334
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,924
because it doesn't matter which direction you go in,

335
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:17,306
you are stepping away and also towards the objective.

336
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,956
And it also means that I can increase the scale of it.

337
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:23,717
In this case, it's basically infinite.

338
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,939
And it doesn't add any navigational complexity.

339
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,561
In fact, it removes a lot of navigational complexity.

340
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,223
And it's also, again, just a much more interesting level

341
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,844
for the player to experience, because this is not something

342
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:35,864
you see often in games.

343
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:40,507
Here's another example of something that I wanted to put

344
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,008
in the game before, but couldn't.

345
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:43,509
These are Indian step wells.

346
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,450
And I saw these, and I thought, well, wouldn't it be amazing

347
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,491
if these just went on forever?

348
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,356
Once I introduced world wrapping, this was impossible.

349
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:53,097
So in this space, you can keep going down these stairs

350
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,817
or climbing up.

351
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,838
There is an achievement if you get to the bottom.

352
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:57,538
But.

353
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,020
So what is something that's very interesting about this

354
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,841
is that instead of having the world wrapping happen

355
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,281
on a grid, it is actually offset.

356
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:10,122
So this is the basic unit that's repeated.

357
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:11,223
So we have a set of stairs.

358
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,303
Now, if we just have normal world wrapping where

359
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,042
If you go down, if you drop from the bottom right,

360
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,843
you'll come back up down from the bottom left

361
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:21,924
because we have everything on a grid.

362
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:24,825
In this infinite step wheel world,

363
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:26,746
when you drop down from the bottom right,

364
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,247
you actually come back from the upper left.

365
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,988
And the reason why that's happening is because

366
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:32,269
instead of putting everything on a grid,

367
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,469
we've offset them slightly.

368
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,011
Because when you're going down these stairs,

369
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,591
you're not actually going straight down,

370
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,132
you're going down and forward.

371
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,332
And this is what it looks like when you're climbing up.

372
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,854
And then you can, because of the gravity rotation mechanic,

373
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:52,315
you can also choose to just fall down the level from the side.

374
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,076
Now, of course, adding roll wrapping

375
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,877
also introduced a lot of new problems.

376
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:00,258
One of the problems is gating.

377
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,139
Basically, when the player is outside,

378
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,819
the entire level pretty much opens up.

379
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,500
You can go anywhere.

380
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,261
And everyone would say, isn't there,

381
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,762
can't the player just skip all these levels

382
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:10,402
and get to the end?

383
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:11,876
And yeah.

384
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:15,839
So this is, let's talk about the 2D example.

385
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,341
So in this level we want the player to get to the star.

386
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,662
And what we'll do, this is too easy,

387
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:22,303
so we'll put a wall here.

388
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,545
And now maybe the player's gotta go get a key

389
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,767
to open the lock, or they have to learn double jump.

390
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:38,626
When you introduce wall wrapping, though, that wall is no longer a barrier because the player can jump to the right and land back on the other side, or they can jump down and come back down from above.

391
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,331
And the reason why that's happening is because of the repetitions.

392
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:47,383
and now I actually got, so this caused a problem with pacing

393
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,384
for a long time until I played Skyrim, and in Skyrim,

394
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,224
when you are outside, you can get to anywhere on the map,

395
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,085
but then once you go inside a dungeon,

396
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:57,185
it becomes a very linear experience,

397
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,106
so the game is open exploration and linear adventuring.

398
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,187
And I actually took that for my game,

399
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,607
so when you are outside in the space,

400
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:05,587
I allow you to go anywhere.

401
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,468
I just sort of embrace that.

402
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,729
But then there are these islands with puzzles,

403
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,550
and once you get there, then it's a linear path.

404
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,671
And once you're indoor, you can't whirlwrap,

405
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:17,173
so that removes the problem of players skipping areas.

406
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,274
Another problem you'll find is that height and direction

407
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,015
basically become meaningless

408
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:23,896
once you introduce weird geometry.

409
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:28,059
A lot of games will have something like a tower, right?

410
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,320
And you might get a mission that's

411
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,121
meet me at the base of the tower.

412
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:33,479
So let's go back to our 2D example.

413
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,102
If I were to ask you where the star is, you'd say it's near

414
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:39,403
the base of the tower to the left.

415
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:41,765
Once you introduce war wrapping, though, that

416
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,266
direction doesn't really make sense because the star is also

417
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:45,207
to the right of the tower.

418
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,631
And now what if we started to decrease the distance between

419
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:54,354
the instances so that they start touching each other. So now in

420
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,115
this case, base of the tower doesn't make sense because this

421
00:19:57,156 --> 00:20:01,318
tower does not have a base. It's disconnected. This is one

422
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:05,560
implementation of it in manifold garden. And here you can see

423
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,322
this is literally a building without a base.

424
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,992
So once you introduce war wrapping, a lot of things,

425
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:15,734
you know, words like northeast, southwest,

426
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:19,017
up, down, left, right, that we use for directions,

427
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,638
they get tossed out the window.

428
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,101
Now what I found is you want to embrace the problems.

429
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,002
So you want to design with the geometry

430
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:26,843
instead of against it.

431
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:28,725
For example, what works really well is

432
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,566
designing your levels to be radial,

433
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:33,189
thinking of something as inside and then outside

434
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,770
and allowing the players to get there

435
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,852
between these two places from any directions

436
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:37,912
instead of...

437
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,983
This is much better than having something that's just a single

438
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:45,125
direction. I just put directional as a word for this.

439
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,827
Now what I want to talk about now is a number of techniques

440
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:52,988
that I found to have worked well. And these fall under two

441
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:53,568
categories.

442
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,131
The first is macro, which has to deal with the big picture,

443
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,451
the way you organize your level.

444
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,113
And the second is micro, the second group of techniques

445
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,274
is micro, which deal more with moment to moment,

446
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,615
not necessarily when the player is stopping to think,

447
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:08,076
but when they're moving through levels,

448
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,397
how can you help them, how can you help guide them?

449
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:13,879
So in macro, you want to have an iconic party.

450
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,460
The word party is the layout of a building.

451
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,881
I got that from Robert Yang's

452
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:20,782
level design histories talk last year,

453
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,743
which I highly recommend.

454
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:23,844
And you want to have logic to your level.

455
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:27,417
and with micro you want to have intentional architecture and

456
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:30,719
you want to utilize patterns and architectural elements. So let's

457
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,860
talk about the first macro technique, iconic parties. So

458
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,921
these are some examples of architectural parties. You've

459
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,263
got the layout. This is kind of roughly what the building looks

460
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:40,664
like. When you're designing a game based on M.C. Escher's work

461
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:43,046
it's very tempting to kind of overwhelm the player with a lot

462
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:46,107
of staircases and tunnels and weird stuff. And I think that

463
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:48,389
works very well in a print because you kind of want to, you

464
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,890
know, look at it in detail and discover things you didn't see

465
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,270
before.

466
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,379
However, this does not work well in a level.

467
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,921
So this is my very first attempt

468
00:21:58,181 --> 00:21:59,461
at the opening level of the world.

469
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,922
And you can see I was just putting staircases

470
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:01,623
and tunnels everywhere.

471
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:04,184
And it looks and feels very MCS-sure.

472
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,225
This is another example.

473
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,865
But if you were to draw,

474
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:10,087
if you were to ask me what the party of this level is,

475
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:11,508
well, this is what it is.

476
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,248
It's very messy.

477
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:15,610
There's no clear structure to it.

478
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,364
This is the same level now.

479
00:22:18,665 --> 00:22:20,346
And you can see in this case what we have

480
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:23,709
is a central tower surrounded by four islands.

481
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:27,213
And what's really great about this shape

482
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:29,295
is you can see that from any direction.

483
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:31,096
And also with the world wrapping,

484
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:33,839
you can see the repetitions of it in the distance.

485
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,300
So I don't have a mini map in the world.

486
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,844
However, because you can see the repetition of the world,

487
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,010
from where you are, you can, by looking at the other instances,

488
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,771
you can figure out what the current shape,

489
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,832
what the current structure of your world is.

490
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:50,435
And so it helps if you have a very clear design instead

491
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:51,055
of just a mess.

492
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:56,559
So a comparison of how the levels changed.

493
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,142
And these are examples of levels with very clear parity.

494
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:01,683
Like you can see this one, and right away

495
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:04,184
you see that these are stairs that continue on forever.

496
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,699
I see very clearly now this is just the lattice structure.

497
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,121
And you don't have to be simple.

498
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,483
You can get more complex, but you always want to have

499
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,165
this very clear overall design that the player can see

500
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:15,306
and recognize very clearly.

501
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,790
Now the second macro technique is you want to have

502
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,671
logic to your level.

503
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:24,915
Now the opening level of the game consists of a series

504
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:27,698
of four rooms indoors to teach the player the mechanics

505
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:28,659
and then they go outside.

506
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,113
And when I was play testing, there are people that are

507
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,833
really good at puzzle games, and there are people that are

508
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:34,753
not so good at puzzle games.

509
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:37,314
And the people that are good at it would finish those four

510
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,774
levels in about 10 minutes.

511
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,795
And others might struggle and take about 30 to 40 minutes.

512
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,516
However, when they got outside, and the outside

513
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,636
consisted of two rooms that they had to find, there was no

514
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:49,917
consistency in how long it took people to

515
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:50,937
find those two rooms.

516
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:53,758
Some people would blast through the first four puzzles,

517
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:55,918
and then they'd get outside and stumble for 30 minutes

518
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:56,778
until they found a room.

519
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:58,879
And some people might struggle for 40 minutes.

520
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,041
with the indoor puzzles and then they get outside and come across the room right away.

521
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,242
And this is because there was no logic to the way those two rooms were placed.

522
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:07,362
They were basically random.

523
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:12,265
So, it was basically a matter of luck in which how you found these.

524
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,446
And they were also a lot of like based on sight lines.

525
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:17,547
So, for example, you know, this is what you saw when you first came out

526
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:18,768
and there's a door at the very end.

527
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:22,709
and you basically had to get the box and go to the door.

528
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,211
And if you didn't do that, if you kind of turned around

529
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:27,652
or jumped off or changed gravity, you lost sight of it

530
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,333
and there was no way to figure out,

531
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:31,214
use logic to figure out how to get back.

532
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:34,555
With the current level now,

533
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:35,936
there is a very clear sense of logic.

534
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:37,757
You have this tower and then the puzzles,

535
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,278
there are four islands with puzzles in them.

536
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:42,199
And so you go to one, you solve it,

537
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,480
and you turn on a laser beam and then you can come back.

538
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:48,099
So the way the level is laid out,

539
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,461
once you solve one puzzle,

540
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,983
you can figure out where the next ones are.

541
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,386
So as you can see, this is kind of the center tower,

542
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:56,909
and just from where the laser beams are pointed,

543
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,631
you can deduce, okay, in this case,

544
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,173
I finished the blue and the red islands,

545
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:02,596
and there are these two other ones that are still missing.

546
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:07,953
So having a logic to your level is very important. Now we're

547
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,754
going to talk about the micro techniques which are not

548
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,036
dealing with the big picture but with moment to moment as the

549
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:15,097
player is navigating through the world how can you help to guide

550
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:20,440
them to the right places. Okay. So we're going to go back to

551
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,284
this opening level and one of the last things I changed is

552
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:29,425
this one piece of architecture at the very edge of the island.

553
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,127
So it used to be just this block and I changed it to a bunch of

554
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,448
stairs and with a platform at the end.

555
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:40,997
And the idea for this was because you're on that central

556
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,078
tower and I need you to get to the blue island where the

557
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:46,939
puzzle is, in this case the star. And in order to do that,

558
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:51,500
I needed the player to rotate gravity to get there. You had

559
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,081
to jump. So you can see this is it with the block. And the

560
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:58,202
problem with this was it was not very clear what it was doing.

561
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:02,563
So this is the thinking. I was thinking you'd walk up to this

562
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:03,063
block.

563
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,473
and you would rotate onto it, change gravity, and then you

564
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,215
jump off onto the island below. If you played Assassin's Creed,

565
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,897
it's sort of like those little things where you jump off into

566
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:18,880
the pile of hay. However, what happened was a lot of people

567
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,502
just kind of walk up to this and look around and then walk away.

568
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,544
And the problem is that this piece of architecture does not

569
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,906
communicate its intention. It's just this block. It's not

570
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,046
telling you what to do with it.

571
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,048
However, what I did was I changed it to a set of stairs

572
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,149
with this platform at the end, and now everybody,

573
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:37,670
like it becomes very clear, oh, I see the stairs,

574
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,850
I'm supposed to walk up them,

575
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,310
and then when you walk up the stairs,

576
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,371
then you rotate to the platform,

577
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,031
and then right away you see the island below.

578
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:47,012
So the difference between the block and the stairs

579
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,753
is that this tells you how to use it, how to walk on it.

580
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:53,354
The second micro technique is you want to utilize

581
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,514
patterns in architecture.

582
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,790
So this is what hallways used to look like in the game.

583
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,531
And this had a lot of problems.

584
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,992
Basically, because you can change gravity, we have

585
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,352
hallways that also bend upwards.

586
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:06,554
The problem is, in a lot of first-person games, a lot of

587
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:07,534
people don't tend to look up.

588
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:10,475
So players would come to this, and then they'd turn around

589
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,296
thinking it was a dead end.

590
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:13,216
So that was one problem.

591
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:16,058
And another problem was, if you started going backwards,

592
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,438
the hallway looked exactly the same.

593
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,051
And that happens a lot because of the gravity changing

594
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:20,471
mechanic.

595
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:21,651
It's very easy to get turned around.

596
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:23,232
So a lot of people would backtrack

597
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:24,492
through an entire hallway until they

598
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,113
got to the room they were in previously,

599
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:27,894
and then be like, wait a minute.

600
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,054
This is not where I wanted to go.

601
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:33,215
So when I started adding windows in the game,

602
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:36,576
I would put windows and hallway to be equal in length,

603
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,017
directly opposite one another.

604
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,638
And I showed this level to Brandon Chung,

605
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:44,299
who is the creator of 30 Flights of Loving,

606
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:47,480
and also talked about wayfinding in levels.

607
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:52,464
last year here and I recommend that talk highly as well.

608
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:54,845
And he suggested taking one of the windows

609
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:57,186
and sliding it down, offsetting it so that it's like this.

610
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,927
So you can see it, you know,

611
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,408
it touches the end of the hallway.

612
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,089
And this immediately solved a ton of problems.

613
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,171
So now when you open the door

614
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,411
and you're looking down a hallway,

615
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:07,793
you see the brightest thing on the screen is the window,

616
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,374
right, and the window offers a vista to the outside world,

617
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:12,435
which is much more interesting than the blank walls.

618
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,516
So it actually makes traversal through hallways

619
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:15,417
feel a lot faster.

620
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,300
and it attracts people towards the end.

621
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,622
And then the window kind of guides your eyes

622
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:22,882
into the direction of the bend.

623
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,523
And this solves the problem of hallways that bend upwards

624
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:28,245
because now players' eyes are guided to look up.

625
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:31,306
And it also solves the problem of players going backwards

626
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,646
because now when you're going backwards,

627
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:34,107
the hallway looks very different.

628
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:36,928
You're no longer seeing this window of light at the end.

629
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:40,069
So just the way the hallways are designed,

630
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:42,050
you can figure out the direction you're supposed to go.

631
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,531
And I actually, you know,

632
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:49,014
sometimes in games they'll want to vary corners and hallways.

633
00:28:49,054 --> 00:28:51,215
And I actually have this in every single hallway because

634
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:54,517
having the player get lost inside hallways is not

635
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:59,279
something that I want to do. So in summary, you want to

636
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,301
embrace the geometry. Don't work against it. If you start

637
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,742
using impossible geometry you're going to find unexpected

638
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:08,264
solutions to previous problems. You will need to rethink a lot

639
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:09,065
of things like gating.

640
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:12,699
You'll need to rethink direction, northeast, southwest,

641
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,160
up, down, left, right, those all go out the window.

642
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,921
Utilize a very clear layout for your level.

643
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,182
The shape of it should be easily recognizable.

644
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,223
You want to create logic in your level

645
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:27,644
so the players can figure out where they need to go next

646
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:28,764
by looking at the architecture.

647
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,663
and you also want to have intentional architecture.

648
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:33,364
Everything you put in the game needs to tell the player

649
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:36,525
how to use it, and use established patterns

650
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:37,905
that the players can rely on

651
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:39,305
to figure out where they need to go.

652
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:41,586
And a lot of people will play the first level

653
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,206
of Battle for Garden and say, you know,

654
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:45,187
I thought this game was going to be very confusing,

655
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,587
but it actually turned out to be not bad.

656
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:49,768
So we've been sitting here talking about

657
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,748
impossible geometry.

658
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:52,049
I just want to leave you with one thing,

659
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,890
which is you mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger.

660
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:00,417
So all of that has kind of helped me to make manifold

661
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:03,239
garden what it is. And I just want to say manifold garden is

662
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,841
playable here at GDC. It's actually just outside in the day

663
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:09,882
of the devs area. So if you want to check it out or watch other

664
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:13,144
people play and see how they work their way through the

665
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:16,466
level. And finally, my name is William cheer. Here's all my

666
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:21,189
contact information. Feel free to come up and ask questions now

667
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:24,891
if we have time. Yeah, I think we have a little bit of time. If

668
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:26,932
anybody has questions, you can come up to the mic.

669
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:29,375
Thank you.

670
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:56,525
So the question is whether I did any paper prototyping.

671
00:30:57,426 --> 00:31:01,369
And I did initially do paper prototyping for the puzzles.

672
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:04,091
But then when it came to designing the levels,

673
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,673
I'm not a very good drawer.

674
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:10,216
And so even to do a 2D drawing is very difficult for me.

675
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:12,758
And all these levels have to be designed in 3D.

676
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,259
So I just build them inside the game

677
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,262
and then walk through them and play test them

678
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:20,043
and figure out where the issues are.

679
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:22,665
So I haven't done paper prototyping.

680
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:22,825
And

681
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:23,949
years.

682
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:26,531
Yes.

683
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:27,211
Oh, yeah.

684
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,472
Hey there.

685
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,474
Who else worked on your team?

686
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:31,474
Did you work by yourself?

687
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:36,218
And how did other people get involved in the later stages when you were sort of defining

688
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:36,878
an art style?

689
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,622
So I worked on the game alone for about two and a half years and then I got backed by

690
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:42,262
Indie Fund.

691
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,492
about a year ago, and I brought on a programmer, David, who's

692
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:48,813
actually in the audience. David worked on the game part-time

693
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,315
last year and joined full-time at the beginning of this year.

694
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,376
And the art style actually was just a lot of iterating over

695
00:31:54,456 --> 00:32:00,319
time. There was never a clear direction. I wanted it to be

696
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,441
inspired by architecture, so architectural drawings were an

697
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:07,703
influence, but were an inspiration. But a lot of it is

698
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:10,944
just kind of tiny things added up over time to get to where it

699
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:11,645
is at now.

700
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:12,881
Thank you.

701
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:19,979
Hi, thanks for this. So there's like a recurring trend in games that are based on like some

702
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:24,882
twist of mathematics, which is that they're really, really hard to pitch. You know, like

703
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:28,743
whenever you talk about a four-dimensional game, of which there are many, I'm making one,

704
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:33,946
you're like, oh, the four-dimensional game, like that other one, like MediaCorey or so on. So

705
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:38,768
I'm wondering how you deal with that when you actually talk to people about it. And the other

706
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:43,150
thing is, what would make it easier for you in a game engine to do what you did?

707
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:49,853
So the question is how to pitch a game that has a weird

708
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,096
geometry, weird twist.

709
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,421
I actually, so.

710
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:58,931
Yeah, I've been working on the game for about three and a half years now and a lot of that is just talking to a lot of people.

711
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,855
In 2014, I went to about 14 different game conventions.

712
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,478
And the way I would used to talk about the game is I'd say,

713
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:09,762
okay, you know, there are six gravity fields and each one is based on a different surface normal,

714
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:13,326
and when you're going this, it's red, and you can just see people gloss over, you know,

715
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,548
and when you mention surface normal, they're like, I'm done.

716
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,772
But then I started to say, okay, have you seen Inception?

717
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,772
And you know that scene where they full Paris in half

718
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,413
and they start walking,

719
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,913
but then immediately people are like, oh yeah,

720
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,234
you know, I know that.

721
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,175
And so I think it's about like communicating,

722
00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:29,676
giving people clear visual imagery

723
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:33,717
to help them imagine more of the consequences of that

724
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:35,038
as opposed to explaining the math.

725
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:43,084
Hi, you just said that you don't draw much, but I had a question concerning how do you

726
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:50,067
go about designing your architectures? How do you... what's your process to establish all this

727
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:54,949
architectural language that you have now in the game? And we saw the evolution, like we saw the

728
00:33:54,969 --> 00:34:00,091
previous prototypes, very blocky, simple cubes and stuff, and now it's very much more on it.

729
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,873
Sure. I was wondering how you go about creating those.

730
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:08,319
uh... the two biggest architects who've influenced the game are Tadao Ando, he's a

731
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,520
japanese architect who works a lot with concrete so that helps with kind of the

732
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,961
the layout of the levels

733
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:16,623
and then and frank Lloyd Wright who kind of helps fill in a lot of the ornaments

734
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:17,904
and the ornaments are there

735
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:19,865
because i don't have textures

736
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,546
and so if you're moving through flat, like a big chunk of flat space and you don't

737
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,868
have textures, players can't see stuff changing on the screen so it feels very

738
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:27,328
slow

739
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,810
but once you start adding kind of these variations in height

740
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:31,531
um...

741
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:34,214
that really helps speed things up.

742
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:37,215
I think their earlier question was about engines,

743
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,416
how engines can help.

744
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:42,358
I think providing, you know, the biggest problem that we have

745
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:43,579
are now dealing with rendering.

746
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,761
So I think having kind of low level stuff in the pipeline

747
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,182
that's opened up that we can tweak is most helpful.

748
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:52,783
But just in terms of 3D and scripting,

749
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:54,304
those are pretty standard.

750
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,346
OK, just one more question.

751
00:34:59,590 --> 00:34:59,690
Hi.

752
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,492
So yeah, you just said something about rendering

753
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:04,613
causing an issue.

754
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:08,575
I wanted to ask, you guys are instantiating everything,

755
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:08,895
right?

756
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:10,195
They're all instances?

757
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:11,096
Yes.

758
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:14,517
So how exactly were you guys getting

759
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,058
around the rendering issues?

760
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,020
Well, we've actually rewritten that system.

761
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,782
And I'm probably not the best person to answer that.

762
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:24,202
But we

763
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:32,054
We do have a 3x3x3 and sometimes 5x5x5 grid of the same level

764
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:37,975
repeated. We actually do not have one standard system. It

765
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:41,515
sort of depends on the geometry of the level. We have hijacked

766
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:46,636
the play pipeline in Unity now so when I hit play it actually

767
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:49,997
creates another level and merges all the meshes and deletes all

768
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,337
the unnecessary stuff and creates an optimized version of

769
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:52,518
that.

770
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:57,512
But yeah, David is in the audience, and feel free to ask

771
00:35:57,552 --> 00:35:58,854
him technical questions.

772
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:03,098
Yeah, so thank you all very much, and fill out the

773
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:04,920
evaluation if there is one.
