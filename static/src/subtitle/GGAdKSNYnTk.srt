1
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:09,620
I have GDC voice, so forgive that.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,101
Welcome, cell phones, evaluations, blah, blah, blah.

3
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,721
Okay, moving on.

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:20,362
We're here for the composer confessions.

5
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:23,422
We clearly pre-planned the width of the table

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,423
relative to the number of people for this panel.

7
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:29,644
So, just gonna dive right in.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,465
The idea with this,

9
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:42,396
is to explore some lessons learned in the field,

10
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,436
you know, on the job.

11
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,577
Things that aren't traditionally covered

12
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:50,118
at things like GDC or in school programs

13
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,719
or master classes or that kind of thing.

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,299
Because they tend to be the thing

15
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,840
that you would never think of until it just happens

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
and you encounter it and then you just have to

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,681
think on your feet.

18
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,761
Unexpected sort of lessons, some of which are

19
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:08,223
kind of interesting and novel and some of which are horrible and painful.

20
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,045
So everyone here is speaking for themselves.

21
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,986
I just reached out to these phenomenal people and said,

22
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,007
hey, if we did this thing, what would you say?

23
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:21,709
And all of them came back with really different topics that basically said,

24
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,930
okay, cool, just I'm counting on you to show up and know what you're doing.

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,052
And so if this is terrible starting five minutes from now,

26
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:30,332
then you have only yourselves to blame.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,506
So, I'm gonna go first.

28
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,862
I'm Austin, I worked on some of these things,

29
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:41,385
and my confession, of sorts,

30
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:46,848
is that it turns out we have absolutely no control

31
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:51,350
over our listeners slash audience slash players

32
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:54,993
and what they are going to take away from our music.

33
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,794
And so a shorter way of saying that

34
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:01,136
is that we don't have the power of suggestion

35
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:03,137
that we think we do as composers.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:14,542
So, when we're getting started in our careers and student work and that sort of thing, I

37
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:20,083
think we spend a lot of time trying to really hone our craft with the goal of creating very

38
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,964
specific emotional and visual responses.

39
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:27,205
So in other words, we aspire to a very vivid and exact.

40
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,653
images, feelings, etc. in the minds of our listeners.

41
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,834
And I've been guilty of this, where I'll think to myself,

42
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:37,016
because this music was written to evoke X,

43
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:40,097
it therefore will forever universally evoke X.

44
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:45,439
T-Rex versus the Hulk, in the most universal of musical images.

45
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,940
But really, anything in front of you, it's like this water bottle.

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,762
I was inspired by this water bottle.

47
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,343
So theoretically, anybody listening for the future

48
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:56,944
will just form water bottles in their head.

49
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,685
Turns out, that's totally bullshit.

50
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,628
should be obvious, this is why it's a confession.

51
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,895
So, as an example, on Journey, I was aspiring to,

52
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:11,037
by the time you reach the end of the game,

53
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:14,700
something that I would call sweeping or soaring,

54
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,963
or if I'm feeling daring, I would want it to feel

55
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,825
exhilarating or even spiritual,

56
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,747
and so this particular excerpt.

57
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:36,536
Baba, okay. So, actual response.

58
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:40,538
Stunning music. It really reminds me of Metal Gear Solid's soundtrack,

59
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,858
Here's to You. You should check it out.

60
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,780
So, I did check it out.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,543
This is a real comment.

62
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,123
So, you know...

63
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,314
I think we all have experienced unexpected comparisons,

64
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,694
like, you know, maybe like this or something else.

65
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,955
But people will liken things that they hear to other things

66
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,076
and that is often bewildering.

67
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,656
And in this case, you know, genuinely,

68
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,537
I have no idea what the hell is going on there.

69
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,697
Maybe, again, the goal was, you know,

70
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:25,179
sweeping and spiritual, and maybe to Nadine.

71
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,710
Here's to you is sweeping and spiritual.

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,631
And so in that sense, maybe I succeeded.

73
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,773
I have my doubts, but...

74
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:40,699
So this was a recurring theme at some point.

75
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:43,182
So relaxing.

76
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,184
Austin Winery, the Brian Eno of soundtracks.

77
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:47,125
I've got that too.

78
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:48,366
It's weird.

79
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,590
Again, I think we're hearing things differently.

80
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:57,926
I really thought my goal explicitly was to be melodic, soaring, I'll say again.

81
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,350
It turns out I'm actually being super meditative and tranquil.

82
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:07,556
I have heard the word relaxing about my music so many times, and I don't think I've ever

83
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:10,720
once tried to write something that was relaxing, except maybe Flo.

84
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:13,062
Here's another one.

85
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:24,058
Love me Jenny. Thank God I spotted one like that much later down the road

86
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:28,841
because I think that's actually a compliment. I think they're actually

87
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:33,243
trying to be nice and I'm hope that just as a defense mechanism I'm saying

88
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:36,725
they're not sort of bored out of their mind but I don't know they fell asleep

89
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:40,827
before they could type a question mark so it's hard to know for sure what we're

90
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:41,288
even saying.

91
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:48,111
Point is, Journey was repeatedly called out as relaxing, meditative, textural, things

92
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,751
that I really didn't think was the goal.

93
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:54,332
And the strange thing is, it wasn't people criticizing it.

94
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:58,192
They were saying, this is what I like about it and identifying things that it explicitly

95
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:58,892
was not trying to be.

96
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,173
It gets weirder.

97
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,694
I played this game after I got my wisdom teeth out.

98
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:09,614
It relaxed me and took my mind away from the pain because I couldn't swallow the ibuprofen

99
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:09,994
pills.

100
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:11,775
So I'm like...

101
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:20,548
I think the culmination was when IGN rated it the number one soundtrack for studying.

102
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:28,274
Again, this is not something I can have any explanation.

103
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:34,939
I would not have thought sweeping and soaring is compatible with studying, but this is where

104
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,501
I was constantly learning this lesson over and over.

105
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,844
So it might be something more like this.

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,244
I realize I can't predict what people are going to say or what their takeaway is going

107
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:46,484
to be.

108
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,929
And the bottom line is that's okay.

109
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,751
It better be okay.

110
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:58,718
We can't control it as much as we think we can or as much as we are specifically trying

111
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:02,262
to evoke very precise images and feelings and things like that.

112
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,444
We just can't.

113
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,171
One more highlight.

114
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,616
This is from a Journey YouTube upload.

115
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,380
When I'm home, I want to do cooking, work or cooking,

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,481
I listen to Bioshock.

117
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,443
Anyone here with me?

118
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,946
I love just showing up.

119
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:18,009
Truth is, I probably would.

120
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,390
Big fan of Bioshock.

121
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:21,333
So flash forward.

122
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:23,264
I thought I'd learned this lesson.

123
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,726
After many years of the sort of incorrect compliments,

124
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,567
I think I probably internalized that a little too much.

125
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:30,907
So when it came time to do Abzu,

126
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:35,148
both probably because I probably internalized

127
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,289
some of that Journey feedback too much,

128
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,490
but also because, earnestly, the game had a very,

129
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,870
very different sort of energy to it,

130
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,511
very kinetic, very full of life.

131
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,292
So I said, okay, I want to be very emotionally,

132
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:47,753
I accepted, apparently, Journey is tranquil and meditative,

133
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,194
and now I don't want to do that.

134
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,554
Now I want to be very melodic.

135
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:56,459
not meditative at all, really match the kinetic energy of the game.

136
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,022
And I want to pretend that's not because of this feedback from Journey,

137
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,483
but it probably made its way in there a bit.

138
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:04,005
So here's an example of me not being meditative

139
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:07,829
and trying to be more overtly melodic.

140
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:28,257
Okay, blah blah blah.

141
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:36,865
So after getting about 50 of these, apparently it sounds exactly like Tomb Raider or Tom

142
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:37,165
Raider.

143
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:42,790
That's Tom Salta's pet project, I guess.

144
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,870
Should have seen some of that coming, although I honestly had not played Tomb Raider since

145
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,095
it came out 20 years ago, and I went back and was one of those like, motherfucker, I

146
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:56,119
can actually hear why people are saying that.

147
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,968
So after wading through all of those, here's a review I found on Amazon, and if you look

148
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:04,489
at the bottom.

149
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:10,354
They say, this score seems overly intellectual instead of from the heart.

150
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:14,295
I find the music lines lose me as a listener in the same way.

151
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,756
What I'm trying to say is, I feel lost.

152
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,717
I feel I get lost listening to his newer scores without being able to remember the melodies.

153
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,798
Go back and listen to Flow or Journey and you cannot forget the tunes.

154
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:33,039
So somehow the less melodic, more meditative score is more melodic than the explicitly

155
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,680
trying to be melodic score.

156
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:44,567
At least Flo is on the list, which is especially bizarre and helps me try to let it go, because

157
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,548
Flo is just overtly not melodic.

158
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:49,390
Anyone who says so, I just don't even know where they're coming from.

159
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,353
And this was probably the true culmination, is literal side-by-side comments.

160
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,894
Very disappointing.

161
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,515
It's lacking strong musical ideas.

162
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,036
It sounds intellectual and not from the heart.

163
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,397
I think that might be the same person.

164
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:08,149
And then immediately below it, I'm crying piles of tears and all this sort of...

165
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:16,170
So I'm sitting here looking at this, and it dawns on me that it's possible to simultaneously

166
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,510
fail and succeed.

167
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,111
And that was something I had never thought about before, considered possible.

168
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:31,053
So the bottom line is, when getting into the creative zone and the process, the big confession

169
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:31,593
was that I...

170
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,065
try to let go of the whole outside world while writing.

171
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,748
But then as soon as the writing is done,

172
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:41,896
I turn into this monster that's scouring the world

173
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,440
to see if I succeeded in my goal.

174
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,664
Did I actually create?

175
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:51,222
what I thought I created based on what people are saying about it.

176
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:55,484
And the confession really is that no good comes of this.

177
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,224
This is not a healthy practice.

178
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:59,465
We can't control what people are going to think.

179
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,685
We can't control what their takeaway would be.

180
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,886
As my father used to say, you would worry a lot less what other people think if you

181
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,226
realized how infrequently they do.

182
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:13,469
Actually, I said that wrong and made it sound extremely asshole-ish.

183
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,010
You would worry a lot less what people think of you if you realized how infrequently they

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,210
do.

185
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,812
So basically, the bottom line is we should be grateful that anyone is listening at all

186
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,653
and extremely grateful if they like it and then just accept everything else.

187
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:33,893
I'm going to turn it over now.

188
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:38,878
To a legend of gay music, as noted.

189
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:46,688
Composer of classics, Goldeneye 64, Banjo Kazooie, Viva Pinata, about 40 million others, Grant Kirkcope.

190
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:47,209
Hello.

191
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:47,930
Woo!

192
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,594
Is it dead? I don't believe it.

193
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:52,816
Yeah, or the space bar.

194
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,711
Yeah, so thanks for that picture, Austin.

195
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:56,271
You're welcome.

196
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,052
Yes, there'll be a...

197
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:57,532
Thank you.

198
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,733
There'll certainly be a chance for that, you know, getting you back a later date, I'm sure.

199
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,074
Yes, yes.

200
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:06,356
So I guess mine is going to be the slightly cynical version of this talk.

201
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,858
Austin, he said I was a cynical guy, so I'm a cynical guy.

202
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:09,998
Depressed most of the time.

203
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:12,420
So my talk is like learning to let go, right?

204
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:17,514
So I think that, as composers, right, we think that we know the best always,

205
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,555
and who we're working for has not got a clue,

206
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:22,336
and they're just completely clueless and they don't know about music and all that.

207
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:23,236
We know best and they're wrong.

208
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,597
But I think that, like I've slowly realized over the years,

209
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,038
that you can't think like that.

210
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,559
Like, the minute you hire yourself out to somebody else,

211
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,200
they're probably going to tell you what to do, and you probably better do it.

212
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,961
Or you're probably going to get fired, and they're going to get Austin to do it instead.

213
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:37,821
You know, so...

214
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:45,658
So that's my thing about learning to let go of that ownership,

215
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,040
that I think that you just have to be prepared

216
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,162
to be told that it's not what they want

217
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:52,903
and you really should try to do it again.

218
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:54,964
And no amount of arguing with them

219
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:55,845
is going to make any difference.

220
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:58,606
It's just going to go, I don't like it and that's it.

221
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,305
Composers by composers, I was best of my composers t-shirt.

222
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:08,131
So, you know, it's like trying to convince like an Ariana Grande fan to, you know, to like Pantera.

223
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:09,533
It's just probably not going to happen.

224
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:15,481
So it's, it's, I guess I learned that, well, I guess, I guess a long time ago,

225
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,684
but it still irks me to this day that I...

226
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:21,236
people say, Grant, I think it's shit, just do it again.

227
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:22,797
And like, I really want to say,

228
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,757
who the fuck do you think you are?

229
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:25,877
I know way better than you,

230
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,598
but you kind of go, of course I'll do it again.

231
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,338
Yes, I'd love to do it again like that, you know.

232
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:31,759
So I use the analogy of like, you go to a restaurant

233
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,959
and you've been saving up for ages

234
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,780
for this great steak that you've heard about

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,540
that you really want to have.

236
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,880
And like, you go to the restaurant,

237
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,021
you sit down, the waiter comes across

238
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,441
and like, he says to you, what are you going to have, sir?

239
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,202
I'm going to have this fantastic steak.

240
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,782
Can't wait for it, I've waited such a long time.

241
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:43,762
And he goes away to the kitchen

242
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,083
and he comes back a bit later.

243
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,144
Me and the lads in the kitchen have had a bit of a chat,

244
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,646
and we decided that we think you're going to like the chicken better,

245
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,307
it's way better.

246
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,949
And you're like, just a minute, I ordered the steak, I want the steak,

247
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,491
I paid for the steak, and if you don't give me it,

248
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:57,312
I'm going to go somewhere else that someone will give me the steak.

249
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,715
So I think that's in a nutshell what I think about that whole

250
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,936
kind of composer's no best thing.

251
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:05,358
Because we probably do, but you know,

252
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,360
you're never going to get that past lots and lots of people.

253
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,323
Is that my bit there?

254
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:13,064
Yes, right, okay.

255
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:14,420
get used to smiling.

256
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,891
So I, you know, when they do say it's not great

257
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,597
and you just, you don't want to say,

258
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:20,881
you want to curse a lot.

259
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,546
you just kind of smile and say,

260
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,847
yes, I'll quite happily do it again.

261
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,767
It's no problem at all.

262
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,009
I do think that it's a really valuable skill to learn.

263
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,611
Like I was working for, I did a movie last year,

264
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:37,272
and I thought I'd gotten great with the director.

265
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,732
It's all going really fantastically well.

266
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,453
I know all the little demos that I did on the scenes,

267
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:42,054
he loved and loved and loved and sent me emails.

268
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,155
You nailed it, awesome, awesome, awesome.

269
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,296
I was thinking, oh yeah, I've done great here.

270
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,116
It's just fantastic.

271
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,317
So we got invited to the mix.

272
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:54,220
thing, the big fight scene, mixed stage, atmos, nonsense, all that stuff, you know.

273
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,743
And it started, it started to go, oh it's too dark, oh it's dark, it's gone so dark,

274
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:02,545
everything's dark, the music's dark, the movie's dark, we've got to change it, you know, we've

275
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,408
got to change all of it. And I was thinking, we just spent money recording the orchestra,

276
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,890
it was all live orchestra, yeah, you've got to change, oh what's a fiddle?

277
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,053
I need some fiddle in it. Jolly fiddle. Like, you know, really Celtic.

278
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,096
I was thinking, what the shit? You know, there's nothing...

279
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,498
You didn't say anything about the fucking fiddle, you know,

280
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,021
when we were writing it in the first place.

281
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,323
Why do you want a bloody fiddle in it now?

282
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,164
Where am I going to get that from?

283
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:22,525
I've got a mixed medium with the orchestra.

284
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,267
How am I going to do that like it was irrelevant?

285
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:26,470
I couldn't say any of that. I just said...

286
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,491
God, I love that fiddle. I'm gonna go and get one right now.

287
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:30,852
I'm gonna slot it in there.

288
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:33,073
You're not even gonna notice it's different to the midi, the orchestra.

289
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:34,954
It's gonna be perfect. I'm doing it.

290
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,995
Like, you know, even though you want to go,

291
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,676
Jesus Christ, man, couldn't you have thought of that

292
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,017
last year when we were bloody well doing it?

293
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:45,279
You know, like, why did you have to say it right now in the mixtape

294
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,520
when everyone sat there going, oh, God, this is not a fiddle.

295
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,460
Where's this fiddle? You know, it's like that, right?

296
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,082
So I think that you have to get used to just letting go.

297
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,803
And instead of going, what the bugger are you talking about?

298
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,209
I'd love to do that fiddle thing, I can't wait.

299
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:58,709
Right.

300
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,711
Yeah, oh yeah, here's another great one.

301
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:04,671
Marketing always knows best.

302
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:07,373
So, like in dev things, right,

303
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:09,314
the dev team usually pretty separate to the marketing,

304
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:10,294
like completely separate.

305
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,595
So, you know, get used to the fact

306
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:14,416
that you're probably not gonna get to write the trailer.

307
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:14,916
Right.

308
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,937
I've had this argument a few times.

309
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:18,038
I always lose.

310
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,239
I've had maybe one once, where, you know,

311
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,580
you're gonna say, wouldn't it be nice

312
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,120
to have some of the themes from the game in the trailer,

313
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,281
and the kind of marketing guy kind of goes,

314
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:26,582
And why's that?

315
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:27,663
Well, because, you know,

316
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,563
you've got themes from the game in the trailer,

317
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,584
but it's not an IP, no one knows the themes, right?

318
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,224
So what's the point of that?

319
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,405
So you kind of, you lose the argument by going,

320
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,426
if it's Star Wars, you're probably gonna wanna hear

321
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,786
the themes from Star Wars in the trailer,

322
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,687
but when it's X game that no one's heard of before,

323
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:41,647
it gives a shit, right?

324
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,708
Like, we don't wanna hear those themes

325
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,088
because I've got this trailer piece

326
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:46,949
that I've used 55 billion times before

327
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,310
that I can give to my video editors right now.

328
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,931
They can cut to the exact, this generic,

329
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:53,771
digga digga digga digga digga digga digga digga

330
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,012
digga digga digga digga digga digga digga.

331
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,275
hate, you know, that shit, right?

332
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,877
So like, we've all heard a million times, right?

333
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:02,279
So, but yeah, the marketing guy knows the piece,

334
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,962
he's used it a bazillion times, give it to the editors,

335
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:06,483
the good is gonna get on with it, right?

336
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,225
And like, no amount of you saying,

337
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:09,666
but wouldn't it be great with,

338
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,567
because it's easy for him, right?

339
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,908
He doesn't have to wait for you to write the piece

340
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:14,030
for the guys to cut the video to the piece you've written,

341
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,612
and maybe get it recorded by somebody,

342
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,093
you can just give him this generic thing.

343
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,655
that he's used a billion times.

344
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:20,337
I was like, I was actually on a project where

345
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,580
the final trailer for the release of the game

346
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,743
was this piece of music that he used lots of times

347
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:26,264
after arguing lots of times and losing.

348
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:29,208
And then he just, literally a month later,

349
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,691
there was a trailer for the next game that we're doing,

350
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,613
and it was the exact same trailer piece

351
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,595
that was on the one that we did.

352
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,757
Like, and I was just like, shit, you know.

353
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:38,783
Why would you do that?

354
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,305
But no one gives a shit.

355
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,726
No one really cares, right?

356
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,107
It's not like, no one's gonna go,

357
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,288
oh, that trailer piece was great

358
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,129
and that trailer piece is bad.

359
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,331
It's just a trailer, right?

360
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,153
And you know, people spend lots and lots of money

361
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:50,795
writing these gigantic pieces

362
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,357
for like a 50 billion piece orchestra and a massive choir.

363
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:54,779
You're never gonna beat win that battle.

364
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,221
So you just have to go, Mr. Marketing,

365
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,883
of course, whatever you like to do,

366
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,024
let's just do that thing.

367
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:01,526
So it's just getting used to that.

368
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:03,888
letting go of the ownership.

369
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,649
Because you are a hired contracting person,

370
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,829
just like hiring a pool guy or a gardener

371
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,550
or a mechanic to do that job for you.

372
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,630
That's what they're doing, right?

373
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,690
They're hiring you to do that job,

374
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,571
and you may not get a looking on any of that stuff, right?

375
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,352
It just could be taken away from you.

376
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,592
And it'll save yourself a lot of heartache

377
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,913
if you get used to kind of going,

378
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,073
all right, fair enough.

379
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:24,814
Because I got really stressed about it a lot of times

380
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,554
and fought over it and lost every bloody time.

381
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,015
So, that's Mr. Marketing Guy.

382
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:31,767
But that's not the way I wrote it.

383
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,568
So another example, the movie I did last time,

384
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,368
like wrote the music, did the demo,

385
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:37,889
you loved it, thought it was great.

386
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:40,189
And then you go away and like a lot of times,

387
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,330
composers don't even get invited to the mix part, right?

388
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,090
It could just be that you've done your job,

389
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,731
you've been paid, goodbye,

390
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,011
and you'll see it when it comes out in the theater, right?

391
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:50,612
But I did turn up to, I did get invited to the mix thing.

392
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:53,712
So you find that the producer guy decided

393
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,773
that he thought this piece would go better there,

394
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,853
and he cut the end and put it at the start,

395
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:58,954
and then took a bit from the end

396
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,134
and put it in the middle to link it together.

397
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:00,634
And you're like.

398
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,815
But that's not the way I wrote it, right?

399
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,795
I did that piece to hit the beats here,

400
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,476
hit that slap in the face, hit that gunshot,

401
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,496
and it's all just gone to shit because it's not there anymore.

402
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,096
But nobody will love it.

403
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,757
There's no fight against that.

404
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,477
You're wasting your time going,

405
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,158
but I wrote the piece like that, so what?

406
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:18,838
We like it like this. That's it, right?

407
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,639
You're done. There's no way you're going to win that war.

408
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,619
So it's just getting used to letting go of all that.

409
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,680
And it is hard, right? It is really hard.

410
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,480
And I'm particularly bad at letting go of it,

411
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,281
so I'm kind of telling myself as I'm telling you guys too.

412
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:30,461
But I just think that...

413
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:34,142
It's just because you're a contract guy, right?

414
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,463
You are, you've been hired out, and that's it.

415
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:37,243
You just got to take it.

416
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:38,943
You might not even get a look in on this stuff.

417
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:41,084
So that's my thing about that.

418
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,104
Yes, the boss is always right.

419
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,585
So like, you know, yeah, again, this movie did last year.

420
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:46,745
And it's not a bad experience, right?

421
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,306
I did have a good experience, generally speaking.

422
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,086
But I was in, we're in the screening,

423
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:53,167
and Mr. Head Dude, who's, you know,

424
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:55,908
financing, like Chinese guy, financing the entire thing,

425
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:57,028
Mr. Billionaire, whatever he is.

426
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,710
He spent most of the time arguing about why his name came in the credits,

427
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,030
rather than anything about the movie.

428
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,811
He wanted to make sure that, yes, I know that the credits,

429
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,932
the guy who comes last is the most important man,

430
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,113
so I must be... That big discussion went on.

431
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:13,054
And he made some passing comment about some music somewhere

432
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,275
that was... I can't remember the comment.

433
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,215
It was so flippant.

434
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:21,377
But the entire entourage around him shat themselves instantly.

435
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:23,918
Oh, my God, rip it out! He doesn't like it! Mr. Doodarats!

436
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:25,938
So the whole thing gets ripped out right in front of you.

437
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,202
Yeah, so he needs to sit there, he's probably forgotten already what he's talked about,

438
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,947
but he only needs to have just been chucked into the bin, like that's just gone right,

439
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,810
because he made some kind of passing bizarre comment that...

440
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,659
No one understood, but felt like,

441
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,262
just take it out right now, it's awful.

442
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:42,283
And it was like that.

443
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,645
And yet again, you've just got no say over it.

444
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,266
You soon realize that in the pecking order,

445
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,948
composers don't come very high.

446
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,411
Like there's a whole mountain of people

447
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,033
sat above you, producers, and all that nonsense above you

448
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,935
who have got way more say than you have.

449
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,878
And they all shit themselves when the Ked guy blinks.

450
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:58,699
Right?

451
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,941
So there's all that kind of, you know.

452
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:05,205
Sitting in your little cave, writing your music, it's all nice and introverted.

453
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:06,566
You're all sort of there. It's all great.

454
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,227
You may need to take one step out of there.

455
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:11,170
You're in that land of real world where everyone's got an opinion

456
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,512
and your opinion matters for nothing, right? A lot of the time.

457
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:14,233
So.

458
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:17,435
That's another lesson that I learned very recently,

459
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,516
that you just have to let go of it.

460
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,898
There's no point crying about it

461
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:23,619
or punching the director on the way out,

462
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,620
like I was inclined to do.

463
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:29,403
So it's a thing that I think you just have to get used to.

464
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,304
The further you go down the path

465
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:34,046
of becoming a more established, contracting composer,

466
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,988
it's no different than anything else, right?

467
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,910
And of course, you're happy about it, right?

468
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,072
So the gist of my segment here, I guess, is like,

469
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,183
let go of everything, you've written your music,

470
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,784
and sometimes you might get a say in the end of it,

471
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:49,265
but a lot of the time you might just pass it off,

472
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:51,506
never see it again until you see it in the finished product,

473
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,366
and it might not be how you intended it to be.

474
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,607
I have to say that my experience of writing music

475
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:57,328
for 21 years has been pretty good,

476
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,989
I've got most of my way most of the time,

477
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,850
but there are gonna be events

478
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,090
where you're just not gonna win that battle,

479
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,031
and it's like you have to be prepared to say,

480
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,972
not get upset about it.

481
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:09,593
And I have got upset tons of times, but...

482
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:11,836
I don't know, I just think you have to,

483
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:13,737
it could be the best lesson learned, I think,

484
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:17,000
is to be able to say, all right, I wrote it,

485
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,482
you sort of liked it, it's in more or less

486
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,304
how I wanted it to be, and that thing you wrote

487
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:23,865
that fits perfectly, when the person sees it,

488
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,146
maybe in the movie theater or the game,

489
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,248
they don't know what you wrote in the first place,

490
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,990
so what they see is what ended up being there,

491
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,912
and they don't know if what you wrote was better or not,

492
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,955
so you just have to kind of accept the fact that that's it,

493
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,776
and you've lost that battle,

494
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,097
and get on with the next thing, and just, you know.

495
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:40,973
So that's it, my little bit.

496
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:43,034
Yes, all right.

497
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,776
That was uplifting.

498
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:54,079
We'll do closed captions for translating all of that as well.

499
00:22:56,941 --> 00:23:00,683
Next, major badass, multi-instrumentalist, composer,

500
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:03,844
Will Roger II, Esquire of Deaconship, Bournemouth, Shire.

501
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:08,627
known from work at LucasArts and the Old Republic

502
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:10,390
to Tomb Raider and Temple of Osiris,

503
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,272
and recently, a new The Distant Light.

504
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:12,352
Woo!

505
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:12,973
Thank you.

506
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:13,474
Thank you.

507
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:14,295
Thank you.

508
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:14,575
Thank you.

509
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:14,776
Thank you.

510
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:14,996
Thank you.

511
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:15,377
Thank you.

512
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:21,385
Thank you.

513
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:21,865
This space bar'll do it.

514
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:27,008
Cool, so Star Wars The Old Republic was my first AAA score

515
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,872
and a big turning point in how I write for the orchestra.

516
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:32,856
In this talk, I'll cover some of the fundamental mistakes

517
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,019
I made in my early approach to orchestration,

518
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,863
how I learned from them, and how I've applied this knowledge

519
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:38,905
to all my writing since then.

520
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:45,369
I'd written several indie game scores before working at Lucas, but The Old Republic was

521
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:49,090
the first time I had a AAA score and my first time writing for live orchestra.

522
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,853
We had a very tight deadline, and so it was also my first time writing extensively for

523
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,094
Star Wars, so there was a lot of pressure to get the John Williams sound right.

524
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:06,622
I used high quality samples for the mockups and my cues were approved, so conceptually

525
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,403
the music worked well.

526
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:13,288
But I never had the experience of going from mockup to live orchestra, and I had no idea

527
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:15,490
of the headaches that these cues would cause.

528
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,214
I wrote for the sound, not for the players, and so I was in for a rude awakening.

529
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:25,979
We had four other composers and a ton of music to get through in a short time.

530
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,581
Some of my cues were played effortlessly,

531
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,923
with musicians reading beautifully on their first try.

532
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,828
But others, easy pieces left them confused and grumpy and dissatisfied.

533
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,410
So here's a few reasons why.

534
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,775
My first problem was writing parts with awkward entrances

535
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,657
and needlessly unnatural rhythms.

536
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,947
players would have to count several measures of rest

537
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,728
before oddly timed entrances with no obvious backing.

538
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,810
And this led to very unconfident performances

539
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,091
and unnecessary retakes.

540
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,614
I had some cues, like you see here.

541
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,055
This is real, by the way.

542
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:04,896
This is not made up.

543
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,743
Some cues for instruments just had very inconsequential parts,

544
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,465
writing half the piece just to play only a short passage.

545
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:14,787
Again, this was because I focused only on the sound

546
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,969
and not on the performance or the players.

547
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,834
And I had some generally dissatisfying parts as well, which.

548
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:28,245
Yeah, which sounded great in samples, but didn't work when played live.

549
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:32,128
In this instance, as you see, the harp just plays a single tremolo throughout the whole

550
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:32,508
cue.

551
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,451
And it was a great texture for the ice planet Hoth, but in practice it was very boring and

552
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:42,034
very static, and honestly just unacceptable to give to a professional player who'd studied

553
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:42,655
their whole life.

554
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:46,477
Speaking of harp...

555
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,273
So harpists play accidentals via pedals that transpose all notes of a kind.

556
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,674
Here I tried a harmonic shift between two hexatonic modes,

557
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,315
which is a very Star Wars-y technique.

558
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,677
But unfortunately, this required six pedal changes at once.

559
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:13,822
And most harpists only have two feet, so it was actually impossible to play.

560
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:23,242
And lastly, I had some cues that I just simply didn't proofread closely enough

561
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,024
when I got them back from our orchestration team.

562
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,767
One piece had incorrect dynamics at the end,

563
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:30,289
turning an ambient piece unexpectedly violent.

564
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,515
And another just had very glitched rhythms

565
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:39,098
where we had to fix it at the podium, which is a huge time waste.

566
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,096
I learned from these mistakes and studied other scores with a focus on performance.

567
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:51,003
Before my next score for Star Wars First Assault, I developed strategies to make sure that the

568
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,747
parts were playable, sight-readable, and enjoyable.

569
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,269
Here's some of those techniques.

570
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,681
The first principle I followed was to just make sure everyone has at least something

571
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,563
interesting to do in each cue.

572
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:08,427
Previously, I might have allowed a harp part to be nothing but glisses for an entire cue,

573
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:12,710
but in this example, I made sure that they had some melodic doubling to keep things interesting.

574
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:19,131
Avoid writing awkward entrances at all costs.

575
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,573
These again can lead to unconfident performances.

576
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:23,634
If you need arrhythmic elements,

577
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,076
a neat trick to try is write it in 4-4,

578
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:27,857
but use tuplets or syncopation.

579
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:30,479
Here the strings have scattered entrances,

580
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,960
but it's easy to count in 4-4,

581
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,542
especially with the harp doubling.

582
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,727
Make sure brass isn't being abused with constant fortissimo.

583
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,566
Horns especially need time to rest,

584
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,311
particularly if you need them to make a big entrance later on.

585
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:49,276
So in this example, from Laura Croft actually,

586
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,900
I remove them from the text here at measure eight

587
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,223
using a trombone to support the trumpet

588
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:56,407
so that the horns can come in full force later on.

589
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:05,279
Try writing in fun challenges that sound more difficult than they actually are, showcasing

590
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,240
the player's versatility.

591
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,745
A good habit is to study instrumental etudes to get to know what's guaranteed to be mastered

592
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:12,465
by a professional.

593
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:17,470
For example, these wind runs and arpeggio... arpeggiando violas.

594
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:22,895
Try using cues to provide alternate textural options.

595
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,818
When recording, you can easily adjust dynamics or tacit instruments,

596
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,781
but you can't really add new parts.

597
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:32,246
Using cues allows you to thicken the textures if necessary.

598
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,111
For example, expanding a solo to a full section.

599
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,155
We should take into account not just the performance,

600
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,095
but also the venue.

601
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,576
For Star Wars First Assault, we were at Abbey Road,

602
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:46,577
which is big enough to seat an entire orchestra

603
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:48,078
in two different configurations.

604
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:50,018
We had two factions in the game,

605
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:52,279
so we recorded Imperial music in portrait

606
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,700
and Rebel music in landscape.

607
00:28:57,465 --> 00:29:02,266
So to wrap things up, the most important thing is to talk to musicians about any questionable

608
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:02,587
parts.

609
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:08,089
Ideally, befriend someone from every section and get their feedback for whatever you're

610
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:11,110
not comfortable with before it hits the copyist.

611
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,590
Their input isn't valuable.

612
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:18,836
And as a final note, I also found that keeping reality

613
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:20,437
and player psychology in mind

614
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:22,479
helps with sampled orchestral cues too.

615
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,002
Write interesting parts for both foreground and background,

616
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:27,924
keeping in mind live player limitations,

617
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,566
and a sampled cue will always sound more realistic.

618
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:33,649
Thanks.

619
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,912
So probably all of us saw Mick win GDC yesterday.

620
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,033
So I don't really need to say anything.

621
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:53,494
So Mick Gordon.

622
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:53,594
Yeah.

623
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:53,854
Yeah.

624
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:54,035
Yeah.

625
00:29:59,097 --> 00:29:59,297
Yeah.

626
00:29:59,317 --> 00:29:59,438
Yeah.

627
00:29:59,458 --> 00:29:59,838
Yeah.

628
00:29:59,858 --> 00:29:59,958
Yeah.

629
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:00,058
Yeah.

630
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:00,518
Yeah.

631
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:00,638
Yeah.

632
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:00,778
Yeah.

633
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:00,938
Yeah.

634
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:01,178
Yeah.

635
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:01,339
Yeah.

636
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:01,499
Yeah.

637
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:01,599
Yeah.

638
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,380
Yeah.

639
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,560
Yeah.

640
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:03,720
Yeah.

641
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:03,920
Yeah.

642
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,060
Yeah.

643
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,441
Yeah.

644
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:05,641
Yeah.

645
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,786
The first developer came to me and said,

646
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,007
we want some music, you see.

647
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:15,809
It needs to be modern, catchy, groovy, and cool.

648
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:16,810
No problem, I said.

649
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:18,532
I knew exactly what to do.

650
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,255
So I went to my studio and I worked all night

651
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,318
on a dubstep song, Wubz, from left to right.

652
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:28,561
I emailed them back with a finished track.

653
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:30,282
I made a dubstep track for you.

654
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:32,044
I look forward to your feedback.

655
00:30:34,104 --> 00:30:38,407
No, no, no, they said, this is not the music we wanted, you misread.

656
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:42,410
It was chiptune music we wanted, modern, catchy, groovy, and cool.

657
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,191
That was what we wanted from you.

658
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:50,136
The second developer came to me and said, we want some music, you see.

659
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:55,900
It needs to have square waves, have noise, and be retro, too.

660
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,841
No problem, I said.

661
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:58,002
I know exactly what to do.

662
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:06,127
So I went to my studio and I worked all night on chiptune music, bit crushing from left to right.

663
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:09,529
I emailed them back with the finished track.

664
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,671
I made chiptunes for you. I look forward to your feedback.

665
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:17,773
No, no, no, they said, this is not the music we wanted you egghead.

666
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:21,456
Sine waves, noise and retro too.

667
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,777
It was heavy metal we wanted from you.

668
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:29,860
The third developer came to me and said, we want some music you see.

669
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:34,381
It needs to be aggressive, fast, and hair-raising too.

670
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:35,942
No problem, I said.

671
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,883
I know exactly what to do.

672
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,285
So I went to my studio and I shredded all night.

673
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:46,027
Nine string guitars panned left and right.

674
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:56,913
I finished the track and emailed them back.

675
00:31:57,553 --> 00:31:58,533
I made some metal for you.

676
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,774
I look forward to your feedback.

677
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:05,701
No, no, no, they said. This is not the music we wanted, you knucklehead.

678
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,182
Aggressive, fast, and hair-raising, too.

679
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:13,805
Something like Bach is what we wanted from you.

680
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:23,129
The fourth developer came to me and said,

681
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,850
We want some music, you see.

682
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:34,117
It needs to be bespoke, baroque, and counterpoint too.

683
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:35,558
No problem, I said.

684
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,359
I know exactly what to do.

685
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,142
So I went to the organ and I played all night,

686
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:45,025
doing my best Bach impression, semiquavers left to right.

687
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:49,588
I emailed them back with the finished track.

688
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,310
I made some organ music for you.

689
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,371
I look forward to your feedback.

690
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,173
No, no, no, they said.

691
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:57,734
This is not the music we wanted.

692
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:58,555
You're dead.

693
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,465
I didn't really say that, it's just the best picture I could find.

694
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:05,849
Bespoke, baroque, and have counterpoint too.

695
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:10,833
We wanted a full orchestra from you, not just an organ, you fool.

696
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,359
The fifth developer came to me and said,

697
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:19,880
We want some music, you see.

698
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:24,784
It needs to be epic, massive, and guttural too.

699
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,907
No problem, I said. I know exactly what to do.

700
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,505
So I looked at my budget and my budget was tight.

701
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:35,026
But I recorded the orchestra anyway,

702
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:36,767
a hundred piece from left to right.

703
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,268
I emailed them back with the finished track.

704
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:41,348
Here is the orchestra.

705
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:42,669
I look forward to your feedback.

706
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,650
No, no, no, they said.

707
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,790
This is not the music we wanted, dickhead.

708
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,052
Epic, massive, and guttural too.

709
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:55,113
It is dubstep we wanted from you.

710
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:00,883
Despair set in, rejection after rejection.

711
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:05,686
I was failing in my ability to interpret direction.

712
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:13,290
Developers were giving me the best direction that they could, and I was frustrating them

713
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,251
because I completely misunderstood.

714
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:21,295
You see, a composer-client relationship is a relationship, alright?

715
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:25,678
Without proper communication, it ends up in a fight.

716
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:30,160
Without a shared common creative language,

717
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,542
you're completely alien to each other.

718
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,583
You're not able to tell when you're wrong

719
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:35,804
or when you're right.

720
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,626
But if you get to know each other,

721
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:40,628
you'll understand each other,

722
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,510
and you'll be able to combine your might.

723
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,834
When they say jump, you'll already know how high.

724
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,136
The two of you will become partners in crime.

725
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,339
So get to know each other really well, become a great team.

726
00:34:57,783 --> 00:35:00,685
And when it comes to music time, you're going to succeed.

727
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:06,049
So get to know your clients, be friends, and share a joke.

728
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,131
That is the key to success, my friends.

729
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:10,592
That's all, folks.

730
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:19,018
Thank you.

731
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:19,258
Thank you.

732
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:19,539
Thank you.

733
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:19,779
Thank you.

734
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,079
Thank you.

735
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:20,279
Thank you.

736
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:20,479
Thank you.

737
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:20,679
Thank you.

738
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:21,060
Thank you.

739
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:21,700
Thank you.

740
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,982
I had no idea that was going to happen.

741
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:24,382
That was awesome.

742
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:28,456
the king of indies, Hyperlight Drifter, Fez,

743
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:32,357
and 40,000 others, Rich Vreeland, aka Disasterpeace.

744
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:35,097
Hey guys.

745
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,719
So my talk is called Curveballs.

746
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,800
I often find the beginning of a project

747
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480
to be the most exciting period.

748
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,201
There's a sense that anything is possible.

749
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:56,860
which has often propelled me down many avenues in search of the thing.

750
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:04,003
Along the way, Murphy's Law, that anything that can go wrong

751
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,904
will go wrong, kicks in, and I rarely end up where I intended.

752
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:12,146
Sometimes projects turn out worse, but often in my experience

753
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:14,107
they turn out different, or better.

754
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:19,006
During the course of my work on a thing,

755
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:22,068
there tends to be a psychological transition

756
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:25,111
from an exciting beginning of boundless possibility

757
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:28,473
to a starker, more responsible reality.

758
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,017
You bring an idea out of the ether and give it life.

759
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:38,261
It gradually frames itself and the edges come into view.

760
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,963
And increasingly, the thing,

761
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:43,325
as I've so lovingly called it, solidifies.

762
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,247
This process is a necessary part of the work,

763
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:51,168
and it's a part of life too, right?

764
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:53,808
We have little choice but to persist

765
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,429
through the unending number of curveballs thrown our way,

766
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,110
starting with being born.

767
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,410
And so we do our best to adapt.

768
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,931
The curveballs often take us down paths we would never take,

769
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:08,252
or could have never imagined.

770
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:14,620
They open doors for us that would otherwise remain closed,

771
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,662
and they lead us to new conclusions.

772
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:19,425
They change us.

773
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,689
In my opinion, this malleable process

774
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,951
is often necessary to complete a work,

775
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:30,856
regardless of whether we see or believe in it at the time.

776
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:34,119
I find that only in the days that follow

777
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,241
can I truly begin to comprehend its meaning.

778
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,274
When starting work on a new project,

779
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:41,275
I often set off in the first direction

780
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:42,735
that sparks my curiosity.

781
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,297
I try to keep the utilitarian needs

782
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:48,498
of a video game in mind,

783
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:50,858
but if I'm staring down a new idea,

784
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:52,699
I seize it as an exciting challenge.

785
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,241
This tendency of mine perpetuates a myth

786
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,282
I can't help but tell myself time and time again.

787
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:03,723
This will work, right?

788
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:10,635
Before I know it, I might be neck deep in an esoteric cobweb of systems,

789
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:14,356
or sinking large units of time into something wonderful.

790
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,637
Or wonderfully inappropriate.

791
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,920
I'm guilty of occasionally forgetting that, when working on a project

792
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,742
with real-world restraints, my ideas have to be grounded in that same reality.

793
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,901
So I spent a few years creating music and sound

794
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,681
for a game called Hyper Light Drifter.

795
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:41,703
During this time, I had a dream that I would write long,

796
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:44,003
artfully composed pieces of music.

797
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:47,424
They would move effortlessly from idea to idea,

798
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,285
all while evoking the perfect expression

799
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:51,205
every step of the way.

800
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:53,586
I wanted to write these songs at the piano

801
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:57,126
and notate them completely before even thinking about

802
00:38:57,226 --> 00:39:00,227
the electronic production or how they would

803
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,641
even be implemented in a video game.

804
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,843
Here I had created a set of goals for myself,

805
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,125
which is often something I do during a project.

806
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:11,768
But this time, they ended up not suiting me

807
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:12,848
or the project at all.

808
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:21,455
First off, I hated using software notation,

809
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:23,636
and I wasted a lot of time

810
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:25,658
inefficiently grumbling my way through it.

811
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:32,599
Second, the piano pieces I had written with all their shifts in tempo, energy, and tone

812
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,720
were very hard to translate to an electronic sound.

813
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,880
They were kind of glued to the sound of the piano.

814
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:46,802
I underestimated the difficulty of recreating the essence of a performance from a completely

815
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,582
different context.

816
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:52,483
I've transferred pieces to new instruments before, and thinking this was no different

817
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,943
or assuming, I took it for granted.

818
00:39:57,925 --> 00:40:00,606
Lastly, the compositional style was not nearly agile enough

819
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,749
to keep up with contextual changes during gameplay.

820
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:08,972
For example, the player would move into a new area

821
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:09,953
and start doing a new thing.

822
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:12,975
And the music would be off somewhere else,

823
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:14,816
expressing some other idea.

824
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:18,438
It was really hard to find that, by the way.

825
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:19,979
I was surprised.

826
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,481
It seems obvious looking back,

827
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,322
but at the time I thought I could pull it off.

828
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:29,234
The path I had chosen proved to be a long, brambly one with a big dead end sign.

829
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,259
It was emotionally tough to put so much time and effort into an unsuccessful direction,

830
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,860
and it took a while to pick myself up and set out again.

831
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:43,243
I only stumbled into the right solution when I was thrown a curveball.

832
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,666
The developer decided to create a demo.

833
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,661
and I suddenly needed to drop what I was doing

834
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,742
and write music for a very large vertical slice

835
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:55,503
of the game in a very short period of time.

836
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,025
Granted, it was a curveball I was aware of,

837
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:03,027
but due to poor planning, it crept up on me in a way

838
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:05,288
that I think still serves the purpose of this talk.

839
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:09,430
Feeling urgency, I had to forgo my agenda

840
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,131
and just write something.

841
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:13,272
Anything.

842
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,193
And put it in the game.

843
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,054
This simple process yielded the best results

844
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,776
and changed the trajectory of the project for me.

845
00:41:23,676 --> 00:41:24,877
And so I learned a valuable lesson.

846
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,500
Sometimes I am too precious about my work.

847
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:33,083
I tend to inflate the importance of ideas I've devised

848
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,445
before they've ever proven themselves to work.

849
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,267
And sometimes it's hard for me

850
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:42,410
to let go of those expectations and move forward.

851
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,198
Towards the end of Hyper Light Drifter,

852
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,439
as the pressure really started to mount,

853
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:51,160
and I was struggling creatively,

854
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,881
I picked up a mantra.

855
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:55,922
Broad strokes.

856
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:00,144
Painting with broad strokes

857
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,525
has often been counterintuitive for me,

858
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:03,966
and it still is.

859
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,028
The rabbit hole is my favorite pitfall,

860
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,228
pun intended.

861
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:12,170
But by prototyping my work in practice,

862
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:13,671
not in a vacuum,

863
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:17,225
and saving detail-oriented decisions for later,

864
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:20,005
I've started to save lots of time.

865
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:23,626
The curveballs are frequent now,

866
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:26,447
but they are more useful than ever.

867
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,228
Thank you.

868
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:28,508
Thank you.

869
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:32,309
Thank you.

870
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,029
Thank you.

871
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:33,389
Thank you.

872
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:33,809
Thank you.

873
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:34,189
Thank you.

874
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:34,909
Thank you.

875
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,010
Thank you.

876
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,250
Thank you.

877
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:38,410
Finally.

878
00:42:42,924 --> 00:42:48,026
A titan of our industry, the order, Tomb Raider, Dead Space, etc, etc, etc.

879
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:49,947
Jason Graves.

880
00:42:56,129 --> 00:43:00,291
I hope you guys are having as much fun as we are up here, because honestly we didn't

881
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,971
know what anybody was going to be talking about.

882
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:03,952
So how many composers have we got out there?

883
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:04,472
Hands up.

884
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:10,275
All right, how many of you folks are basically terrified of failing all the time?

885
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:11,055
Hands up.

886
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:12,095
Yeah.

887
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:19,829
My name is Jason Graves and I'm addicted to attempting to fail.

888
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:27,795
This is Composer Confessions and my confession is I really love to push boundaries and I

889
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:36,601
don't feel like I'm really doing that if I'm not on the precipice of getting fired, you

890
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:36,781
know?

891
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:41,704
Like, how far can I go with what they're talking about, with what they want?

892
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:42,985
Oh my gosh, that's still up there.

893
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:43,305
All right.

894
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:43,505
All right.

895
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:50,814
Prepare now there's been some really nice presentations so far, but I I mean Austin save the the best

896
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,456
graphics interface and everything for last

897
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:05,924
So I'm gonna talk about a couple of different games from a franchise called dead space and a lot of this

898
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:10,027
It's probably unknown because it was all behind-the-scenes stuff, but

899
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:18,611
I'm gonna give a couple of examples and then I'm gonna talk about why I love the idea of setting yourself up for possible failure.

900
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:25,054
I hate that word failure and I know it was in Composer Confessions, but I see it as more like opportunity than anything else.

901
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:28,435
So Dead Space 3, I believe.

902
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:32,656
Um, no, uh, we're, we're...

903
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:34,857
The audio is not there.

904
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:38,058
No, that's audio, but...

905
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:50,730
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

906
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:58,075
So this is all music that was not used in the game, and it was all recorded live.

907
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:04,526
And at one point in time there was going to be this giant spaceship, I'm not making this up,

908
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:09,909
a giant spaceship of redneck, uh, like truckers from space that you were going to be doing things

909
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:15,451
with. We were going to do country songs, like space cowboy country songs. We were going to

910
00:45:15,491 --> 00:45:18,213
have all kinds of crazy sort of country...

911
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:23,378
influence kinds of things in the score. And those of you who are not familiar with Dead Space,

912
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:28,382
it's very organic sounds that are completely messed up in a very natural way.

913
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:30,144
People just playing their instruments wrong.

914
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:37,571
So, as a result, I had two weeks of recording in Nashville with electric guitars, accordions.

915
00:45:37,992 --> 00:45:44,275
harmoniums, pedal steel players, vocalists, all kinds of experimental stuff that I just

916
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:49,177
sort of pulled some things real quick to play. This is more the ambient stuff, but there was

917
00:45:49,357 --> 00:45:54,859
action in there as well, and it's all country music. It's just, you know, the perverted version

918
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:57,521
of country music. And it was really one of those moments.

919
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:02,043
I was like, this is the third one, I feel like I want to do something a little bit different,

920
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:06,306
and they want to do country, so how far can I push it before they just, you know, say you're in,

921
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:11,989
you're crazy, you don't, you can't do that. And this was the result, and everyone seemed to like

922
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:17,693
it a lot, but there was a lot of internal shifting, if any of you remember when Dead Space 3 came out,

923
00:46:17,713 --> 00:46:21,535
it was a little confused, it wasn't sure, is it horror, is it action, what's, what's kind of

924
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:25,818
going on, and the audio director that came in was like, no, we don't want any country stuff,

925
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:27,319
and just, just cut everything.

926
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:29,140
And it was a lot of music.

927
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,943
It was a lot of me pouring my heart into it and working with all these players

928
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,664
and learning all these new techniques.

929
00:46:35,244 --> 00:46:36,425
It didn't make it into the game.

930
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,607
And oh gosh, I haven't figured out anything to do with it yet.

931
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:40,168
But.

932
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,391
It introduced me to Nashville.

933
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:47,993
And I became friends with Alan there, who's the contractor and also plays violin.

934
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:52,515
And I've been there five or six times recording orchestral scores and small pickup things.

935
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:56,736
And that was all through hanging out with him while we were recording this Dead Space 3 stuff.

936
00:46:57,076 --> 00:47:00,237
And it's really one of those whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

937
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:06,479
And I try to push as hard as I can, no matter how scary it might be or how much I'm convinced

938
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,120
that I don't know how I'm going to make this work.

939
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,401
If I'm not in that position mentally, then...

940
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:14,263
it's almost like that's when I operate my best.

941
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:16,385
That's when I'm really feeling charged

942
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:19,027
and trying to do something really different.

943
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,548
So I'm gonna go backwards to Dead Space 1,

944
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:24,590
which originally had a much different idea

945
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:26,572
in terms of the tone of the gameplay.

946
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:29,574
And I think it's really cool being composers up here.

947
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:32,556
Our music is so influential in how people feel

948
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:33,397
when they play the game.

949
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:36,319
And the original Dead Space wasn't necessarily super scary.

950
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:37,760
It had more of a...

951
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:43,685
of feel.

952
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,742
But it never really worked.

953
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:02,242
We ended up deciding to throw out like 30 minutes of music

954
00:48:02,782 --> 00:48:05,363
and go with the opposite kind of approach,

955
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:07,104
where there's no rhythm, there's no melody.

956
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,925
There's like, what can you do to terrify the player the most?

957
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:13,586
I love talking over my own music if you haven't noticed.

958
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:15,466
So this is what we ended up doing instead.

959
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:19,827
Awkward pause, awkward pause.

960
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:21,508
It's coming.

961
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:43,000
Now the interesting thing about this music, the first track was all done in MIDI with

962
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,221
me in my own studio.

963
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,903
To do this scary stuff, they wanted to have control over the music but they wanted it

964
00:48:49,923 --> 00:48:52,664
to be scary and there were no aleatoric libraries back then.

965
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:57,506
And the audio director at the time, Don Becker, said, well how can you give us the scariest

966
00:48:57,566 --> 00:48:59,687
music in the world but let us have control over it?

967
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:00,047
And I was like, oh!

968
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:00,107
Ha!

969
00:49:00,127 --> 00:49:00,167
Ha!

970
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:00,247
Ha!

971
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:00,307
Ha!

972
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:00,407
Ha!

973
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:00,567
Ha!

974
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:00,647
Ha!

975
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:00,707
Ha!

976
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:04,069
You know, if you want to do something like that, you're going to need to go and give

977
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:05,430
me all the live budget up front.

978
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,932
Let me go record the orchestra playing all these different sounds and things, and then

979
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:13,015
give me months to cut it all up and put it together into something, and maybe give you

980
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:14,095
a demo after that.

981
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:19,119
But we were on like a six-month plan, at the least, thinking of course he would never go

982
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:19,439
for it.

983
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,720
And he's like, yeah, man, let's do that.

984
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:26,913
which that was the ultimate setting myself up,

985
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:28,594
you know, enough rope to hang yourself

986
00:49:28,994 --> 00:49:29,895
and all that kind of stuff.

987
00:49:30,115 --> 00:49:32,697
And I was terrified the entire time I was working on the job.

988
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:34,598
I was going to GDC talking on a panel

989
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,140
and in between my panel and the next panel

990
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,041
I was gonna attend, I was going back to my hotel room

991
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:40,122
and working on orchestration

992
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:42,164
and trying to figure out what to do with the players.

993
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:46,687
But I learned so much from all of that unknown territory

994
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:48,168
at first that I was just completely...

995
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:53,110
terrified of. And of course everyone says, well, that's why the music is so scary.

996
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,091
No, it's scary because I grew

997
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:59,513
numb to making it. It's not scary enough. I have to make it scarier.

998
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:02,194
But just having that sort of drive to

999
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:08,157
do something different and to really get it under my fingers and feel confident

1000
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:08,817
that

1001
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:13,420
about halfway through the project maybe, you know, I think this is gonna work, I think it's gonna work,

1002
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,382
and then usually by the time everything's finished, it ends up working,

1003
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,564
but it's not something that's been completely intentional.

1004
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:22,065
It's not something I think that any of us are feeling like,

1005
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:24,647
oh man, we've got this, you know, don't sweat.

1006
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:26,508
I mean, maybe we've got the martini glass and we're like,

1007
00:50:26,548 --> 00:50:28,209
I know exactly what you want, don't worry about it.

1008
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:32,172
But inside, we're terrified because we're trying something new.

1009
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:35,594
And I've seen people from Jerry Goldsmith to John Williams.

1010
00:50:36,154 --> 00:50:40,836
Bernard Herrmann, I mean, any of these amazing media composers talk about how terrified they

1011
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:45,719
are at being creative, trying something new, putting yourself out there, but the more you

1012
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:45,979
do it...

1013
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,579
you're still terrified all the time,

1014
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:50,540
but at least you have a little bit of a background,

1015
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,880
like, okay, I've done it before,

1016
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,661
I know I'm gonna somehow do it again,

1017
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:55,541
and you just keep moving forward,

1018
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:57,502
and you use all that stuff that you learned

1019
00:50:57,582 --> 00:51:00,622
from the last time you internally almost were fired,

1020
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:01,883
even though no one thought that,

1021
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:05,584
and it's the next gig, and you're starting over,

1022
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:07,944
and pushing yourself, and learning more.

1023
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,525
So I'm gonna end with a little emoji thing,

1024
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:12,285
and when we go to the last slide?

1025
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:13,126
Okay, great.

1026
00:51:13,726 --> 00:51:14,006
Austin.

1027
00:51:14,526 --> 00:51:16,246
All right, we have 10 minutes for questions.

1028
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:25,766
Thank you all.

1029
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:27,346
Have at it.

1030
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:28,446
Smartin?

1031
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:28,987
Yeah.

1032
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:29,547
Yeah.

1033
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:30,807
Austin, this question's for you.

1034
00:51:31,227 --> 00:51:31,608
Oh, God.

1035
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:38,170
Well, based on your well-documented ability

1036
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:42,571
to write really relaxing music, I

1037
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:45,652
was wondering if you have considered maybe switching

1038
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:50,334
to a lucrative career writing for Muzak and spa meditation

1039
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:50,794
CDs.

1040
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,195
Well, I just resell the stuff I do write.

1041
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,635
Damn it.

1042
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:55,902
I don't have to even switch careers.

1043
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:57,723
Thanks for that, though.

1044
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:00,645
Hey, guys.

1045
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:01,966
That was a great presentation.

1046
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:03,867
This question is for all of you.

1047
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:06,929
When you have multiple projects you're working on,

1048
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:10,070
especially when they involve different styles,

1049
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,272
like one game is going to be completely orchestral,

1050
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:16,814
and another project is going to be like death metal

1051
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:20,056
electronica, how do you approach that?

1052
00:52:20,216 --> 00:52:22,137
Like, what's your process?

1053
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:29,866
For me, I try to build up a little bit of momentum on the individual projects so that I can

1054
00:52:30,387 --> 00:52:33,270
Give myself like a buffer zone to kind of get into that headspace

1055
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,052
So, you know

1056
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:39,277
I might I might work on one thing for a week at a time and then switch if

1057
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,840
But you kind of have to figure it out based on you know

1058
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,723
What the projects are and what the requirements are but that seems to work for me

1059
00:52:46,158 --> 00:52:47,578
I could say panic probably.

1060
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:49,719
About all the things you need to do.

1061
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:52,140
It's like a million different styles and like everyone wants it tomorrow.

1062
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,001
Everyone wants it like yesterday, you know.

1063
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,982
So I think that you do panic a little bit.

1064
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:58,683
But I think panic is probably quite healthy and it gets you going.

1065
00:52:59,143 --> 00:52:59,923
But, you know,

1066
00:53:00,184 --> 00:53:02,725
nothing you do is ever going to work out like you think it's going to work out.

1067
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:04,926
Everything you're going to do is always going to go wrong somewhere.

1068
00:53:04,946 --> 00:53:06,466
It's always going to be like, I'm going to manage it

1069
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:07,847
and then I'm not going to manage it and you're going to

1070
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:09,767
shit yourself and think, I'm never going to get there.

1071
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:10,188
So...

1072
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:13,911
It's never going to be perfectly scheduled out so you're going to get time to work on

1073
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:17,894
everything. You just got to panic and get on with it. That's it. Make a start.

1074
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:23,098
Yeah, time wise is one problem but for me it's sometimes just conceptually getting yourself

1075
00:53:23,178 --> 00:53:25,700
back into that sound world. And like being...

1076
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,945
That can be very challenging. I can add that I, for what it's worth, I really love when I

1077
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:36,149
have juxtaposed projects that are radically unlike each other because the whiplash of

1078
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:38,111
shifting gears actually helps make...

1079
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,130
each direction of travel feel fresher.

1080
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:45,532
Because if I wrote nothing but the big sweeping

1081
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:49,073
orchestral thing, then it would certainly

1082
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:50,814
get stale and flat immediately.

1083
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:53,075
But if in the middle of that, we're

1084
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:54,195
interleaving all these.

1085
00:53:54,716 --> 00:54:02,424
forays into other stuff. For me, I'm wired to benefit from that. I like it. So to me,

1086
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:08,090
the problem you're identifying is a good situation. Also, just ask Jason to hug you.

1087
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,031
He does that quite a bit.

1088
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:12,234
We're going to share the mic because I've got four mics down there. I've found that

1089
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:15,297
splitting it up just an entire day dedicated to one project, I think is a good idea.

1090
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,739
And then I'm finished that day on that project.

1091
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:20,160
And then I start thinking about the other project

1092
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,041
for the next morning.

1093
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:22,662
By the time I get up in the morning,

1094
00:54:22,702 --> 00:54:25,144
I'm completely dedicated to that second project.

1095
00:54:25,324 --> 00:54:28,246
Or even at extreme times, it's been split during the day.

1096
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:30,627
But I say, at 12.30, I'm working on the other one.

1097
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,530
And I try to do the best I can to mentally compartmentalize

1098
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:34,770
those.

1099
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,830
OK.

1100
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:36,051
I'm just going to stop.

1101
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,492
No worries.

1102
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:37,752
Thanks, guys.

1103
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:37,972
Thanks.

1104
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:47,642
Hey guys. So question, this is coming from a non-professional composer. I'm a game dev that doesn't actually do composition.

1105
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:54,688
So back before the technology became what it was today, people tended to have different areas of games that had loops,

1106
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:59,171
and it was like a 30 second loop or a minute loop of music. Thinking back to like the Zelda N64 days.

1107
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:01,673
Still very much how we do things.

1108
00:55:03,394 --> 00:55:08,296
So a lot of the melodies that were there are very, you recognize them, you hear it, you're like, oh, that's that area of this game.

1109
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:17,900
With all these ambient layers and stuff going on, how do you try to keep melodies that you can recognize and that people can recognize in new games that require that, to use that new technology?

1110
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:24,983
Well, I apparently don't write melodic scores, so I'm not qualified to answer that.

1111
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,204
I actually have an answer that, um...

1112
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:32,395
might be a little upstream, but I think it's actually up to the design of the game.

1113
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:39,017
Because what I always find is important is to just identify moments in the game where

1114
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:42,799
you can bring music to the forefront, rather than trying to have every single piece be

1115
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,139
this incredibly melodic.

1116
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:47,160
I don't think that really works with games anymore.

1117
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:51,322
But what you can do, for example, how many people here have played Red Dead Redemption?

1118
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:53,976
And you know exactly where I'm going with this.

1119
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:56,678
As soon as you go to Mexico and it plays that beautiful song,

1120
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:59,100
that's a musical moment that everyone remembers.

1121
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,362
And that didn't come about because they said,

1122
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:03,804
oh yeah, let's have this awesome song all the time.

1123
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,406
No, they identified a moment in the story

1124
00:56:06,606 --> 00:56:08,047
and in the gameplay where this would work.

1125
00:56:08,487 --> 00:56:10,169
And they cut out the AI and they made sure

1126
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:11,409
you couldn't get attacked or whatever.

1127
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,711
But everyone kind of came together and they planned for it.

1128
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:15,212
So it's actually something that you

1129
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:17,094
as a designer can help as well.

1130
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:24,511
Yeah, if you pick your spots and you underline certain moments, it kind of gives them, you know, it can give those moments more, I guess, gravitas.

1131
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:30,094
And it's a good thing to, can be a good thing to do with melodies so that, you know, you kind of remember those melodies.

1132
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:39,419
Yeah, I think also a simple trick that I use a lot in both Journey and Abzu, but I use it in general, is...

1133
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:48,468
I treat melodies as big as one shots often when entering an area to the point of like

1134
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,192
the Red Dead Redemption example, but it can be even within a single cue where

1135
00:56:52,629 --> 00:56:56,631
you know, player comes over the hill, we announce a big melody, but when it loops, the melody

1136
00:56:56,711 --> 00:57:01,754
doesn't loop with it, and the sort of support, accompaniment, backing track, whatever, does

1137
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:07,718
loop, which is by design more sort of simple or ambient or whatever the case, so that it

1138
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:11,420
feels like you've just made this giant statement, but you're also not just bludgeoning it to

1139
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,301
death because that actually ends up taking away from it.

1140
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:18,143
My favorite example is, I love to take like a ten second excerpt of the Rite of Spring

1141
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:21,145
and just loop it over and over to see just how fast it becomes the...

1142
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:24,868
from one of the best things ever written to one of the worst things ever written.

1143
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,851
And so like the loopingness is the problem.

1144
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:30,713
It's not designed for that.

1145
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:36,937
So figuring out ways to be able to make your big statement and then not, you know, beat it to death.

1146
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:38,058
Cool. Thank you.

1147
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:41,201
I think I tend to beat it to death most of the time.

1148
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:46,305
And that's why when we go to PAX, everyone comes to ask for your autograph.

1149
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:47,065
Don't start that.

1150
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:49,865
Sir, Mr. Colvin.

1151
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:50,726
Hello.

1152
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:54,891
So I'm a developer, and I've been that person who's

1153
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:56,152
giving the feedback.

1154
00:57:56,853 --> 00:58:00,777
And that person has been giving the brief, so sorry, guys.

1155
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,561
I just wanted to ask, what kinds of brief

1156
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:08,025
do you wish you got from developers that you don't get?

1157
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:09,226
Oh, that's great.

1158
00:58:09,812 --> 00:58:10,893
I'm just going to jump straight in there.

1159
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:15,177
The thing that annoys me the most is when you're pitching on a project and they give

1160
00:58:15,218 --> 00:58:19,362
you a single page that describes the game in a very high level way and they go, so what

1161
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:20,743
would the main theme sound like?

1162
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:25,109
you have no clue what the main theme's gonna sound like.

1163
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:27,291
You have a single page to work from, you know?

1164
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,132
To me, the main theme's often the last thing

1165
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:30,153
that comes from the project.

1166
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,155
And often, you know, the composer that they choose

1167
00:58:33,195 --> 00:58:35,637
to go with can often be selected from that round.

1168
00:58:35,697 --> 00:58:37,798
And that's kind of a really weird thing for me.

1169
00:58:38,299 --> 00:58:39,420
But it's just kind of what I was talking about,

1170
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,921
just getting to know everybody and things like that.

1171
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:42,822
The point I was trying to make there is so,

1172
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:45,945
when you say to a composer, I want you to make it grand,

1173
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:48,446
your definition of grand is completely understood

1174
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:49,787
by the composer that you're working with.

1175
00:58:50,308 --> 00:58:54,030
I mean, what I mean is grand, what Rich think is grand, what you think is grand is very, very different.

1176
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:57,232
So it's having that shared, common, creative language that's very important.

1177
00:58:57,252 --> 00:59:02,174
And it's always good to like, ask for, you know, some YouTube links or some MP3s

1178
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:05,476
or things that you think might suit the style of game you're working on or whatever it may be.

1179
00:59:05,816 --> 00:59:08,397
So at least it puts you in the right direction, rather than just kind of going,

1180
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:11,799
I worked for somebody who said, you know, I don't know what the music should sound like, but I'll know it when I hear it.

1181
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:15,841
And that's a bit like, I could be hitting next Christmas writing this music, you know, it's completely useless.

1182
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:19,583
You get a guy who sends you four YouTube, or one YouTube clip of something that he likes.

1183
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:21,805
You get that straight away, you understand it, right?

1184
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,447
You know, and sometimes getting briefs with no MP3s is a bit crap

1185
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:27,628
because you don't know what they really mean by what they're saying.

1186
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,690
I've like read briefs that I need to pitch for

1187
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,512
and thinking that they're asking for some bizarre combination of...

1188
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:40,204
Something plus hip-hop which it used to be all the time now whatever you write write jazz but with a hip-hop beat write big band

1189
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:43,886
But whatever it is right so like it seems to be stick hip-hop in it

1190
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:47,488
Whatever it is and so you know it's just it's just senseless. They need to send you something

1191
00:59:47,508 --> 00:59:54,032
I got some of the same people said we want something that isn't like this, but it's got the right energy

1192
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:55,353
And I was like what?

1193
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:58,315
What on earth is that all about right so just send?

1194
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:04,138
Send a couple of YouTube clips or some MPD's you think are in the right direction at least give us a clue all right

1195
01:00:04,555 --> 01:00:04,895
I'll try.

1196
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:09,876
I think we can probably take one last one here and then we're out.

1197
01:00:10,696 --> 01:00:11,817
Sort of a personal question.

1198
01:00:12,337 --> 01:00:12,817
Sorry, Jesse.

1199
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:18,258
I actually just wanted to give an answer to this guy.

1200
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:20,059
You can do that in your own time, Jesse.

1201
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,639
Get your own talk.

1202
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:32,822
If you could name two people, one modern era composer or artist that you really admire

1203
01:00:34,913 --> 01:00:36,714
previous era composer.

1204
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:38,855
For me one of the-

1205
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,116
You mentioned Stravinsky so.

1206
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:43,038
Yeah, several previous eras.

1207
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:44,799
For me Jerry Goldsmith

1208
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:46,480
is sort of king of kings

1209
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,881
but today, these days I have

1210
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,283
to say I am in the

1211
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:52,883
club of Johann Johansson

1212
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:53,724
devotees.

1213
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:55,325
That's my answer.

1214
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:57,866
Come on Greg

1215
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,147
it's your turn.

1216
01:00:59,167 --> 01:00:59,327
Come on.

1217
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:09,508
Well, modern day, I really, I love John Williams.

1218
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:15,651
I just classical, you know, so modern, yeah, thank you.

1219
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:18,413
I've been sticking with films, well, no Stravinsky.

1220
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:20,494
I love Stravinsky, ballet suites and all that stuff.

1221
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:21,635
That's what I first listened to.

1222
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:23,836
I love how programmatic it is and through composed.

1223
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:26,538
And it reminds me of film music.

1224
01:01:26,598 --> 01:01:27,278
It tells a story.

1225
01:01:28,502 --> 01:01:30,203
Yeah, I'm John Williams' God, without a doubt.

1226
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,626
And I guess, I'm a bit of a metal fan,

1227
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:35,428
so I guess like Queensryche or something like that,

1228
01:01:35,448 --> 01:01:38,230
Judas Priest, that's the kind of thing that I like.

1229
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,272
Probably, I'd probably headbang quite happily to that

1230
01:01:40,512 --> 01:01:41,173
for all day long.

1231
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:43,575
And I guess, like Vaughan Williams and Elgar

1232
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:45,216
are my kind of classical guys that I really like a lot.

1233
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,641
I mean, I'm another Stravinsky guy, but to list another name,

1234
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:53,402
Hindemith is one of my all-time favorite classical composers,

1235
01:01:53,722 --> 01:01:54,622
early 20th century.

1236
01:01:55,122 --> 01:01:56,162
And as far as modern folks,

1237
01:01:56,603 --> 01:01:58,583
Yoko Kanno is probably my favorite by far.

1238
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:02,384
Anime composer for those who...

1239
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:03,825
I don't really have an answer.

1240
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:04,865
To me, it's all just music.

1241
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:05,865
I love everything.

1242
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,026
There's not one specific thing that I like

1243
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:09,527
and one specific thing that I don't like.

1244
01:02:10,007 --> 01:02:11,447
It's all the same notes on the page to me,

1245
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:12,707
so I don't have anything.

1246
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:13,688
I'm sorry, that's a lame answer.

1247
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:15,722
I'm going to be a little weird.

1248
01:02:16,522 --> 01:02:18,803
I'm kind of similar because I listen to a lot of music.

1249
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:20,824
And maybe nothing particular stands out.

1250
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:23,186
But what does stand out for me is actually

1251
01:02:23,646 --> 01:02:24,806
artists in other mediums.

1252
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:28,928
So I was actually thinking of Miyazaki and Mobius, who, for

1253
01:02:28,968 --> 01:02:31,069
some reason, visual art kind of speaks to me and kind of

1254
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:32,790
inspires me to write music.

1255
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:37,132
Thanks all for coming.
