Hello and welcome to GDC 2021.

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:19,615
This is our live AMA Q&A with Global Game Jams, Kate Edwards.

3
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,096
That was a lot of letters all at once.

4
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:24,058
I'm Joel Kinshore, Editor-in-Chief of Indie Games Plus.

5
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:25,899
I'll be the moderator for this session.

6
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:31,162
My pronouns are he, him, and I am ridiculously excited to announce Kate Edwards.

7
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,719
If you've got a ton of questions for her, let's rock.

8
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:36,359
Yeah, absolutely.

9
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,859
Thank you so much for having me here.

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,460
It's great.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,020
As a longtime participant in GDC,

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,121
this is a little bit different from what I'm used to,

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,721
but that's great.

14
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:48,182
So absolutely, let's get moving on this.

15
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:50,123
Very cool.

16
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:51,243
So I'm gonna jump right in

17
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:52,463
before anybody else has any questions

18
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,244
because I'm lucky I can do that.

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,304
What first interested you

20
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,885
in bringing your geographer experience into video games?

21
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,825
Cause that's, that sounds really interesting to me.

22
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:07,851
Yeah, that was really kind of a mistake, a happy mistake, because I, you know, like many

23
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:13,853
people in my generation who are, you know, above 50 or in our, you know, up there, more

24
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:19,256
veteran status, I guess, we didn't, game design and game, you know, creating games, there's

25
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,976
not really a clear career path.

26
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,819
You know, coming out of high school or in the college days.

27
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,681
So for me, I basically pursued what I was interested in,

28
00:01:27,182 --> 00:01:29,223
which was, you know, wanting to be an astronaut,

29
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,506
wanting to be an artist for Lucasfilm because I want to work on Star Wars

30
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:36,590
and then eventually settled on geography and cartography

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,333
because I've always had this incredible interest in cultures and travel

32
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,474
and maps and everything.

33
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:45,478
And plus the artistic artistic skill I had, I could use with cartography.

34
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:52,703
And so basically to make a really long story short, I pursued that field and I'm really happy I did.

35
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:58,306
It's been fantastic and I ended up doing my graduate school work at the University of Washington in

36
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:05,090
Seattle and I just finished my master's degree which was focused on using VR for cartography.

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,535
That was way back in 1991 and Microsoft called our department and said they needed a cartographer to

38
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,097
work on a cart encyclopedia, which some people out there might remember.

39
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:20,202
And so I went over to Microsoft on what I thought was going to be like a really short-term contract

40
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:26,187
to be a cartographer and you know basically help create the maps for the initial version of Encarta.

41
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,412
Well that turned into a longer and longer contracts and eventually a full-time position

42
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:37,819
and I in that full-time role which was still initially mainly focused on the cartography in

43
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,164
In Carta World Atlas, in Carta Encyclopedia, Streets and Trips, like all the mapping products that Microsoft was doing.

44
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:54,031
I did get asked by the Flight Sim team at one point, they're like, hey, you know, you're a cartographer, we need some help with some advice on this.

45
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,172
But where it really started for me,

46
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,153
when I really started working on games,

47
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:02,715
was I created an internal team at Microsoft

48
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,696
called Geopolitical Strategy,

49
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:07,858
because I noticed that the company was having struggles

50
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:11,419
with maintaining knowledge around what is sensitive

51
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,861
from a political standpoint or cultural standpoint.

52
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:19,305
um in the content that they were producing and so like you know the office tea would make a mistake

53
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:24,050
in one market and then you know another product group who does you know completely across the

54
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,653
company would make a similar mistake and then they'd get in all this really big trouble with

55
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:33,118
the government because you know they were making these mistakes and so I basically determined that

56
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,141
this is a weakness and so there needs to be a group that coordinates that kind of knowledge

57
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:37,882
across the company.

58
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,644
So once I created that team, that was way back in 1998,

59
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:46,389
that also gave me the mandate to work on all Microsoft products,

60
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:50,253
including all the games. So I started working on all the PC

61
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:54,436
stuff back then, like all the Age of Empires and Asheron's

62
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:58,340
Call and all those kinds of games, MechWarrior. And then of course, we got

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,242
into the early Xbox, you know, because Xbox had that

64
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:07,864
But then I got to basically work on all of those Microsoft franchises.

65
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:13,365
Halo, you know, obviously, Fable, Forza, all of that stuff.

66
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,946
And that's when I really found like this is my calling.

67
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:20,587
I get to do what I call culturalization work on video games.

68
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,048
So it's basically this incredible confluence of everything I love.

69
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,729
Technology, creative media, games.

70
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:34,878
Geography, cartography, all of this stuff came together in a really strange way, and I'm so thankful that it did.

71
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,760
And I love what I do.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,386
Yeah, it sounds like it's really interesting work and it works well to all your interests.

73
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,237
And if the audience has any questions, feel free to jump in, throw those in the chat.

74
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:50,618
Otherwise, I'm just going to keep taking over the whole talk because I'm super busy.

75
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:54,059
I want to keep pushing forward. Can you tell us some of the...do you have some interesting

76
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,820
stories on your work with like Halo or Call of Duty or any of those?

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,982
Oh yeah, there's a lot of stories. I mean, probably one that has become...I've used this in

78
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:10,903
some of my lectures...one that caused a lot of problems is we had one game...

79
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:14,365
that probably a lot of people have never heard of or don't remember called

80
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,547
Cockroach Chogen, which was on the original Xbox.

81
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:19,449
It was like a hand-to-hand fighting game.

82
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:24,952
And the problem is that the game included a initially included an audio file

83
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,534
that had chanting from the Quran.

84
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:29,175
So it was, you know, I do remember this.

85
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,956
Yeah. So it was Harjinder Raab, but.

86
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:51,903
Yeah, no, exactly. So it was chanting lyrics from the Quran, which they, you know, basically that's probably that's not appropriate to have in a game in that kind of context. And so, you know, when I raised the concern, it was it was brought to me. And then I verified it with someone who was, who was in my building, who's actually originally from Kurdistan.

87
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:55,305
And so he's like, yeah, he's like, this is going to be a big problem.

88
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,466
I'm like, yeah, I figured that.

89
00:05:56,626 --> 00:06:01,088
So basically, the decision was made to fix it right away.

90
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:04,570
But the problem was that we already had actual copies of the game

91
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,272
already printed and literally rolling on their way to stores.

92
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:13,918
And so the challenge then is like, what are we supposed to do with all those copies that are out there?

93
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,260
And of course, my decision was just destroy them.

94
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,023
I mean, recall them and just, you know, we'll make new ones.

95
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:23,827
Because for a company like Microsoft, it's not that expensive, you know, to redo that.

96
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:28,452
But the decision was made to go ahead and release only the U.S.

97
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:32,155
because the feeling was that it should not be a big issue, even though.

98
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:38,016
As a geographer, I'm like, did you know that there's, you know, eight or nine million Muslims in the United States?

99
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,858
Did you know that's like Detroit's 50% Muslim?

100
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,801
It's like we are not a homogeneous society here.

101
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:48,885
So there are people in this country who are going to be, you know, who are going to notice this.

102
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,167
And I was told, don't worry about it.

103
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:56,311
So basically, you know, and the decision was kind of a convoluted decision.

104
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,893
I'm not going to go into how that was made, but basically.

105
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:09,577
Because the game did release, we did get a letter from the government of Saudi Arabia that basically was telling us that this was a huge problem.

106
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:17,560
It became front page news in the Middle East really rapidly. It really started to explode in the region as a negative piece of news.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:34,249
And so I eventually was asked by the head of the Middle East region of Microsoft to come over there and basically help do damage control because I, as a geographer and in the role I served in Microsoft, I knew, you know, the complex issues behind it and why this is going to be sensitive.

108
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:41,093
So they said it'd be great if somebody from headquarters like you could come over and actually explain what's going on and what happened.

109
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:47,724
And so I did, and I ended up going to Riyadh, and I landed in Riyadh two days before the

110
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:53,206
second Gulf War started. So that was exciting. So exciting is a word for it.

111
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:56,848
You know, and I didn't really, I wasn't really thinking about it. Obviously, I was aware of what

112
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:00,669
was going on in the world. But at the same time, I'm like, well, that's my job, I need to go there

113
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:07,512
and do this. And so what was fascinating is that, you know, I sat in front of representatives of the

114
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:11,314
religious council of the Saudi government to explain to them.

115
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:16,576
And it was to say it was a bit uncomfortable is an understatement.

116
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:23,218
But basically, to shorten the story, you know, I basically explained to them what happened.

117
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,220
And, you know, they accepted the apology and then we just moved on.

118
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,423
Then I went over to Dubai and had to do something similar, even though, you know, the UAE is a more liberal culture within the region.

119
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,483
So it wasn't quite as stringent there.

120
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:42,205
But the point being is that one audio file that somebody did not check,

121
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:45,545
that nobody asked, like, what are these lyrics? Where is this from?

122
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:52,567
All because of that, the game eventually was globally recalled because it just was so caustic.

123
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:57,708
It created such negative PR. And, yeah, it was unfortunate.

124
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:01,249
It actually showed up on eBay for a while, like, hey, banned video game.

125
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,150
Actually, the price was fairly high at one point, but then, of course, it immediately dropped.

126
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:15,076
So that was just one example of many, many kinds of challenges in this space that you have to deal with because, you know, choices have consequences.

127
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:22,221
And we have to be super careful about where we're, you know, putting in games, even though, you know, the developer said, well, we put it in there because it sounds cool.

128
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:29,987
And I agree, it does sound cool. It's a beautiful lyrics. It's a beautiful music to listen to. But the context is just not appropriate.

129
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,173
Yeah, you definitely have to keep these things in mind.

130
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:37,117
And it's good that there's folks like you who are working to kind of like be at the forefront of this stuff.

131
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:42,241
How do you stay up to date on what's going on in the world for your culturalization work?

132
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:43,923
That's one of the questions we had in the chat.

133
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,100
That is a great question. What I do is I read a lot of stuff.

134
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,003
I also have a lot of search alerts that I've set up that are like customized

135
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:56,985
that basically inform me on a daily or weekly basis.

136
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:01,188
So I'm basically constantly getting stuff in my inbox based on searches

137
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,990
that I created around topics that I that I need to know about,

138
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,052
you know, in this space.

139
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,974
I also have an extensive network of people I've I know,

140
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,076
you know, just from all the travels I've done.

141
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:19,241
people whose opinions I trust and I know basically where they're coming from. So I can ask them,

142
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:22,644
you know, if there's something going on in a specific market, I can, you know, just,

143
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,508
you know, chat them up and say, hey, you know, what's going on with this? What do you, what,

144
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:31,953
what's your perception of what this means? Things like that. So it's, it's really a combination of

145
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:36,918
things. I mean, I also, I read academic journals, I read The Economist, I read a lot of news.

146
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:40,821
I'm out there to basically stay informed of what's going on.

147
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,543
Because one thing that's really important about the job,

148
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:46,246
it's not just knowing like the specific sensitivity

149
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,588
around a specific piece of content.

150
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,390
Like for example, a symbol that some person,

151
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,112
an artist put on a character's outfit.

152
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:58,956
Things like that. That's kind of the baseline knowledge that I constantly try and build up.

153
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:04,420
I, for example, like symbols alone, I have a stack of books that's at least a meter high

154
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,243
of all these simple dictionaries that I, yeah, and I'll kind of browse those for fun because

155
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:15,228
that's kind of the nerd that I am. Because I just, I find it fascinating. But, so there's

156
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:19,831
kind of that combination of kind of the baseline knowledge of certain cultures that has been built

157
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:22,513
up and a lot of that is on the foundation of my geographer.

158
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:29,197
um training in that background but the other part of it is understanding the current market conditions

159
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:34,619
which is why I keep up on the news and the what's going on in the world because I need to know that

160
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:40,682
when this game is supposed to release let's say third quarter 2022 I need to have a sense of what

161
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:45,184
is the market condition going to be like then because you never know I mean in some places

162
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,866
all it takes is as we know could take one election.

163
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:52,590
And things change. I mean, you know, in certain markets, I mean, laws can change.

164
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,154
The whole, you know, what is acceptable, unacceptable could suddenly change.

165
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,817
I mean, all of that kind of stuff can change depending on or just

166
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,501
even the general perception of video games might change either more favorably

167
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:04,302
or less favorably.

168
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:07,444
depending on what happens in that particular market.

169
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:09,546
So that's the kind of stuff I also have to keep track of.

170
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:12,929
So, so yeah, that's basically how I do it.

171
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,932
It's just a huge combination of things of reading and staying up on all the

172
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,014
the searches and whatnot, but also talking to people.

173
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,997
That's really the best way to do it is just having a network of people

174
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:25,959
who you can talk to about what's happening in their locale.

175
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,503
And it sounds like a great deal of work on top of all the other work you already do.

176
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,224
It is a lot of work.

177
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:34,965
It's a lot of work.

178
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:37,066
But the thing is, I love doing it, though.

179
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:37,947
I love what I do.

180
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,728
I'm just this hyper curious person.

181
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:44,870
So I just I love absorbing information, you know, and it's

182
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:48,252
the best way of all is just talking to people from other cultures.

183
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,374
That's why I feel really thankful that over the last many years,

184
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,476
I've been able to travel a lot when there's no pandemic.

185
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:59,538
So typically I'm traveling like 75, 80 percent of the year,

186
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,520
speaking at a lot of conferences around the world.

187
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:13,184
But that gives that opportunity to talk to people face to face and learn more about their perspective on things and what they're struggling with as game developers and the issues that they're dealing with.

188
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,445
So all of that informs my work.

189
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:20,047
I find a lot of studios are very open to the work you're doing.

190
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:29,087
Today, yes. When I first started doing this work, which was, you know, during my Microsoft days, that was over 27 years ago.

191
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:35,730
I basically peg it that far back. So back in those days, it was challenging.

192
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,453
It was a challenge because the prevailing attitude at the time was like, hey, video games were edgy, were cool.

193
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,133
We can do stuff that's controversial.

194
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:49,135
And yeah, sure, but that's any creative media. It's not just games.

195
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:54,837
It's like, yeah, you have the creative right and you should exercise that right to basically make what you want to make.

196
00:13:55,337 --> 00:14:05,300
But it's all about whether or not that is really going to be compatible with the local worldviews and the local expectations that you're going into.

197
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,984
So yeah, it's it's it's it's but today it's gotten a lot easier.

198
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:15,946
Obviously society has changed dramatically over the last 27 years.

199
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:20,847
The level of understanding I think has increased especially among

200
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,908
companies who understand that representation matters.

201
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,429
It really matters and you need to make the effort.

202
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:32,666
to go the distance, so to speak, in terms of making sure that your characters, your narrative,

203
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:37,407
your environment, all of these things are accurate and respectful of the cultures that you're going

204
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:43,129
to be leveraging. Even in a fantasy game, you know, it matters there, obviously, because most

205
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:49,032
fantasy and sci-fi games also get their inspiration from the real world. Pretty much every game does

206
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:50,372
by in some aspect.

207
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:56,615
And so we have to make sure that the representation is, you know, is really concentrating on that.

208
00:14:56,735 --> 00:15:03,178
So I find today, and especially this punctuated within the last couple years or so, I find that

209
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:08,040
a lot of companies have suddenly woken up to the idea that this is really important.

210
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,963
And there's various social issues and, you know, recent events that have caused them to be

211
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:17,705
more, you know, aware of how important this really is.

212
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:18,746
And part of me.

213
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:23,730
is grateful for that, but also part of me is a bit resentful because I'm like,

214
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,953
it should not have taken you this long to get it. You should have, you should have, you should have

215
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:33,198
just, you know, thought this way early on. Because honestly, when I first started doing this work,

216
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:38,382
the argument I originally used was that we're doing this because we want to respect the player.

217
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:42,706
We want to respect who they are as a human being and make sure that that's, we're representing

218
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:47,149
them correctly in our games and making sure we're respectful within the narratives that

219
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,870
we're pushing out.

220
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:50,860
That argument didn't go very far back then.

221
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,803
So I had to pivot my argument and make it a money argument.

222
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:58,547
So that's why I had to say, well, you know, if you culturalize your content,

223
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,090
it actually maximizes the reach of your content

224
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,913
because then it can go in more places around the world.

225
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:07,576
And so therefore, if you, you know, that's if you culturalize

226
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,958
and make sure it's more compatible.

227
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:12,380
with other markets, that does happen to increase your revenue.

228
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:16,063
And that argument resonated really strongly, especially with

229
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,767
the higher ups in different companies. And so I'm like, okay,

230
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,849
great, I found the key that opens up the door. But at the

231
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,231
same time, I was like, I should not have had to make a money

232
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,573
argument to make this important to people.

233
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,856
Yeah, it's heartening to hear that things are getting better

234
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:33,538
now. But it's like you say, it's it's disappointing that it took

235
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,159
this long to kind of get to this point.

236
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:41,489
Thank you for staying kind of fluid with how you pushed to get this stuff to happen though.

237
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,434
Sometimes people come to you and you definitely had an I told you so that I bet you were holding

238
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:47,334
in your butt.

239
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,199
I try not to say I told you so but it happens sometimes.

240
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,461
It's too good to pass up sometimes.

241
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,815
We've got another question in the chat. How do you make sure that you respectfully handle

242
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:06,760
cultural assets in games and how do you grow your own economic, grow your own expertise

243
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,483
in these cultures that aren't your own? Part of that answer but...

244
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:13,614
Yeah, I answered a little bit of that, but that this question is a little more specific.

245
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:18,077
And I think it's a it's a great question, because I think there there's a certain understanding

246
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:23,401
and awareness I have of various cultures around the world, just by the longevity of the time

247
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:27,604
I've been doing this work, because, again, reading a lot, talking to a lot of people,

248
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:32,347
having an understanding of like kind of the baseline reaction that some cultures would

249
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:32,627
have.

250
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:38,109
But I'm obviously I'm not presumptuous to think that I'm going to represent the voice of a specific culture.

251
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,891
So my job when I'm doing it is basically to flag something and say,

252
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:46,513
I think this is going to be a problem in this culture based on my understanding.

253
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,414
But then they need to take the next step.

254
00:17:49,454 --> 00:17:52,535
And sometimes they facilitate that through me and my work.

255
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:57,137
But then oftentimes I help them facilitate it through, you know, by themselves.

256
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,858
But basically, you need to find someone from that culture.

257
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,961
an expert, a sensitivity reader, you know, some person who's going to represent that culture and

258
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,423
be able to speak to the issues that you're addressing here, because that's ultimately

259
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:15,905
how you have to do it. You have to consult with them. And obviously we've seen games do a better

260
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:20,127
job of this over the last few years. You know, there's great examples, like for example,

261
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:23,668
some games that have Indigenous characters, like I think what, Assassin's Creed 3.

262
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:28,814
which then brought in someone from the Cherokee Nation to directly advise on how, you know,

263
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:33,059
the Connor character should be represented, the language they use, all of that kind of thing.

264
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,244
I did a little bit of consulting work on Never Alone, for example, which was the game

265
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,208
developed in direct partnership with the Inuit people.

266
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:46,597
up in northern Canada, which was, you know, and basically they were the ones dictating to the development team.

267
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:54,989
This is what how it should be done. This is the language. This is the look, you know, and I think that when you're when you make a game that is based on real cultures.

268
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,592
and real geography, you really have to have that kind of direct engagement. To me, that's really

269
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:05,633
the only best way to do it. Because my knowledge, I can definitely flag things and I can make people

270
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:10,054
aware that, you know, they're going down a path that could be potentially problematic. But, you

271
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:15,775
know, I, I, like everybody else, I've got my limits to my knowledge. Basically, I hit that wall. And

272
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:20,276
that's when I know either I need to reach out and talk to somebody locally, or I need to get the

273
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:21,356
company to do the same.

274
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:27,200
You know, or even take another step, which is like do specific sets of user research or focus groups

275
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,822
with a particular culture so that they can make sure they're not walking down

276
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:34,585
the wrong path, you know, with their creative choices.

277
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:40,549
Are you seeing any sort of common mistakes between developers that can be fixed with this expertise?

278
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:47,203
Yeah, there's a lot. I mean, even though I do see companies that are more aware today than they were

279
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:52,466
even five years ago, we're still see tons of stereotype issues, lots and lots of stereotyping

280
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:59,450
going on. To me, that's a combination of just, you know, part of its creative laziness, frankly.

281
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,793
It's not doing your due diligence.

282
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,937
If you're going to create a character that's not from the culture that you represent,

283
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:11,285
you know, then you need to do your due diligence to make sure you're making a character that is realistic to that culture

284
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:14,769
and not, you know, not leveraging any tropes that are out there.

285
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,535
around that particular culture. It's really easy to do because it's something of a creative trap,

286
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:25,921
you know, that we make these assumptions. And this, it speaks to the fact that every single

287
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:29,905
one of us, whether we like it or not, we are biased. I mean, because we all come from a

288
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:34,610
specific culture, specific language, specific geography. And, you know, I think most of us,

289
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,312
we overcome that bias with education. That's...

290
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:43,115
What the benefits of having an educational process. But that doesn't mean that all of those biases we

291
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:48,236
might have are just and I'm when I say bias, I'm not talking about like active bias, like I'm

292
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:52,778
actually thinking about doing something that's going to be, you know, problematic. I'm just

293
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:57,940
thinking I'm just saying that the bias is there because that blocks us from having that full

294
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,902
understanding of what other choices might be. If you're going to make us like a specific character,

295
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,402
say a character from East Asia.

296
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:09,503
You know, what are my choices there? Well, East Asian culture is dramatically diverse.

297
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:14,905
When you look at, you know, China, Korea, Japan, you know, other places throughout the region,

298
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:19,966
and even within those countries, it's quite diverse. You really have to dig deep and understand,

299
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:26,048
you know, what do you want to represent from that particular culture? And again,

300
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:27,888
speaking to the point about

301
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:35,652
about fantasy and sci-fi games, sometimes game developers, because a lot of our games tend to be

302
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:40,915
set in a fictional universe, we also have to be really careful because those things bleed over

303
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:46,439
all the time. Those choices are also just as complicated because we often look to the real

304
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:52,482
world to set up allegories in our sci-fi or fantasy universe, whether it's narrative allegory or visual

305
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:53,062
allegory.

306
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:58,866
But those allegories have an origin point. They have an inspiration in the real world and we need

307
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:04,290
to make sure that we have sufficient what I call allegorical distance so that the original

308
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:10,994
inspiration isn't too obvious to what actually shows up in the game. So I think that was a long

309
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:15,317
answer. Sorry. It was a really good answer because I feel like you're covering a lot of important

310
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:21,201
points and that many of us without even realizing it carry these little biases, these little things

311
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:21,521
we don't.

312
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:28,709
Maybe we didn't pick up on that we feel or in terms of phrase we use or like you say the

313
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,871
inspirations for some of these character styles or types or things like that

314
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:38,315
in our fantasy mediums and things like that really looked at. So to your point, it's very

315
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:43,918
important to kind of examine these things before we kind of trot out something harmful again without

316
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:50,923
thinking about it. Yeah. All right, we got another question here from the audience.

317
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:57,400
How can someone graduating high school or university today best seek out their own incredible

318
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,920
confluence of everything I love?

319
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,642
That is a great question.

320
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:06,705
I mean, part of it, like I kind of alluded to earlier, in my case, was a happy accident.

321
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:11,907
But the point is, though, I never lost track of what I love.

322
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,668
And, you know, I always had that...

323
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,752
I kind of wear my interests on my sleeve, so to speak.

324
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:21,875
So like my love of Star Wars never went away.

325
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:25,918
It's like, you know, because that's why I wanted to be an artist at Lucasfilm,

326
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,800
just so I could work on a Star Wars movie.

327
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,061
That was the whole reason.

328
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,464
And of course, I didn't get that chance, but I did years later.

329
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:35,887
I did work on Star Wars, the Old Republic for Bioware for four years.

330
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:39,349
So, you know, in that case, the circle was now complete.

331
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,351
I actually got to work on something, Star Wars.

332
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:46,234
Not in the same capacity I imagined when I was in high school, but I still got to work on it.

333
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:53,819
So that's one of those just serendipitous things about your life path and career that I always find interesting is that you have no idea

334
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,041
whether or not these things are going to come back along your path at some point in the future.

335
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:03,204
You know, it is important to kind of choose a path because you got to be on a path.

336
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:04,165
That's the important part.

337
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:09,008
You got to be going in a direction, but you have to be open to how that could change.

338
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:15,051
You know, I do mentor a lot of people in this industry, a lot of young people who want to come into this industry.

339
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:24,795
And one of the biggest challenges I find, but I think it's also natural with that age, is that you have, you're very focused on exactly what you want to achieve.

340
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,936
I want to be the chief designer on X franchise, for example.

341
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:32,281
I want to be the lead designer at this company.

342
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:36,187
That's great, and I think people should have specific goals like that,

343
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,953
but you've got to be really open and flexible to other stuff that comes your way.

344
00:24:41,760 --> 00:25:00,137
Because I never imagined when I was in high school being a geographer, I never imagined working on video games, even though I love video games. I was seven years old when Pong showed up in the store. So that was my first video game. And I've loved games ever since. But, um, I never imagined any of this happening.

345
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:07,501
at all. It was not even close on my radar. And yet it was mainly because as the choices came along,

346
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:13,844
I was open to the idea that like, okay, yeah, I want to do that. I want to do this. Like, I,

347
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:19,227
you know, I left Microsoft in 2005, even though I built my own team there, I created my own job

348
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:24,310
there. I was getting paid very well with good benefits and all of that. But I left because

349
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,453
it just I felt like my job was done there. I had done basically what I needed to do with the company

350
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,895
And now I wanted to see if other companies want to do this too.

351
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,818
And I wanted to also focus almost exclusively on games,

352
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,198
which is another reason I left,

353
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,800
because then it would give me the ability

354
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,342
as a self-employed person to focus on what I wanted to focus on.

355
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,044
And a lot of people thought I was insane.

356
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:48,966
Why would I possibly leave a good job like that,

357
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,087
that I created at a company like Microsoft,

358
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:53,849
and go off and become, you know, an entrepreneur,

359
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:55,991
which is, you know, almost a death sentence for some.

360
00:25:56,711 --> 00:26:02,296
And but it was because I just had that driving desire to to take my knowledge and do something

361
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:08,241
different with it. And so I think you have to take be willing to take risks like that and be willing

362
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:13,166
to be open to whatever comes along your way. And don't be afraid you know if you have a great

363
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:17,229
opportunity that comes your way that might be a little divergent from the path you were imagining.

364
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,910
I would encourage you to take it,

365
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,592
because you never know how that's going to come back.

366
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,913
And the reality is that everything you do,

367
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:26,674
no matter what job it is, no matter what path you're taking,

368
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,715
you are building up experience,

369
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,416
life experience and work experience,

370
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:32,597
that ultimately could be useful down the road.

371
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,038
So I just encourage you to just keep your eyes open,

372
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:38,580
because too many people get blinded

373
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,801
by this really solid focus.

374
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:45,143
Yeah, you get too focused on one thing.

375
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:46,384
So it's kind of like,

376
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,077
Allowing yourself to broaden that experience.

377
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:50,297
Yeah.

378
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:50,957
See you.

379
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,058
All right.

380
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,698
Probably time for one more question.

381
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,679
Of course, it slipped on down the list.

382
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,300
How dare you sneak off on me?

383
00:26:59,660 --> 00:26:59,940
All right.

384
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,121
We're actually going to touch on some of your Global Game Jam stuff now.

385
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:03,441
Yeah.

386
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,922
I talk about this globalization stuff all day.

387
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,944
A lot of solo game devs struggle with matchmaking and forming teams.

388
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:12,544
A lot of people use Game Jams as a platform for this,

389
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,965
but many of these teams collapse after the event.

390
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:16,986
Experience Global Game Jam.

391
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:22,266
Is there a way to provide help to game devs on finding the right people to work with?

392
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:26,951
That is a fantastic question. That is something that we're trying to work on because we know

393
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:31,756
that that is a real problem and we know that became more punctuated last year because last

394
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,739
year was the first time we did a virtual Global Game Jam.

395
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:39,689
We did GGG Next, which is our event for younger people, last summer in July.

396
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:42,611
That was the first time we ever did a virtual jam.

397
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,574
And then, of course, in January this year is when we did a virtual jam as well.

398
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:50,716
And, well, GGG Next actually starts in five days this year.

399
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,458
And again, that's a virtual format.

400
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,846
And that really raised the profile on what a struggle it is for solo devs to get connected to a team.

401
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:04,371
Because obviously when you're on site, you're at a location, it's a lot easier.

402
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:08,135
Even though then it can be somewhat challenging for people because there's always that...

403
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:13,898
That little part after the theme is announced and people kind of go their separate ways to

404
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:19,101
start working on their game, there's always kind of that little forum where you have the solo people

405
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:25,324
saying, hey, I can do this. Does anyone need me on their team? And usually those people get paired

406
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:29,706
off, which is great. They get attached to a team. But if you're virtual or if you're just kind of

407
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:35,069
out there, it is tough to do that. And so we've been trying to think of ways to make it a lot

408
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:36,630
easier so that we kind of have

409
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,492
I don't know, I don't want to call it matchmaking, nothing like that.

410
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,315
But basically a way so that teens can say, hey, this is what we need.

411
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:47,297
And you also have a pool of people who say, this is what I do,

412
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:50,599
you know, to make it a lot easier, especially in a virtual jam,

413
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,341
because that just makes it super challenging because you're not

414
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:56,563
you don't have any like necessary communal space.

415
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,584
And if you're like in a discord channel or something,

416
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,386
it's just a lot of noise to kind of figure out what's going on.

417
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,353
So the short answer is that we're aware of this problem and we're trying to fix it.

418
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:12,816
Right now it's not an easy fix, but I'm glad you raised the question though.

419
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:19,460
All right, and I think that's about all we have time for today. We're down to that last minute.

420
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,283
So, Kate, thank you so, so much for coming out and talking with us today. It was

421
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:28,385
fascinating to listen to your work. Definitely going to keep following up on what you're doing

422
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:29,186
from here on out.

423
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:35,904
Well, thank you. Yeah, this was great. Yeah, I mean, we could talk for hours on this subject.

424
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:37,304
I will take you up on that someday.

425
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,825
And I'm more than happy if people want to reach out to me.

426
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:43,027
I'm pretty easy to find on Twitter and elsewhere if you want to reach out to me.

427
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,628
And if you have additional questions, don't hesitate.

428
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:49,929
Especially, you know, if you're looking to get into the industry, this is how you start.

429
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,850
You ask questions and don't be shy.

430
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:56,232
All right. With that, thanks a lot for coming out, folks.

431
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:57,152
Enjoy the rest of GDC 2021.
