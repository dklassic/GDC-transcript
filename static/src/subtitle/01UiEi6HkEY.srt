00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:13,730
Hi there, hello and welcome. My name is Simon Parkin and this is my talk for GDC 2021

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,452
on designing the secret game that helped win.

3
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:27,719
World War II. This is a talk that's based on a book I've written called A Game of Birds and Wolves

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,803
which is available online and in all good bookstores so if you want to read more then

5
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:39,127
please go find that. And without further ado I'll get into the talk.

6
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:45,731
When I was a child my brother and I spent our summer holidays at our grandparents house in Devon.

7
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:50,706
They loved board games and they had an old wooden chest filled with them.

8
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:57,471
And one day in amongst the boxes of Scrabble, Monopoly and Bagatelle, we found a copy of Battleships.

9
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:03,175
Now this wasn't the plasticky tabletop version with which we're all familiar,

10
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:10,020
but rather a luxurious version of the game that was played out on a giant map that had to be spread across the floor.

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,023
We'd take turns to throw our dice and manoeuvre the ships.

12
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,794
into opposing positions, and then at the press of a button on a destroyer,

13
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:25,237
a small plastic disc would fire along the glossy board like a miniature hockey puck.

14
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:30,940
If your aim was true, the disc would slot into a hole at the base of your target,

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,043
and then through some toy maker's magic, the top of the ship would explode into the air like a cap,

16
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:41,206
rocketing from the top of a shaken bottle of lemonade.

17
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,977
My grandfather never spoke much about the war.

18
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:47,039
I knew that he'd been a merchant seaman,

19
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,941
but not when or where he had sailed,

20
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,263
or even if he had seen combat at sea.

21
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,546
And as such, I never put together

22
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,447
why he might own this particular game,

23
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:58,911
or why he would often watch from the doorway while we played.

24
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:06,751
A couple of years ago, I started working on a documentary, a radio documentary for the New Yorker on wargaming.

25
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:19,124
Wargaming, if you don't know, is a tool that's used by politicians, civil servants and the military to explore via the medium of dice and play the potential effects of world events.

26
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:28,667
Throughout the last few years, for example, the British government has used war games to envision the potential effects of a second referendum on Brexit,

27
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:39,230
or what might happen in the event of numerous lockdowns for the pandemic, forcing civil servants to play as key politicians.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,211
And the same is true in America and many other countries around the world.

29
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:49,012
During the making of the radio programme, I visited the Defence Academy in Shrivenham.

30
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:52,629
and there I met a man called Major Tom Mouat.

31
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:57,170
Major Tom is essentially Her Majesty's game designer-in-chief,

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,751
a kind of Dungeons & Dragons moderator dressed in khaki fatigues.

33
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:05,932
He's designed and run wargames everywhere from the Pentagon to Beijing.

34
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:10,893
I asked Tom if he had an example of where something learned in the crucible

35
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:15,215
of a wargame had gone on to be used to great effect in the real world.

36
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:19,998
He explained to me that the hotline that links the White House to the Kremlin,

37
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:24,461
which is often represented in Hollywood films by red telephone,

38
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,704
was an idea that came out of war games played during the Cold War.

39
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,467
Then he mentioned a little-known story about a retired naval captain

40
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:37,350
called Gilbert Roberts and a group of young women who together

41
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:42,574
invented a war game that radically changed the course of the Second World War.

42
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:49,707
In the last week of 1941, Britain had come perilously close to defeat.

43
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:55,793
The UK is an island nation, reliant on imported goods for many of its resources.

44
00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:01,018
And at that time, in fact, no less than 95% of Britain's fuel came to the country

45
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:06,283
from trading partners and colonies, while 70% of its food supply was imported.

46
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:14,731
In total, an average of 68 million tons of food and fuel was delivered by a 3,000 strong merchant shipping fleet.

47
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:19,637
The sailors of these ships knew from the bitter experience of the First World War

48
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:26,143
that the safest way to cross the Atlantic Ocean was to move in convoys, finding safety in numbers.

49
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,618
So the ships would gather together in groups,

50
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,580
sometimes consisting of more than 60 vessels.

51
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,722
And they'd sail across the Atlantic

52
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:41,585
from the west coast of Britain, across the east coast

53
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,787
of America, usually, in tight formation.

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,225
The Royal Navy then sent warships that would protect these flocks of boats.

55
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:53,608
These ships were known as escorts, the protectors,

56
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,652
and they would encircle the convoy as it plodded along its course,

57
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,855
a bit like sheepdogs protecting a herd of sheep,

58
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,238
ready to fend off any attacks.

59
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:11,750
Now, even before the outbreak of the Second World War, Karl DÃ¶nitz, who was leader of the U-boat arm of the German Navy,

60
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:16,695
reasoned that if his fleet of submarines could block and sink these convoy ships,

61
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:22,340
Britain, which is an island unable to sustain its people without imports, would starve.

62
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:26,244
In this way, hunger, the blunt, persistent weapon of war,

63
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,687
could be deployed against Germany's enemy from a position of remove.

64
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:36,027
Doniz had long believed that the most effective way to attack the British ships was to organise

65
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:40,191
his U-boats into packs, a bit like wolves hunting sheep.

66
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:46,056
It was a tactic that he had tentatively explored as captain of his own U-boat in the First

67
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,680
World War, just before he was captured by the British and sent to a prisoner of war

68
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,541
camp in Sheffield.

69
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:58,395
where incidentally he managed to earn a prison transfer to a lunatic asylum after he pretended

70
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:06,159
to be a U-boat, convincing his captors that he had lost his mind. The tactic that Donitz pioneered

71
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:12,602
was dubbed the Rudel tactic or wolf pack tactic which was borrowed from the wolves of Donitz's

72
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:17,324
childhood fairy tales. Wolves, as Donitz knew, hunt cooperatively.

73
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:23,885
By working together as a pack, they can bewilder and run down prey that would be too large to tackle alone.

74
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:31,607
Togetherness also affords the animals the ability to care for wounded pack members without sacrificing momentum.

75
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:37,308
What better way than its reason for U-boats to hunt, not as loners picking off stragglers,

76
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:41,909
but as an organised pack, touring the sea with shared focus and intention,

77
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,390
able to take down much stronger foes than they might otherwise.

78
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:53,675
Donitz's belief that if Britain's supply lines were broken, then Britain's defeat would soon follow was not limited to the Germans.

79
00:06:54,276 --> 00:07:02,701
The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, described merchant shipping as, at once, the stranglehold and the sole foundation of our war strategy.

80
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:13,006
This fundamental truth was acknowledged in a chart that took up almost the entirety of a ward in the operations room at the Admiralty, the Navy's London headquarters.

81
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:22,231
This graph charted the number of ships that had been sunk at sea to U-boats and it showed, in the starkest terms imaginable, the stakes at play.

82
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:29,394
The top quarter of the map was divided by a thin red line that marked the narrow threshold between victory and defeat.

83
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:37,178
If the rate of ships sinking stayed below the line, then the British people could survive on the amount of food and fuel that was making it through.

84
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:43,340
But if the graph exceeded the red line, the country could no longer continue to participate in the war.

85
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:52,831
While de Nitz was not given anywhere close to the 300 U-boats that he estimated via his own war games that he needed to blockade Britain,

86
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:59,360
the embryonic wolfpack attacks that began towards the end of 1940 immediately showed their effectiveness.

87
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:06,964
In British shops, fish became scarce and expensive. Butter, bacon and sugar could only be bought with coupons.

88
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:13,806
Onions, which prior to the war were imported from Spain, France and the Channel Islands, vanished from greengrocers.

89
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:16,487
And so too did lemons and bananas.

90
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,553
The frequency and success of the U-boat attacks steadily climbed.

91
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:27,057
By the end of 1940, the U-boats had successfully sunk more than 1,200 ships,

92
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:32,180
about five years worth of construction work in typical peacetime conditions,

93
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,944
and more than the rest of the entire German navy and air force combined.

94
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:42,886
The numbers told, if not the whole story of the Battle of the Atlantic, then the salient point.

95
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,547
The British were losing catastrophically.

96
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:49,528
Someone had to figure out what was making the U-boat so effective

97
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:53,790
and what, if anything, might be done to upturn that success.

98
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:59,713
Gilbert Roberts was a 41-year-old former naval commander

99
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:04,675
who had been discharged from the Navy in 1938 following a bout of tuberculosis.

100
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:10,919
After he recovered from his illness, Roberts found himself a young retiree, without a ship

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,803
or a purpose.

102
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:17,731
He joined the Home Guard for a stint and then worked as a police officer in Devon.

103
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:23,736
But neither of these roles particularly suited Roberts, who was a talented tactician and wargame designer.

104
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:31,403
He was also a heroic man, even before the arrival of war and its inevitable provocations towards courage.

105
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:40,590
Once while reading a book on a Cornish cliffside, Roberts spied a group of walkers as they struggled to climb from the mouth of a cave against the tides rushing.

106
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:47,958
Roberts tripped down the cliff, plunged into the water, and for more than an hour fought the waves to recover one of the sightseers.

107
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,785
In the early months of the Second World War, Roberts was further tested by circumstance.

108
00:09:54,265 --> 00:10:02,534
One night during the Blitz, while he was sheltering in the basement of a London apartment, Roberts heard a thud on the ground above.

109
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:07,745
He climbed the stairs, looked through the window, and there in the white light of an overhead flare,

110
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:13,930
saw a bent, oiled German bomb, half buried in the pavement, with its fuse still sparking.

111
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,914
Roberts ran towards the danger, snatched out the fuse, and burnt his fingers badly in the process.

112
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:25,799
Then, in the last week of 1941, Roberts received an unexpected summon

113
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,542
to the Admiralty's office. He was told to bring an overnight bag.

114
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,603
and when he arrived he met two of the Navy's most senior officers,

115
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,386
one of whom was an aide to Winston Churchill himself.

116
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:42,232
The two men described the extent of Britain's ongoing losses in the Atlantic.

117
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:48,938
The fact that Britain had come so close to starvation had in fact been deliberately kept from the British public.

118
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,843
Churchill would routinely exaggerate the number of U-boat losses in public speeches.

119
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:57,866
For example, at Manchin House on the 20th of January 1940,

120
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:03,730
at a moment when the British forces had sunk just nine of Germany's 57 operational U-boats,

121
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,933
Churchill claimed to have sunk half the U-boats with which Germany began the war.

122
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:13,837
To arrive at this conclusion, he added 16 U-boats that the Admiralty believed may have been sunk

123
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:16,198
to the nine U-boats known to have been sunk.

124
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:20,201
And to this number for good measure, he added a further ten of his own imagining.

125
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,315
As such, when Roberts was told the awful truth of the situation, he was astonished.

126
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:31,159
He was then informed that because of his achievements in running war games,

127
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,324
he had been chosen to figure out the secret to the U-boat's success in the Atlantic.

128
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:42,743
Robert's task was threefold, to discover the secret of how the U-boats were operating,

129
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:48,585
to develop effective countermeasures, and finally to teach these new tactics,

130
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:52,987
whatever they may be, to any and every captain who was sailing the Atlantic.

131
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,048
Tuberculosis may have robbed him of the chance to serve at sea,

132
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:01,289
but it had in this unlikely way provided him with an opportunity

133
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:06,371
by which he could make his presence felt on every destroyer and corvette on the ocean.

134
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:11,820
Before he left the Admiralty to catch the midnight train to Liverpool, Roberts was led

135
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,608
into an office where he came face to face with Prime Minister Churchill, who barked

136
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:19,352
find out what is happening and sink the U-boats.

137
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,859
Roberts arrived in Liverpool to a beleaguered city.

138
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,820
Hitler later admitted that he had targeted the city with his bombers

139
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,001
because he believed it housed the headquarters from which the Battle of the Atlantic was being orchestrated.

140
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,262
His guess was correct.

141
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:39,943
In fact, Derby House, which was home to this command centre,

142
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:43,564
had already been successfully hit by a German incendiary,

143
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,404
although the bombers wouldn't have known it.

144
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:51,492
When Roberts had arrived, he was informed that he would be given eight rooms on the top floor of the building.

145
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:55,334
He could move in just as soon as the roof had been repaired.

146
00:12:56,794 --> 00:13:01,715
Roberts' first meeting with the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Percy Noble, was a complete disaster.

147
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:06,777
After dismissively asking what precisely Roberts planned to do with his games,

148
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:07,957
Noble told him,

149
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:11,738
Well, you can carry on, but don't bother me with it. I'm busy.

150
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:17,019
The next question was who precisely was going to assist Roberts in his work.

151
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,783
By 1942, most men who were able to serve in the Navy had been enlisted and deployed.

152
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:29,247
The Navy then, in its desperation to find workers, turned to young women,

153
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,449
advertising posts in the Wrens with the slogan,

154
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,271
Join the Wrens and free a man for the fleet.

155
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:41,548
The Wrens' motto at the time was Never at Sea, a pledge that also carries with it a

156
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,354
sort of negative space assurance that we know our place.

157
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:50,281
What other organisation has ever been defined by what its members are forbidden from doing

158
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,063
rather than what they hope to achieve?

159
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:58,898
Nevertheless, under the stewardship of Vera Lawton Matthews, a former activist for the suffragettes,

160
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:03,720
the Wrens were gradually deployed to all manner of interesting and essential roles.

161
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,942
Some became welders, others became carpenters, some loaded torpedoes onto submarines,

162
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:17,584
and many plotted the progress of live sea battles on maps that were hung in operations rooms,

163
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,245
just like the giant plot at Derby House.

164
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:26,229
The Wrens' heroism often matched that of the men they had freed for duty.

165
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:32,011
In 1942, for example, Pamela McGeorge was asked to deliver an important dispatch

166
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,051
from one side of Plymouth to the Commander-in-Chief at the other.

167
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:37,872
She drove her motorcycle through the night,

168
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:42,233
while German bombers dropped their weapons on the city.

169
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:46,996
When one of these bombs landed close to the road, McGeorge was blown from her bike

170
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:52,599
and its wheels were mangled beyond repair. But undeterred, she continued on foot to

171
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,982
Admiralty House with the letter in hand. When she arrived, she offered immediately to head out again

172
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:05,686
with the response. In Liverpool, at Derby House, Roberts was introduced to 10 of these young Rands,

173
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:10,609
some of whom had only recently left school, and they were to be his supporting team.

174
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:17,104
The young women had been hand-picked for their aptitude in mathematics, statistics and even

175
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:17,864
gamesmanship.

176
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:24,147
The first, most senior woman assigned to the team was Jean Laidlaw, an assiduous 21-year-old

177
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:28,309
who was obsessed with ships and sailing and who later became one of Britain's first

178
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,770
female chartered accountants.

179
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:35,918
Then there was Laura Janet Howes, who had come to England from Antigua just four years earlier.

180
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,401
Howes was a mathematical wunderkind, and at school while her teachers were off sick,

181
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:45,024
she would teach the maths class in her teacher's stead.

182
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:52,908
Elizabeth Drake was next. Drake's father, Charles, worked as an actuary for the Prudential Insurance Company.

183
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:58,651
Drake was chosen to work with Roberts based on the assumption that an aptitude for mathematics,

184
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,572
like height or temper, runs in the family.

185
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:06,074
And the last of the Wren officers was a sportswoman, Nancy Wales.

186
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:11,457
Nan, as she was known to her friends, was older than the others at 27, but she was a

187
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:15,318
formidable tennis player and competed in badminton at county level.

188
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:20,956
Hockey was her true passion and two years later she would go on to play for Lancashire

189
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:25,421
and then earn the unique distinction of being the only player to play for their arch-rivals

190
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,384
Yorkshire, a team that she then captained for many years.

191
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:35,812
The unit, which became known as the Western Approaches Tactical Unit or WATU for short,

192
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:38,194
was given the top floor of Derby House.

193
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,002
As Roberts' first dismal meeting with his superior, Percy Noble, demonstrated, the unit

194
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:50,325
was viewed with tremendous scepticism by many senior officers, who wondered what these people

195
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:55,248
were doing playing games while there was a war on. As such, Roberts and his team of Wrens

196
00:16:55,308 --> 00:17:01,051
worked quietly in their top-floor home, trying to not attract too much attention until they

197
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,452
had something concrete to bring to their superiors.

198
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:10,895
Watteau's office resembled something between a school gymnasium and thanks to the scattered

199
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:17,139
sticks of chalk and tumbles of string laying around a child's playroom. The linoleum floor

200
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:23,704
was divided into sections a bit like a giant chessboard. Each line was spaced 10 inches apart

201
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:29,188
which represented a distance of one nautical mile and the counters laid out on the floor

202
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,130
represented ships and surfaced German U-boats.

203
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,916
Around the edges of the room stood great sheets of white canvas.

204
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,878
They were arranged into enclosures, a bit like voting booths,

205
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:44,800
with each one with a peephole cut into it, at eye level.

206
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:49,543
The average visibility from the bridge of a warship is five miles,

207
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:54,666
and the canvas sheets were positioned in such a way that when a player peeked through the slit,

208
00:17:55,006 --> 00:18:00,870
he or she could see the equivalent of a five-mile view of the tiny wooden ships sitting on the floor.

209
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:07,580
Linen side wires which could be bent to adjust visibility, depending on the game scenario that

210
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,845
was being played, held the apertures open. One team was positioned behind the canvas sheets

211
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:20,829
at desks and they played as the Royal Naval escort captains, the sheepdogs guarding the flock.

212
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:26,458
The other team, which was usually captained by Roberts or his right-hand woman, Jean Laidlaw,

213
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,744
played as the U-boats. And as in the real Battle of the Atlantic, each size objective

214
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:38,272
was focused on the convoy. These were the ships carrying those essential food and fuel supplies.

215
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,943
The task of the team playing as the escorts was to protect them,

216
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:45,664
and the task of the U-boats was to attack them.

217
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,865
And each side also had a secondary objective.

218
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:53,106
For the naval team, this was to sink as many U-boats as possible.

219
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:58,848
And for the U-boats, the aim was to avoid detection and exit the battlefield unharmed.

220
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:03,209
In other words, it was an asymmetrical game,

221
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,670
each team with different abilities and objectives.

222
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,076
The convoy ships, which was the prize in play for both sides, weren't controlled by a player.

223
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:20,122
They would just, that would just move automatically forward at each turn of the game towards their destination,

224
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,525
with the battle raging on around them, just as it did at sea.

225
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:31,996
Players were given two minutes in which to submit their orders for their next turn to replicate the urgency of a real battlefield.

226
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:36,280
And the movements of the U-Boats were drawn in green chalk on the floor.

227
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:43,847
This colour was chosen as it was almost impossible to make out against the floor's brown tint when viewed from an angle,

228
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:49,853
and ensured that U-Boat positions were undetectable to the players who were looking through the canvas screens.

229
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,975
By contrast, the escort ship's movements were added to the floor in white chalk,

230
00:19:55,476 --> 00:20:00,364
which, unlike the green markings, was legible to those looking from the canvas booths.

231
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,182
Now turn by turn the pieces would move around the floor as the escort ships dashed to the

232
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:11,744
site of an explosion and dropped their depth charges while the U-boats performed their

233
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:18,467
feints and dodges in an effort to pick off the convoy ships all while evading detection

234
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,528
and the depth charges of the escort ships.

235
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,690
The role of the Wrens in the game was something like umpires.

236
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:34,129
They would measure distances and mark the movements in the chalk to ensure that the game played out as accurately as possible.

237
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:43,494
Then finally, after an hour or 90 minutes when the game was complete, the players would all come together, stand or sit around the board,

238
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:49,557
which was now crisscrossed with chalk markings, and Captain Roberts would reveal how everyone had fared.

239
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:54,863
The game, of course, was a simplification of real U-boat action,

240
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:59,584
but there was enough here for Roberts to begin staging recent sea battles

241
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:04,326
that had happened actually on the ocean to recreate them in the game.

242
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,807
His objective here was to experience the action from the perspective of the U-boats

243
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:14,788
and using that knowledge, assess what the escort commanders might have done differently

244
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,709
to save ships, supplies and lives.

245
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,743
With the rudiments of the game in place, Roberts now spent a great deal of his time studying

246
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,466
the after-action reports that had been written by naval officers who had battled U-boats

247
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:35,709
and survived. He was searching for clues to their tactics. His position in Liverpool at

248
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:41,573
Derby House meant that he was ideally situated to meet and quiz any and every naval officer

249
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,134
who passed through Western Approaches Command.

250
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:51,005
This meant that Roberts did not have to rely solely on the rather staid written testimony of the sailors.

251
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:56,549
He could also listen to first-hand accounts, interviewing men as they returned from sea.

252
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:02,052
During the course of several interviews, a rather chaotic picture emerged.

253
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:08,516
Not only was there no set of tactics by which the Royal Naval ships were fighting U-boats,

254
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,699
neither was there any training for how the ships should work together as a team.

255
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:22,432
The destroyers and the corvettes, it seemed to Roberts, were broadly free to direct their response according to each ship's captain's whim or notion.

256
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:29,335
Fred Osborne, 1st Lieutenant of the Corvette HMS Gentian, who later worked at Wattie for

257
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:35,259
a number of months, described convoy defence at the time as difficult and haphazard, and

258
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,181
in the absence of collective countermeasures.

259
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,644
He wrote, no clear doctrine for combating attacks on convoys had been formulated or

260
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:46,426
taught and as such the losses were appalling.

261
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,162
Roberts asked every captain that he interviewed the same question.

262
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:56,126
What do you do when one of your merchant ships in the middle of the convoy is torpedoed?

263
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:02,112
Some of the captains spoke of going to action stations, others about increasing their speed,

264
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:05,535
but when pressed, most of them just shrugged in resignation.

265
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:10,979
What could you do in the middle of the night, blind, explosions sounding all around,

266
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:16,382
when your radar operator was unable to distinguish the sound of a U-boat in the water

267
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:20,064
from the noise of a choppy sea or even a shoal of fish?

268
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:26,929
There was another reason why the naval escorts were having such an awful time hunting the U-boats.

269
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:32,132
This was an incorrect assumption about the way in which the U-boats were attacking,

270
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:35,054
and it had resulted in thousands of deaths at sea.

271
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:41,344
Roberts didn't know it yet, but his primary task in turning around Allied fortunes at sea

272
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:49,307
would rest on his successfully spotting this cardinal error in the British understanding of how U-boats operated.

273
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:56,990
Now to understand this cardinal error we need to meet this man, 28-year-old Otto Kretschmer,

274
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,471
perhaps the most famous of Germany's U-boat aces.

275
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,922
The young U-boat commander was taciturn and focused.

276
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,663
One of his nicknames, in fact, was Silent Otto.

277
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:10,905
But he inspired utter loyalty from his crew,

278
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,727
many of whom were, like the Wrens, very young people

279
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,108
who were barely out of school.

280
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,791
Kretschmer's contribution to German U-boat strategy

281
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:21,851
was profound.

282
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,083
In the early months of the war, the U-boat captains would attack Allied ships from outside

283
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:33,586
the boundary of the convoy. This was to abide by the recommendation of the manufacturer of

284
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:39,110
the torpedoes that they used, which advised that they were ensured a distance of no less

285
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,432
than one kilometre between the U-boat and its target.

286
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:48,377
There was uncertainty as well about the effectiveness of British sonar detection,

287
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:50,217
which was known at the time as ASDIC,

288
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:53,438
and that led to many U-boats firing their torpedoes

289
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,680
from well outside the detection range of the escorts,

290
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,581
at sometimes a range of three kilometres or even more.

291
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:05,062
Now, Kretschmer wanted to see what would happen

292
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,983
if he could slip past the naval escort ships.

293
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:14,398
enter the lanes of the convoy in amongst the merchant ships and fire practically from point

294
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:21,722
blank range. He had a motto, one ship, one torpedo and of course the less distance between

295
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:26,185
his U-boat and the target the easier it would be to adhere to that motto.

296
00:25:27,698 --> 00:25:31,240
Kretschmer first attempted this manoeuvre in September 1940.

297
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:37,984
One night he slunk in between the escort ships, in the cover of darkness, on the surface of the water,

298
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,126
where he could evade detection by the Allied sonar.

299
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:46,329
And then, like a fox inside a henhouse, he successfully sank three ships,

300
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:50,351
firing his torpedoes at a very close distance.

301
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:56,404
When he returned to his U-boat base in the captured French port of Lorient later that

302
00:25:56,464 --> 00:26:01,007
month, Kretschmer wrote up his findings in a set of standing orders for his crew.

303
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:05,990
This document laid out the rules for the efficient and successful running of a U-boat.

304
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,833
It was a 12-point plan, covered everything from the need for an effective lookout to

305
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:13,954
the requirement that the men set aside time to clean their dishes.

306
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:20,138
Most of these instructions were commonsensical, but Kretschmer's point nine went against the

307
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:26,162
written advice that the U-boat's captains maintain a minimum distance of a thousand meters between

308
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:32,046
their vessel and its target. Kretschmer wrote plainly that at every given opportunity the

309
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:37,529
torpedo should be fired at extreme close range. This can only be done, he wrote,

310
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,453
by penetrating the escort's anti-submarine screen and getting inside the convoy's lanes.

311
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:48,572
This, he added, should be the objective of all our attacks.

312
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,958
In just two sentences, Kretschmer had outlined a tactic that would, in the

313
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:56,922
months to come, lead to the deaths of thousands of

314
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,185
Allied soldiers and raise the line on the chart of

315
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:05,451
shipping losses at Admiralty in London, perilously close to the threshold of defeat.

316
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:14,007
One of Wattoo's first tasks was to restage a battle from a few weeks earlier in December 1941,

317
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:18,071
where the British ships had actually successfully sunk three U-boats.

318
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:23,015
Roberts and his team believed that this, the battle for convoy HG76,

319
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,717
held some of the secrets they were looking for.

320
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:32,662
So the team arranged 48 miniature ships in 12 columns on the floor. They added the tracks of

321
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:39,806
the three U-boats that were known to have participated in the battle. U-434, 574 and 131.

322
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:46,490
With the stage set, Roberts now began to move the convoy which spread across six white lines

323
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,235
on the floor to represent a six mile width in two minute intervals at a simulated rate of 10 knots.

324
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:59,987
Each move was made on the floor in precisely the same pattern as the actual escort had

325
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:01,848
moved a few weeks earlier at sea.

326
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:08,013
In this way, blow by blow, Roberts imitated the action as per the official reports.

327
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:14,017
He was able to see the battle from a crow's nest perspective above the board, and as he

328
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:15,779
did, a question formed in his mind.

329
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:21,937
If the U-boats had been firing from outside the perimeter of the convoy, as was widely believed,

330
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:26,959
how had one of the British ships, which was at the centre of the convoy, been sunk?

331
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:34,241
The distance just seemed too far. Might it be possible then, he wondered, that the U-boat

332
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:41,483
had attacked this ship not from outside the convoy, but right from inside the columns from point-blank range?

333
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:45,307
There was a simple way he reasoned to prove his theory.

334
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,369
Hold everything, he told his staff.

335
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,732
He rushed into his office to make a phone call.

336
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,615
Roberts picked up the receiver and asked the operator

337
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:55,578
to put him through to the flag officer submarines in London,

338
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,660
hoping to speak to its chief of staff,

339
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,323
an old friend, Captain Ian McIntyre.

340
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,506
To Roberts' astonishment, the flag officer himself,

341
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,588
Admiral Sir Max Horton, picked up.

342
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:09,584
Horton was an officer of foreboding distinction.

343
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,985
As a young submarine commander in the British Navy,

344
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,245
he'd scored the first kill of the Great War.

345
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:18,206
And on return to port, he would signal success

346
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:21,307
to the cheering onlookers by flying the Pirate's Flag,

347
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,608
the Jolly Roger, making a tradition

348
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:25,088
that would continue thereafter

349
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:28,029
to the end of the Falklands War and even more recently.

350
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:32,517
Horton's talent as a submariner propelled him up the ranks and

351
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:38,048
years later his biographer described him as the greatest authority on submarine warfare.

352
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:44,628
So on the phone, Roberts explained who he was and asked Horton if he could ask a question.

353
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:50,150
During the last war, Roberts asked, would you ever have crept among the ships of a convoy

354
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,510
to fire your torpedoes?

355
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:56,212
Of course, replied Horton, it's the only way of pressing home an attack.

356
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,033
Thank you, sir, said Roberts, and hung up.

357
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:04,490
It was late, but Roberts asked Laidlaw and one of the younger wrens, Janet O'Kell,

358
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:10,855
if they might stay behind with him, reset the game and run a new version of it on the

359
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:11,576
giant board.

360
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:17,281
The two women, who were infused with Roberts' excitement, agreed, and together they hurriedly

361
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,222
reset the game.

362
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:24,747
This time, Roberts placed a U-boat model right in the centre of the convoy and ran the events

363
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:25,888
of the battle in reverse.

364
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:39,966
If the range of the torpedoes was around two and a half miles, it was reasonable to imagine that U-boat captains would try to fire from less than half that distance in order to maximise their chances of scoring a hit.

365
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:49,916
Between them, Roberts and the Wrens began to plot different scenarios that might have enabled the U-boat to sneak inside the lanes of the convoy without being detected.

366
00:30:51,237 --> 00:30:57,600
Only one of these scenarios checked out. One of the U-boats must have entered the column

367
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,042
from the rear. It must have done so on the surface of the water, where it would have been able to

368
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:07,824
travel a little faster than the ships it pursued, and by approaching from this direction,

369
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:11,786
where the lookouts rarely checked, it would have done so without being detected.

370
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:18,390
Roberts and the Wrens headed to the kitchen to make coffee and a round of corned beef sandwiches.

371
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,052
The conversation continued to centre on the battle they had left suspended on the floor of the game

372
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:29,394
room. The group discussed how, if they were a U-boat captain, having made a point-blank

373
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:34,095
range attack on a merchant ship, they might then attempt to escape the battle unharmed.

374
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,364
The game had enabled these fledgling tacticians to begin to think like U-boat captains.

375
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:43,967
From that perspective, the answer suddenly seemed obvious.

376
00:31:44,828 --> 00:31:51,412
Having made your attack, you would just simply dive and you'd sit there and wait for all the ships to roll on overhead.

377
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:59,679
And eventually, Roberts concluded in his diary, I would emerge deep from the stern of the convoy and he would get away unharmed.

378
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,442
Kretschmer's U-boat tactic had been abruptly unveiled.

379
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:10,279
Now Roberts wanted to try out some potential countermeasures that might foil the plan.

380
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:15,602
The team returned to the game room and Roberts assumed the role of a U-boat captain while

381
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:21,545
Laidlaw and O'Kell played as the escort ships. A countermeasure revealed itself immediately.

382
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:27,368
Rather than splay out from the convoy at speed and drop depth charges at random,

383
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,811
as was the current common practice, Laidlaw and O'Kell lined up the escort ships around the convoy,

384
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:39,909
While the convoy continued on its way, each escort ship performed a series of triangular

385
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:45,691
sweeps, listening for the U-boats trying to flush it out from its position beneath the convoy.

386
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:50,793
With a mounting sense of excitement, the team ran the procedure twice more,

387
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:54,635
and in both instances Robert's U-boat was detected and sunk.

388
00:32:56,033 --> 00:33:00,736
It was by now the early hours of the morning, and in all the excitement, time had passed unnoticed.

389
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:04,698
Roberts ordered a staff car to return the two young women home.

390
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:12,743
The next morning, Roberts sent an invitation to the sceptical Admiral Percy Noble, his boss,

391
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:17,646
to come up to Wattie's office and watch a demonstration of their findings.

392
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,709
Noble entered the game room, flanked by his staff.

393
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:25,693
The commander-in-chief warily eyed the chalk markings on the floor,

394
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,834
the canvas sheets that were decked out like ship portholes.

395
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,475
What was all this make-believe nonsense?

396
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,737
Undeterred, Roberts began to explain their discoveries.

397
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:39,960
How the U-boats would slip between the convoy ships on the surface of water at night,

398
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,521
when they were unlikely to be spotted, how they would make their attacks,

399
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:46,303
and then dive to wait until the danger had passed.

400
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:49,078
The atmosphere was frosty.

401
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:52,959
Noble had made no secret of his condescending skepticism

402
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,220
towards Watteau's work.

403
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,421
Roberts detected a tone in Noble's manner of snootiness,

404
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,401
as he put it.

405
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:02,702
How could this former naval officer,

406
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:05,242
with his nubs of chalk and jumbles of string,

407
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:08,823
contribute anything useful to the real battles being waged

408
00:34:08,883 --> 00:34:09,363
at sea?

409
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:12,764
But as the game played out on the floor,

410
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:16,125
the admiral began to sit forward in his chair in astonishment.

411
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:22,405
One of the Wrens, playing as a U-boat, fired a torpedo from within the convoy's columns and then dove.

412
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:27,406
Roberts performed the team's newly developed counter-tactic,

413
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:32,788
moving the escort ships in triangular sweeping patterns designed to flush out the hidden U-boat.

414
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:38,350
And while performing these sweeps, one of the ships picked up the Germans' position on its radar.

415
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:44,072
As he watched, Noble saw for the first time the errors that had been responsible

416
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:46,413
for such a tremendous loss of life at sea.

417
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:50,924
When the demonstration was finished, the Admiral stood to his feet,

418
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,967
congratulated Roberts and asked what this new manoeuvre was to be called.

419
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:02,311
Jean Laidlaw, the 21-year-old woman responsible for statistical analysis at Watu,

420
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,493
explained that she had christened it Raspberry.

421
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:10,776
It was, she said, a razz of contempt aimed at Hitler and his U-boat fleet.

422
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:17,539
Noble, the Commander-in-Chief, then turned to one of his men and told him to take down a message

423
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,024
to be sent immediately to the Prime Minister. The first investigations have shown, it read,

424
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:29,449
a cardinal error in U-boat tactics. A new, immediate and concerted counter-attack

425
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,532
will be signalled to the fleet within 24 hours.

426
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:39,918
Raspberry was a revolutionary tactic and its effect on the war at sea was immediate.

427
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:47,135
Shortly after the demonstration to Noble, Watteau began running week-long courses for naval officers

428
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:52,100
who would play out imaginary battles and learn how to perform the counter-tactics,

429
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:57,746
which soon included a variety of other operations, each named after a different fruit.

430
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:05,268
For the officers who were playing as escort commanders behind the canvas peepholes, the games were keenly intense.

431
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:13,252
The pressure of those two minute intervals between turns mimicked the stress of action against U-boats at sea.

432
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:21,837
And each officer would often be caught up in the fiction, no longer viewing the pieces on the floor or the chalk lines as game pieces,

433
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:26,999
but as real ships, real wakes and real explosions that they represented.

434
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,603
The game occupied an unusual position between reality and make-believe.

435
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:37,486
No limbs or lives were lost here on the linoleum ocean, of course,

436
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:42,249
but neither was the game fully abstracted in the way that Monopoly is based on,

437
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,491
but distinct from the property business.

438
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:50,595
For the men who played Watu's game, and who would often return from sea just a few days earlier,

439
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:56,579
and who were due to sail again a few days later, the game had this unsettling quality.

440
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:02,623
The choices they made on the floor reflected each officer's current tactical thinking.

441
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:08,165
If his ship was lost during the game, he had to cope with the knowledge that had the same

442
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:13,946
situation arisen at sea, he would have probably acted in the exact same way and may well have

443
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:14,366
died.

444
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,747
Make your mistakes here and you won't make them at sea, Roberts was fond of saying.

445
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:26,169
A euphemistic way of pointing out the scale of risk against which the game was attempting

446
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,429
to insure its players.

447
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:39,259
For all Robert's engaging presentation, a man who failed to drive off a U-boat, or worse still, who lost his ship in the game, would leave Watu feeling sternly chastened.

448
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:54,391
We destroy U-boats out on the oceans, wrote one journalist who sat in on a round of the game, but the death sentence is delivered miles away in the Assay's court in an old building erected on the banks of the River Mersey.

449
00:37:56,523 --> 00:38:00,145
Watto's courses, which lasted from Monday through to Saturday,

450
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:04,669
and which ran weekly without interruption from the first week of February 1942

451
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,750
to the last week of July 1945, involved up to 50 officers at once.

452
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:18,935
Each course consisted of four game scenarios which varied details such as weather conditions,

453
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:23,777
visibility, time of day and the size, speed and start point of the convoy.

454
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:29,139
And finally, when the game was finished, the officers would step from behind the canvas

455
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:33,781
screens and together with the Wrens sit in a square of chairs around the room.

456
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:39,387
With a 10-foot wooden pole, Roberts would commentate on the preceding battle,

457
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:44,333
blow by blow, like a sports pundit delivering his post-match verdict.

458
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:48,979
Roberts would draw attention to moments of particular brilliance,

459
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,264
moments of particular disaster, and the turning point of each game.

460
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:58,687
These summations were for Roberts one of the most enjoyable aspects of the work.

461
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:04,373
He relished the opportunity to build a picture of the battle much more vivid and engaging than

462
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:09,098
the rather stale reports that were written by officers who had returned from action at sea.

463
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:16,143
As we listened to him, he made the most difficult situation appear simple," said Vice Admiral

464
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:18,364
Gilbert Stevenson of Roberts Flair.

465
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:23,925
He appreciated the difficulty that hundreds of commanding officers had in deciding what

466
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:29,067
to do when faced with any of the surprises that war at sea constantly presented, and

467
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:33,408
he taught them how to meet those surprises until they were ready for anything.

468
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:40,741
Still, the combination of ministration and expertise was not always welcomed by the experienced

469
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:46,685
officers on the receiving end of advice from these young women. Often the men would resent

470
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:53,249
being told what to do, no matter how gently, by teenagers, some of whom were barely out of school

471
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,231
and who in most cases had never even been to sea.

472
00:39:57,365 --> 00:40:03,227
During one 1942 game, for example, Bob Winnie, who captained the destroyer HMS Wanderer,

473
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:08,849
in which he sank three U-boats, handed his instructions to one of the Wrens, Judy de

474
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:13,170
Vivier, who he described as a particularly clued-up girl, who he had been assigned.

475
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,971
No, sir, said Judy, of Winnie's chosen move.

476
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:18,732
I don't think you should do that.

477
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:23,234
Good God, he would later record thinking of her firm and plight request.

478
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:25,554
What on earth does this girl know about it?

479
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:32,093
but so confident and tactful was D'Vivia's tone that when Winnie chose to hear her out,

480
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:39,361
he listened to her convincing explanation in astonishment. From his perspective, a battle-worn

481
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:44,327
captain was being tutored on the finer points of U-boat warfare by an inexperienced young

482
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:44,608
woman.

483
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:54,547
For Roberts, this exchange vindicated a long-held belief that with careful design, games had the capacity to make experts of amateurs,

484
00:40:55,027 --> 00:41:00,550
and to instil in players invaluable, potentially life-saving, battle-winning experience.

485
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:08,234
In the summer of 1942, the escort ships sank four times as many U-boats as the previous month,

486
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:12,316
beginning an upward trend that would continue broadly for the rest of the year.

487
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,393
In the months that followed the development of Raspberry, using information gleaned via debriefs,

488
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:21,755
Roberts and the Wrens developed numerous other tactical manoeuvres

489
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:25,097
that would suit the expanding variety of wolfpack attacks.

490
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:31,401
Most of these manoeuvres, which involved the escort ships performing various different shapes

491
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:36,124
and varieties of coordinated sweeps to find and flush out the lurking U-boats,

492
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:38,366
were given the names of fruit and vegetables.

493
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:43,250
There was pineapple, there was gooseberry, there was strawberry and artichoke,

494
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,693
and a modification to the original manoeuvre that was known as a half raspberry.

495
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:52,177
The unit revolutionised British anti-submarine warfare.

496
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:57,862
By the summer of 1943, the U-boats had been decisively driven from the Atlantic.

497
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:02,106
During the period that the Germans subsequently dubbed Black May,

498
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:07,330
the German Navy lost 41 U-boats, many to Watu-coined operations.

499
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,353
It was a decisive tally on this, the impersonal scoresheet of war.

500
00:42:14,443 --> 00:42:22,126
Karl DÃ¶nitz, who by now was the Grand Admiral of the German Navy and who never lost his first love for U-boats or the young men who crewed them,

501
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:26,888
ordered the withdrawal of Wolfpacks from the Atlantic battlefield in the summer of 1943.

502
00:42:27,008 --> 00:42:32,770
It was, he urged, merely a temporary, partial change of operations area.

503
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:41,173
But four months later, the US Admiral Ernest King downgraded the U-boats from the category of menace to a mere problem.

504
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:49,497
In the 17 weeks that followed the 17th of May 1943, the Allies sailed 62 east and westbound

505
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:54,838
convoys along their North Atlantic routes without losing a single ship to a U-boat.

506
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:01,640
More than 12 million tonnes of food and supplies arrived unimpeded into Britain from eastbound

507
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,160
convoys.

508
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:09,710
Seizing the opportunity, senior officers at the Admiralty then increased the size of the convoys,

509
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:16,715
which by June 1943 averaged 62 merchant ships compared to just 43 the previous month.

510
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:22,959
The so-called Tonnage War was finished and with it, in most ways that mattered,

511
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:24,480
the Battle of the Atlantic.

512
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,225
Between the first week of February 42 and the last of July 45, when Watu officially closed,

513
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:38,310
close to 5,000 naval officers played the game run by Captain Roberts and the Wrens

514
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:45,036
during more than 130 courses. Graduates of the game included the ornithologist and painter Peter

515
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:50,401
Scott, remembered by one of the Wrens for having drawn ducks all over his navigational chart.

516
00:43:51,347 --> 00:43:56,192
There was a young Philip Mountbatten too, future husband to Queen Elizabeth II,

517
00:43:56,552 --> 00:44:00,976
whose presence around the unit brought many of the Wrens unending delight, as one put it.

518
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,339
And there was the writer Nicholas Montserrat,

519
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,583
who would go on to describe in his 1951 novel The Cruel Sea,

520
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:12,587
a convoy game played out with model ships on the floor of an empty room,

521
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:15,549
that was clearly based on his experience at Wattoo.

522
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:20,286
In addition to the thousands of British naval officers who completed the course,

523
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:25,069
Roberts and the Wrens trained delegates from everywhere from the United States to India,

524
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,551
Malaya to Norway, and four university professors.

525
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:33,054
Many graduates of the game credited the battles they waged on the floor

526
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:38,077
as being instrumental in their subsequent victories during encounters with the U-boats at sea.

527
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:44,398
Similar tactical units sprang up across the British Empire, some of which were also staffed

528
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:51,240
by young Wrens who, by playing the game time and time again, also became experts in anti-submarine

529
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,622
warfare. By 1945, a total of 66 Wrens had completed the course themselves

530
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:01,803
in order to become staff at Watto or one of its sister units.

531
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:13,990
2,603 merchant ships and 175 of the escorting naval vessels were sunk in the Battle of the

532
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,731
Atlantic, which was the longest continuous military campaign in the Second World War.

533
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:23,672
More than 30,000 merchant seamen and more than 6,000 Royal Navy

534
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:28,213
sailors died in the Atlantic during the war, many in attacks by U-boats.

535
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:37,614
It was an astonishing loss of life that was tempered by the work of the men and women of Wattoo and the sailors who deployed their tactics at sea.

536
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:46,298
At the end of the war, Sir Max Horton, the commander-in-chief of Western Approaches, who had been defeated in a game by two of Wattoo's wrens himself,

537
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:55,141
sent the following personal signal directed to all those who had served in the unit, an incandescent tribute to their quiet momentous achievements.

538
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,354
On the closing down of Watu, he wrote,

539
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:02,056
I wish to express my gratitude and high appreciation

540
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:05,298
of the magnificent work of Captain Roberts and his staff,

541
00:46:05,698 --> 00:46:07,999
which has contributed in no small measure

542
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,120
to the final defeat of Germany.

543
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,902
Later, Churchill famously wrote that the only thing

544
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:15,983
that ever really frightened him during the war

545
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:17,324
was the U-boat peril.

546
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:20,025
Without Roberts and the Wren's work,

547
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,187
the Battle of the Atlantic may have been lost,

548
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:24,368
and perhaps even the war with it.

549
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:33,279
Four weeks after the U-boats retreated from the Atlantic in 1943, my grandfather, who was 17 years

550
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:38,643
old at the time, made his inaugural journey across the ocean in a merchant ship protected

551
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:46,009
by naval officers trained by Watu. Thanks in major part to their work, he arrived in New York untouched.

552
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,537
Many of those involved in Watteau's work never spoke of their role in the war.

553
00:46:52,278 --> 00:46:55,259
While the group's feat and contribution is barely remembered,

554
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:04,522
by the fall of Berlin in 1945, the U-boat commanders were intimately familiar with Roberts, his team and their tactics.

555
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:12,145
Roberts spoke fluent German and he was one of the first British officers to land in Germany following the surrender of the Nazis.

556
00:47:12,905 --> 00:47:17,006
He was in fact in Berlin the night the Americans performed their final raid of the war.

557
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:24,023
The following day, Roberts eagerly traveled to the U-boat headquarters in the German town of Flensburg.

558
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:30,548
There he met the veteran submarine commander, architect of the Wolfpack tactic,

559
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:36,593
and the man who later that week would become Hitler's successor as president of Germany, Admiral Karl Donitz.

560
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,156
The two men exchanged respectful salutes.

561
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:44,679
The other U-boat captains, however, appeared to blanch at the sight of Roberts,

562
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,740
and their fear was soon explained.

563
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:52,301
Roberts began a tour of the facility and he visited the U-boat operations room itself.

564
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:58,384
And there, enlarged and tacked to a wall, he saw his own photograph which had been

565
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:03,566
taken out of a magazine article. Beneath the image there was a handwritten caption,

566
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:09,629
This is your enemy, Captain Roberts, Director of Anti-U-Boat Tactics.

567
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:18,286
Games and video games are usually dismissed as childish pursuits, something to be set down

568
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:24,190
in adolescence and maybe picked up again in retirement. But as Major Tom explained to me

569
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,994
in Shrivenham, in times of great turmoil, war games rise in popularity and they rise in importance.

570
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:37,759
That was true in 1942, and as office rooms in the Pentagon and in Whitehall resound

571
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,281
with the rattle of dice, it's equally true today.

572
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:44,105
Thank you very much for listening.
