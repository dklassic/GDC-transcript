1
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:11,374
Is that going to go?

2
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:11,755
Yeah.

3
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:12,355
Hi.

4
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:13,777
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:16,139
I've been a game designer for like 10 years now.

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,541
I did eight years in Reykjavik, Iceland,

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,204
with CCP Games on EVE Online, which you may have heard of.

8
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:25,768
And I spent the last two years in Berlin, Germany,

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,930
with a company called Sandbox Interactive,

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,132
making Audi Online, which you probably haven't.

11
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,934
But that's what I'm going to talk about today.

12
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:33,415
Let me start my timer.

13
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,959
So, things I'm going to talk about today.

14
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,721
I'm going to try and explain what this Albion thing is that I make,

15
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,584
at least to the degree where you can understand the rest of the talk.

16
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:49,827
I'm going to explain what I mean by economy balance and why it matters.

17
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:54,010
And then I'm going to kind of walk through...

18
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,733
our balance process or like kind of our economy setup process for Albion.

19
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:02,475
I'm going to talk about setting goals, why they're important, how we set up the relationships

20
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:09,398
between things, a little bit on doing the math, filling everything in, and then kind

21
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:13,640
of what happens when we ship, how we deal with feedback, how we kind of iterate on it

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,100
as a result.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,382
I'm going to try not to talk too fast because I've been a little bit jet-lagged, so bear

24
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,102
with me.

25
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:19,543
Thank you.

26
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:19,983
Thank you.

27
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:28,159
To explain Albion, I want to briefly thrash through the family tree of Western MMOs.

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,162
Ignoring Asia because it's convenient, not because it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:33,283
I don't need it for this.

30
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:35,625
But we love you, Asia.

31
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:39,008
So we start off with multi-user dungeons back in the late 70s, early 80s.

32
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:44,893
Basically a way of allowing people to play versions of Dungeons & Dragons

33
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,315
on university mainframes with their friends.

34
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,456
And we kind of build from there.

35
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:55,861
In the late 90s, we get the two kind of beginnings of modern MMOs coming through.

36
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,003
We get EverQuest and we get Ultima Online.

37
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:02,886
EverQuest we can already divide this tree branching in two now.

38
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:06,349
EverQuest is kind of what we'd refer to as a theme park game, or an early version of

39
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:11,452
a theme park game, which is largely about gaining experience and leveling up and getting

40
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:15,135
loot and progressing through the game to the end game.

41
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,017
Ultima by contrast is what we'd refer to as a sandbox game.

42
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:22,265
It's much more about giving players a world and some tools

43
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:28,959
and letting them interact with each other and figure out for themselves how to have fun to a large degree.

44
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,106
They run for a while, they do okay.

45
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:35,847
So early 2000s, we get them for the next iteration.

46
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,608
Yeah, World of Warcraft really kind of consolidates

47
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,269
the theme park approach.

48
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,129
It adds an extensive questing system,

49
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,110
which really gives you those rides in the theme park.

50
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,250
So you know, you get on your quest

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,870
and you go do the quest and it's wonderful.

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,731
And then you're done with that quest

53
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,931
and you move to the next quest.

54
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,232
Very much again, progression focused

55
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,272
and getting to the raids kind of focused.

56
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,873
Eve, by contrast, is kind of Ultima in space.

57
00:02:56,873 --> 00:03:00,696
It's still very focused on players interacting

58
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,578
with each other and kind of emerging gameplay

59
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,119
and kind of seeing what happens in the world.

60
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,080
Probably the biggest departure there

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,741
is that Eve goes single sharded.

62
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:12,783
Most MMOs do what we call sharding.

63
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,845
They split the world up into multiple copies of itself

64
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,626
and players connect to a particular shard

65
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:19,447
and that's where their characters and their friends are.

66
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,169
and they play on that copy of the world.

67
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,972
Eve, everyone connects to the same world space,

68
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,896
the same instance essentially of the world.

69
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:29,459
That's kind of quite a big step for sandbox games

70
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,721
because it really means everyone is interacting

71
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,743
with each other as much as possible.

72
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:37,849
From there, World of Warcraft leads to basically

73
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,050
all the MMOs in the universe.

74
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:45,472
World of Warcraft makes a lot of money, as you may have noticed, and everybody else wants

75
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,355
some of that money, so they go after that.

76
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:51,722
And that leads to a lot of MMOs, and on the sandbox side we kind of get Darkfall, which

77
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:55,648
you may have heard of, which is kind of a more PvP-oriented version of Ultima.

78
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:59,151
and then not very much at that kind of scale,

79
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,653
and now I'll be in a Fitzen over here.

80
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:03,235
We're inspired by Eve, we're inspired by Darkfall,

81
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:04,957
and we're inspired by the original Ultima.

82
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,720
That's kind of where we fit in.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,142
So we are an MMO, we're like World of Warcraft,

84
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,544
in that we're a shared, persistent fantasy world,

85
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,926
but we're not like World of Warcraft

86
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:15,707
in most other respects.

87
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,329
Hopefully that gives you a sense of where we go.

88
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,180
I was going to do a slide explaining what is this Albion thing, but then I realized

89
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,900
we made a video.

90
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,820
What is Albion?

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,502
Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG in which you get to write your own story instead of

92
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,302
just following a laid out path.

93
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:36,203
Explore a vast open world consisting of different unique biomes.

94
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:40,244
Everything you do has an impact on the world.

95
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:45,926
As in our player driven economy, every piece of equipment is crafted by players from resources

96
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,186
gathered by players.

97
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:50,708
The equipment you wear defines what you are.

98
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:56,512
Switching from knight to magician is as easy as swapping your armor and weapon.

99
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,033
Or be a combination of the two.

100
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:04,357
Venture out into the world or into dungeons and face Albion's inhabitants and wildlife.

101
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:08,500
Go on expeditions to encounter even more challenges.

102
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,582
Fight other players in open world clashes.

103
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:15,865
Fight over territory or city control in tactical group battles.

104
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,431
Relax by retreating to your personal island.

105
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:24,695
Build a home, grow crops, raise animals.

106
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:25,576
Join a guild.

107
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,000
Everything is more fun when you work together.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,424
Leave your mark in the world.

109
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:36,187
In Albion, everybody matters.

110
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:44,350
Yeah, so that's kind of basically what we do.

111
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,111
It's single sharded.

112
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,912
It's very sandboxy.

113
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,473
It's very player oriented.

114
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:52,875
Three kind of things that I'd pull out that I think

115
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,776
make us stand out.

116
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,838
Albion is we regard ourselves as properly multi-platform.

117
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,379
We're releasing in July, we hope,

118
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,161
on PC, Mac, Linux, and Android tablets,

119
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,742
with iOS following soon after.

120
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:12,306
We're targeting tablets and we're targeting 2GB of memory because it's kind of intensive,

121
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,367
but it's not just like a companion app.

122
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:19,990
What you play on your tablet is the same client, it's just a different build of Unity, connected

123
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,370
to the same game world with the same stuff.

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,992
You can go raiding and PVPing on your iPad if you want.

125
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,594
That's led us, for example, to our art style you saw,

126
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:31,136
is very kind of simple, but I think looks really good still.

127
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,658
Makes us think a lot about accessibility

128
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,179
and about complexity of the game,

129
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:36,760
kind of trying to bridge those two audiences

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,721
with the traditional MMO crowd, which

131
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,762
is kind of our primary audience, but also bringing it

132
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,083
to the mobile arena as well.

133
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,980
Another thing that we do, we focus on small team PvP.

134
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,386
A lot of sandbox games, particularly something like EVE, you've probably heard of 5,000 people

135
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:55,108
fighting out in the system, which is cool.

136
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,172
And we still have the opportunity for that in our open world PvP.

137
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:03,695
But in terms of conquering territory, we take a break from that direction.

138
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:08,377
The way you take another guild's territory is you pick one of their vulnerability slots

139
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:12,559
in their time zone and then you bring five players and they bring five players and we

140
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,841
wall it off, wall the territory off into like an arena and you fight it out with the equipment

141
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:17,802
both sides have brought.

142
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:22,844
So even though there is opportunity to go big, if you want to be, you can be a small

143
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:26,846
guild if you've got five people and five good fighters and a couple of logistics and

144
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,506
crafting people.

145
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:32,211
you can claim your own corner of the world without needing to bring hundreds of players.

146
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:35,654
So that both kind of brings, I think, a different direction to some of our PvP

147
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,758
and also informs a lot of our thinking because we have to think about this, you know,

148
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,480
tightly balanced, small-scale engagements.

149
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:47,973
The third thing we like to wave around is this UR Uwear thing, which works really well

150
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:48,173
for us.

151
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:52,434
Obviously it gives players a lot of choice, which is good for them.

152
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:58,035
It also means that kind of the more macro level, we've got like 45 base weapons and

153
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:03,276
27 armor sets, I think, or 27 armor items, and they all have spells attached and a choice

154
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:08,718
of spells and you can mix and match those completely, which leads to a lot of variety

155
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:10,298
in PvP, which is what we're going for.

156
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,058
It means that.

157
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:14,380
every fight can be different because players are constantly looking for that

158
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,302
improved build and that counter build and all this kind of stuff

159
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,663
so it keeps the PvP as fresh as it can rather than

160
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:23,345
like there's no classes, there's no restrictions on this stuff so you're not

161
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:25,746
just like oh it's a monk he's probably running one of

162
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,727
these three builds we know how to deal with that

163
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:30,929
you see someone like he's wearing a plate helmet and cloth hues what's going

164
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,150
on here it just leads to a lot more variety and

165
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,612
interest there. So that's kind of that's the game we're

166
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:39,633
talking about hopefully

167
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,955
That gives you almost enough of an understanding to understand the rest of this talk.

168
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,097
I'm going to get into the meat of it now.

169
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,739
What is economy balance and why?

170
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:52,022
I have a philosophy background so I like why questions.

171
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:56,907
I also find the answers to them really useful in kind of informing my thinking.

172
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:58,049
Hopefully it will help you too.

173
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:02,753
So I'm going to be talking about, yeah, what is economy balance, why do we care about economy

174
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:03,034
balance.

175
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,495
I think these are important questions.

176
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,667
So, economy balance, we take at Sandbox

177
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,473
a pretty expansive view of economy.

178
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:15,393
basically all the macro scale balance in the game.

179
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:17,013
We're not worried about stuff at this,

180
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,414
for economy stuff with like, you know,

181
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:20,694
does the axe do more damage than the sword?

182
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,135
But like, does the level one axe do more damage

183
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,575
than the level three axe and how much?

184
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,776
That's already getting into economy territory

185
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:29,757
because it's a power scaling issue.

186
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,997
So yeah, economy means all the macro balance.

187
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,878
It means obviously resources and money,

188
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,178
our silver and our various resources you can collect.

189
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,203
It also means the progression system.

190
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:42,467
We have this tree structure and you earn fame,

191
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:46,234
which is our version of XP in different areas of the tree.

192
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:47,556
You use a double-handed sword

193
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,159
and you get better at double-handed swords.

194
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:54,708
But the balance of that ties in, the balance between, like I was saying, equipment tiers

195
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,529
ties into the economy balance because it's all of a thing.

196
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,131
Our farming system, for example, and everything else at that kind of scale of the game where

197
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:07,453
we're trying to balance resources and macro level stuff against each other, all falls

198
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:11,874
under the aegis of economy balance and it all gets approached generally the same way,

199
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:14,495
the same kind of process, which is what I'm going to talk about in a bit.

200
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,677
Why do we care? I like this question, I think this is important.

201
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:21,501
I'm going to do some theory.

202
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,665
We want our game to be good, right?

203
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:29,138
And I don't like using the word fun because I think it constrains too much what we can

204
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:29,979
be doing with games.

205
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:34,443
Like if you ask someone who's climbed Mount Everest if they thought it was fun, they would

206
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,644
probably say no.

207
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,946
That doesn't mean it wasn't good.

208
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:43,210
So I'm going to try not to use the word fun too much in this talk because I think it's

209
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,913
too constraining for what we can offer as a game, particularly when you get into virtual

210
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,394
worlds like we do.

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,848
And we think our economy balance can make a huge difference to whether or not our game is good.

212
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,373
So we do want to think about it carefully and we do want to get it right.

213
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,640
So let's talk about motivation.

214
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,420
I've been relying for many years,

215
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,960
I used it a lot on the Eve team,

216
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,901
and I've been using it as well at Sandbox.

217
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:07,381
On a model that I borrowed from,

218
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:10,382
or we borrowed from Scott Rigby and the folks at Immersive.

219
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,002
I think Scott's doing a talk later today,

220
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:12,963
so you should go listen to him,

221
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,503
because I'm gonna try and skim over it,

222
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:16,883
and I'm gonna get some of it wrong, I apologize.

223
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:17,864
But hopefully it gives you enough

224
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,544
to understand where we're going with this.

225
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:23,005
So in this model we have intrinsic motivators,

226
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,225
for starters, you have autonomy.

227
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,008
feeling like you're in control of what's going on,

228
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:31,272
relatedness, feeling like you're connected to other people,

229
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:34,837
and mastery, feeling like you're improving in skills.

230
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:36,419
And these are our intrinsic motivators.

231
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,782
These are things that just make people feel good.

232
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,225
And if you can get them doing all three of these things at once,

233
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:44,529
then they're pretty much guaranteed to be enjoying your game.

234
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,093
The real tricky one for MOs and other long-running games we find is usually mastery because mastery is not

235
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:55,855
Being good at something. It's getting better mastery consumes

236
00:11:55,855 --> 00:12:01,117
That's why you have to spend so much on on content in theme park games for example because the content is consumed as you go

237
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:06,299
Once you've beaten something you've solved it. It stops being interesting from this point of view

238
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,901
So yeah, if we can hit all three of these then we're probably in a good place

239
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,182
By contrast we have extrinsic motivators

240
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:17,293
This is basically any kind of external reward.

241
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,154
So making numbers go up,

242
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:21,695
particularly numbers relating to your character,

243
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:24,195
your level, your XP, your money, whatever,

244
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:28,377
and getting stuff, everything to do with loot

245
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,577
and that kind of thing.

246
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,298
And it seems the human brain really likes this stuff.

247
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:35,559
It likes seeing numbers go up faster.

248
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,300
And it gets very motivated by almost getting what it wants.

249
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,721
So if it almost gets that amazing loot drop it's after,

250
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,803
Combined with the fact that human brain is awful at probability

251
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:49,026
means it's very easy to trick it into thinking it was almost there and to keep trying.

252
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:53,329
And this extrinsic stuff is very compulsive.

253
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:56,851
It's not necessarily enjoyable, but people will do it anyway.

254
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:00,174
And they will keep doing it until they run out of things to improve

255
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:02,976
or they hit some kind of break point and look at themselves and say,

256
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,677
why have I been grinding walls for 60 hours?

257
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:08,680
And they can walk away from your game and never come back at that point.

258
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,602
So it's kind of a fragile way of people getting people held in.

259
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,905
So yeah, we have these two different things,

260
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:17,905
intrinsic and extrinsic.

261
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,427
And when the two compete,

262
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,749
when there are different activities with different motivators

263
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,069
competing for players' attention,

264
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,911
this kind of tends to happen.

265
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,193
The extrinsic motivator always wins.

266
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:32,875
Another way of breaking it down is saying

267
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,997
the intrinsic stuff is what your players will enjoy

268
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,958
and the extrinsic stuff is what players will do.

269
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,232
And your economy, obviously, is all basically your entire

270
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,054
extrinsic motivation system.

271
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,496
Another way of defining economy for our purposes

272
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,819
is all of the extrinsic rewards in the game.

273
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,342
Your economy is basically one giant incentive structure

274
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,063
that tells your players what to do.

275
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:57,245
As they go looking for the best ways to level up,

276
00:13:57,245 --> 00:14:00,068
whatever that best way is, is essentially

277
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,890
what your game is telling your players to do.

278
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:08,300
So, if we look at a traditional MMO, we make a simple Venn diagram, we break it down into

279
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,801
three areas.

280
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:14,266
On the left, that is the left for you, yes, we have the blue bit, you have your intrinsic

281
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:14,706
motivators.

282
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:20,371
This is areas of the game, the pure blue, that are intrinsically motivating, but are

283
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:21,832
not extrinsically motivating.

284
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,273
This is wasted potential.

285
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,996
This is all the bits of your game that are good, that no one is going to play because

286
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,057
there's no reward for it.

287
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,033
In the middle, we have the bit of your game that is both intrinsically and extrinsically rewarding.

288
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:36,734
This is the good bit of your game, the bit that people will play and enjoy.

289
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,036
And on the right, we have the grind.

290
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,797
This is all the stuff that's purely extrinsic.

291
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,279
This is killing a million wolves because wolves are the most efficient way to level up.

292
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,240
There's no kind of...

293
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:48,562
It's not good.

294
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:52,063
You're not enjoying killing the millionth wolf particularly.

295
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,564
But it's very efficient.

296
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:56,565
Generally speaking, the problem here is you're missing mastery.

297
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:59,486
You've figured out how to beat wolves 200 hours ago.

298
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:00,726
You're not learning anything.

299
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:02,146
It's just kill the wolf, kill the wolf, kill the wolf.

300
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:06,988
So yeah, this is the bit of the game that is usually called the grind.

301
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:07,628
This is why we're grinding.

302
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,449
It's because it's grindy because there's no intrinsic value in it.

303
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:13,910
So what we are trying to do as an economy balancer

304
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,590
is we're trying to do this.

305
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:21,737
We want to make it so that the intrinsically rewarding parts of our game and the extrinsically

306
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,398
rewarding parts of our game are as much as possible overlapped.

307
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:28,759
And in particular, at a more subtle level, we want to ensure that the most intrinsically

308
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,921
rewarding parts of our game are also the most extrinsically rewarding parts of our game

309
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:33,641
and vice versa.

310
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,643
So that as players try to optimize that process and they try to find what's the best way of

311
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:42,624
doing this, the game doing that takes them to the best parts of your game.

312
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:43,145
Right?

313
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,885
Economy, balance, success, you can do that.

314
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:49,952
So yeah, that's basically the theory.

315
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:53,093
Let's move on to the next bit.

316
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:54,294
So we have that, we have our whys.

317
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,855
Let's talk about how we actually go about doing it.

318
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:00,096
What I am gonna do here basically is try

319
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:04,038
and take you through a kind of a simplified

320
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:07,159
and slightly idealized version of an earlier iteration

321
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,620
of our economy balance because it was still at that point

322
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,001
simple enough to explain in an hour.

323
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:15,423
Hopefully, like, the important thing for me here is the process, right?

324
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:16,804
It's how do we do this?

325
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:23,088
The fact that Axe takes 32 resources, the why of that is probably not nearly as useful

326
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:25,469
to all of you as how we get to that number.

327
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,730
So that's what I'm going to try and focus on.

328
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,492
And we're going to start off with goals.

329
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:35,956
If I had to define design in a simple, soundbite-y way, I would say that design is art with goals.

330
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,657
Design is art that's trying to do something in particular.

331
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,858
And the goals are kind of what drive that.

332
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:44,098
So let's talk about some goals.

333
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:47,682
Well, let's talk about why we do goals more to the point.

334
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:51,146
A few kind of bullet point reasons.

335
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:54,409
I find it brings a lot of clarity and a lot of honesty to the process.

336
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,574
It makes you pin down up front if you start off with your goals.

337
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:03,800
What you are doing and why you are doing it helps everyone to understand kind of where we're trying to go with these feature

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,765
And the same way to just writing anything down will often clarify the thoughts

339
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,648
Writing your goals down and getting them pinned down somewhere

340
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:13,292
And can really kind of give you a good foundation to build off

341
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,375
You know where you're going and what success is going to look like when you get there

342
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,544
I found it's great actually for team harmony.

343
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:26,027
The Eve design team in particular is like 15 or so people and we'd have disagreements

344
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,289
sometimes about how to do something, like where we're going with the feature, how we

345
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,010
wanted to do a particular thing.

346
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,772
And the more I was thinking about goals and applying that to my design work.

347
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,994
the more I realized that most of those arguments were happening

348
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:39,494
because people had different goals,

349
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:42,676
and we hadn't stated what the actual goal for the feature was,

350
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,737
and therefore they're talking past each other.

351
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:48,018
This guy talking, trying to design a feature for veteran players,

352
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:50,599
this guy trying to design a feature for new players,

353
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,980
and of course they can't agree on anything

354
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,281
because they have different goals in mind.

355
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,842
So getting them pinned down and everyone on the same page

356
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,803
can avoid a lot of those things,

357
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,824
and when you get into those discussions, if you stop and say,

358
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,585
hang on, what do you think we're trying to do?

359
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:02,565
What do you think we're trying to do?

360
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:11,891
that's often enough to actually to defuse the entire discussion or at least bring it down to a level where we're talking about the same thing to each other.

361
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,012
Um,

362
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:26,061
I've also found goals great as a supporting structure. Um, I kind of a simple level just having something to go back to when I'm when I'm stuck or I'm struggling. I'm not sure where we're going next. Let's go and look at the goals where we're going with this feature. Um, how do we want to get there? It's really helpful.

363
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:27,603
and kind of at a broader level,

364
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,004
goals bring you into kind of the area

365
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:32,226
of like constraint-driven design.

366
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,748
You're narrowing down your possibility space

367
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,609
by specifying what you want to achieve

368
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,710
and that limits your options,

369
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,112
which for me makes it much easier to design something good

370
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,674
because I'm much more focused on how exactly do this

371
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,595
rather than where in this great big blue sky

372
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:48,057
are we gonna go with this feature.

373
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,938
So laying out those constraints early on

374
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:52,240
and kind of pinning down the options,

375
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,942
I find really useful to taking it to a better place.

376
00:18:56,363 --> 00:19:01,906
In principle, obviously, goals should be perfect and immutable and laid down at the beginning in stone tablets.

377
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:03,746
In practice, that doesn't happen.

378
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:08,348
We find that some of our goals are wrong, or we want to do a feature in a particular way,

379
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,829
we really know we want to do this, but it doesn't match our goals.

380
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:15,571
And it's fine, I think, to go back and change those goals, so long as you actually change the goals,

381
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,452
change what they're written down, and make sure everyone is on board with what we're doing next.

382
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:19,532
Goals should not be...

383
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,633
They should be constraining you in where you're going,

384
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,754
but they should not be limiting your overall design.

385
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:30,115
They should be a tool to help you rather than something

386
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,075
to stop you from getting to where you want to go.

387
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,536
So let's set some goals.

388
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:37,517
Yeah, there's kind of three stages to our process, I guess.

389
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,037
The first is the setting goal stage,

390
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:40,777
where we sketch out the outline of what we want to do.

391
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,458
Second step is going to be talking about relationships,

392
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,838
which is filling in the details,

393
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,079
and then step three is the math,

394
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,519
which is basically doing the coloring in.

395
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:54,387
So I said we're going to go through a sample economy set up

396
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:57,289
and I'm going to lay out some goals and then we're going to go over them

397
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,890
and figure out how to get there.

398
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,831
So goal one, incentivize the best parts of the game.

399
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,792
This is the theory I was talking about earlier.

400
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,874
We want to make sure that the most rewarding parts of our game

401
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,715
are the bits that players will enjoy the best.

402
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,296
It's a good starting goal, nice and straightforward.

403
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:16,878
Goal two, we for our game want to allow as much as possible

404
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,219
everyone to compete.

405
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,293
We don't want to have huge gaps between the veteran players and the newer players.

406
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:27,817
We want to try as much as we can within the context of everything else working

407
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:32,441
to allow everyone to have a fighting chance in every battle essentially.

408
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,363
So that's going to be driving some of our thinking.

409
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:37,185
For reasons that I will get into more...

410
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:42,349
As we go through this, we want to maintain fairly stable price ranges.

411
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:46,934
We want fluctuations in prices, we want a player-driven economy, we want the market

412
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:52,240
to be uncertain, but we're going to want to keep it within a certain range and not let

413
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,465
things drift too far out of bounds so that we're not basically violating our balance

414
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:56,965
assumptions.

415
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,424
On top of those three, this is kind of order,

416
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,585
this is not strict ordering,

417
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,427
but it's a general sense of the priorities.

418
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:08,350
We want to maximize the enjoyment of the non-core audience,

419
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,874
which basically, we know from experience from our game

420
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:14,876
and from other sandbox games that some players

421
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:17,239
are not going to want to do PvP, for example.

422
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,701
And even if we think it's the best thing since CySquared,

423
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,624
some players are just like, I really want to play your game,

424
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,425
but I just want to play in the safe area on my own.

425
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:31,006
That's okay. We need to make sure that our really good bits, our guild versus guild and so on,

426
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:35,873
are as good as they can be. But then we want to try and make everyone else happy as

427
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:39,598
much as we can on top of that. So that's kind of a secondary consideration that's always in

428
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,841
our head. How can we fix things for them as well?

429
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:47,026
And finally, we're going to try as hard as we can to keep the math simple.

430
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:51,049
There's a place for complex math, but it's a fairly rare place.

431
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,770
So as much as we can, we're going to try and keep it straightforward.

432
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,411
It means that it's easier for us as developers

433
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:57,432
to work with all the numbers we're doing,

434
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:59,573
because we're making a lot of numbers.

435
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:04,196
And it means for players, the simpler and more easy to grasp the math is,

436
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:07,157
the easier it is for them to develop an intuitive understanding

437
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:09,999
of how the game fits together without having to go and build their own spreadsheet

438
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,320
to figure out what you were doing.

439
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:16,672
So those are kind of our core goals.

440
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,116
Step one, do the outline.

441
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:20,281
Next step is step two, building relationships,

442
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:21,363
filling that outline in.

443
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:27,621
So, goal one, incentivize the best bits of the game.

444
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,863
We think that the best parts of our game,

445
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,986
the most intrinsically rewarding, is our PVP,

446
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,268
and especially our guild versus guild,

447
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,870
like territory warfare gameplay.

448
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,234
They score really high on our intrinsic motivators.

449
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,335
You're out there with your guild,

450
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,057
fighting other guilds who you know,

451
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:48,259
and you're next door enemies who you love to hate,

452
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,540
so you've got a lot of relatedness.

453
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,342
Your guild has control over where it's going and who it's fighting.

454
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,144
You get a lot of autonomy out of that.

455
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:58,706
And because we're doing PvP, and we have this complex

456
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:02,468
you are what you wear equipment meta game,

457
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:06,451
each battle can be different, so we can have strong intrinsic rewards

458
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,574
as well as strong mastery, because we're constantly

459
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:12,855
facing new challenges to overcome.

460
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:15,777
So we think that's the best bit of our game,

461
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,939
and we want to make sure the people go there.

462
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,183
So we have 8 tiers of resource in our game, and we have 5 resources.

463
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:28,765
The first 3 tiers are effectively training resources.

464
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:33,267
We don't really worry about them from an economy balance point of view.

465
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:38,890
The game kind of starts at T4, so we have T4 to T8, our 5 primary tiers.

466
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,484
that we're worried about.

467
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:44,008
Our world is divided into clusters,

468
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:47,454
which is like a region, a zone of the game.

469
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,379
They're like 800 meters aside, I think, or something.

470
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,323
Squares that make up the world.

471
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:54,964
Each cluster has a tier.

472
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:58,045
The tier of the cluster determines the resources present.

473
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:01,306
So a tier six cluster has resources up to tier six.

474
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,306
So when we set our world up,

475
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:03,966
and you can't really see this, but it's there, I promise,

476
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:07,487
like in the outlands and the PVP area

477
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,088
where the highest tier clusters are,

478
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:12,289
and the very kind of most competitive areas

479
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,489
where the very highest tiers are.

480
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:15,390
So the T8 clusters are.

481
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,891
where the kind of the core of the guild versus guild happens.

482
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,553
So the places where all that fighting happens,

483
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:22,154
all that good gameplay happens,

484
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:24,696
also have the best resources and therefore the best rewards.

485
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:24,956
Cool.

486
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:28,238
So that's kind of our core thing.

487
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:32,481
You get rewarded for doing things that we think you'll enjoy.

488
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:35,563
Second goal, allowing everyone to compete.

489
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:40,286
What we're going to aim for here, in simple terms,

490
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,908
is a low power gap and a high rarity scaling.

491
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:46,099
What do I mean by this?

492
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:49,121
So we have a power progression between tiers.

493
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,002
You can have T4 equipment, T5, T6, T7, T8.

494
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:54,505
Each tier is more powerful than the last.

495
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,667
And we want to get that gap as low as possible

496
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,789
so that the T8 people aren't so far ahead of the T4 people.

497
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,731
So we looked at other games, we looked at our own game,

498
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,411
we play tested, we talked to players,

499
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:09,972
we worked through it all, and we figured out eventually

500
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:12,433
that about 1.2 per level, per tier,

501
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,533
is about what we're looking for.

502
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,514
That's about as low as we can go.

503
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,814
So T5 is 20% more powerful than T4.

504
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:20,015
T6 is 20% more powerful than T5.

505
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:24,796
And therefore T8 is about twice as powerful as T4, 2.07.

506
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,451
So one T8 guy has about the same stats as two T4 guys.

507
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:31,853
That's about as low as we can make that

508
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:34,134
without the tier step feeling empty

509
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:37,536
and like what's the point in getting high tier gear?

510
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,457
And that's kind of where we hit with that.

511
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,659
By contrast, rarity of resources in the world,

512
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,819
we're gonna go much steeper.

513
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:46,100
We're gonna do three times per tier.

514
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,383
So each additional tier is three times rarer than the last.

515
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,723
So T8 is 81 times rarer than T4.

516
00:25:54,037 --> 00:26:02,298
What we're trying to do here is basically make the very high-end stuff incredibly expensive.

517
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:07,540
Kind of the ideal balancing fallout of this setup is that T4 is common.

518
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,481
If you want to go PvPing, you can always afford some T4 gear.

519
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,521
It's not completely valueless because we want death to have some meaning.

520
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,702
It makes the fights more interesting.

521
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:17,942
But it's accessible.

522
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:21,663
T5 and T6 is kind of what you work for on an everyday basis.

523
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,524
That's where you want to be hitting for most of your fights.

524
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:28,124
And then T7 and especially T8, the T8 right at the top,

525
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,485
are very rare.

526
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,586
We want the big guilds to be saving up their T8 equipment

527
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:34,766
for critical fights.

528
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:38,067
If most players never see T8, at least for the first year

529
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,467
of their game or whatever, that's fine with us.

530
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,508
That's in a healthy, balanced place.

531
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,525
We want this because the high-end gear needs to exist to act as a wealth sink at the high-end

532
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:54,429
because otherwise you can get massive wealth disparities between different levels of player.

533
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,693
And also to give everyone a long-term goal.

534
00:26:57,693 --> 00:27:00,836
You're always working towards something once you get there.

535
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:03,298
your final goal, you're kind of done.

536
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:05,019
Like, we found an EVE that like,

537
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,921
the biggest shipping game is a Titan,

538
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,163
it's 20 kilometers long and it takes six months to build

539
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:11,765
and it's worth like hundreds of real world dollars

540
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,587
or whatever, and like, something like,

541
00:27:13,587 --> 00:27:15,108
last time I looked many years ago,

542
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,150
like half of all Titan pilots had unsubscribed

543
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,971
from the game because they'd won.

544
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,155
Right, they got the biggest thing, game done.

545
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,337
So we want to keep that high end as rare as we can.

546
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:30,315
and as I say, use it as a way to sink resources

547
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,695
and sink wealth out of the world

548
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:35,397
without being completely overpowering to everybody else.

549
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:36,017
So that works out nicely.

550
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:40,899
Next thing we want to do, we want to keep these,

551
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:44,721
as I said earlier, keep these price ranges stable.

552
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,370
To a certain degree, we want price flow.

553
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,292
Obviously, we have a player market,

554
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,374
open economy, player-driven economy.

555
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,796
We want prices to shift according to supply and demand.

556
00:27:56,796 --> 00:28:00,139
This kind of balances out the income per hour

557
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,521
that people get in different professions,

558
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:06,544
because time is essentially the ultimate resource

559
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:08,506
for any game like this.

560
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,487
We want to ensure that people who are killing mobs

561
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,809
to get silver are making the same kind of money

562
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,451
as people gathering resources.

563
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:19,636
And if we have the market, then those two will balance out as people, if it's not worth doing.

564
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:23,079
People, if there's too much of something, the value of that thing will go down.

565
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,141
People will stop doing, collecting it so much.

566
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:27,424
The supply will drop, the value go back up.

567
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:29,085
Like, it's a nice, happy relationship.

568
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:32,309
But we want to keep the overall prices within a band.

569
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,673
This is good for a couple of reasons.

570
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,356
It means that people can't,

571
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:42,718
the high-end girls can't run away with wealth

572
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,220
by monopolizing the high-end resources

573
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,863
and basically forming a cartel or monopoly there.

574
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:56,152
that can cause problems because they get so much wealth that it distorts the entire game.

575
00:28:56,152 --> 00:29:00,736
We also have this thing obviously where we have these five versus five fights.

576
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:04,419
You can't just bring more people to deal with the wealth imbalance, so we're a little bit

577
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,362
more constrained in terms of what we're okay with, with disparities there.

578
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:13,545
And finally of course we need to make sure at the broad scale that those fighting areas,

579
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:17,448
the GBG, the PVP areas, Guild versus Guild, player versus player,

580
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,722
are more valuable than the safe space.

581
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:22,603
If that gets out of whack,

582
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:25,465
then our whole game swings out of true.

583
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:27,886
So we're gonna try and keep those under control.

584
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,847
How we're gonna do that is we're gonna have overflows

585
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,248
and underflows for everything.

586
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,069
So we have, as I said, we have our resources,

587
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:35,951
we have our silver, as kind of the two things

588
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,512
we need to balance off against each other

589
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:38,252
to a large degree.

590
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,232
We have a couple of features.

591
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:44,175
We have this salvage feature that lets you take a crafted item

592
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:47,899
and salvage it, and that gets you 75% of its resources

593
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:52,463
back as resources and 25% of its resource value back as silver.

594
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:55,145
This means that players can turn resources

595
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:59,208
into silver through this method at a rate that we set.

596
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,031
We also have a feature called transmutation.

597
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:05,053
You can take some tier forward to the transmuter.

598
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:08,200
which is a building, you give it a load of money,

599
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,142
and it may give you some T5 wood.

600
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,904
So you can improve your resources

601
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:13,645
by spending large amounts of silver on it.

602
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,369
This means that you can turn silver into resources.

603
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:19,531
So now we have this back and forth flow between the two

604
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:22,314
at rates that we set, which is important.

605
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,050
What this ends up doing is building a price channel for these things.

606
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,554
If you're selling resources for less than its effective silver value,

607
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:32,775
then some player will figure that out,

608
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,758
and they will buy the resources, craft them up, salvage them out,

609
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:40,342
turn them into silver for more silver than they bought them for,

610
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:40,983
and that will...

611
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:44,063
bring the price back up again as the demand shoots up and everything

612
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:45,724
because people are getting free money.

613
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,964
That gives you an effective floor on the price.

614
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:53,505
And similarly, transmutation, if you're selling above the transmute price,

615
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:57,366
then someone can just, you know, you're selling T6 at above the transmute price,

616
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,626
someone can buy some T5, transmute it up,

617
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:03,687
and sell it, and then put it on the market for profit, essentially.

618
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,907
Free money again.

619
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,807
That will tend to drive the prices back down,

620
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:09,408
so we end up with this nice channel between salvage and transmute.

621
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,140
So that gives us our underflows and our overflows,

622
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,281
gives us our price controls.

623
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:17,262
But as we're building relationships,

624
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:19,564
what we need to do is we need to find

625
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:22,166
what that relationship is.

626
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:26,630
We assume that the sort of expected price

627
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,152
based on rarity follows the rarity curve.

628
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:31,114
So the sort of the natural price for each resource

629
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:33,115
goes up by a factor of three each tier.

630
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:37,439
We get our salvage price, gives us a nice floor.

631
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:40,541
And we get our transmute price, which gives us our ceiling.

632
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,244
This is a log scale, because it flattens it out.

633
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:44,184
So we have this price channel.

634
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:48,768
And then we need to decide how that relates to the rarity progression,

635
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:50,910
because that's kind of the core relationship here,

636
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,551
is how do those two things map together.

637
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:57,115
So we decide that the low end, at T4,

638
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,958
we want to have the salvage price be about what the implied rarity value is.

639
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,789
We want to ensure that those prices at T4 are low,

640
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:06,930
but we want to hold them up a bit.

641
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,971
We don't want T4 equipment to be worthless

642
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,012
because that makes dying worthless, which makes it boring.

643
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,073
We also want to ensure that new players coming up,

644
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:16,074
they're just getting to T4 for the first time,

645
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:19,216
they're harvesting T4 resources.

646
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:20,456
We don't want that to be worthless.

647
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,077
So this kind of generates a flaw.

648
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:24,658
Worst case scenario, they can salvage it out

649
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:26,339
and make silver off it.

650
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,880
So harvesting T4 is never not worth anything.

651
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,229
The transmute price we want high at this point,

652
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:35,010
because we don't want veteran players bypassing

653
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,633
those new players and just transmuting all the T4

654
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,234
they need themselves.

655
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:43,437
We want to ensure that it's not worth transmuting down here,

656
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:44,798
basically.

657
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,561
By contrast, at the high end, we want our tier 8.

658
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,004
We want the implied rarity price at or even slightly

659
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,265
above the transmute price.

660
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:59,797
so that we're ensuring that as much value as possible is coming out of that

661
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:04,361
while keeping it under control. Because the limit at the high end is

662
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:05,742
respawn rates

663
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,964
in the territory that gills control rather than harvest time, they're

664
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:11,626
basically waiting for the resources to come back.

665
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:15,129
So it's basically free resources, it's always going to be worth it for them.

666
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:19,033
But we don't want that price to shoot through the roof,

667
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,194
and we don't want to,

668
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,375
both because we don't want those girls

669
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,717
to become fabulously wealthy,

670
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,398
and because we don't want to lock everyone else

671
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,461
completely out of the highest tier gear.

672
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,623
So, in fact, we'd be happy if most of our tier eight

673
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:29,524
came from transmutation.

674
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,206
It means there's a huge silver sink.

675
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:33,448
We're sinking a lot of silver out of the economy,

676
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:36,992
which keeps our inflation under control, makes us happy.

677
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:39,888
It means everyone can get it, but it's expensive.

678
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:41,769
We obviously don't want people salvaging

679
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,129
high-tier equipment, that would be crazy.

680
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:45,430
So we have these low and highs,

681
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,170
and then because we're on a log graph,

682
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,110
we're just gonna say, our rarity scaling

683
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,271
basically needs to hit like this.

684
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:54,952
So we have this, in addition to these numbers now,

685
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:58,193
we have this thing called item value, IV,

686
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,613
which is kind of our arbitrary silver equivalents

687
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,674
for a resource, and we wanna say the item value,

688
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,874
which is basically the salvage value,

689
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:07,035
is about the same as the rarity value at T4.

690
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,197
And the transmute cost is going to be 10 times that.

691
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:14,741
So you're always going to have this item value, which is what salvage returns,

692
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:17,764
and above that you have the transmute value.

693
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,087
And we know it's pinned.

694
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:25,310
The two things, salvage and the resource value intersect at T4.

695
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,372
We want them to cross over at T8.

696
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:29,274
So our item value progression is about 1.66.

697
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,244
And that is basically our economy setup.

698
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,965
There's a whole bunch of numbers

699
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:36,905
that are gonna follow on from this

700
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,446
as we math out how much of everything

701
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:39,686
on all the respawn rates and so on.

702
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,467
I'm gonna talk about it in a second.

703
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,668
But our core economy setup is this slide.

704
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,068
This is the basic relationships

705
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:47,889
that determine how everything fits together.

706
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:51,537
And we'll do the same process for silver and for fame,

707
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,940
our equivalent of XP, and for farming

708
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,961
and for everything else, we'll go through this process

709
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,723
and how much do we want and how fast do you progress,

710
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,766
how much fame do you get per hour, how much is it worth,

711
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,167
how long does it take you to max things out,

712
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:04,887
all this kind of stuff.

713
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:07,589
But it's all just a set of relationships and core numbers

714
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:09,931
that say this is how the game fits together.

715
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,385
And that's our relationship building.

716
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:14,367
So we have these goals.

717
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,670
We have incentivizing the best part of the game.

718
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,814
We're doing that through saying the bits, the GVG

719
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:23,019
and the PVP bits, have the best resources.

720
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:25,302
Allowing everyone to compete by keeping that power gap low

721
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:27,626
and keeping the rarity progression steep.

722
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:30,948
Someone didn't listen to the phone warning.

723
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:34,929
We're maintaining stable price ranges by having these overflows and underflows.

724
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,330
Our salvage and our transmute to keep things in the channel.

725
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,451
They can float around all they like inside that,

726
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:42,272
but we know that they're not going to get too far out of bounds.

727
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:46,494
And then along the way, maximizing enjoyment of the non-core audience.

728
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:51,756
That's things like, for example, transmuting means that you can get to T8 from the safe zones.

729
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:55,798
You can only harvest up to T5, but you can save up the silver to keep transmuting up and up and up.

730
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:58,820
It will take you forever, but it's there.

731
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,603
Making sure that T4 and T5 are available in the safe zones

732
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:05,166
so that you can kind of,

733
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,787
you can kind of gear up to go do PvP

734
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:09,329
before you have to go into the PvP areas.

735
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,810
All this kind of stuff is just, you know,

736
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,671
ticking away in our mind.

737
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,033
How can we tune this to make them happy?

738
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,114
And the math is pretty simple.

739
00:36:15,114 --> 00:36:16,415
It's all geometric progressions

740
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,717
because we don't find the need at this point

741
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:20,178
to make it any more complex than that.

742
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:26,516
Cool, so let's do some coloring in.

743
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,298
Doing the math.

744
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:30,379
We have our relationships,

745
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,959
we've got all these free-floating relationships.

746
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,721
We need to pick some anchors, or at least an anchor,

747
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:36,822
to kind of pin that down to some actual numbers.

748
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,504
For this, what we decided to do,

749
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:41,365
we looked at saying, okay,

750
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,286
the high end of normal PPP is tier six,

751
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,768
and for the people we think are playing at that level,

752
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,570
We reckon there's going to be this many,

753
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,792
and they're going to die this often.

754
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,153
We need about 10,000 tier six per day

755
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:55,315
across all the resource types.

756
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:57,977
So that kind of gives us our anchor point.

757
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,759
We know then that if it's 10,000 T6,

758
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,421
because of our three times rarity progression,

759
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,262
it's 30,000 T5, and 3,000 T7, 3,333 T7, and so on.

760
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:09,387
From that anchor point and our relationships,

761
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:13,891
it all flows out, and we make a giant spreadsheet.

762
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,849
And we go away and we do Excel.

763
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,731
And this is what I'm actually doing at work right now.

764
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:20,553
The last couple of weeks, it's making more spreadsheets.

765
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,935
There's a lot of work involved in this for us

766
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:27,398
because we need to math out everything in the game.

767
00:37:27,398 --> 00:37:28,999
But there shouldn't be surprises.

768
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,574
We always check the numbers at the end of the process to make sure they don't look insane.

769
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:38,898
And sometimes there are things we want to fiddle with a bit for player experience reasons,

770
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:44,503
like we've been thinking a lot recently about how long does it take tween finding resources

771
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:49,388
to harvest and can we kind of tune that to be more enjoyable without breaking our overall

772
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:49,868
economy.

773
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,030
But for the most part...

774
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:53,436
We don't want to be fiddling.

775
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:57,743
If we find ourselves wanting, having the urge to change a lot of numbers at the end of the

776
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:02,390
spreadsheet process, then we know we've probably done something wrong in either our goals or

777
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,716
relationships and we want to go back and change those.

778
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,078
And we'll usually have like, the setup variables will be in the sheet somewhere,

779
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:11,759
I'll talk about this some more in a second.

780
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,781
So we can just go, okay, what if we change it from 3,

781
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,883
power of 3 per level or 3 to whatever per level, to 3.5,

782
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,744
does that give us more what we want?

783
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:23,026
Okay, and we're working at that level of the numbers rather than

784
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,107
tuning individual values.

785
00:38:25,107 --> 00:38:27,609
Because we want to have these clear relationships that are driving all

786
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,189
our stuff.

787
00:38:29,913 --> 00:38:34,136
So in the context of this, in Excel, I want to talk a little bit about some Excel best

788
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:37,958
practices that we've developed.

789
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,078
Because I think it's cool.

790
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:39,739
I like Excel.

791
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:40,399
It's my friend.

792
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:44,462
The table feature is amazing.

793
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:46,223
Who here knows what I'm talking about?

794
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,537
Okay, cool. Some people don't. This GIF is going to blow your minds.

795
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,298
Come on.

796
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:55,980
So you can basically select a thing, and then you click make it into a table.

797
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,421
And then it's a table.

798
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:01,724
And then you can add things. You can refer to them using their column name,

799
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:06,546
which is wonderful, and it auto-extends, and you can filter based on the thing.

800
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:06,826
Oh, so good.

801
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:12,568
I learned this at Sandbox and I was just like, this is amazing.

802
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,149
So this is definitely a thing we use a lot.

803
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,751
Gives you the color coding, gives you all the stuff.

804
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:21,015
A particular little trick I picked up is the variables table.

805
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:23,097
If you make a table that is a single row...

806
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:25,320
and you call it vars, then you can,

807
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,723
rather than having to refer to $a, $32

808
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,405
as your balancing number for this,

809
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,827
it's vars primary mult.

810
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,809
That's where it is because the columns are single cells,

811
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,633
so it returns a cell rather than an array.

812
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,836
So I often have these little settings tables

813
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,818
just to let me put all the values in one place

814
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,500
and it's really easy to understand.

815
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,902
Which brings me to my next point,

816
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:45,904
usability and maintainability of Excel.

817
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,346
We're getting deep into nerd country here, I know.

818
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,207
But I think about this a lot,

819
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:52,549
because we have big spreadsheets.

820
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:53,690
We have a master sheet we've been using

821
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,710
for like three or four years

822
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,492
that has all the kind of core data in.

823
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:59,194
We've got various spin-off sheets that we use.

824
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:01,355
And there's different people using them at different times,

825
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,816
and you have to come back to things that you've done

826
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,218
from six months ago, and we update things for new math

827
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:06,099
and all this kind of stuff.

828
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:12,042
And kind of keeping those spreadsheets fresh and usable and present is kind of a challenge.

829
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:17,465
So we think a lot while we're doing this about sending them off about color coding so we can see...

830
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,246
Can I get back to this?

831
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:22,227
Ooh, over here. I should have put this in a new thing.

832
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:27,550
We can see here, like, the orange tables are static game data we're not touching.

833
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,651
Green is our primary setup.

834
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:31,332
The green cells are the cells that we want to tweak most.

835
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:35,294
The red cells are output data that we're going to put into the game and so on.

836
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:37,836
So we can look at a sheet and say, okay, I want to fiddle with it.

837
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,337
I know I'm fiddling here and here because that's where the green stuff is.

838
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:43,153
All this kind of stuff.

839
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:45,074
I use the comments feature in Excel a lot.

840
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:47,616
You can comment cells, leave notes yourself.

841
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,497
So this is why I did this gigantic formula,

842
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,358
because in six months time, when I come back to it,

843
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:52,498
I have no idea what it's doing.

844
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:57,201
And generally thinking about the robustness of formulae,

845
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,842
making it so they can deal with adding and removing columns

846
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:00,943
or changing column names.

847
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:03,704
It's a whole bunch of theory to do with VLOOKUP and matching

848
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:05,145
and stuff that I don't want to get into.

849
00:41:05,145 --> 00:41:06,746
But we think about this stuff a lot.

850
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:08,507
We want to make sure that our Excel can survive

851
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,787
being punched in the face by people

852
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:11,508
who don't know what they're doing.

853
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:14,387
That's point two and point three.

854
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:17,630
I'm a strong advocate for automating all your exports.

855
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,772
There's obviously an argument you made

856
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:21,233
about it saves designer time

857
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,054
if it has to do everything manually,

858
00:41:23,054 --> 00:41:25,416
but then you get into an argument with your programmers

859
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,319
about whose time is worth more.

860
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,200
Obviously, the designer's time is worth a lot,

861
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,641
but let's just sidestep that.

862
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:34,083
Let's talk about bugs, right?

863
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,124
If you put things in by hand,

864
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:36,906
and I've done a lot of hand entry in my time,

865
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:41,747
Eventually you're going to fat finger something and you're going to add or miss a digit somewhere.

866
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:46,669
And something buried deep in the bowels of your game is ten times more or less than it

867
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:47,549
should be.

868
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,191
And if you're a small team like us, you probably won't catch that if you've just done a thousand

869
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:51,591
numbers by hand.

870
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:55,252
And then some players will and they'll destroy your economy before you catch it and it's

871
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:56,853
a complete pain to unpick.

872
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:59,354
If you've automated all your exports,

873
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:01,836
you've built a nice mathy Excel table

874
00:42:01,836 --> 00:42:04,497
that's all formulas so there can't be any individual errors,

875
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,539
and then you push a button and it goes into your game,

876
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,560
then that kind of bug doesn't exist anymore.

877
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,162
The bug where you've done something wrong

878
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,763
and everything in your game is a factor of 10 out

879
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:15,885
does exist, but you spot that because it's really obvious.

880
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:18,887
So we've had our CTO made us a nice little Excel plugin

881
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:22,009
that you click a button and it writes it out

882
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,370
to our XML format, which is lovely.

883
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,972
So I strongly, strongly, strongly do the automation.

884
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:31,708
ignore the arguments about efficiency of time and just say it's going to stop you from breaking

885
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,435
your game because I've seen it far too many times.

886
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,072
Yeah, and then we ship the thing,

887
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,973
and then we see what happens.

888
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:43,053
For a couple of reasons.

889
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,534
Firstly, we used to calculate on Eve,

890
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,214
we'd generally get 10,000 players online after downtime.

891
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:50,095
So we're gonna get 10,000 man hours of QA in our first hour,

892
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:54,557
which we can't match pre-launch, period.

893
00:42:54,557 --> 00:42:56,297
That's too large a number.

894
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:59,358
On top of that, at a more kind of detailed level,

895
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:00,338
a more subtle level,

896
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:05,755
If your game is simple enough for you to predict how it's going to play out,

897
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:09,439
then it's also simple enough for your players to predict how it's going to play out,

898
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,443
and some of them are smarter than you, and they will solve your game and put the answer on a wiki.

899
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:18,889
And then, everybody knows that the most efficient way to level up is killing wolves.

900
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,030
Everyone is now killing wolves.

901
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,012
Congratulations, your game is boring.

902
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:31,104
So I'm of the opinion that your game should be sufficiently complex that you do not know how it is going to get used.

903
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:33,286
Which is kind of a scary thought.

904
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:37,630
But it seems to be the only way to square that circle of keeping people engaged over long periods.

905
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,894
They need a game that they can't see the end of, they can't see the simple solution to.

906
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:46,878
Which means that you're going to have to you know you want to take a good stab at it and all this work

907
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:52,563
We've done here is doing that trying to figure out where we think everything's going to settle and we have these you know

908
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:57,507
This is part of why we have these minimax things these overflows underflows the the price channel

909
00:43:57,507 --> 00:44:00,789
So that if we've got something horribly wrong it the game still catches it

910
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:07,615
But there's no real substitute for putting it out there and seeing how it goes

911
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:10,778
So you're going to have to iterate on it you have to see how it performs, and you're going to have to

912
00:44:11,154 --> 00:44:14,277
make changes when you realize the mistakes you've inevitably made.

913
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,001
Basically how we're doing this is we're doing some science.

914
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,744
We're going to make some mental models.

915
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:23,247
We're going to make some predictions based on those models.

916
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:25,769
We think the economy is going to do something like this.

917
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:27,291
We're going to put it out there.

918
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,552
We're going to test those predictions.

919
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:31,795
And then we're going to use those measurements, those tests,

920
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:34,238
to refine our model and have another go at making it better.

921
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:38,129
And there's a lot of things that play into this.

922
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:40,091
Obviously, we use analytics, we use metrics.

923
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:44,416
They're great in particular for the measure step,

924
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,097
figuring out what's going on.

925
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:48,553
We also involve our players a lot.

926
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,154
We talk to our players, we have forums,

927
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,894
we have a hand-picked group of players

928
00:44:51,894 --> 00:44:55,016
called our Roundtable, because we're Ethereum,

929
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:57,877
who give us more direct and more focused feedback.

930
00:44:57,877 --> 00:45:00,478
We have Discord, we have Reddit, blah, blah, blah, blah.

931
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:02,479
Always try to talk to our players,

932
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:06,181
because A, they will tell you where to go look in your data.

933
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,545
B, they will give you a lot of qualitative information, and C, they will help you understand

934
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:15,151
why, which is the real crux of the issue.

935
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:18,916
How do you build a causal understanding of what is going on in your economy so that you

936
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,541
know that if we change X, then Y will happen?

937
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:22,762
If you just rely on metrics...

938
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,484
which are great and all, you get some data points,

939
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:27,805
and you're like, oh, okay, okay, okay,

940
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:29,366
this is probably doing this.

941
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:31,287
And if your game is really simple, that's great,

942
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,349
and if you want to maximize the height of the line,

943
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,389
you just keep going right.

944
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:37,271
If your game is complex, then a model may tell you,

945
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:38,431
actually, no, it's going to do this.

946
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,792
Right?

947
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,633
And if you try to use your metrics to min-max that,

948
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:42,273
it's going to...

949
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:46,029
best case take you to that peak on the right and then stop

950
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:49,070
and worst case you're going to go over it and you're going to crash everything.

951
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,892
So, metric's good, but metric is good in their place feeding into your models

952
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:56,013
and not just being blindly trusted

953
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:59,214
because your game is simple enough to be solved

954
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,055
to solve your balance with metrics, it's too simple

955
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:02,756
and your players will fix it, solve it for you.

956
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,222
So always in this, always looking at our feedback,

957
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,263
always looking at our analytics,

958
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:10,464
always trying to kind of, once we've shipped,

959
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:12,325
to go back and constantly working back

960
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:15,406
towards those core goals to bring our economy

961
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:17,087
into the place we want it to be.

962
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,989
So, that kind of is gonna wrap it up.

963
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,619
Understand what you're doing and why you're doing it.

964
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,481
I say I'm a philosophy guy, so that kind of works for me,

965
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:30,523
but I think it's important generally.

966
00:46:30,523 --> 00:46:32,904
Set clear goals, invest time early on in your process

967
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:36,487
and set in the goals for what you want to achieve.

968
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:38,308
Spend a lot of time thinking about the relationships

969
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:40,269
between things, that's the core of your economy set up,

970
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:42,211
is how things relate to one another,

971
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:43,652
what it's telling your players to do,

972
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:44,712
where the incentives are,

973
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:47,854
and where that's going to end people up.

974
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:50,736
Your math should be unsurprising and uneventful.

975
00:46:52,388 --> 00:46:53,849
Do your Excels well.

976
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:56,889
Make lovely spreadsheets with pretty colors.

977
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,030
These tables are awesome.

978
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,830
And yeah, math it out.

979
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,290
And if you need to make changes, go back and change

980
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,691
in your goals and your relationships

981
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,111
during your final numbers.

982
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:08,791
And then we ship and we revise and we look at our analytics

983
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,972
and we listen to our players and we figure out

984
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:12,512
how to optimize the game.

985
00:47:12,512 --> 00:47:14,372
It's never gonna be perfect because if it's perfect,

986
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:15,152
then it's solvable.

987
00:47:15,152 --> 00:47:16,373
If it's solvable, then it's boring.

988
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:16,453
Cool.

989
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:16,673
That does me.

990
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:16,753
Yeah.

991
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:22,804
Thank you.

992
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:31,606
Any questions?

993
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:32,526
We have people at microphones.

994
00:47:32,526 --> 00:47:32,946
Wonderful.

995
00:47:32,946 --> 00:47:33,006
Hi.

996
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:33,126
Hey.

997
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:36,827
So near the beginning of your talk, you went over the difference between extrinsic and

998
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:37,468
intrinsic rewards.

999
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:37,628
Yes.

1000
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:40,468
And you mentioned that one of your goals is to basically overlap them as much as you can.

1001
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:43,229
And so the first thing that comes to my mind is how can you superimpose this, how can you

1002
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:44,750
do a micro three way or a simple three way reward?

1003
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:48,628
there is a lot of research out there that

1004
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:51,849
if you give extrinsic rewards to behaviors

1005
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,331
that are intrinsically motivating,

1006
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:58,813
that it actually reduces the intrinsic motivation.

1007
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:02,155
Most of that research is in the context of workspaces

1008
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:03,535
and job performance, but I was curious

1009
00:48:03,535 --> 00:48:07,237
if you've encountered that trend in your work

1010
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:08,358
and how you've dealt with it.

1011
00:48:08,788 --> 00:48:14,272
So the question is basically, what about all that research that says that extrinsically

1012
00:48:14,272 --> 00:48:17,934
awarding people for intrinsically awarding stuff makes them like it less?

1013
00:48:17,934 --> 00:48:19,475
More or less?

1014
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,597
Yeah, that's the thing.

1015
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:27,861
In an idea world, in a simpler game, we wouldn't need all these structures, but...

1016
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:33,336
I'm not sure how you avoid having extrinsic motivators in a game like this.

1017
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:39,879
I'm not sure how you'd make an MMO scale game without any kind of XP or money or anything.

1018
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:46,302
Which would be an interesting thought experiment, but I don't know where you'd go with that.

1019
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:47,623
So given that we have them...

1020
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,125
we might as well use them for good, right?

1021
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,026
I know what you're talking about, I totally agree,

1022
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,387
and it would be ideal if we didn't have that,

1023
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:56,669
we didn't have achievements, we didn't have any kind of

1024
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,170
sticking an RPG system on everything.

1025
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,951
But in a game where we kind of,

1026
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:02,392
we don't see an obvious way to avoid it,

1027
00:49:02,392 --> 00:49:03,833
we've just got to kind of make the best of it,

1028
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,234
if that makes sense.

1029
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:04,434
Thanks.

1030
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:04,814
You're welcome.

1031
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:10,655
I just had a quick question about inflation.

1032
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,016
You said before that as far as I have inflation,

1033
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:15,957
there's that whole security system that brings it back.

1034
00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:16,877
That's fine.

1035
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:20,379
I was kind of more curious about your end game players

1036
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:22,279
and inflation on a player level.

1037
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:24,920
Like just over time, accumulating resources,

1038
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,561
how you would deal with sinking them,

1039
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:27,942
like gold sinks in WoW for instance.

1040
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:32,920
Okay, so the question, if I understand it, is how do we kind of ensure that individual

1041
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,722
players don't get runaway wealth that ruins everything for them?

1042
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:41,045
It's a good question, because inflation has historically been a big issue in all kinds

1043
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:42,366
of persistent world games.

1044
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:45,067
A couple of things.

1045
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:49,530
One is to always have a higher goal that they're aiming for, that they can throw money at,

1046
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,471
is a nice way to get them to spend.

1047
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:56,134
But the thing we found, like, so we found on EVE, my data's all two years old, someone

1048
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:57,915
will shout at me if this is wrong now, but...

1049
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:03,883
money in the game went up over time and average money on players went over time, but

1050
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,765
market inflation was pretty much flat.

1051
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,687
What we think is going on here

1052
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:08,027
is that

1053
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:13,993
the players, particularly the players who generate lots of wealth, who are into that kind of

1054
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:16,095
gameplay, they see their wallet as their high score.

1055
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:21,390
so they don't accumulate all that money so they can throw it at someone, they accumulate

1056
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,971
their money so they can say, I've got 3 trillion isk, how much have you got?

1057
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:28,912
And that's kind of their motivation, my assumption at least, their motivation for gathering all

1058
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:33,213
that money so it doesn't impact the gameplay nearly as much as you'd think because they

1059
00:50:33,213 --> 00:50:35,954
don't want to spend it, if that makes sense.

1060
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:37,554
Totally fair, thank you.

1061
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:41,595
I'd love if anyone did some research on that and told me definitively because it's an interesting

1062
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:42,896
question.

1063
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:44,796
Yes, very interesting question.

1064
00:50:44,796 --> 00:50:45,616
I'm Ted Castronova.

1065
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:53,939
you know virtual economist. This was a wonderful talk. I'd like you to design the real world economy.

1066
00:50:53,939 --> 00:51:00,667
I've got it like a 3000 word rant on why the financial system is completely badly designed if you want it.

1067
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:10,404
Well yeah. Can I. I want to get your car. Anyway a question. What do you guys do about gold farming. I just looked up the

1068
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:16,488
price of Albion silver and there it is. Yeah. So what do you do for that third market.

1069
00:51:16,628 --> 00:51:23,069
So we have a system, the same system that Eve has more or less, where you can...

1070
00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:28,651
We have in-game silver and in-game gold, and silver is the main game resource, main game currency,

1071
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:30,931
and gold is bought with real-world money.

1072
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:34,732
You can buy... We have a premium subscription that increases all your progression by 50%,

1073
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:38,113
so you really want it, and you can buy that with dollars or with gold,

1074
00:51:38,113 --> 00:51:43,094
so you can trade gold and dollars, or silver and real-world money effectively on the market.

1075
00:51:44,115 --> 00:51:49,199
That puts a limit on it or dampens down the gold selling.

1076
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,801
On top of that, various enforcement programs

1077
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:52,862
that I don't know the details of,

1078
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:54,724
but I know people are doing.

1079
00:51:54,724 --> 00:51:57,286
It's just a scourge of everything ever.

1080
00:51:57,286 --> 00:52:04,032
I'm not aware of a silver bullet solution.

1081
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:05,673
But yeah, we have the gold thing

1082
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:08,976
so people can trade money for game time and so on.

1083
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:11,498
And we just try to stamp on them wherever we find them.

1084
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,780
Sadness.

1085
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:14,820
Hi.

1086
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,521
Hi.

1087
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:17,322
Thanks a lot for the talk.

1088
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,683
I really enjoyed it.

1089
00:52:18,683 --> 00:52:21,665
My question is about AI participants in the economy.

1090
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:26,269
I don't know if Albion has these, but I know that Eve does.

1091
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:30,111
So I'm just curious what sort of goals or approaches you take on getting AI players

1092
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:36,276
to participate in such a way that doesn't cause players to either ignore or abuse them.

1093
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:43,329
So you talking about AI in terms of player one bots or in terms of our

1094
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,030
Intervention the economy no like in player

1095
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:51,693
Factions or NPCs who are gonna buy sell or generate pieces of the economy, so I said again

1096
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:54,340
In-game factions or NPCs?

1097
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,840
Right, okay, so yeah, yeah.

1098
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,701
Developer side AI rather than player side AI.

1099
00:52:59,701 --> 00:53:05,923
Yeah, okay, so question is how do we intervene, basically, in the economy in an automated way?

1100
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:07,404
Largely speaking, we don't.

1101
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,962
We have things like, for example, when the game goes live for the first time,

1102
00:53:12,962 --> 00:53:15,864
it takes several days for people to get enough food supply

1103
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:18,085
to supply the buildings they need to make food.

1104
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:19,966
So we have some, like, sell orders for food

1105
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:25,428
the first week of the game after launch to kind of kickstart that.

1106
00:53:25,428 --> 00:53:31,751
But otherwise, I don't think we have any artificial buy or sell orders in the game.

1107
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:32,972
It's all entirely player-driven.

1108
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:48,575
they can bootstrap everything themselves beyond the food issue so that's not a huge problem

1109
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:56,918
and yeah we don't mess with that side of things very much at all.

1110
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:03,094
If I'm answering the question correctly, do we have an equal amount of each resource type in the world?

1111
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:03,894
Five minutes, thank you.

1112
00:54:03,894 --> 00:54:10,396
Yeah, we have, yeah, at least certainly the level I'm talking about here,

1113
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:13,197
we do the math so we know how many resources of each there needs to be

1114
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:15,818
and then we tune the spawn rate of each individual resource type.

1115
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:19,559
There's slightly fewer wood nodes in the world because there's less forest,

1116
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,859
therefore a wood node has a slightly shorter respawn time.

1117
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:25,260
So yeah, we try and keep that pretty flat across all things because the goal is...

1118
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:30,968
like the equipment construction setup is designed to use everything equally.

1119
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,193
Obviously if players find, for example, that cloth armor is way better than leather armor,

1120
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:36,696
then there's going to be a surge of demand on cloth and drop for leather,

1121
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:39,741
but that's cool, that leads to all kinds of interesting market effects that we're very happy with.

1122
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:47,586
Hi, I just want to talk more on the, or ask a question about the inflation.

1123
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:54,991
Did you consider a pure bartering system where there is only a player market?

1124
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:59,733
If I want your sword, you want chicken heads, I give you five chicken heads for a sword,

1125
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:02,355
rather than a silver, gold, coin, currency?

1126
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:08,306
So the question is, did we consider not having currency and just doing barter?

1127
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:12,088
I don't think we did.

1128
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:16,651
There was actually an interesting thing a couple of tests ago where players were...

1129
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:18,472
Everyone was very obsessed about being self-sufficient.

1130
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:22,494
All the guilds wanted to make all their own stuff, so they weren't actually using silver at all.

1131
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:26,416
They were all about harvesting, telling all their players to go out and gather resources so we can build our own stuff,

1132
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,378
which led to a really weird place where no one needed money.

1133
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:32,421
which mess with our game quite a lot.

1134
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:35,103
But broadly speaking, the main problem with trying to do that,

1135
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:38,405
it's a really interesting approach, but the problem is that

1136
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:43,049
it really clogs up the market because if you have X,

1137
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,932
you need to have, you must want Y that's being sold,

1138
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:47,933
it means it's much harder to find a market match,

1139
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:50,235
whereas having silver as an intermediary means that

1140
00:55:50,235 --> 00:55:51,476
you can always offload stuff.

1141
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,158
Silver's basically a way of just...

1142
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:57,201
or money and currency in general is just a way of time shifting trades, right?

1143
00:55:57,201 --> 00:56:00,243
So it means that you can offload that sword for some silver now

1144
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,285
and I can turn the silver into the eggs I need later

1145
00:56:02,285 --> 00:56:04,947
rather than having to wait for a silver to eggs trade to show up

1146
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:07,770
or doing some weird thing where I, you know,

1147
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,971
trading for yammick sauce or whatever

1148
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:12,013
to try and get myself to what I want.

1149
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:15,736
So it would be cool, but I think it ends up clogging the market up too much

1150
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:19,119
for it to be workable, at least without doing a lot of thinking.

1151
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:19,179
Yes.

1152
00:56:22,432 --> 00:56:25,194
I don't think there's any more questions, I think I can stop there.

1153
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:26,795
That's wonderful.

1154
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:30,718
Yeah, so thanks for coming, you've been a lovely audience for me to fill out your forms

1155
00:56:30,718 --> 00:56:31,018
and stuff.

1156
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:33,159
I'm going to keep talking so that guy can't clap.

1157
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,160
No, I'm done, cool, thank you.
