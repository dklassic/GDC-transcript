1
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,867
I'm going to tell you all about our project Immortality.

2
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:27,354
This was already going to be a loose and ramshackle presentation, and then the organizer of this conference decided to schedule my talk first thing in the morning, the day after the awards show.

3
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:33,168
I'm going to try and get through it, and we'll pull together.

4
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:38,332
I want to get to a nice, substantial Q&A, so I'm going to try and power through it.

5
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,374
Apologies, anyone that has to try and keep up with me.

6
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:44,076
So let's go.

7
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:46,919
I'll start my timer.

8
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,961
So I'm Sam Barlow.

9
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,723
I'm a game director, designer, writer.

10
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,805
Founded this company, Half Mermaid Productions, to go make interesting narrative games.

11
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,347
Why are we called Half Mermaid?

12
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:04,128
It's a fun story.

13
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:15,338
When we started my last project, Telling Lies, we had to set up an entity to go make things and do all the legal stuff, and the lawyer rang me up and was like, oh shit, we need a name for your company.

14
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,373
that has to be unique and interesting.

15
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:31,340
And on the spur of the moment, I thought of this dream project that I had, which was an idea for a movie about Alfred Hitchcock working with Esther Williams.

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,782
If you don't know who Esther Williams is, this is Esther Williams.

17
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:42,667
She was at the height of her fame, probably the most famous film star at the time, and she was known for

18
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,233
making movies in which she would swim.

19
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:53,898
She kind of invented the Olympic sport of synchronized swimming, and she would do these elaborate musical spectacles involving swimming.

20
00:01:55,278 --> 00:02:05,364
Her story was fascinating because she had aspirations to be more significant as an actress, to take on work that didn't just involve swimming.

21
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:23,127
And so the idea for this movie was you'd kind of have Alfred Hitchcock at the end of his career and he's kind of fading and he comes together with Esther and they both want to make something special and the focus of this movie would be Hitchcock wanting to shoot the most elaborate drowning sequence that had ever been conceived.

22
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:28,149
And so the name of this movie was Drowning a Mermaid, which was nicely kind of ironic.

23
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,109
So that became the name of the company.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,911
And then when we started Immortality, we decided we were going to self-publish.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:48,178
We realized that without the context I've just given you, drowning a mermaid sounded kind of aggressive and scary as a company name, so we kind of morphed it into Half Mermaid, acknowledging that all of us, at least from the top up, are half a mermaid.

26
00:02:50,345 --> 00:03:13,923
And this is significant because that dream project I had, this idea of exploring this combination of director and actress and the creative tensions, essentially found a new form in, ultimately, the project Immortality, which, if you haven't played Immortality, I am probably going to spoil everything.

27
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,253
So you have, I don't know, like three minutes if you can download it on your phones before it's all going to be ruined for you.

28
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:35,060
Immortality is a video game about exploring footage from three lost movies and answering, initially, the question, what happened to Marissa Marcel, the star of these three movies?

29
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,864
It was the first indie game ever to get a perfect score of 10 in Edge magazine.

30
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:44,886
And last night, we won two awards.

31
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:57,278
We clearly did something right, and if you follow all the steps I lay out here, you can recreate that success.

32
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:59,819
It's very reproducible.

33
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,180
This is a template you can just apply to your own projects.

34
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:14,303
So I'm going to zoom back out, and I'm going to kind of start from the higher level philosophies and goals that drive what we're doing.

35
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:20,224
And hopefully, if we have time, I'll get to the spreadsheets, which I know is the thing that everyone is here to hear about.

36
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:28,209
So what is the driving mission behind what we're doing at Half Mermaid and what is my mission in games in general?

37
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:38,516
And for me, it's kind of crystallized, especially over the last few games, to be about storytelling and the form of storytelling.

38
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,099
And for me, if I look back at the 20th century,

39
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,180
which, you know, I was born in the 20th century.

40
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,785
As my kids remind me, I was born in the late 20th century, which makes me sound like an antique.

41
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:58,871
The 20th century as a period of storytelling for me is defined by broadcast, right?

42
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,493
This is the big game changer.

43
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:08,059
You've gone from traditional storytelling techniques, kind of oral storytelling, in-person theatrical storytelling,

44
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:29,531
and you have the popularity of radio that then blossoms into network TV and cinema where a storyteller can create a beautiful piece of storytelling and then share it with a huge audience and that audience can then absorb and react and there is a sense of global community.

45
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:51,127
around it but it's so powerful and my go-to, this is like the best fact ever, my go-to kind of example of how powerful this moment was and this transformation to broadcast was in the 50s Orson Welles did a live TV version of King Lear

46
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:06,664
when this version of King Lear was broadcast, more people watched the live TV version of King Lear than had ever watched any performance of King Lear in the entire history of humanity prior to that day.

47
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:14,747
So you get this sense of like the seismic shift from like how stories were told and distributed and the scale at which they operated.

48
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:18,528
Once we hit broadcast, you know, the scale is obscene.

49
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,569
And that is such an interesting and powerful thing.

50
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:30,319
So now that we're in the 21st century, what is my sense of what is gonna define the forms of storytelling that we create?

51
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,279
And for me, it's all tied up in digital, right?

52
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,520
What does it mean to tell stories through digital media?

53
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,860
What does that enable?

54
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:47,102
And for me, the initial beautiful first step is what I call throwing away the container.

55
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:50,063
So if you look at, take movies as an example,

56
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:59,133
The structure of a movie, the fact that it's like 90 minutes to 2 hours roughly, the act structure is very specific.

57
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:03,736
Like the container of movies exists for very practical purposes, right?

58
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:08,799
If you want to distribute a movie, you need to print it on film, put it in a can, at least you used to.

59
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,661
drive it to the movie theater, play it.

60
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:20,870
If you're broadcasting a television show, naturally you have a single static version of the show that then gets blatted out to everybody, and again, there are restrictions there, right?

61
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:31,380
The 30-minute show or the 45-minute show, act structures based around commercial breaks, these very specific containers that, you know, exist for very practical reasons.

62
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,715
If I'm watching a movie, there is a limitation to the human bladder.

63
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,942
The movie theaters want to schedule multiple movies throughout the day for commercial reasons.

64
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:46,370
So we have all these kind of restrictions that come with this kind of 20th century version of broadcast.

65
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,532
But now that we're digital, we can throw those away entirely, right?

66
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:58,215
And I think up until now, the disruptive kind of digital storytelling media has tweaked the container, right?

67
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:02,417
Netflix might say, oh, we can have a 35, 36, 37-minute episode.

68
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,719
Or maybe Stranger Things can be two and a half hours long or an hour long.

69
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:07,104
Is it a movie?

70
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:07,705
Is it TV?

71
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:10,567
But these are all like very subtle shifts.

72
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:19,654
They're still writing these pieces of television in the same structure, with the same container, with the same usage of plot as this kind of guiding principle.

73
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:28,560
So for me, the real opportunity that we have in coming from games is to throw these containers away and what happens then?

74
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,582
What do you do in the absence of the container?

75
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:44,546
And for me, if you look at the core pillars of what video games do best and can do best, these are the means by which we can navigate this much more open, interesting space for storytelling.

76
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:46,587
So here are my four pillars.

77
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:51,988
In the background there, that's the pillars of Nosgoth, which is a little bit of foreshadowing, if you take note.

78
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,990
And the four pillars for me are challenge, right?

79
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,251
As human beings, if you put an obstacle in my path, if you give me a riddle or question,

80
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:06,885
I'm naturally inclined to want to overcome that obstacle, to solve the riddle, to answer the questions.

81
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,469
So challenge is this really interesting driver.

82
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,937
When you give people agency and control in a piece of storytelling, that's going to really drag them in and give them that sense of immersion.

83
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,218
Expression is, I think, like my favorite.

84
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:23,620
When I think of expression, I think of like Nintendo.

85
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:37,606
I think of playing Mario, which is a game in which Nintendo say, here is this game about running and jumping, but the mechanics of that game give you a richness and a fluidity to allow you to express yourself through how you run and jump, right?

86
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,807
Any two people playing Mario are going to navigate differently.

87
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:44,129
There's like a real kind of nice possibility space within that mechanic.

88
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:45,850
And I think what

89
00:09:46,909 --> 00:10:01,249
differentiates my games often with some other narrative games is really paying attention to how can the player express themselves through how they interact with the story and finding mechanics and structures which open up to that expressivity.

90
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:08,598
The third pillar, exploration, is obviously a fundamental feature of a lot of video games.

91
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:17,744
As a hunter-gatherer species, we are predisposed to dig exploration, being led by a sense of curiosity, discovery.

92
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,607
These are key fundamental aspects to a lot of traditional video games.

93
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,589
And I think, again, what I've been doing is trying to

94
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:30,640
take a lot of those verbs around exploration and apply them directly to the story itself.

95
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,342
And that's been kind of a fascinating journey.

96
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:39,364
And then the fourth pillar is the one that we sometimes take for granted.

97
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,426
Video games are very good at simulating things.

98
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:49,889
We can simulate physics and vehicles and bullets and have AI that has an abstracted simulation of some kind of creature.

99
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,171
And so we kind of lean on that a lot because it's

100
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:54,292
for

101
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:32,323
would involve players, but I kind of questioned how useful it was for my, specifically my storytelling, and so starting with her story in 2015, I kind of explicitly gave myself the challenge of make a video game with no simulation, no state changes, no tracking of kind of structure, can I still create an experience which is enjoyable and immersive.

102
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:43,786
Given this kind of approach, the last few games I've made, I set out, so with her story, I was exploring a lot of these ideas for the first time.

103
00:11:44,446 --> 00:12:00,389
The idea was to deconstruct a detective story, take a type of story that the audience is familiar with, knows all the tropes, take that knowledge and then use that to kind of fuel the experience by breaking it down into atomic elements, letting people freely navigate.

104
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,400
I followed this up with Telling Lies

105
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,602
And the use of video in her story was somewhat instinctive.

106
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:16,344
There wasn't a lot of conscious thinking about why I did that.

107
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:24,149
But looking back with Telling Lies, I started to think about what was interesting about this technique of using video.

108
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,071
And the kind of stated mission of Telling Lies was to make an anti-movie.

109
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:37,116
It was like all the things which make this distinct from the traditional forms of movies, the structure of it, the pacing of it, the way we shoot it, were kind of driving

110
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,734
the idea of telling lies.

111
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:49,837
And so both of these kind of culminate in Immortality where we kind of then revisited a cinematic aesthetic and said, well, what happens if we deconstruct movies themselves, right?

112
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:57,778
If we start to break apart how movies work, why movies work, how they're made, and kind of really dig into that.

113
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:02,759
And it unlocked some extremely ambitious and challenging questions.

114
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,720
So it's like a kind of fun thing to do.

115
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:13,756
So, also driving this, I have like my pillars of what is a video game, right?

116
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:17,119
And as I'm working on a game, I'll keep returning to those, right?

117
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,340
Is this expressive enough?

118
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,921
Is there a meaningful challenge?

119
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,403
You know, how does the exploration work?

120
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:24,304
Are we empowering the player with our exploration?

121
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:35,413
But the kind of other method I have, which is sort of fundamental to my process, is I have these three aspects of the game and

122
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:42,419
The logic is, if I have all three of these in place, this is going to be a good game.

123
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,303
And if I don't have a clear idea of all three of these, do not start making game.

124
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:57,053
This is the early sanity check of is there an actual solid core here, and as well it helps with

125
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:00,956
When the game's finished, is it going to be sellable?

126
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,316
Is it going to be explainable?

127
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:04,157
Is this something I can market?

128
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:06,519
The whole kind of concept gets tied up here.

129
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,682
So the method is to come up with a theme.

130
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:15,604
So the theme is, what is the question that we're exploring here?

131
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,005
And it might be a question I don't have an answer to.

132
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:19,998
and

133
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:38,748
And then there's the emotion.

134
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:49,493
And this is kind of key to me, is as a storyteller, I want to have a really specific emotion that I felt that I want to communicate.

135
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:55,516
And to communicate that needs an experience, right?

136
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:59,118
If I was to just put it into words, it would sound trite or unspecific.

137
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:05,441
So how do we create an experience, and through living that experience, have the player

138
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:07,499
feel this emotion.

139
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:16,967
So for example in Telling Lies the emotion was how does it feel to have been in a relationship that's failed

140
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:23,578
but still hold in your head the memories of the happy memories of when that relationship was working, right?

141
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:31,803
And it's a very complicated part of being a human is holding these conflicting emotions and still having the spark and the way that memory works.

142
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,626
Like there was this real gnarly little emotion there.

143
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:40,089
It was like, how do we get people to experience that and think about it?

144
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,951
Because if I express it like I just did, it's kind of lame.

145
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,197
And then a key thing is the metaphor.

146
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:49,522
I call it, I'm slightly breaking the use of the word metaphor.

147
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,065
The idea here is

148
00:15:52,185 --> 00:16:15,932
what is what is the metaphor and kind of it becomes the mechanic that describes the game and this becomes really useful communication tool to the player so for example with her story the metaphor was that moment in a police show where the detective is sat at the computer and they've run out of leads they're at the you know it's

149
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:17,176
about

150
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:37,591
That's the core mechanic of her story, and that is this metaphor.

151
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:44,035
So then if you build the game around that, when you then show players the game, they get it because they recognize this thing.

152
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:49,137
And the question is, is this a useful metaphor for the story we're telling?

153
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:53,240
Is this going to be something that you can wrap these themes and emotions in?

154
00:16:54,315 --> 00:17:02,381
And so yeah, the process is to really use this as just like a way of analyzing a piece of game design and going, do I have these three things?

155
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:09,987
And, you know, maybe it's easier to do this in the indie space, but also like throw out the crap that is extraneous to this, right?

156
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:15,692
If you can kind of focus on these three things, that gives you a tight and cohesive piece of game.

157
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:26,978
So doing this process on immortality, our theme, which was absurdly ambitious, was why do human beings tell stories?

158
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:43,802
And we're like, if we're going to do something that's about cinema and looking back at the 20th century, and cinema is the great storytelling form of the 20th century, this is an opportunity to ask these very deep questions.

159
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:45,282
And it was exciting.

160
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:50,543
to give myself permission to ask something as ambitious and silly as this.

161
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:59,366
Because sometimes you try and kind of scope things down and you feel like, oh, this is like overreaching or it could end up awkward if we try and answer these big questions.

162
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,368
And, you know, with this project, it really became tied up in

163
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,790
Like to what extent is our mortality part of this?

164
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:18,212
You know, oftentimes you look at people creating pieces of art, creating stories, and sometimes the objective is to use it as an immortality project, to create something that will live beyond them.

165
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,513
And is that a useful and healthy thing to do?

166
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:25,213
So this was like the theme that we set out to explore.

167
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:32,495
The emotion was, again, it always sounds trite when you try and express it, but

168
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,307
struggling with the impossibility of creating the perfect story.

169
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:51,120
And it was like, if storytelling is something we're driven to do, if there are kind of primal reasons for it, the most interesting way to explore that is a case of failure, right?

170
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:56,886
So this fella here is from the cancelled Legacy of Kane game that I spent three years of my life working on.

171
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:03,736
was the most challenging thing I worked on and the biggest failure, probably, of my career.

172
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,462
After that I went and did some stuff and I did her story.

173
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:14,947
So it's slowly being repressed and buried, all my feelings of this project.

174
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,790
And as we started to build this one, I'm like, oh shit, this is all

175
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:30,996
This is all about that Legacy of Kain game because there's such a commonality between movies and games in terms of the number of people you need, the expense, the technology, right?

176
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:38,020
These are very challenging places to try and tell a story and tell a true and pure story because there's just so much going on.

177
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,423
So, you know, I really wanted to try and tap into how that felt.

178
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:44,805
Why did I work so hard?

179
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:55,292
Why did I push myself so hard at the expense of my family and the rest of my life to try and make this legacy of Kengame, which was a constant struggle, and how did it feel when it failed?

180
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:59,896
And, you know, trying to put that into an experience for you all to enjoy.

181
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,850
Then the metaphor became the Moviola.

182
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:11,472
This was like the very first design doc for the project was this little picture of Pikachu with Moviola.

183
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,133
It's a slightly mixed metaphor.

184
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:19,055
We can kind of expand it and say it's the Moviola of the editing suite, right?

185
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:26,437
The metaphor became, imagine you're in an editing room and you have all this footage, right?

186
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,118
That process where in making a movie,

187
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:35,435
The editor sits down to do the assembly cut, and they have everything that's been filmed, this vast amount of footage.

188
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:48,326
And they start organizing it, and obsessing over it, and looking at it, and picking out the good takes, and going frame by frame, and just really immersing themselves in the beauty of the film, and slowly they assemble a movie.

189
00:20:49,212 --> 00:21:00,234
And so that kind of was our sort of guiding principle and the mechanics of that and kind of wanting to explore the tactile nature of film as a medium versus the kind of more digital stuff we're familiar with.

190
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:09,996
But even at this point, the presence of Pikachu shows that we were aware that we were also making Pokemon Snap, essentially.

191
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:13,777
And this was another way that I justified, like, this project's going to work.

192
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:24,976
and we're doing some weird stuff and we have these ideas but I've played Pokemon Snap and that was fun and people liked Pokemon Snap so this is going to work.

193
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:38,484
So then the next thing that we do and this is going to be a huge difference for me going from the AAA space or the bigger project space

194
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,393
to being an indie and being able to kind of define how projects work.

195
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,234
And it is specificity.

196
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:50,920
And to be honest, like, all I ask of a game these days is to have some specificity.

197
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,924
Like, I want some real crunchy, little, special, unique details.

198
00:21:55,964 --> 00:22:00,409
I want to feel like I'm engaging with something that's very authentic and specific.

199
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:02,951
Like, I just recently finished playing Pentament, right?

200
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:04,512
And I was like, oh, this is some, like,

201
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:11,967
This is like a deep, deep dive into a particular fetish for this period of history.

202
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,409
I'm feeling enriched by interacting with this.

203
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:17,391
It doesn't feel like a mishmash of generic stuff.

204
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:26,699
And the 100% reliable recipe I have for imbuing a game with specificity is research.

205
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:33,144
So on this project, we spent a year, year and a half of a two and a half year project

206
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:39,934
was researching and outlining and writing and thinking about this stuff.

207
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:47,900
And I have another cheesy tool that I call the list, which is I will basically go and read everything on a subject.

208
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,664
Just read hundreds of books, watch as much footage, read academic papers, just everything I can get my hands on.

209
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:59,127
And as I'm going, if I find a really interesting little detail,

210
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:11,805
I'll add it to a list and at the end of this process I just have this really long list just full of these little textures or details or moments that I've never seen before that feel fresh.

211
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:20,340
And it's kind of this little toolkit that I have as we then start to actually assemble the story and the process and the mechanics of like, oh, there's that little thing.

212
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,401
I've been looking for a way to use that and insert that.

213
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:30,125
But yeah, the research, reading, it's so easy now to just go online and convince yourself that you've researched something.

214
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:37,928
But if you sit down and read like three different autobiographies of someone, you just get like a volume of genuine like human detail.

215
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,089
That's interesting.

216
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,290
So to give you an idea, we're gonna watch a bunch of videos.

217
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,470
now.

218
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:45,132
Actually, I'm going to intro you first.

219
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:58,059
We started thinking about this idea of exploring movie making, answering these questions, trying to explore this idea of failure and the struggle.

220
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,022
For me, I have a particular love and interest in the idea of lost movies.

221
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,464
Here we've got a shot from a movie that Orson Welles

222
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:12,815
He shot like half of called The Deep, which was an adaptation of the book Dead Calm, which is one of my favorite thriller novels.

223
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:14,936
He never completed it.

224
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:15,557
He ran out of money.

225
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:19,980
In fact, Orson Welles ran out of money a lot later in his career.

226
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,623
Like he probably has the record for the greatest number of lost movies.

227
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:36,433
And it's like this perfect encapsulation of what we're talking about, because if the purpose of art is to create an immortality project, a lost movie is a failure.

228
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,445
You put all this effort in and it never comes out.

229
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:43,468
It's this radical example of failure.

230
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,130
But it still lives, right?

231
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:54,877
I get excited thinking about this movie that never happened and I see a couple of frames from it and a few clips from it and that's so evocative and interesting and my brain starts working and thinking about it.

232
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:57,419
So it's also got this nuance to it.

233
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,682
And then similarly, there are movies that have come out.

234
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:04,605
So Eyes Wide Shut was something of a North Star for this project.

235
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:07,509
of the movie.

236
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:27,331
From the very beginning, he was constantly trying to adapt this book that it was based on.

237
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:37,377
At various points, they almost made it with Woody Allen as the star, which is an alternate path that we have luckily developed.

238
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:38,498
There was a version with Steve Martin.

239
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,519
He had John Le Carre write the treatment.

240
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,361
He just kept trying to figure out how to make this movie.

241
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,826
and it ends up being his last movie, right?

242
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:49,387
And he literally died before finishing his movie.

243
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,547
In fact, this movie killed him.

244
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:56,888
So when Kubrick died, the version of Eyes Wide Shut that's out there was not a finished edit.

245
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:57,769
It was like, you know, 90%.

246
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:03,049
And Kubrick was also famous for continuing to edit the movie even after it had premiered.

247
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,010
And it's this idea of struggle and failure as well.

248
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,231
Like this at the time was the longest ever movie shoot

249
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:18,677
There was all this kind of intrigue and interest around what was going on, why this movie was running for so long, what was happening with Tom and Nicole.

250
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:26,182
And fascinating things like Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were in this movie, shot out 90% of their scenes.

251
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:30,444
And then when it ran for so long, they had to recast them and reshoot it all.

252
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:37,128
So it's even a movie that came out, it's full of all these what ifs and potential versions that could have existed.

253
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:41,091
So the idea that the kind of finished,

254
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:46,660
ultimate version, like, is that the perfect version that Kubrick spent his whole life trying to make?

255
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,682
You know, and all those kind of unlived possibilities are kind of fascinating.

256
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:58,427
So this was, you know, we started to kind of hone in on this and this idea, well, how about we make our subject lost movies, right?

257
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:05,911
The idea that we're exploring and kind of unearthing and bringing back to life these lost movies felt like a really nice way to explore our themes.

258
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:09,013
And then we kind of

259
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:10,449
quickly

260
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:38,237
what goes on in the making of a movie and the history of making of movies and the power structures, this was like the absolute locus of like all of these forces.

261
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:46,242
So for example, the person on the left there is Margarita Cancino, and on the right is the person she became.

262
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,665
The movie studios picked her and decided to transform her.

263
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:55,768
She underwent painful plastic surgery, and this was like old school plastic surgery,

264
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:01,050
They changed her ethnicity, they changed her name, they kind of essentially rebuilt her from the ground up.

265
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,571
And she was their creation, right?

266
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:05,312
Under the studio system, they owned her.

267
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:09,993
Rita Hayworth was this new entity that they had created.

268
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:22,038
So it's like this real apex of like that sacrifice of self to essentially allow yourself to be rebuilt in service of the storytelling.

269
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,319
But at the same time,

270
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:32,060
There was this nuance as well of like thinking now from the 21st century, like Rita Hayworth has survived.

271
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:39,125
There is something of her soul that when we watch her movies, lives beyond the screen.

272
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:43,488
And we don't talk about the studio heads who created her, right?

273
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:47,231
And all the other people that were part of all these different power systems.

274
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:55,994
All these mechanisms, like there's something where she has kind of survived and she does still live on through this footage of her.

275
00:28:56,114 --> 00:29:08,621
And so this idea of like a star, this idea of an actress who's brought in and kind of molded felt like a really useful kind of locus as our main character to explore some of these themes.

276
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:16,553
I also started to get really into hair, realized that hair was super important in our story.

277
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:26,941
So here on the right, this is Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shanghai, a film that she filmed with Orson Welles, who at that point was her ex.

278
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,845
So like all of those complexities and different power dynamics were

279
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:33,427
extremely complicated

280
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:47,239
When he heard of this, he was absolutely furious.

281
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,083
He was like, we created Rita Hayworth, the hair is like 50% of who Rita Hayworth is.

282
00:29:52,603 --> 00:30:01,611
And so you had these two guys, one was the guy who created her and owned her, the other was her ex who was also her director, both arguing about what she should be doing with her hair.

283
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:04,033
And it's like, it's kind of screwed up.

284
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,801
And the hair continues, right?

285
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:16,364
So we started to get really interested in Jane Fonda as well because she occupied this beautiful moment where film changed, right?

286
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:30,390
We went from the studio system into kind of new Hollywood and tracking her career, she was an actress who was able to actually assert herself and gain some agency and start taking on roles and sort of transform.

287
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:31,343
was

288
00:30:49,588 --> 00:31:15,541
he was in love with the fantasy of them that he created on the camera and he was extremely controlling and so for him the idea of the beautiful blonde uh... woman was like his his archetype and at a point in her life where Jane Fonda was discovering feminism and was trying to assert herself and change her career she went out got a hairdresser and they cut the hair went back to a natural color and what became known as the clute haircut was born

289
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:25,940
There's a lot, there's so much hair, hair trivia that we were just like, oh, this is like such a big deal and it's so kind of interesting, the nuance that it brings.

290
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:28,885
Here we've got some videos.

291
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:33,647
So we were watching like so much video, I became obsessed with talk shows, right?

292
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:37,529
I watched like a hundred hours of Dick Cavett, which is, I recommend it.

293
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:44,931
And there's something really interesting about these actresses coming out, being interviewed, so they're playing a version of themselves.

294
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:51,254
And it was at points excruciating because all of the sexism and the power dynamics,

295
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:12,975
fully on display in a lot of this stuff so this was this is from like I guess the 80s is Phoebe Cates with Letterman I have a particular love of grungy video so clips like this I'm like I love this shit this is beautiful

296
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:22,398
There's a constant obsession with the age of actresses and their youth and their perfection and how moldable and controllable they are.

297
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:22,898
Thank you for being here.

298
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:23,398
Thank you for being here.

299
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:24,619
It's quite an honor, I guess, huh?

300
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,039
Yeah, it's a real honor.

301
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:26,299
Yeah.

302
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,899
You look very young in person.

303
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,700
Yeah, everybody says that.

304
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,540
Yeah, you look like, I don't know, 15, 16, maybe?

305
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,580
Well, yeah, maybe.

306
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

307
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:40,161
And can we tell folks how... The rest of the interview gets worse.

308
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:42,982
He was completely...

309
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,160
Okay, we got next.

310
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:52,183
Okay, so this was another clip that kind of had pride of place on our mood board.

311
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:58,165
So this is Olivia Hussey with her co-star in the Romeo and Juliet movie at the end of the 60s.

312
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,167
They were both like 15, 16 when they filmed this movie.

313
00:33:02,487 --> 00:33:07,530
And they're being interviewed by a very kind of BBC-ish British interviewer.

314
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:15,093
And there's this small little clip here which YouTube loves, like the YouTube commenters love this stuff because it's all about smoking.

315
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:26,464
personal question of the uh... and as you know you're at fifteen it's pretty young to be smoking cigarettes when did you start?

316
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:32,245
at about fourteen about fourteen while you were doing the prime of miss jean brody?

317
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:44,768
yes well just before then actually i mean that that is pretty young there aren't many girls at fifteen i know that smoke cigarettes publicly oh there are and uh... what are your

318
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,616
Yeah, she spent the whole interview smoking like a chimney.

319
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:59,986
But that little bit, the whole interview, this BBC guy is treating her like some slightly exotic, precocious creature, and he's very intrigued by her strength of character or whatever.

320
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:05,251
But the look she gave him, and she was like, you don't know shit about teenage girls and what they're up to.

321
00:34:06,232 --> 00:34:10,116
That stuck with me, and I started watching a lot of these

322
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:11,954
clips

323
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:27,618
as an exaggeration and reflection of actually how much strength of character these actresses have to sit there and just kind of smile through this crap.

324
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:41,483
If actually inside of them there was something even more powerful that could just step up and rip the head off this interviewer or, you know, had a lived experience or a wisdom that was far in excess of what you're thinking.

325
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:46,704
And that kind of grew into the fantasy element of this game.

326
00:34:50,829 --> 00:35:00,253
Another character that I kind of became obsessed with and

327
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:14,641
interestingly paralleled the story of Jane Fonda and where Jane Fonda was able to actually kind of emerge and gain control.

328
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:18,223
Jean Seberg, who you see here, did not.

329
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:24,086
She was an actress who was kind of cast from obscurity by Otto Preminger.

330
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:30,466
into a movie where he literally burned her alive on set and was a big failure.

331
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:39,629
She had this incredible moment where she essentially ushered in the new wave by starring in Goddard's Breathless, but subsequent to that, her career didn't work.

332
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:50,333
She was constantly trying to seek out meaningful work, and the system, the men around her consistently failed her, and then she kind of died tragically.

333
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:53,894
So kind of getting really deep into her story,

334
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:59,105
became a big part of the thought process of trying to create this character of Marissa Marcel.

335
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,728
This clip here is the first time she appeared on television ever.

336
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,833
This is a deep archival thing, so the quality is amazingly bad.

337
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:08,413
It's beautiful.

338
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,955
The generation loss is exquisite.

339
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:12,977
But check out some of the body language in here.

340
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:14,979
It's actually kind of excruciating.

341
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,235
exact moment.

342
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:24,319
You know, here are the two principals in the most exciting adventure in show business in the last 25 years.

343
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:31,643
The gentleman here, you probably recognize him, the distinguished producer and director from Hollywood, Otto Preminger.

344
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:34,745
So let's have a nice welcome to Otto.

345
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:42,630
Now before I introduce this youngster, I want to tell you the story that Otto Preminger conceived and carried out.

346
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,727
He has the rights to Shaw's St.

347
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,247
Joan for the movie.

348
00:36:49,088 --> 00:37:11,200
He thought to himself that, wearying of the star system temporarily, that this time he was going to find a girl, an unknown, and so he scouted through all of the United States, and then in most of the countries of Europe and in Canada, and out of probably 18,000 girls, I believe, submitted their applications and their backgrounds,

349
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:14,396
And then Otto reduced this to 3,000.

350
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:16,518
He tested all of those.

351
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:25,105
And this youngster here, Jean Seberg, is the one who caught lightning in a bottle because of her talent and her beauty and the qualities that Otto was looking for.

352
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:28,247
So let's have a wonderful hand for this 17-year-old youngster.

353
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:29,889
And then we talked about Jane Fonda already.

354
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:54,680
We really kind of zoomed in on this moment in her life when she had this reinvention and she was living in 70s New York, hanging out with Warhol, who himself was doing some very interesting explorations.

355
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,321
Warhol's studio called The Factory is on Union Square.

356
00:37:57,941 --> 00:37:59,401
He called there, no result.

357
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:02,762
He was at a farewell party for Jane Fonda on the SS France.

358
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,304
We're doing a picture together.

359
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,722
Building up all this research, we then kind of

360
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:34,098
zoomed on

361
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,483
responding to all this research, kind of orchestrate and pick where we put these in the history of film.

362
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:15,572
So we had our first movie at the tail end of the studio system, this idea of a director who is out of fashion, a kind of late period Hitchcock style director, who, you know, is coming from a studio system where everything is fake and owned.

363
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:25,058
And, you know, it's things that would have felt extremely cinematic and exciting, early in their career now feel more dated and theatrical.

364
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:34,305
And then we contrast that with this jump to the new Hollywood in the early 70s, particularly in New York, where filmmaking becomes more organic and authentic.

365
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:39,311
We have this idea of, like, 70s filmmaking being this kind of ideal of, like, grown-up cinema.

366
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:41,874
And we wanted to kind of interrogate that.

367
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:50,267
And then for our final movie, we give ourselves a little interesting time jump, and we're at the end of the millennium, where everyone's kind of looking back.

368
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:53,447
You have the invention and explosion of the indie movie.

369
00:39:53,947 --> 00:40:00,749
There's all these young people who are looking back at the 70s and being like, this was the good shit, and we're going to try and replicate that.

370
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:05,550
And it was kind of the last hurrah before everything became digital.

371
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,831
So this gave us like this interesting arc to explore, right, and have this character live through these different moments.

372
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:21,615
and we were able to figure out different aspect ratios, so we'd have this kind of nice explorability of seeing footage from these different areas and being able to recognize where we were.

373
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:25,436
Okay, I'm going to get on to the mechanics.

374
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,717
I'm going to have to go fast, otherwise we won't get to the spreadsheets.

375
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:40,261
So whilst we're doing all this research and outlining and thinking, we're also in parallel, like prototyping the mechanics, so we kind of have the time to let those bed in and get the right game feel.

376
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:45,184
So the movie Ola, I talked about, you know, this idea of putting you in the editing room.

377
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:50,608
And we wanted to hit something, you know, I pitched someone early on about this and they were like, so is it like final cut?

378
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,329
Are you like gamifying final cut?

379
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,851
It was like, well, no, cause that's like the prosaic bit.

380
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:59,634
What we want more is like, you're in the editing suite with the editor, right?

381
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:05,798
You're looking over their shoulder and you're reaching into this bin and pulling out footage and putting it in the machine and then discovering what's on it, right?

382
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,382
We wanted to give you that, the excitement of that and the tactile nature of that.

383
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:12,539
without a lot of the prosaic stuff.

384
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,381
So the movie only became this focus.

385
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:21,867
We had like 15 hours of recordings of movie over sounds that we started trying to kind of use and concatenate.

386
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:26,650
And then there was this piece of research that I just kept going back to.

387
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:33,776
And this was Nick Rogue when he, so the film director, Nick Rogue, when he started out, he was like a T-boy at one of the studios.

388
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,958
And he talks about, and this part of his biography,

389
00:41:37,699 --> 00:42:02,606
He talks about the moment where he first saw, this was an editola, which is the same thing as a movieola, first time he saw footage running and he could turn it backwards and he could play with the speed of it and he was just like mind blown like this was magical to him that he could manipulate time and it fundamentally changed his understanding of filmmaking and storytelling and

390
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:08,946
In the same biography, he then goes on to say, so the editola was like a PlayStation 3 for me.

391
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:10,727
So he was writing this a few years back.

392
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:17,990
And just like you read that when you're doing your research and you're like, holy shit, like he's telling us what to do, right?

393
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,433
We're gonna take the PlayStation 5 and make it into a movieola.

394
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:24,933
We're gonna flip that equation.

395
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:30,676
But he understood that there was something like playful and kind of tactile and exploratory about that experience for him.

396
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:38,824
I put this clip in as an indulgence, but I don't know if I can... I'll indulge myself.

397
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:40,806
So you see this in his work.

398
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:50,272
In the film Walkabout, he uses the manipulation of the footage to express some subjectivity.

399
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:53,514
So in this movie, some evil hunters shoot this buffalo.

400
00:42:54,415 --> 00:42:55,375
We see the buffalo die.

401
00:42:57,065 --> 00:43:01,688
And then Rogue starts screwing around to try and express something.

402
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:07,711
So he does this zoom right into the grain of the footage, right?

403
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:09,772
Breaking it down into its kind of atomic elements.

404
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:13,734
And then along comes this kid who, by the way, is Nick Rogue's son.

405
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:16,816
Movie making is always incestuous and complicated.

406
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:18,763
on

407
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:41,025
And he looks over, and because he's willing the buffalo to not be dead, we then see from his perspective the footage of the buffalo in reverse, coming back to life again.

408
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:43,886
This was like an obsession of Nick Rogue's.

409
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:52,709
And we really dug into that as well, this idea that playing the footage backwards was a way of resurrecting something, of bringing something back to life.

410
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:56,250
And if you

411
00:43:57,731 --> 00:44:15,600
of play to mortality, you might see some moments or scenes in this where the idea of playing things backwards as a way of resurrecting, the idea that the existence of this footage and your manipulation of it as a way of bringing someone back to life is kind of a big core beat of that story.

412
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:26,365
And as a side note, using your marketing to foreshadow your big story beats and the endings of your stories is awesome, and you should do it.

413
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:35,267
So we just, yeah, every time we talk about immortality, early teaser trailers, we put out these images of this fire and these flaming posters.

414
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:43,011
So even before people were playing the game, we were preparing them and helping them build up the richness of where we were going in our story.

415
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:45,612
I think Pentamon did that as well.

416
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:51,347
not

417
00:45:09,904 --> 00:45:10,044
Great.

418
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:32,326
They were terrified it might look like crap, and a lot of film grain in video games doesn't look very authentic.

419
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:39,187
So we set out to do the best film grain, and we came up with a system.

420
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:42,408
So the way film grain works is there's two grains.

421
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:52,050
When you first capture the image on the negative, there is an initial grain that's created by the little imperfections and holes between the actual material.

422
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:52,751
team.

423
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:14,433
look at the luminosity of the image, and then apply these different grains in varying amounts.

424
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:18,297
We had these fun little curves that we could set up in Unity for the different film.

425
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:29,366
Each different type of film, we had scans of actual film grain that we turned into tileable textures, and then we could apply and tweak the way the luminosity gradients worked so that we were applying the grain.

426
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:33,409
And you'll notice where you hit the really hot, burnt-out whites, there is no grain.

427
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,752
A lot of film grain shaders will just sort of multiply.

428
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:38,290
and you'll see the dots everywhere.

429
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:53,429
So this we just kept tweaking and going back and forth on to try and hit that authenticity and give us that beautiful kind of crisp grain when we were zooming in and out so it didn't feel like a kind of compressed digital version of this analog film that we were trying to celebrate.

430
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:01,060
So we continued to prototype and work on things.

431
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,122
And so we spent a year tweaking the feel of scrubbing the film.

432
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:09,023
And we had this prototype build.

433
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:10,324
So we hadn't shot anything.

434
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:11,925
We had a bunch of clips of different films.

435
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:18,888
And this was from the eyes of Laura Mars, a scene in which Tolly Lee Jones does take his shirt off.

436
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:21,729
And rewinding and tweaking film is

437
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:23,510
so much fun, right?

438
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:31,256
Me and Chris Nolan and Tennant are just like on the same wavelength of like, people take clothes off, you play that backwards, it looks amazing.

439
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:37,460
People shake their hair, play it backwards, see water, smoke, all these kind of things that just look beautiful and you start messing around with them.

440
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,823
So this was one of the scenes that I would just test and test and test.

441
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:44,445
And we tried so many different things of like, how are you scrubbing the film?

442
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,568
We started with this idea of like a movie, Ola is quite mechanical.

443
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:52,625
But we ended up kind of mixing our metaphor a little bit because we wanted it to have like a real tactile feel.

444
00:47:52,685 --> 00:48:00,690
So we're like, well, imagining the film reels, if you're touching the reel and you can kind of move it, but then you can spin it and it'll have some inertia to it.

445
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,513
So we came up with these ideas of like flicking and what does it feel like to flick an analog stick?

446
00:48:05,073 --> 00:48:06,434
Then we realized you lose control.

447
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:09,736
So we started like ratcheting it and locking you into certain speeds.

448
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:14,580
And there was like, yeah, it was like a year's worth of just like screwing around with the footage playback.

449
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:18,905
And as you can see there, I'm now technically married to Tom Lee Jones.

450
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:21,608
He's a lovely partner.

451
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:25,391
And then we got onto the grid, right?

452
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:26,252
This was exciting for me.

453
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,654
Like in the previous games, we'd always do a trailer.

454
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:36,822
And to show in the trailer just how much cool footage we had and the range and variety, we'd always end up on this visual of like a video wall.

455
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:38,644
Like, whoa, look at all the cool stuff here.

456
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:40,446
And on this one, I was like, what?

457
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,893
Couldn't that just be the game?

458
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:44,195
Wouldn't that be exciting?

459
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:50,521
I was also like, my teenage years were spent going to video installations in art galleries, I was obsessed with those things.

460
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:56,367
So just like big screens and walls of video is an aesthetic that I really appreciate.

461
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:03,355
And this is how we ended up with kind of our core interface of this grid that you can zoom in and out of and shuffle.

462
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:10,878
And the excitement for me here was this idea of the map is the territory, right?

463
00:49:10,998 --> 00:49:18,341
It's like a Borges short story about the idea of a map that is actually to scale And that's video games, right?

464
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:25,944
Like we navigate these virtual worlds that have essentially an extent that is huge and here

465
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:49,816
This idea of an interface that does all these things I'm listing here like it's essentially your menu, it's your inventory of clips you've collected, it also serves as a kind of history because we have this symbol grid that every time you click on something we're capturing that image and the grid shows the place you parked the footage at as well so it becomes very personal and specific to you.

466
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:58,200
So the idea that it was doing all these things, and we wanted as well, like you never leave this screen really.

467
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:06,943
You zoom into the footage, and then you'll zoom out of the footage, and you can teleport between bits of footage, but like you're essentially in this consistent world, right?

468
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:09,244
Again, it's like an abstraction of the edit room.

469
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:10,345
You're surrounded by all the footage.

470
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:14,208
and we're just allowing you to feel overwhelmed by how much is there.

471
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:29,120
And it also recalls, like, if you're a hardcore cinephile, you're going to, you know, there's sites that do, like, a frame from every minute of, like, your favorite movie, and you can see how the color schemes shift across the movie and stuff, and it's, like, a really fun way to just kind of x-ray a movie.

472
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:34,344
A lot of this game was, like, what is all the cool shit I do as a cinephile?

473
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:37,527
How can we just trick the player into doing that without realizing it, right?

474
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:38,708
Because they just think it's a game mechanic.

475
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:56,211
The one thing we did, we were trying to be so authentic in everything we did, the one thing, and we were so torn about this because the aspect ratio of most gaming things is landscape, to sort all these clips

476
00:50:58,061 --> 00:51:01,644
It made sense that the film strip would be on its side.

477
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,547
Movie film, however, is vertical.

478
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:11,154
So technically, if this was real footage, the strips and the little holes would run vertically down.

479
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,476
We did briefly try that, and it just didn't work aesthetically.

480
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:20,582
So we were like, yeah, well, we know that we're breaking a rule here and that this is not real, but it's going to help everything in the long run.

481
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:23,025
So we felt bad about it, but we pushed forward.

482
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:29,873
And then the core kind of marquee mechanic of this video game, the match cut.

483
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:32,295
Let's see if we've got time.

484
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:34,857
This is such a good match cut.

485
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:38,921
This is from Peeping Tom, a movie about people dying on camera and what that means.

486
00:51:39,962 --> 00:51:41,503
Oh, look at that match cut.

487
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:45,986
Again, the match cut is something people are going to be able to grok.

488
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:47,548
It's this thing they'll understand.

489
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:48,729
It's exciting and fun.

490
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:52,312
Could that be the mechanic at the heart of our game?

491
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:59,725
Because we had been discussing how do we make a mechanic out of cutting in film, right?

492
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:02,507
How do we not have it be prosaic, like final cut?

493
00:52:02,547 --> 00:52:04,568
How do you have that be interesting and expressive?

494
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:11,752
So we had this idea of what if I could click on anything in any frame and have that then cut to something else?

495
00:52:11,952 --> 00:52:12,872
That's so expressive.

496
00:52:13,032 --> 00:52:13,853
You can click on anything.

497
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:16,714
You're deciding what's interesting, what's aesthetically interesting.

498
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:23,416
And then we get really interested in this idea of, well, to preserve the magic of the cut, you don't know where it's going to go.

499
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:26,677
The game is going to decide where this cut takes you.

500
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:31,819
And that was fascinating to me because it was introducing randomness into a pure narrative game.

501
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,280
And we know that randomness works in Diablo loot drops, all these other game mechanics.

502
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,562
But usually in narrative, you're looking for this causality and this very simple causality and logic to it.

503
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:43,362
So I was like, oh, this...

504
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:45,393
feels interesting, right?

505
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:49,435
It's a big risk, but let's explore what it feels like to have randomness in a story mechanic.

506
00:52:49,756 --> 00:52:50,916
And it felt like teleportation.

507
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:53,738
I'm obsessed with the idea of teleportation.

508
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:57,200
So many games are about moving faster, having superpowers, right?

509
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,003
And this idea of teleporting around a narrative feels like a superpower.

510
00:53:02,504 --> 00:53:04,945
I'm going to skip showing you the video, because you know how it works.

511
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:08,147
So how did we do it?

512
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:09,348
And this was the big challenge.

513
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,755
I'm going to go really fast now, sorry.

514
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:20,845
And then I love in-game, sometimes the solution is just to do a huge amount of work.

515
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,805
And that's what we did.

516
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:28,586
We said, well, is it possible to actually just track every single thing that we think is worth clicking on?

517
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:29,886
And it was.

518
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:39,368
We had a team of people in After Effects, myself and Natalie, would mark up, these are all the things that are in focus that should be clickable.

519
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:44,329
And then we had a team of people using tracking technology to track all these objects.

520
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:57,036
We then had the complexity of having to compress that information, which was gigabytes per scene in VFX software, into these simpler, lower polygon animations so that every single object is constantly being tracked.

521
00:53:57,556 --> 00:53:59,717
There were rules for how things overlapped and things that were interesting.

522
00:54:00,097 --> 00:54:04,560
And then we had this big lookup table that would tell the code there is an equivalence.

523
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,241
An apple and an orange could cut together.

524
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:10,823
Marissa Marcel playing Franny can cut to Marissa Marcel playing Maria.

525
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,785
And there is a ranking to it.

526
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:29,658
which I'll get to in one second but also we kind of did a lot of iteration on well how do you click we had a version where you you could just click at any point and it would do the match cut and we're like it doesn't feel sexy enough so then we were like well let's make it a mode let's have to enter the mode and then it becomes like

527
00:54:30,732 --> 00:54:30,792
at

528
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:46,899
I'm

529
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:17,380
We have all this information about thematically what's happening in scenes, what various elements mean, and it tries to choose a good point to jump to.

530
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,141
Maybe in the Q&A or outside we can talk more about the specifics of that.

531
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:31,743
But it tries to do clever things and it has this kind of heartbeat so it'll alternate between trying to connect things that are in proximity

532
00:55:32,298 --> 00:55:32,358
and

533
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:48,655
of logic to it, but it's not exposed to the player.

534
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:51,416
It's kind of doing this meaningful little dance.

535
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:53,817
It's like playing a kind of two-player party game, right?

536
00:55:54,337 --> 00:55:55,997
You play consequences.

537
00:55:56,057 --> 00:56:02,199
I draw a funny little picture, and for it to be fun, you have to meaningfully respond to what I've done, but I also want you to surprise me.

538
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:03,760
So this was kind of this interesting balance

539
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,142
And then we have secrets in the game.

540
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:07,443
There are some big secrets.

541
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,606
We wanted this thing to feel alive and feel haunted.

542
00:56:10,647 --> 00:56:23,862
So we talked about Orson Welles again, about the War of the Worlds, how he took radio, something people were so familiar with, and kind of took for granted, and then used that as a chance to actually surprise them and scare them and horrify them.

543
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:26,612
I keep mentioning Orson Welles.

544
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:30,975
The secret is we were trying to make the Citizen Kane of video games.

545
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:36,780
So we were explicitly like, let's just learn everything about Orson Welles and that will get us there.

546
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:41,584
We did lots of prototyping on this idea of hidden aspects to the footage.

547
00:56:42,105 --> 00:56:47,189
This idea, like I said, of rewinding being a way of accessing and resurrecting and discovering things.

548
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:54,180
And we knew it was going to work because we did tests with footage of me during the pandemic, just at home.

549
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:59,929
And it still frightened me, like when stuff would appear and pop out or fade in when I wasn't expecting it.

550
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:06,200
And the few things we kind of iterated on in this mechanic that are interesting.

551
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:18,686
Originally, we had a lot more of these kind of invisible cuts where a character would walk off screen, and then seamlessly we would transition to a different version of this scene.

552
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,467
And those were really cool, and we used quite a lot of those in the game.

553
00:57:21,807 --> 00:57:29,931
But then when we were actually implementing them, we discovered that there were places where if we actually created a jump cut, that should actually be kind of more scary and more horrific.

554
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,152
So we kind of started adding those in.

555
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:40,776
We have this concept of free-floating moments, so a lot of the supernatural and hidden scenes are linked to specific instances, right, and are very located in the moment.

556
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:47,919
But to facilitate keeping things spooky, there are a whole bunch of scenes that are free-floating that the code will attach to a clip.

557
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:53,361
If it feels like, oh, you haven't seen anything spooky for a while, here's a place we could insert something, it'll kind of fit those in.

558
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:54,422
So it's trying to keep things

559
00:57:55,302 --> 00:58:00,025
Interesting and then we played around a lot with what people now call the immortality noise like how do we add these?

560
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:12,232
Audio layers to hint on the menu on the grid and also within the footage to let you know There's something creepy and usually people kind of start hearing that and paying attention to it And then 30 minutes later is when they really like hang on okay?

561
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:14,330
and discover things.

562
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:19,855
But thanks Metroid Prime because we talked a lot about how Metroid Prime hints its secrets with audio.

563
00:58:21,116 --> 00:58:25,420
So now we've got two minutes to get into the spreadsheets which is why you're all here.

564
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:30,323
Everyone always asks me, like, how do you do this?

565
00:58:30,604 --> 00:58:31,424
How do you create these things?

566
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:35,707
And the answer is, like, lots of spreadsheets, lots of outlining.

567
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:44,792
Like, we started here with early plans of, like, the meta story of Marissa Marcelle, figuring out the years, what was happening to Marissa Marcelle across the different time periods.

568
00:58:45,892 --> 00:58:51,356
Then we came up with the three movies, and we outlined and scripted out the beats for all of these movies.

569
00:58:52,636 --> 00:59:07,968
Then we got a producer to look at it and give us a shoot order of how would they actually have shot this movie, what order would it have been shot in, and transposed that onto Marissa Marcel's story so we could find synergies and beats of like, oh if this thing happens to Marissa it would be cool if it happened whilst they were shooting this thing.

570
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:19,102
We took these outlines, put them back into order, gave them to some of the great screenwriters in history, like Barry Gifford, Alan Scott, Amelia Gray, who I've worked with before.

571
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:22,607
They went and wrote us the movies based on these outlines.

572
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,930
Whole, full, finished screenplays of movies.

573
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:28,288
brought those back, moved them around again.

574
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:31,229
I sat down and then I injected the making of stuff.

575
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,310
I was like, well, if they're shooting this scene, what is Marissa saying?

576
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:34,851
What's happening?

577
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:36,471
What's the kind of behind the scenes drama?

578
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:43,134
So we started to kind of work into these screenplays and create the story of Marissa that kind of weaved into them.

579
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:45,695
And we get to a point where we have

580
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:48,715
Okay, I'm nearly there.

581
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:57,983
We had this sheet which was called the Organizing Monster, which is a giant, this is like a teeny slice of it, giant spreadsheet that is like everything in the game.

582
00:59:58,703 --> 01:00:04,348
And then we used what I call a hologram method, which is how do these nonlinear things that you make sound make sense?

583
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:11,394
And the answer is like a hologram contains in every piece of it, like the information for the whole rest of the image, right?

584
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:36,049
So we look at every scene and we have all these columns and it's like every scene has to meaningfully answer a question about Marissa's story, tell us a piece of plot beat from the fictional movie, have a piece of craft from movie making, have some hint at the meta story, tell the story of what's going on with Arthur Fisher, what's happening with Robert Jones, have a piece of imagery that resonates with our themes, all three of our themes that we're tracking.

585
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:46,097
we just go through and make sure that every scene is doing everything so that then when the player starts combining them in different orders they can meaningfully make

586
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:55,489
progressions in theme or in story, if they're digging into a particular character or subset of the story, they can meaningfully put these things together.

587
01:00:55,589 --> 01:01:02,932
And as well, like having seen this thing, seeing this other scene, now I put the two things together and I get some kind of greater insight.

588
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:10,936
So this is just like, it's all just about lots and lots of work and like just going over it again and again and again, iterating these outlines and these story beats.

589
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,120
talk.

590
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:45,977
Any object that was in the scene would be underlined in the script, and then the code would import the entire script in fountain format, which is like this kind of markup version of screenwriting, and it would extract all of the images, characters, and we had this looping scene from Eyes Wide Shut, and it basically generated the entire game of Immortality based on the screenplay.

591
01:01:46,297 --> 01:01:59,869
So you could drop into a scene and it would just loop Tom Cruise taking his shoes off, and then it would beat out the dialogue, time out the dialogue based on the script, place all the action lines, and every time an object or a character came into the script, they'd get this little box that would appear on the screen.

592
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:05,394
So I could sit and play the whole game and click on these boxes and imagine

593
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,291
the finished game, right?

594
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:12,512
And this was never a useful prototype, but none of my prototypes are ever useful to give to normal human beings.

595
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:21,794
But there's enough there that I can answer questions around pacing, discoverability, feel, flow, and kind of get to the point where we feel good.

596
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:29,635
And we can also run like algorithmic tests that tell us how interlinked scenes are, how frequently certain things appear, and we can kind of tweak based on that.

597
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,836
So we basically just play this a lot,

598
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:45,785
We look at all the data we're extracting from the script and use that to balance the script and the format so that then we can go and shoot three entire movies and have a game that works at the end of it.

599
01:02:47,046 --> 01:02:47,407
What next?

600
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:47,867
This is it.

601
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:48,548
It's my final slide.

602
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:49,348
We're slightly over.

603
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:52,056
Are there any takeaways?

604
01:02:54,257 --> 01:02:55,918
If you want to make immortality, that's how we did it.

605
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:05,503
But I think genuinely this stuff that we're doing that I think is really interesting, like this idea of randomness and narrative, I think is a really interesting thing to explore.

606
01:03:07,104 --> 01:03:15,849
You know, we're so tied to narratives that are on train tracks and the idea of causality and systems that actually injecting a little bit of spice, I think is really interesting.

607
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,171
Thinking about exploring

608
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:19,672
narrative content

609
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:44,026
they will have very different experiences in their heads, but also in what they're doing, what they're clicking on, the flow through the game.

610
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:48,127
Like it's meaningful to them, it's meaningfully personable and kind of expressive.

611
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:54,209
And then just fundamentally, if I have one takeaway, it's like this idea of losing the container plot.

612
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:59,790
People ask me like, how do your games still tell a story that makes sense if it's all out of order?

613
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,911
And it's like, well, plot isn't interesting or relevant.

614
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:03,751
Like plot is

615
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:20,351
a requirement of a movie because people are sat in a chair and they need the toilet and they're getting tired and they're looking for 90 minutes or three hours if it's a Marvel movie looking at the screen and so plot is this thing that's like keeps their attention right what happens next what's next what's next what's next

616
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:23,055
We don't need that because we have all these other things.

617
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:25,598
We have the challenge and the exploration and the expressivity.

618
01:04:25,638 --> 01:04:26,960
So we have an engaged audience.

619
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:33,409
So these conventional ideas of plot and how you order and contain things are things that we can kind of move beyond.

620
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,194
That's something I would love to see more of.

621
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,461
Here we go, tail slates.

622
01:04:41,582 --> 01:04:47,846
That's what you do when you have like a messed up shot and you can't actually get the clapperboard in shot to start with because it's all complicated.

623
01:04:47,886 --> 01:04:52,329
So at the very end, camera assistant runs in and says, tail slates, and they have the thing upside down.

624
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:53,970
And it's really cool.

625
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:59,473
And it's never not cute to see the camera assistant run in excitedly and call tail slates.

626
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:01,335
It's the funnest thing.

627
01:05:02,635 --> 01:05:05,377
I guess we can go outside if anyone has any questions.

628
01:05:06,158 --> 01:05:07,959
Thank you for listening and putting up with me.
