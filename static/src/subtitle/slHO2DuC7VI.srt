1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,720
All right, so a couple of quick housekeeping notes.

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:11,803
Try and keep those cell phones quiet during the presentation.

3
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,285
And the second thing is, if you could please fill out

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,527
the survey that you get towards the end of the talk,

5
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:17,428
you'll get it via email.

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,169
Everybody would really appreciate it.

7
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,210
So thank you.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,712
To provide some context, what's my background?

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,534
So I've been working in games for a while.

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,496
I've shipped a variety of different games.

11
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:33,059
Like many people, start out in one role,

12
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,119
kind of transition to others.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,961
So starting with gameplay engineering,

14
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:39,204
and then doing design work, and then moving into a more

15
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:43,356
a broader design role that then encompassed more UX.

16
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:45,457
And so for the more recent titles

17
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:46,798
have been a lot more heavily involved

18
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:49,539
in that particular aspect of design.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,540
And today we're going to talk specifically

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,421
about the UX for Halo Wars 2.

21
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,604
So as a starting point, it's good to think

22
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,965
about what the constraints are for any given game

23
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:00,605
that you work on.

24
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,487
Halo Wars 2 is an RTS.

25
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:06,588
It's a sequel to a game that came out about 10 years ago.

26
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:11,025
And whenever we bring a new title to the Halo franchise,

27
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:13,387
we always have to think about what these kinds of constraints

28
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:13,927
are going to be.

29
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,130
So the first one of these here is expectations.

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,333
So 15 years of history for this franchise

31
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:24,776
makes for a lot of passionate fans, a lot of features

32
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:27,378
that have evolved over time, and making sure

33
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:29,740
that every game that we build delivers

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,182
on the expectation of those fans.

35
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:34,585
There's also our own internal team expectations, though,

36
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,747
which is how do we move the franchise forward?

37
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:39,209
What do we bring that's new, that's exciting,

38
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,630
that pushes the boundaries of modern UX design?

39
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,193
Another unique thing about Halo Wars 2

40
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:46,774
that's different from the original game

41
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,796
is that we wanted to take it to more than one platform.

42
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:54,480
So Halo Wars 1 was designed to be a console-specific RTS.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,542
And a lot of the UX was built with console in mind

44
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,204
to be a good experience for that particular platform.

45
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,343
Not only did we want to bring it to these two platforms,

46
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,366
we also wanted to enable the ability to cross-play

47
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:06,548
with these two platforms.

48
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,011
And there's a lot of considerations we had to make

49
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:12,916
in terms of how we modify what that core game is

50
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:14,558
and what the right experience for it is.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,780
Next one here is team.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,441
So there are a number of folks at 343

53
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,722
that have worked on the Halo titles, number of Halo titles.

54
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,882
But there's also new people that come on board.

55
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:27,283
And we also had the good fortune to partner

56
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,584
with Creative Assembly in the development of this title.

57
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:32,104
And that was a lot of learning for all of us

58
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:35,565
to work together, basically, on what our design process would

59
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:38,706
be together, and then how we continue to evolve

60
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,147
this franchise together, and a lot of great debate

61
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,668
around what the core pieces that franchise to carry forward are.

62
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,858
And finally, it's something that we all deal with,

63
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,719
but it's a pretty important consideration

64
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:50,680
in the way that we design anything,

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,642
which is just time is always a constraint.

66
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,244
And I used to think that once upon a time,

67
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:57,546
perhaps, you know, that there was a bad design

68
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,748
that was implemented and who knew what reason it was

69
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,129
in any given particular title.

70
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,866
And over time, I've come to appreciate that for a variety

71
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,888
of reasons, whether it's the amount of time that you may

72
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:09,890
spend working on a feature, spending too much time on it,

73
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,412
or not keeping in mind when the

74
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,413
project needs to be shipped.

75
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,235
This is a constraint that basically forces us, in some

76
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,776
cases, to make imperfect decisions.

77
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,275
So from these constraints, we also

78
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,416
think about what our UX vision pillars are

79
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,237
going to be for the game.

80
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:26,878
So for Halo Wars 2, there's several here

81
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:27,418
that we're going to cover.

82
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,900
And we're going to talk about how these vision pillars inform

83
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,441
the decisions we made around specific areas of building

84
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:32,901
this game.

85
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:37,363
So the first one is, how do we instill the feel of Halo

86
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:38,444
into the titles that we build?

87
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:41,885
And there's a lot of different components that go into this,

88
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:43,286
but a lot of it comes down to the fact

89
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,568
that we really want to highlight the things that people expect

90
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,709
out of the franchise, get them to feel

91
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,331
as they come into the game that it's a good experience,

92
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,312
that it's something familiar.

93
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:54,994
And Halo Wars 2 is no exception in that regard.

94
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,616
We want to build an RTS for everyone.

95
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,009
So RTS has been around for a long time.

96
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,771
And Halo Wars did a lot of work to bring in a new audience

97
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,532
of players that maybe were intimidated by the RTS before.

98
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:09,253
But even still, matches could last for a long time.

99
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:11,734
And we heard feedback from folks that basically they

100
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:12,735
wanted a way to get in.

101
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,235
They really wanted to learn how to play the game.

102
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,457
But they were intimidated by the economy or the base

103
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:19,978
building or just some of the other features of RTS.

104
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,879
So we wanted to bring a new mode, a new way to play this

105
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,680
game that would help people to come in and feel like they had

106
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,581
a good entry point.

107
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,790
The next one here is being approachable and deep.

108
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,592
And this specifically applies to the way

109
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,433
we thought about this new mode, which is our new Blitz mode,

110
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:36,933
basically.

111
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,775
And it's a new mode where it's a hybrid of a card strategy

112
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,176
game and the RTS genre.

113
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,817
It's played in five to seven minute chunks.

114
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,518
We wanted to make sure this appealed not just

115
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:50,120
to new casual players, but also to players that

116
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,581
would get into it for the long run

117
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,502
and play competitively, playing tournaments,

118
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:55,603
make sure that this particular mode had legs.

119
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:01,546
It's also expected that a given for any given Halo title that

120
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,407
we offer a great multiplayer experience.

121
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:06,689
And this is everything to do with how you join up with your

122
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,072
friends, how you match make, and then the options that are

123
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,633
offered to you when you play custom games, all the way to

124
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:15,235
the controls and the feel of the game from moment to moment.

125
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,637
And once again, it's something that we need to think about

126
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:19,598
for each of these games independently.

127
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,207
And the final point here is to be a platform showcase.

128
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:26,069
So now that we are on these two platforms, Xbox and PC,

129
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,831
we want to deliver an experience that feels great for folks

130
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,532
that are coming in from both the console side

131
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,013
and from the PC side.

132
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,997
So let's talk a little bit about what the Halo feel encompasses.

133
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,799
So when you look at Halo titles, it's

134
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,440
something that you want to feel from the moment

135
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,281
you launch the game.

136
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,862
It establishes the mood.

137
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:48,677
Creates a sense of wonder.

138
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,478
It brings you deeper into the universe.

139
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,200
It makes you curious about the franchise.

140
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,763
We offer you fantastic worlds, and we

141
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,604
want to make sure that all players feel like they're

142
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,465
taken on this journey from the moment they start

143
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,346
to each of the different areas of the game

144
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,187
that they might explore.

145
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,849
So as they go through the campaign,

146
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:08,470
they're starting to think about what story elements are there,

147
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,392
what the characters are, what options are available for them

148
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,833
to customize their multiplayer experience.

149
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,864
We want to bring forward a lot of these memorable characters

150
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,867
and the heroes and to let you wonder about them

151
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,509
and to think about them in how it relates to the story

152
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,451
and to get you to come back.

153
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:29,855
And to also think about how you can customize your experience

154
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,196
and bring yourself into these games.

155
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:36,811
And importantly, we've built up a lot of history here.

156
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,593
And we want to make sure that things feel familiar.

157
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:42,397
So we spend a lot of time going back and creating style

158
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,859
guides and flows that we can apply for each game.

159
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,022
And it's not always the same, necessarily, from game to

160
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:50,245
game, but the ideas remain and the consistency remains.

161
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,007
It's something that feels comfortable from the moment

162
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:53,008
you get in and you start playing.

163
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,822
So as it applies to Halo Wars 2,

164
00:06:56,902 --> 00:07:00,044
Halo Wars 2 is unique in that it's an RTS,

165
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,485
and so a lot of the game is played

166
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:03,286
from a fairly zoomed out perspective.

167
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,748
You don't necessarily get a close up view of these characters.

168
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,750
So one of the cool things that we really wanted to get

169
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,551
into that initial experience,

170
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,453
and Creative Assembly had spent a lot of time

171
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,474
building a lot of detail around these characters

172
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,075
and vehicles and units,

173
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,136
and you just don't get a good perspective on them

174
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,497
while you're fighting and playing the game.

175
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,079
So as you come into these menus for the first time,

176
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,461
you'll see these dioramas where the camera pans

177
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,361
around these characters.

178
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,442
It zooms in on them.

179
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,904
And it really gives you a good sense of what they look like.

180
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,605
And it makes you wonder about, OK, cool.

181
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,808
There's this deeper element to what's here, even though I

182
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:37,509
can't necessarily see it from the way that I'm playing the

183
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:37,970
game normally.

184
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:42,178
We also want to make you wonder about what's going on in the

185
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,040
campaign and what that experience feels like.

186
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,063
So when you switch over to this area of the game, again,

187
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,646
you're presented with the holotable of the Ark, which is

188
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,289
an important place where a lot of events for

189
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:54,410
Halo Wars 2 take place.

190
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,492
And once again, you'll see it from different angles.

191
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:57,292
It'll pan around.

192
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,636
It's an important unifying element throughout the

193
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,577
cinematics, because the characters will frequently

194
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:04,559
talk about how they're going to different places here and

195
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,140
what they're doing.

196
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,891
And by bringing this forward, we just create more of that sense of intrigue around what

197
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,934
the campaign has to offer.

198
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,160
And finally, we're delivering a new mode here with Blitz.

199
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,564
And this mode specifically, it's a card-based RTS hybrid.

200
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,607
And there's a lot of work that went into illustrating these

201
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,450
cards and making them feel very unique.

202
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:29,634
And when I first saw the screen, I was really excited

203
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:31,596
because I've played a lot of physical card games.

204
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,799
And I don't know if you've ever seen an uncut sheet of

205
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,600
cards, but it's a really cool thing to behold.

206
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,122
And these particular menus, as you get in,

207
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,245
you can basically see a lot of these illustrations put

208
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,907
together on posters that you pan between different sections

209
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:44,547
of that poster.

210
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,429
And it brings you into what it feels

211
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:48,030
like to have that card game there.

212
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,732
And it lets you know that it's a very distinct and unique area

213
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,193
of the game.

214
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,936
So let's talk a little bit about how we actually

215
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,798
went about creating that RTS for everyone,

216
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:59,639
and specifically with respect to the way

217
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,761
we iterated on the Blitz mode specifically.

218
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:05,255
So as I mentioned, it's a hybrid of a card game and RTS.

219
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,256
The matches are meant to be five to seven minutes long.

220
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,958
We want to make sure that there's a good focus on core

221
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:15,303
RTS combat and basically map control, fighting for

222
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:18,285
resources, but not having to deal with a lot of that early

223
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,747
game experience of how you build up your economy and

224
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,389
upgrade your tiers and knowing the tech tree and everything.

225
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,553
So early on, we wanted to establish some pillars

226
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,276
around what this mode would entail.

227
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:31,958
And we had some initial challenges

228
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,159
because we wanted to make sure that we

229
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,263
had the right controls, the right deck size, hand size.

230
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,127
Things played well on multiple platforms,

231
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,148
and it felt like a card game.

232
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,866
So an early version of this that we're looking at was being

233
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:48,067
able to deploy cards at the position of the cursor with

234
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,308
the directional pad, basically.

235
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:54,169
This is fast, but as you can see, the cards themselves,

236
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,510
they would have been small.

237
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,051
We've had different scales of this, but ultimately, they

238
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,632
didn't represent the same type of card throughout the

239
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:01,432
experience, right?

240
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,333
So it's just hard to see the details there.

241
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,313
The deployment was fast.

242
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,934
You don't really hold cards this way, so it didn't have

243
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:07,974
that card game feel.

244
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,335
And they took up a fair bit of space in the HUD.

245
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,203
So we started to think a little bit more about, OK, can we

246
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,765
basically take more elements of a traditional card game

247
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,427
and bring that in, and then maybe drop this down a bit in

248
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,330
the HUD, and maybe this would help us accomplish

249
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,930
more of our goals.

250
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,993
And so we did this basically card hand fan down the bottom.

251
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,154
You can see the cards are now bigger.

252
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:30,155
They're more legible.

253
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:32,497
Still not perfect, though, because you do have some

254
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:33,418
overlapping elements.

255
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,359
Selection's not entirely clear.

256
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,541
But we're starting to get a little bit closer into

257
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,823
something that feels like it fits in naturally with the way

258
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:40,403
the game plays.

259
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:45,922
And so for our final solution, we went with a four-card hand.

260
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:48,563
We laid them out horizontally, dropped them a bit down

261
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:49,043
in the HUD.

262
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,544
But all the core components of the cards, as you can see,

263
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:53,624
are fairly legible.

264
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:57,365
You can see the cost, the type, the name, and illustration.

265
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,906
And if you want to go deep and then deploy these cards,

266
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,247
get a little more information on them with just a click

267
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:05,187
of the mouse or a pull of the trigger,

268
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,128
you get the expanded card view.

269
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,649
And in here, you've got a very clear, large.

270
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,342
card and right your face there the selection elements are clear

271
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:20,366
and it feels natural feels like a card game it works well on PC and console

272
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,809
because it's just a couple button presses are a couple clicks away

273
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,293
and it felt like we had the right sort of the right look for we're going for

274
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:29,494
here

275
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:36,159
now thinking about this more though never wanted to be approachable for new

276
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,841
players but then also deep for players that want to play competitively

277
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,181
And we had a lot of assumptions coming in about what it meant

278
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,441
to be a card game.

279
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,803
So typically for a lot of card games, you've got fairly large

280
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,484
deck sizes, and you want to have all these really

281
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,965
interesting choices about what you can pull in and how you

282
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,426
can play those cards.

283
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,412
And when we start to think about this from the context of being

284
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:59,233
on console and having a deck editor, a deck view,

285
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,454
it starts to get fairly busy.

286
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:04,456
So ultimately, you've got some way

287
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:06,497
of representing your deck and the card library

288
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,377
on the same screen.

289
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,378
And you can move cards back and forth.

290
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,219
And there's variations on this for different console card

291
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:12,499
games.

292
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,401
But it's also something that is hard to keep in your head all the time, right?

293
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:19,363
If you look off to the sides, you're going to notice that, you know, you can't quite

294
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:20,563
see everything that's in your deck.

295
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:25,566
The duplicate, you know, the ways they're represented, it's, you know, not always obvious.

296
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,647
And then obviously you're only seeing a slice of your card library.

297
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,888
And on top of that, there's just a lot of buttons here.

298
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,070
So we changed our frame of reference.

299
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,053
We thought, well, what if we went to a model where the decks

300
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:40,256
themselves are only 12 cards, and the card could be

301
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,919
represented in its entirety on the screen in that deck view,

302
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,222
or the deck view that's there.

303
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:48,946
You basically can snapshot this, share it easily with

304
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:49,386
your friends.

305
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:55,285
you know, the way we get around the choices in terms of making sure that there's depth

306
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,127
in the choices is we only allow one of any given card in the deck.

307
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:02,310
And so you still have to make a lot of interesting choices around what type of units you bring,

308
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,054
the various costs that they bring, and how that shapes your deck.

309
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:11,518
And the leaders themselves add a twist to it because they have their own unique sort

310
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:13,700
of play styles that affect how you build these decks.

311
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:17,305
Now when we go to look at how we do deck editing, again,

312
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,006
it's a fairly similar presentation,

313
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,367
except this time now we've put the actual deck

314
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:22,328
on the left side of the screen.

315
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,550
We've put the rest of the library on the right.

316
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,783
And you can quickly and easily get your cards in and out

317
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,064
of your deck with a single button press or a single click.

318
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,324
One adds, one removes.

319
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,045
It feels pretty natural.

320
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,626
You can't obviously see your whole library at a time,

321
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,186
but you can page through it fairly quickly.

322
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,827
And it felt like we were able to solve a lot of these problems

323
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:42,208
just really by thinking about this in kind of a different way.

324
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,909
And there's still a good bit of deck variety,

325
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,270
and the leaders provide the variety,

326
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,170
and all those things work pretty well together.

327
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,084
So I think our next pillar it's really delivering on a great

328
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,666
multiplayer experience and this means many things right it

329
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,269
means how you're able to play with your friends and match

330
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,553
make what you can do for your custom games and then also how

331
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,236
we bring depth into the multiplayer experience and for

332
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,239
Halo Wars 2 specifically we wanted to go even deeper than

333
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:10,361
the original game in terms of how you differentiate your

334
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:10,702
armies.

335
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:12,003
So.

336
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,969
We had this notion that we wanted to bring in these leader command trees.

337
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:20,530
You know, something where if we play the same leader, for example, I may focus on faster

338
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,051
moving units that can capture points quickly and heal themselves.

339
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:31,033
And you may choose to focus more on, you know, long-range attacks, kind of AOEs, and a more

340
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,033
aggressive style of play.

341
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,511
And as we were building this out,

342
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,094
we felt like we were bringing in the depth.

343
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:39,996
But there was a concern that we had as a team,

344
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:41,717
and then also something that we wanted

345
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,159
to see through our beta, which is,

346
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,981
does this provide a bit too much of a jarring context

347
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,342
switch for a real-time strategy game?

348
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,103
Is there too heavy of a mental load for this?

349
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,885
And it came to be that we're pretty split amongst the team.

350
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,826
During the beta, the feedback pretty much

351
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:56,986
reinforced this notion.

352
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,127
And the way that you deploy these leader powers is in the

353
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:03,008
game, you basically pull the trigger and you get a radio

354
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,069
menu that allows you to actually activate these powers

355
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:08,130
and then target where they go off.

356
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,231
We wanted to figure out, could we potentially merge these two

357
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,091
concepts together?

358
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:15,272
As we started to think about changing it,

359
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,753
we started to think, OK, how can we

360
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:19,774
merge the depth of this command tree into this radial menu?

361
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,395
As you could see, in our initial pass,

362
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,276
there's a lot to explain here.

363
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:25,456
There's levels.

364
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:29,498
There's the differences between the lock state, unlock state,

365
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,779
how those powers change over time.

366
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,240
And there's a lot of things to parse here.

367
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,181
It's also something you don't get

368
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:40,683
a good sense of the larger meta level of what

369
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,343
your leader power state is.

370
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,854
And you have to basically walk the wheel in order to really

371
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:48,559
get a good sense of what exactly is happening.

372
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,426
So when we got to our final version, we did a bit more

373
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:53,308
work in terms of.

374
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,933
Pulling up those levels of those powers,

375
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,133
you can see the notches on the edge.

376
00:15:58,153 --> 00:16:00,234
They're a little subtle, but you can see at a glance

377
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,895
effectively what levels are locked,

378
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,956
what levels are unlocked, and where you've invested in.

379
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,857
The tree itself unlocks in quadrants,

380
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:10,357
so as you spend points, the next quadrant moves,

381
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,658
you move into the next quadrant, you can use powers there.

382
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,019
And we actually removed a bunch of the text here.

383
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,541
And the thought was that players would organically

384
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,043
discover, basically, what the differences of these powers

385
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:24,044
are as you play the game more, you read about it,

386
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:24,925
you learn strategies.

387
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,787
And it turned out to be the case that this ended up being

388
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,988
a fairly good trade-off in the sense that it was quick and

389
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:31,788
easy to access.

390
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:35,270
Again, you can get in here, open this menu, upgrade

391
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,291
powers, change them very quickly.

392
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,874
You lose some sense of that larger sense of progression,

393
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,936
but overall the speed and ease of use made these powers

394
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,458
really a core piece of the multiplayer experience.

395
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:49,800
And we do see a good variety in terms of how players use

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,402
these powers amongst their leaders throughout the game.

397
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:55,744
So this is something where we felt like some things were lost,

398
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,666
but we also gained some things, and ultimately this turned out

399
00:16:58,686 --> 00:16:59,747
to be a reasonably good solution.

400
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:03,816
Now, the last one I want to talk about here is being a

401
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,756
platform showcase.

402
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,579
So as I mentioned, we're trying to be a great Xbox title, be a

403
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,022
great PC title, and really satisfy people that are core

404
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,684
gamers in both of those platforms.

405
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:19,549
Now, in the original Halo Wars, one of the cool features

406
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,332
of how the leader powers were used is the fact that when you

407
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,393
were bringing these up, you would have this targeting

408
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,034
reticle come in.

409
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:30,779
And the screen dims, it goes into the scope view,

410
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,440
it feels very Halo, it looks almost like a sniper scope.

411
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,182
And it works really great on the controller.

412
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,764
So before we shipped Halo Wars 2,

413
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:41,645
we actually created Halo Wars Definitive Edition,

414
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,007
ported it to PC, and tried to bring over these powers

415
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,129
in a way that felt good for PC and mouse controls.

416
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,934
And it turned out these ended up being a lot harder to implement on the PC than we expected.

417
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:55,636
You can kind of think about it in some different ways.

418
00:17:55,716 --> 00:18:00,661
So for example, without the cursor here, your normal PC cursor, you get a little bit lost

419
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,822
in terms of what you're targeting.

420
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:06,467
It also never quite felt responsive enough even if we mapped it to the mouse in a way

421
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,488
that we thought made sense.

422
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,289
If we tried to leave the main PC cursor up,

423
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,390
then you'd have this double cursor thing going on.

424
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,351
And if we kind of got rid of the overlay,

425
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,312
then it just didn't really have that same level

426
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:18,753
of anticipation and excitement of deploying these powers.

427
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:21,354
So ultimately, for Halo Wars 2.

428
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,391
We moved to a model where the reticles are more friendly

429
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:26,392
for both platforms.

430
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,872
And they look great.

431
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,233
The powers themselves look fantastic once they're

432
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,374
deployed, a lot of cool effects and explosions.

433
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:37,075
It's hard to deny, though, that some of that anticipation

434
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,936
of using those powers and that transition,

435
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:41,076
it's definitely missing.

436
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:43,677
So it doesn't feel quite as exciting

437
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:45,878
for that initial part of the power deployment there.

438
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:49,039
But at the same time, the game runs cross-platform.

439
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,941
A lot of folks are enjoying it that way.

440
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,403
It feels fair because you have the same targeting mechanisms

441
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:56,046
for both games, both versions of the game.

442
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,169
And one of our main requests that we get from our community

443
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,650
is for more cross-play.

444
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,433
So at the end of the day, this is also another trade-off

445
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:05,395
where, well, it feels like something was lost.

446
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,336
We gain something else.

447
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,203
So as we think about the various takeaways from the game

448
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:16,251
and what this iterative process brought us,

449
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,116
here's a few things that we would probably take

450
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,279
from one game to another.

451
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,437
So the first one here is know your core, right.

452
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:25,718
And so for us, yes, we've got a lot of history

453
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,099
in terms of what the franchise is,

454
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:29,960
but how that applies to each game is a bit unique.

455
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,921
And it's important for us to make sure

456
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,563
that we're constantly reevaluating what that means,

457
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:38,004
updating our internal documentation and specs for that,

458
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,825
and really just thinking about how it applies

459
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:40,726
to that new title.

460
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:43,007
And how we take what we've learned

461
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,288
and apply it in new ways for new modes

462
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:46,308
and new ways to play the game.

463
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,472
As I mentioned, you know, again, with our assumptions

464
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,412
around the Blitz mode, it's really rethinking

465
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:53,253
our frame of reference.

466
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:56,874
So sometimes we might have a tendency as designers

467
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,015
to kind of spin on something for a long time

468
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:00,915
because we feel like there's a better solution

469
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:01,556
that's available.

470
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:05,037
And for us, this was a key piece of, again,

471
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,658
thinking about the deck sizes for Blitz,

472
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:08,538
where really just thinking about the deck size

473
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,259
in a different way and depth in a different way

474
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:12,340
and how we make those choices,

475
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,480
it simplified a lot of our design around

476
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,362
how we build out the UI for those pieces of that game.

477
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,127
And finally, embrace trade-offs.

478
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,908
So as I mentioned, we had to move from being a console

479
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,969
title to a multi-platform cross-play title.

480
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,591
And while it's true that we did lose some elements of what

481
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,652
would have been great to have for native implementation of

482
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,893
each of those platforms, our community continues to play

483
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,233
with each other on these different platforms.

484
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,014
They enjoy it.

485
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:41,114
Some of our best players are actually still on console

486
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,035
today, even in a PC console cross-play world.

487
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:47,797
And they continue to ask for more ways to play, more

488
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:48,877
multiplayer playlists.

489
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:52,039
So at the end of the day, while there are some tradeoffs

490
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,120
in terms of the aesthetic and the anticipation

491
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,301
of those powers and things like that,

492
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,883
those are probably things that the upside of it being

493
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,924
that we have this cross-play audience is something

494
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:03,125
we didn't anticipate in terms of the demand for it.

495
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,586
So that's been really great to see.

496
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,289
And that's it. So thank you very much.

497
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:11,751
And if you have questions, please feel free

498
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,151
to step up to a microphone.

499
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,393
If you want to ask me via e-mail, there you go.

500
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,635
And, um, yeah.

501
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,441
welcome what's there.

502
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,547
Please fill out your surveys as well.

503
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:21,929
Thank you.

504
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,643
Oh, someone's got a question.

505
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:57,923
Hi there.

506
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:58,643
Yes?

507
00:21:58,683 --> 00:21:58,984
Yeah.

508
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:00,304
Adrian here.

509
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:01,484
Thank you for the talk.

510
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:02,264
Really useful.

511
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:09,106
When do you know it's enough searching for a solution and it's time to embrace the tradeoff?

512
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:15,877
So the question was, yeah, when do you know you've iterated enough to basically get to your solution?

513
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,519
And again, that gets back to the knowing your core, right?

514
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,822
So I think at the end of the day, it's really just about, you know, for any given game, right?

515
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,583
What is it that's unique about it? What's your hook?

516
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:29,986
And then how does that apply to whatever particular thing that you're thinking about?

517
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,108
The other piece that, like I said, is just making sure that you're allocating enough

518
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:38,631
time down the road, because I think you always end up paying later for things that you end

519
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,992
up spending too much time earlier on.

520
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:44,415
So generally speaking, I think you're going to find your solutions faster for things that

521
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:44,935
are working.

522
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:49,598
And sometimes it's definitely worth it to pursue those things that will take you a while

523
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:50,118
to get to.

524
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,681
But really just knowing your core and knowing how you parse out that time.

525
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,582
Awesome.

526
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:56,822
Thank you.

527
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:57,323
Thank you.

528
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:01,716
So thanks for the talk.

529
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:05,478
And I was just curious, a lot of your solutions up there

530
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:08,439
went back and forth between making a trade-off

531
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,161
in the direction of gameplay or in the direction of UI.

532
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,902
And I was just wondering if you had any process for figuring

533
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:19,184
out, like, OK, so the solution here rests in changing the UI,

534
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,205
like with the cards, where they go.

535
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:22,986
But then there was also a piece of that that was like,

536
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:24,887
we're changing the hand size, which

537
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:26,348
has implications on gameplay.

538
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah, and that's why I said, like, I think it's,

539
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,701
that's why I kind of encourage the thinking

540
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,362
about the frame of reference, because like I said,

541
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:35,003
it's, you could have solved that problem

542
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,004
from a UI perspective, and what we're finding

543
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,325
is solving some of these challenges from a UI perspective

544
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,006
was taking a lot of cycles, and so,

545
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,147
that's where it came back to, you know,

546
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:45,188
does it really need to be this kind of gameplay?

547
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,169
Are there other models, other games, you know,

548
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,830
other platforms where maybe card games

549
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,251
have smaller hand sizes or smaller deck sizes

550
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,011
that we could look at?

551
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,374
So that's why it's great to just have a, you know,

552
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:56,695
kind of build up this pool of knowledge

553
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,476
of the different genres and then figure out,

554
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,158
can you pivot, you know, based on the gameplay or the UI?

555
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,020
So I don't know that there's a clear answer in any one case,

556
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,662
but I think it's really on a case by case basis.

557
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:07,784
And that just gets back to that point of like,

558
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,885
if you feel like you're spending a lot of time on something,

559
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:12,968
like try to look at it from a completely different angle.

560
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:14,749
Thank you. Yep.

561
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:19,473
Oh, hello.

562
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:22,110
There you go.

563
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,490
Great talk.

564
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,811
Thank you.

565
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:23,813
I have one question.

566
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:29,181
What was the biggest UX design challenge you encountered on Halo Wars 2 and or Blitz that

567
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:31,746
surprised you and you didn't think would be such a great challenge?

568
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,669
So the question is, what was the biggest UX challenge

569
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:38,331
we had that surprised us that we didn't anticipate?

570
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:42,274
To be honest, I think it was just really the multi-platform,

571
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:45,096
how it impacted the UX.

572
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:47,038
Because we really took for granted

573
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:51,040
how much of the original game was designed for console,

574
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,001
in ways that we didn't anticipate.

575
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,183
Like I said, the powers are a really good example of that.

576
00:24:54,923 --> 00:25:00,189
Because you figure normally for RTS you're coming in and it's going to be you know something that naturally fits to a PC experience

577
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,732
We found we had to do a lot of work actually to get the PC experience up to where

578
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:09,078
PC players played it as so I think that's probably that was probably one of the harder pieces was

579
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:11,640
Maintaining what was great about that experience on console

580
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,464
But then coming back to PC and making it appeal to players that play a lot there

581
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:17,186
Great. Thank you. Yeah

582
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:25,788
No, another one?

583
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:26,008
No, me.

584
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:26,168
Me?

585
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,090
Yeah.

586
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,817
So, going on with this PC and console, do you have any problems in balancing?

587
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:39,822
Do you have a moment that felt that it was easier on PC or it was easier on console?

588
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:44,747
Because you said about cross-play, so it's like naturally you want to have it balanced.

589
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:44,847
Yeah.

590
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:44,947
Yeah.

591
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:45,047
Yeah.

592
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:45,147
Yeah.

593
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:45,247
Yeah.

594
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:45,347
Yeah.

595
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:45,448
Yeah.

596
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:45,608
Yeah.

597
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:45,708
Yeah.

598
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:46,949
Yeah, it's a good question.

599
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,969
So the question is, how is balance affected

600
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:52,191
by basically being on PC and Xbox and enabling cross-play?

601
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:54,551
And certainly, I think there are certain aspects of the game

602
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:58,553
that we saw early on in play testing where just for actions

603
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:01,654
per minute, PC players could have some advantages.

604
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:04,575
As I mentioned, though, we look at our balance data

605
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:05,315
across the game.

606
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,196
And still, I think, actually, a chunk of our best players

607
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,296
still play on console.

608
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,877
And I think a lot of that just comes down

609
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:11,937
to the core gameplay.

610
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:17,174
It doesn't require maybe the same amount of actions as,

611
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:21,058
you know, a PC game, RTS, with much larger army sizes

612
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,660
or a lot more micromanagement.

613
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,942
So there's a lot of aspects of the gameplay

614
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:27,745
with the way the units work and their powers that balances

615
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:32,249
that out because it's more about timing and positioning

616
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,552
and, you know, other things that you can control reasonably well

617
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,493
on both console and PC.

618
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,739
What was the size of your UX team on the project?

619
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:42,940
Like one designer, two?

620
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,061
That's such a hard question to answer,

621
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,103
because as I mentioned, part of the point of what

622
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,163
I was explaining with my background,

623
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:51,905
like every time I worked on UX for a game, that UX team

624
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,766
has been a very different kind of thing.

625
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,048
And it's typically a team of specialists.

626
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,449
And if I were to really think about it,

627
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,670
like there's a lot of folks within 343

628
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,171
and a lot of folks in the creative assembly

629
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:04,593
that are specialists in different areas.

630
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,915
So like if I had to put a number on it, I, you know.

631
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,140
I don't know, maybe 15, 20 people, I guess, roughly.

632
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,421
But again, it's a hard question to answer

633
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:17,482
because I probably don't even appreciate, in some ways,

634
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,303
the contributions that some people

635
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:20,304
would have made to what that is.

636
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,104
It's not a traditional UX structure.

637
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:23,905
And I don't think any of the projects we work on

638
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:24,946
really are in that sense.

639
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:26,847
But it's really just bringing in a bunch

640
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,908
of these different subject matter experts.

641
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:33,970
Good?

642
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,610
OK.

643
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:36,291
Thank you.
