00:00:01,098 --> 00:00:06,962
Hey, I'm Steve Lee and back in 2017 I did a GDC talk about the idea of holistic level

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:10,305
design after I finished working on Dishonored 2 at Arkane Studios.

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:15,849
Cut to today 5 years later and I thought I would make an updated, condensed video version

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:16,730
for you to watch here.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,733
It's half an hour long and includes a lot of examples from my work on Dishonored 2,

6
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:25,477
but I hope that it feels relevant beyond immersive sims and beyond level design, because as you'll

7
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:28,519
see, I think a lot of this is pretty fundamental to game design in general.

8
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,672
So what do I mean by holistic level design?

9
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:37,795
The holistic thing is just about not focusing on one part of something or on the parts in isolation,

10
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,156
but thinking about how everything fits together.

11
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:44,697
This has always struck me as really fundamental to level design because when you make levels,

12
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,599
you're crafting an experience out of the culmination of the entire team's work.

13
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,666
For example, just in this little clip of the Dishonored 2 mission that I worked on,

14
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:58,731
you can see layout design and level scripting, but also UI elements, mechanics and systems design,

15
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:04,895
environment art, animation and mocap, story ideas and dialogue, basically everything.

16
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:09,259
Even if most of these features and content are made by other people in the team,

17
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,722
as level designers it's our job to understand how we can use all these things together

18
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:16,144
to make a cohesive and engaging experience.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,825
With that in mind, something that really resonated with me and influenced this talk was a section of this book,

20
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,606
101 Things I Learned at Architectural School.

21
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:32,852
It talked about the idea that beauty is due more to harmonious relationships among the elements of a composition than to the elements themselves.

22
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:39,498
And as it says at the end, it's the dialogue of the pieces, not the pieces themselves, that creates aesthetic success.

23
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:45,101
Now you might be thinking, well that sounds very clever and fancy, but what does it actually

24
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,464
mean when we apply it to games and level design?

25
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:52,064
To me, these are the three elements that we usually talk about when discussing games.

26
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,706
Gameplay, presentation and story.

27
00:01:55,106 --> 00:02:00,108
You know, we talk about whether the gameplay is fun, or the graphics are nice, or the story is good.

28
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,190
But what I'm talking about isn't really about any of those things in isolation.

29
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,193
Instead, it's about a bunch of new concepts that emerge from the relationships between these things.

30
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:13,075
To explain what I mean here, between gameplay and presentation

31
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,876
emerge these ideas of affordances and intentionality.

32
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:20,358
And between presentation and story emerges this idea of world building.

33
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:25,519
And finally, between gameplay and story emerges this idea of interactive narrative.

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,141
So this is what the talk is about, and this has been a very long intro. So let's get stuck in.

35
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,062
So first up is affordances and intentionality.

36
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:39,063
Two concepts which emerge from this relationship between the gameplay and the way we present things.

37
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,485
Affordances is a term that is generally considered to come from the world of industrial design.

38
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:47,915
A great book to read about it is this one, The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman.

39
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:51,697
And the classic example of affordances in action is the design of door handles.

40
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,078
So here's a quick explanation of what they're about.

41
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:59,040
Here you can see two doors, where the one on the left should be pushed, and the one on the right should be pulled.

42
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:04,123
And the problem here is that the handles for both of these doors look the same, and as if they should both be pulled.

43
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:09,985
We've all at some point in our lives approached a door like the one on the left, and intuitively pulled it and looked like an idiot.

44
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:16,166
Here we can say the presentation or the signifiers of these affordances are badly designed and misleading.

45
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:25,530
By contrast, here's a much better set of door handles where the shape of the push panel on the left clearly affords being pushed, in a way that contrasts with the one that should be pulled.

46
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:34,874
And in this case the affordances are so clear and strong that you could actually remove the text from these door handles and use them in any country and people would just intuitively use them correctly.

47
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:41,579
So it's an industrial designer's job to present affordances clearly, and communicate how things work intuitively.

48
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,761
In other words, make sure that form conveys function.

49
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:49,184
Doing this is a crucial part of designing anything that is used by people.

50
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,526
And of course this includes games and levels.

51
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,829
And with something like a Dishonored mission, there are loads of different layers of things to think about.

52
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,112
So here are a few examples from the mission that I worked on, which was the Dust District.

53
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:04,246
The key concept for this mission was that there are two factions and two leaders.

54
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,387
The player needs to unlock something known as the Jindosh Lock

55
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,907
to access the building that the next level takes place in.

56
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,388
They've been told that if they help either of the factions in the area

57
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:17,109
then the leader of that faction will give them the information they need to unlock it.

58
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,570
So even more explicitly than a typical Dishonored mission

59
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,570
this one was about making a choice.

60
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,531
And one of the first things we talked about was reflecting this in the overall layout

61
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,292
and presenting the two factions at a very clear junction.

62
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,092
Hopefully this not only makes it very clear that this is a big choice to make,

63
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:36,873
but we also hope that it allows the players to look at the layout from this perspective

64
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,995
and visualise and intuitively understand how different this mission can be based on that choice.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,001
One of our main opportunities to explain the level to players was the briefing with Megan near the start.

66
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,263
We had a lot of meetings about exactly what Megan would tell you in this discussion

67
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:56,224
and exactly how we phrased the objective updates that are triggered after the discussion.

68
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:01,046
Because ultimately it's quite a complex mission with a lot of stuff that we could explain to players.

69
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:04,427
But A, we don't really have time unless we make the briefing really long.

70
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:11,170
And B, we don't want to explain so much about the level that we spoil the genuine experience of exploration and discovery.

71
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,655
So we were really deliberate about what we make clear to the player, what we keep a total secret and everything in between.

72
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:22,680
The critical information was this choice between the factions that makes this mission unique

73
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,003
and the fact that this choice will fictionally affect Kanaka and the endings of the game.

74
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:30,547
Something we wanted to tell the player but be very vague about

75
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,390
was that there are ways to progress to the next level without helping either faction

76
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,234
and consequently the objective update that you get after this chat looks like this.

77
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:42,860
We tell players that they can either deliver one leader to the other, as Megan suggests,

78
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,562
or they can find another way.

79
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:49,667
This provided the right balance between all players understanding what this mission is fundamentally about,

80
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:53,771
while also telling more discerning players that there's a lot more to find in this mission

81
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,154
if they take the time to explore and experiment.

82
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,583
And finally, there was a huge thing that we didn't want to tell players about at all.

83
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:05,744
And this is that the Jindosh lock, which is the contraption that players have to unlock to progress to the next level,

84
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:09,245
is actually a very hard logic puzzle that they can solve on their own.

85
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:15,086
And if they do this, they can avoid interacting with either of the two factions, and basically skip the entire mission.

86
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:19,527
This is because it was something that we only wanted a few of our players to actually do,

87
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,907
but we wanted lots of players to discover on their own that it was possible,

88
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:26,108
and then for it to be super satisfying for anyone who actually does it.

89
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:31,921
So on a high level, the overall layout for the mission and the way we discuss the objectives

90
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:36,163
in the briefing play a big part in teaching the player what they can do in this level

91
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,244
and why it's interesting.

92
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:42,687
Teaching players with clarity and consistency is a really fundamental skill as a level or

93
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:43,308
game designer.

94
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,370
Because whatever kind of game you're making, the player always needs a certain level of

95
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,633
understanding in order to engage with the interesting challenges or immerse themselves

96
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,174
in the intended experience that you're trying to create.

97
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:59,540
And the reason I'm talking about informing players and presenting your affordances in the right way

98
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,225
is because this is how you enable the other concept that I mentioned, which is player intentionality.

99
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:08,950
This is a concept that Arkane and all of the old school developers of Immersive Sims

100
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,474
consider to be a fundamental and essential part of game and level design.

101
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:17,082
It goes all the way back to Doug Church talking about it in his seminal game design essay

102
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:22,452
Formal Abstract Design Tools back in 1999, a couple of years after Janet Murray discussed

103
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:26,399
it in the context of interactive narrative in her book Hamlet on the Holodeck.

104
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:31,159
There's probably loads of fancier definitions that you can google, but my version is that

105
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,545
acting with intentionality is about making conscious choices with specific goals and

106
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,566
expectations in mind.

107
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:41,252
And this might sound super basic, like something we can take for granted that players are naturally

108
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:44,296
doing all the time when they play a game, but it's often not the case.

109
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:50,258
Here are some examples of weak player intentionality that we probably all experience at some point when playing games.

110
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:55,541
The first one is being lost, or trying to find something to do, or trying to figure out what's going on.

111
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:59,003
If we ever get to a point where we're just kind of wandering around aimlessly,

112
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:02,785
then obviously we're not really acting with a very strong sense of intentionality.

113
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,364
Another example is doing something without knowing why you're doing it,

114
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:09,385
and only because maybe the game's UI has told you to do it,

115
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,806
or because it seems like the only thing you can do,

116
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:16,688
or maybe you're just doing something because you think it's what the designer wants you to do to progress through the level.

117
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:19,609
Or maybe it's that thing where you find a lever in a game,

118
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,750
and you pull the lever just because you know that you're playing a video game

119
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,891
and you're always supposed to pull levers in video games.

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,382
In these cases, while it could kind of be argued that the player is acting with some sense of intentionality,

121
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:34,823
they're clearly not engaged in the narrative or the fantasy of the game, which is what we want.

122
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:40,144
And finally, another example is when we're reacting to something in a kind of twitchy, impulsive way,

123
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,325
in real time, to a sudden surprise.

124
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:46,126
Like when a monster jumps out at you from behind a door you've just opened, for example.

125
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:50,387
This ends up being more of an instinctive response and less of an intentional choice,

126
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,488
so it doesn't really count as intentionality.

127
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:58,010
This concept of player intentionality is at the heart of all immersive sim gameplay, and

128
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,391
how level design and system design is approached.

129
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,872
To us, intentional play is kind of the whole point.

130
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:08,794
This is why in all of Arkane's games, whether it's Dishonored or Prey, Arx Fatalis or Deathloop,

131
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,916
the player is given a very diverse and orthogonal set of powers and abilities, which individually

132
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:18,218
present very simple and clear opportunities to the player, but that can also be used in

133
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,060
combination with each other to solve problems in a near infinite number of ways.

134
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:26,685
The clear and consistent low level affordances that these powers provide

135
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,506
allow the player to come up with their own plan for how they're going to deal with a situation

136
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,526
and constantly act with intentionality

137
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:35,827
rather than simply doing things because the game seems to tell them to.

138
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:40,408
This concept of intentionality is so important at Arkane that as a level designer

139
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,629
if you suggest a gameplay challenge or some kind of optional puzzle or anything like that

140
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,250
that at some point seems to inherently lack player intentionality

141
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,171
then that will be pointed out as a problem.

142
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,745
Forcing players to do things without understanding why they're doing them is generally considered bad design.

143
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:02,092
To break the concept down a little, here are four things that I think players need in order to act with intentionality.

144
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,436
First of all is the presentation of choice and agency.

145
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,647
The second is motivation and having goals in mind.

146
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:10,388
The third is information.

147
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,890
The information to understand the situation they're in

148
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,912
and have a sense of the possibilities faced and what they can do.

149
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,475
And finally, players need time to process that information

150
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,278
so that they aren't rushed into acting without thinking first.

151
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:27,802
And with those four things in mind, here are some key ways to facilitate intentional play.

152
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,095
The first thing is that it really helps if you present the player with higher level and

153
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:36,902
longer term goals, instead of just drip feeding them lower level tasks like look over here,

154
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,226
walk in that room, press this button, now do this.

155
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:44,632
It's way cooler to give them a higher level objective which they can find their own solution

156
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:44,772
to.

157
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:48,258
And of course, this is fundamental to how Dishonored always works.

158
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,724
The textbook Dishonored mission is that you're on one side of the map, and somewhere on the

159
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,786
other side of the map is someone you have to deal with.

160
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:59,071
The game doesn't tell you how to do it, and it's up to you to explore and make your own

161
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:02,355
unique journey towards that goal, and resolve things how you choose.

162
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:08,020
The second thing is to have consistent, systemic gameplay mechanics that combine in interesting ways.

163
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:17,827
The low-level consistency of how things work is crucial here, because it enables players to plan how actions and mechanics can be combined to achieve the higher-level goals that have been given.

164
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:22,730
And finally is this idea of player-driven pacing and player-initiated action.

165
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:31,336
This relates to the idea that players need time to observe and process the information about their situation, then formulate a plan before acting with intentionality.

166
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:36,276
If it helps, we can think of this process as a 4-step gameplay cycle that the player

167
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:38,037
continuously goes through as they play.

168
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:42,418
If we start at the top with observing, the player is taking in information about their

169
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,719
situation and considering that information in relation to their goals and motivations

170
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,719
to form a plan.

171
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,920
Then they execute that plan.

172
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,621
And assuming the game takes place in real time, there's often a fourth step, where

173
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,762
they react to any immediate consequences to the execution of the plan.

174
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,883
And then they go back to observing, and doing this over and over again.

175
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,805
Stealth gameplay is particularly good at emphasising this loop.

176
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:08,247
It's built into stealth games that the player starts in a hidden state

177
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,689
where they have time to think and explore and analyse the situation

178
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,250
and then formulate an intention before acting.

179
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,512
Sometimes their actions lead them to being revealed and spotted

180
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,793
in which case they have to start thinking and responding in a more dynamic way

181
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,835
in order to return to the stealth state and start observing and exploring again.

182
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,883
In the case of Dishonored, the combination of verticality in the level layouts and the

183
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:34,406
game's mechanics making them very mobile empowers players to reach lots of higher vantage

184
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:38,948
points and hiding places, and these give them more time and a better perspective for their

185
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,389
observation and planning phases.

186
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,672
Having said all this, I really want to stress that you can design intentional play into

187
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:46,473
any kind of game.

188
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:50,795
It's not about what you're designing, but how you design it, to allow and encourage

189
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,496
players to engage with the game in an intentional way.

190
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:59,653
Another thing about intentionality is that I think it affects the way players perceive linearity.

191
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:03,779
In level design, I would generally say that if linearity feels bad,

192
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,567
then at least part of the reason is often because the intentionality is lacking or a little weak.

193
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:12,437
If you've seen any of my videos, you'll know that I'm a big fan of Half-Life 2.

194
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:15,220
And one of the things that people often praised it for

195
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,646
was this idea that it does a really good job of feeling a lot less linear than it really is.

196
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,970
Now, I think there's a lot of reasons for this, and I'm not going to go into them all,

197
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,312
but intentionality is definitely a big one.

198
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,573
When you look at that game, it's clear that Valve playtested their levels so much,

199
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:34,215
and iterated on the level design, and the scripting, and their presentation of affordances so much,

200
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:38,358
that in general, they've done a really good job of aligning what the player wants to do,

201
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:39,918
with the thing that they have to do.

202
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,701
This means that, between the well-designed situations and the well-told story,

203
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:46,882
players are actually engaged in what they're doing.

204
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,843
And even though the game is pretty linear,

205
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,825
it never really feels like you're doing things without knowing why,

206
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,826
or just because the game's UI told you to.

207
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:59,682
In effect, the game's UI doesn't even have objectives or task updates, and it never explicitly tells you what to do.

208
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:04,307
It communicates the player's goals naturally and biologically through the story's characters,

209
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:09,033
the situations you'll get into, and the consistent affordances of the gameplay objects in the world.

210
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:14,159
To this day, I still think it's a great example of this stuff, with a lot to learn from if you go back and play it.

211
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:19,567
And speaking of great Valve games, let's talk about Portal, which is even more linear than Half-Life 2,

212
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,629
despite very few people complaining about it being linear.

213
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,831
Again, I think the intentionality thing is a big part of this,

214
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,214
because even though there's usually only one solution to progress, being a puzzle game and all,

215
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:35,577
the player is always given the information, the time and the freedom to experiment with intentionality.

216
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:40,500
So regardless of the linearity, Portal feels like a genuinely player-driven experience,

217
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,001
where the player always has a sense of what they're trying to do.

218
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,180
Finally, a fun thing that sprung to mind when I was writing this talk were the parallels

219
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,843
between what I'm talking about with intentionality and some of the ideas in the movie Inception.

220
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:57,725
Because as a level designer, particularly if your game is quite linear, you're trying

221
00:14:57,745 --> 00:15:01,968
to design and present situations in such a way that without holding their hand and leading

222
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:05,489
them through it, players will naturally have the kind of experience that you intend.

223
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,612
But you also need to craft it in such a way that they discover things naturally,

224
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,253
so that when they reach the conclusions that you want them to,

225
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:15,796
they'll feel like it was their own idea and their own personal experience.

226
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:20,519
Because just like in the film, if they make these choices and reach these conclusions on their own,

227
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:23,801
then the ideas and the feelings will resonate with them much more deeply.

228
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,203
So if you can get the immersion and the intentionality right,

229
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,744
I think linearity often stops being a problem.

230
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:33,727
Whereas if it's not quite right, players can feel it and they pick up on it.

231
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,564
They become less engaged and their emotion is broken,

232
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:40,248
when it starts to just feel like the designer is making you jump through a series of hoops,

233
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,650
and it doesn't feel like an authentic experience.

234
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:47,454
Anyway, fanboying over Christopher Nolan films aside,

235
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,936
the point here is that whatever kind of game you're making,

236
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:52,279
and however linear or non-linear it is,

237
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:57,443
this concept of intentionality is a fundamental thing for us to understand as level and game designers.

238
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:03,859
The second big topic of this talk emerges from the relationship between the way we present

239
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,862
things and the story, and it's this idea of worldbuilding.

240
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,888
I'm really into games like Half-Life, Bioshock and Dishonored, and these are all games that

241
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:14,991
are praised for a very rich sense of place and their worldbuilding.

242
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:20,116
A lot of this is art direction stuff and high level story stuff, but as a level designer

243
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,218
you can often also contribute a lot to this too.

244
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,590
What I'm going to talk about here relates to a set of three goals for worldbuilding,

245
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,131
which is to create a world that feels unique, cohesive and meaningful.

246
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,912
And with those goals in mind, here are a few tips.

247
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,513
Tip number one is that worldbuilding needs to be specific.

248
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:40,794
I mean this both in terms of being detailed in the ideas that you're presenting and not

249
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,836
just painting with a really broad brush with genre and setting things in the future and

250
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:45,336
stuff like that.

251
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,120
And also that your ideas should be really specific to the world of your game,

252
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:53,311
because it's the specificity that will help your game stand out and resonate with people.

253
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,731
But I'm not saying that everything you do needs to be super unique and original.

254
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,413
In an interview I read after we shipped Dishonored 2,

255
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,236
our creative director Harvey Smith used Kieran Jindosh as an example

256
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:07,799
of a character who was a pretty well used archetype in this kind of game.

257
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,921
Basically a crazy, evil, genius scientist guy.

258
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,564
But by layering details and specificity onto this archetype,

259
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:18,327
the character turned from someone who could easily have felt like a bit of a cliché

260
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:22,130
into someone who feels unique and helps develop the unique world of Dishonored 2.

261
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:27,798
To run through a few examples of these details, our crazy evil scientist guy has a pretty

262
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,498
distinctive look.

263
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,563
He kinda looks like a love child of Nikola Tesla and Prince, which reflects both his

264
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:36,045
impressive intellect and his eccentric personality.

265
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:40,450
There's a little story and visual detail about how he lost his finger and thumb in

266
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,974
an industrial accident, and in its place he's invented a bionic thumb that he can smoke

267
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:45,474
like a pipe.

268
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:49,220
And when he's tasked with securing an important building in the Dust District,

269
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,181
he does this using a super obscure puzzle that he's invented, the Jindosh Lock,

270
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,342
literally locking people out based on a kind of intelligence test.

271
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,664
Not to mention of course that he lives in the Clockwork Mansion,

272
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:04,145
a giant transforming building that doubles up as a museum for his own creations and genius.

273
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,367
This building, and the entire level that takes place in it,

274
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:11,728
reflects and develops his character, and his contribution to the world of Karnaca and Dishonored.

275
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,778
Now, some of the details I talked about might seem trivial on their own, like his bionic

276
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:17,680
thumb for example.

277
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,747
But altogether they add enough specificity to the character to help him stop feeling

278
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:26,014
like just a cliché or a trope or whatever, and become unique enough to contribute to

279
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:26,655
the worldbuilding.

280
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:33,808
With this kind of thing in mind, I tried to populate the Dust District with scenes that are not only specific to the Dishonored universe,

281
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:37,869
but also specific to this particular district, which has its own unique story.

282
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,370
To explain quickly, on the left is a scene set inside the Black Market,

283
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,111
which is a shop where you can go in and talk to someone and spend your money on useful items and things.

284
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,532
I didn't want it to just be this purely functional gameplay thing,

285
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:54,853
so I added this scene where Howlers, who are like the Mafia-style faction of the game,

286
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,293
are harassing the shopkeeper for protection money.

287
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,247
They're claiming that they're protecting them from the overseers,

288
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,569
who everybody knows would take issue with the fact that they're selling magical stuff

289
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,530
like bone charms and runes in their shop.

290
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,351
So firstly, instead of this shop just being another gameplay thing,

291
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:14,314
I created this narrative scene to fictionally integrate it into the specific world of this district.

292
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,836
Secondly, I used this idea of a gang pressuring a shopkeeper into giving them money,

293
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:22,718
which is quite a textbook mafia-style thing to do in this kind of world,

294
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:27,460
but I made sure to put a twist on it that is specific to the fiction of this game and this level.

295
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:33,549
Now onto the scene in the middle, where overseers are executing civilians for breaking their

296
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,553
religious principles, and doing things that are generally considered impure and forbidden.

297
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:42,758
Even more than the first scene, this clearly invites the player to intervene and interact

298
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,861
with the scene, instead of just watching it, which I'll talk more about later.

299
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:53,034
The scene is also used as a useful opportunity for the Overseers to actually read out their ideology to the people in the lineup and to the player,

300
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:56,977
which helps to flesh them out as affection and give the player an opinion about them,

301
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,539
which is important to the choice that they're making in this mission.

302
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:06,183
And on the right, there's a scene inside the Overseer outpost where an Overseer is mercy-killing a friend, another Overseer,

303
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,845
after he was mortally wounded in a fight with Howlers.

304
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,512
Through the way that it's done and the way they talk about it, the idea was to show a

305
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:17,834
particular kind of discipline and conviction that characterises the way the Overseers think.

306
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:22,957
It also shows the Overseers in a more sympathetic light, which is unusual and I thought would

307
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:27,139
be an interesting thing to do when the player is presumably on the way to assassinate their

308
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:27,439
leader.

309
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,121
So as I've said, all of these scenes are supposed to convey information that is specific

310
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:36,684
to these factions in this district and in this game, and in general I think it's important

311
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,845
for worldbuilding to be as specific as we can make it.

312
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:44,040
Point number two about world building is simply to try and think of ways to do it with everything you do.

313
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:48,624
Try to be conscious of when you're just designing things on a kind of creative autopilot,

314
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:52,287
and you're just following the formula of how you think this kind of thing is usually done.

315
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:57,951
Try to find ways to make every aspect of your level complement what the world and the story of your game is about.

316
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:05,999
One little example of this in the Dust District is that I knew I wanted somewhere in the Overseer HQ where the player could find some really juicy loot.

317
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,860
And in Dishonored, this kind of valuable loot is often magical stuff.

318
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,401
The fictional backdrop of the level is that Overseers are moving into this area and encroaching on Howler territory, and they're totally against magical stuff.

319
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:23,863
So I could make sense of the Overseers having magical stuff in their HQ by showing that they confiscated it from the locals in the area.

320
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,746
On top of this, I put this stuff in a small room behind a locked door,

321
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,108
and I gave the key to an overseer who is sleeping in a room nearby.

322
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,252
So there's a little gameplay idea that connects to a little narrative idea,

323
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:37,594
and the player is naturally flowing between the two.

324
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:44,579
My third tip for worldbuilding is that it's generally good if your worldbuilding says things about the people in that world.

325
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,726
This is because worldbuilding is a form of storytelling, and stories are basically always about us as people and human ideas in general.

326
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:57,091
In film, a great example of this is Children of Men, which I really recommend if you haven't seen it.

327
00:21:57,712 --> 00:22:01,253
In this film, the world building is always very clearly about us as people

328
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,234
and what would become of us in a world where hope is fading away.

329
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,755
In practically every shot of this film,

330
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:11,958
the background and the mise-en-scene is speaking to us about how this loss of hope would change our society.

331
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,679
For example, how it would change the role of police

332
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,660
and people's political values like attitudes to immigrants

333
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,541
and even our attitude to suicide.

334
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:25,469
In games, the classic example is Bioshock, where every part of its world is contributing

335
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:29,890
to a vision of a crumbling, dysfunctional society founded upon relentlessly pursuing

336
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,271
progress inspired by the objectivist theories of Ayn Rand.

337
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,932
So what kind of ideas define the world of Dishonored?

338
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:42,193
For me it's about class and power relationships and privilege and corruption, and the idea

339
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:46,714
that everybody, depending on their place in society, is either screwing someone over or

340
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,135
being screwed over by somebody else.

341
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,333
And of course, it's the lower class citizens who get screwed the most.

342
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:57,135
The Dust District is generally a lower class area, a mining district, and as a central

343
00:22:57,195 --> 00:23:02,297
architectural feature in the level, we created a very bespoke wooden raised street, a kind

344
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:06,218
of shelter that people have built in response to the dust storms and the environmental problems

345
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,679
that have been caused by the Duke.

346
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:13,118
It represents how the people here are figuratively, but also literally, being pushed underground

347
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:17,020
by the problems caused by the people in power, and also that they're trapped in the middle

348
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,441
of an ideological fight between the Howler and the Overseer factions.

349
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,483
This is reflected in the way that the street is placed in the middle of the map between

350
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,243
the two HQs.

351
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:30,125
So beyond just being visually interesting, we designed it to be a symbol of the story

352
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:34,266
and the power relationship of this district and its people, supporting the broader themes

353
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,526
and the tone of the Dishonored universe in general.

354
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:40,367
This idea that people in society are victims of the people above them.

355
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:45,088
So to summarise, these were my three points about worldbuilding.

356
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,168
Point number one was that worldbuilding should be specific.

357
00:23:48,988 --> 00:23:52,749
Point number two was that we should always try to be worldbuilding, and that almost every

358
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,170
aspect of our level design can be seen as an opportunity.

359
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,833
And point number three was about the importance of saying things about the people in your world

360
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:04,057
and relating to human ideas in general to tell a more resonant and meaningful story.

361
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,961
So that's the world building section of this talk.

362
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,884
The third and final part is about interactive narrative,

363
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:16,809
this really big and complex idea that naturally emerges from the relationship between gameplay and story.

364
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,781
Interactive storytelling is obviously a huge topic that I couldn't hope to cover in a small part of this talk,

365
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:28,685
but most of what I wanted to focus on related to this idea of show don't tell, and what this phrase might mean to the

366
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,107
medium of games rather than film and literature.

367
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:38,471
To explain what I mean by this, in film show don't tell is generally about this idea of telling the story using the unique strength

368
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:44,095
of the medium, which is moving pictures and sound and editing between them in a way that evokes drama and ideas.

369
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:50,800
In literature, Show Don't Tell is more about the idea of writing in a way that evokes ideas

370
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,105
and drama in the reader's mind and imagination, rather than simply telling them what happened

371
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:56,347
and how to feel about it.

372
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:01,472
This idea is famously summed up by the Russian novelist Anton Chekhov, when he said,

373
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:05,497
Don't tell me the moon is shining, show me the glint of light on broken glass.

374
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:10,916
So if we take the key parts of what this phrase means to film and literature, we have this

375
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:15,879
– using the unique strength of the medium and evoking drama and ideas in the audience's

376
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:16,219
mind.

377
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,561
Let's start with using the unique strength of the medium, which in the case of games

378
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:22,062
is obviously their interactivity.

379
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:26,764
Bearing in mind what I said earlier about the importance of intentionality to gameplay

380
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:27,864
and engaging interaction.

381
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:33,297
If we're talking about interactive narrative, then we can think about the idea of narrative intentionality.

382
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:39,584
By this I mean intentionality that is driven by narrative goals and motivations, rather than abstract gameplay ones.

383
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:46,154
In the case of Dishonored, the player's ability to act with narrative intentionality is kind of constant throughout the entire game.

384
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:53,081
Because while sneaking through any level in the game, the player has choices about how stealthy they are, or violent, or non-violent.

385
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:59,768
And the game tells them that playing violently will have consequences on the world of the game and influence certain outcomes of the story.

386
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:05,679
This has the effect of transforming what would be a bunch of simple gameplay choices of killing enemies

387
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,100
and a simple goal just to get to the end of the level

388
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,222
into loads of little opportunities to act with and express narrative intentionality.

389
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:18,285
It gives players a reason to care about who they are in the story and the role that they choose to play.

390
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,871
Going back to the Dust District, one of the main things that appealed to me about this

391
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,572
particular mission when I was given it to work on was that it presents a choice to the

392
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:31,073
player that isn't just about dealing with a target in a lethal or non-lethal way, but

393
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,534
a choice about two factions and two ideologies.

394
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,915
In other words, moral layers of narrative intentionality for the player to consider

395
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:39,635
when they choose how to play this mission.

396
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,227
If we go back to these three scenes in the level that I mentioned in the world building section,

397
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:51,209
another layer to these scenes is that I deliberately designed them to encourage the player to interact with them with narrative intentionality.

398
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:57,151
They're not just scenes that you watch, and I'm not just showing and telling you story stuff here in a non-interactive way.

399
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,262
These scenes are deliberately designed to be interrupted and interacted with

400
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,744
and kind of provoke the player into making interesting narrative choices.

401
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:08,767
They feature extra lines and scripting and stuff beyond the main scene

402
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,168
to react to certain choices that the player can make

403
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,631
and they're designed to be dramatic situations that present the player with narrative questions.

404
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,342
Questions like whether they care about what is happening around them, and if so, what

405
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:21,223
are they going to do about it?

406
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:26,165
And if they choose to engage and pursue whatever goals they might have, are they willing to

407
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:31,047
resort to and tolerate violence, or do they take the time to resolve things in a non-violent

408
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:31,287
way?

409
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:36,509
As far as I'm concerned, whenever I can make a player make gameplay choices with narrative

410
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:41,692
goals in mind, and not just gameplay ones, the experience becomes inherently more immersive

411
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:42,312
and interesting.

412
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,884
So that was about using the unique strength of the medium, interactivity, and how that

413
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:50,025
leads to the idea of narrative intentionality.

414
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:54,627
If we take a look at literature's take on this phrase, we have this idea of evoking

415
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,368
drama and ideas in the audience's mind and imagination.

416
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:02,431
I'm going to talk about two examples of this, and my first one is the classic pick-up-the-can

417
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:03,311
scene from Half-Life 2.

418
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:08,194
This scene is basically a tutorial for the player picking up and interacting with physics

419
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:12,116
objects, but what's cool is that the level designer used this as an opportunity to do

420
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,197
something much more interesting.

421
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,812
As the player approaches, the combine guard knocks the can off the bin and patronisingly

422
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,653
tells them to pick it up and drop it in.

423
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:25,135
When the player picks the can up, the game's UI tells them that physics objects can be

424
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:25,475
thrown.

425
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:29,757
And of course, the tempting thing to do now is to throw the can at the guard's head as

426
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,038
a cheeky little act of protest.

427
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:34,850
Not only does this introduce some fun and choice into the tutorial,

428
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,071
but this little choice is also helping establish the story of the game.

429
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:41,232
Because this binary choice between obeying and rebelling

430
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:44,614
basically sums up the human condition in the world of City 17.

431
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:48,676
Every human citizen here, in a world being taken over by the Combine,

432
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:51,757
is struggling with this choice of whether they should obey and conform,

433
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:53,078
or resist and rebel.

434
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,499
And by being oppressed by the Combine directly, and making this choice ourselves,

435
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,441
we as players relate to them as people, and their plight.

436
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,820
And that means that when you come to this scene a bit later in the game,

437
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,661
you don't just shoot the baddies because they're baddies in a video game,

438
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,521
but you naturally side with the civilians because you relate to them.

439
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:14,542
And you're naturally opposed to the Combine based on a personal, interactive experience that came before.

440
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:19,923
So even though Half-Life 2's story and gameplay is generally quite scripted and linear,

441
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:24,024
to me it still qualifies as very solid, immersive, interactive storytelling,

442
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:28,085
because it's very smart about involving the player in the ideas and themes of the story.

443
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:33,198
It's important to remember how much of the experience of a game and its story happens

444
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:37,580
in the player's mind and not necessarily on screen, and how much more effective it

445
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,560
is when this is the case.

446
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,141
This idea was well summarised by the film director Frank Capra, who once said this,

447
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,102
I made mistakes in drama.

448
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:49,063
I thought that drama was when the actors cried, but drama is when the audience cries.

449
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:52,438
And of course, we can take that idea and apply it to games,

450
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,240
because we want the player's interactive experience of a game

451
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,121
to be these dramatic highs and lows,

452
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,522
instead of them just being something they watch on screen.

453
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,504
This brings us back to the show-don't-tell thing,

454
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,945
and the question of what show-don't-tell means to games.

455
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:08,947
Whatever our game and narrative is, how do we show interactively?

456
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,029
My other example of doing this is from Heavy Rain,

457
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,551
a game which is very cinematic in its presentation,

458
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:17,932
to the point where some people criticize it for being too much like a movie,

459
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:19,293
and not interactive enough.

460
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:23,300
But I think this particular scene is a really interesting example of what I'm talking about.

461
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:27,025
It's from the beginning of the game, establishing you as the main character.

462
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:31,130
A father, in a story about losing your child and doing anything to save them.

463
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:34,334
You've just woken up in the morning and you're out in the garden.

464
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:39,360
Play fighting with your kids in a very melodramatic, Star Wars video game kind of way.

465
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:44,339
And as with a lot of Heavy Rain, it's a sequence of quick time events, where a button prompt

466
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:48,048
appears on the screen, and based on whether or not you succeed or fail at pressing it

467
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:50,013
in time, the scene plays out differently.

468
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,954
The interesting thing here is that if we follow our traditional gamer instincts and just try

469
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:59,837
to selfishly win everything, then we end up being a super douchey dad in the process.

470
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:03,860
I've watched a lot of playthroughs of this sequence on YouTube, and it's really good

471
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,544
at making players realise this as they play, and change the way they play based on a narrative

472
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,266
desire to play the role of a good dad.

473
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:14,449
And this is kinda cool, because there's a lot of subtext going on in this scene.

474
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:19,157
These little choices are a kind of interactive metaphor for what it means to become a parent.

475
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:23,801
Because when you have a kid, succeeding in your own selfish terms is no longer the priority.

476
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:26,844
Your life becomes more about helping them and not you.

477
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:30,087
And that's what this whole scene is about, and conveys interactively,

478
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:32,749
by allowing a player to choose whether they win the fight.

479
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:41,098
It's a great example of how we can take a game mechanic, even something that seems as basic and binary and typically trivial as pressing a button in time,

480
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:47,120
and use it to interactively evoke some fairly big ideas about the character in the story and about life in general.

481
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,142
And all of this really happens in the player's imagination, without the game explicitly telling them anything, which is awesome.

482
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:58,364
So to summarise this section on interactive narrative, these are my three points.

483
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:03,601
The first one was about the idea of show-don't-tell, and what that really means in the context of games,

484
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:08,844
and making sure that we're thinking about the most interactively interesting ways of executing our ideas.

485
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:14,527
Number two was about empowering a player to act with narrative intentionality, and what that means.

486
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:20,571
And finally, three was about finding ways to evoke drama and ideas in the player's mind and imagination,

487
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,893
and not just showing everything happening on screen.

488
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,812
To wrap up, I thought about this section of a book called Understanding Comics by Scott

489
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:33,334
McLeod, which is a super smart book that I recommend to everyone. It's written to educate

490
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:37,536
people and change people's perspective on comics, but I think it has the effect of changing

491
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:42,138
the way we look at pretty much every medium. In this section of the book, he talks about

492
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:46,339
how comics used to suffer from people assuming that, because comics are a medium made of

493
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,361
pictures and words, that you can just take a great artist and a great writer and just

494
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,062
throw them together and you'll have a great comic.

495
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,891
Whereas in reality of course, if all you do is just put nice writerly words on nice painterly pictures,

496
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,651
then you'll probably only end up with something that's a pretty shallow form of a comic

497
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:04,392
that doesn't really utilize the true magic of the medium.

498
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:09,253
The point is that the power of great comics doesn't come from simply combining these two things.

499
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:13,073
It comes from a range of new and unique creative principles and techniques

500
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:17,134
that emerge from the unique relationship between these things that comics create

501
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,955
and that ultimately set the medium apart from all others.

502
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:25,462
And of course, the whole point of this talk is to emphasise how a similar thing applies to games and level design.

503
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:29,226
I think we've all played games before where these three elements I talked about

504
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:32,349
the gameplay, the story and the fancy graphics and stuff

505
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,993
they're all good individually, but they don't seem to gel very well

506
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:39,056
or they aren't working together to create something new and interesting.

507
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:43,921
And to me, when games and level design are at their peak, it's all about how these things work together.

508
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:48,250
For those familiar with the genre known as immersive sims, I think this framework of

509
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,833
ideas really speaks to what the immersive part of immersive sim actually means, and

510
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:55,576
what the player is actually thinking about all the time as they play.

511
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:59,719
And I think that as level designers working with other disciplines, and as teams in general,

512
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,863
the more that we can discuss and establish these kinds of ideas as shared goals between

513
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:06,985
departments, the better and more interesting our games will be.

514
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:11,017
And that's the end of the talk and this massive video.

515
00:34:11,558 --> 00:34:15,280
I hope you found it interesting and got something out of it because to be honest it took me

516
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,600
ages.

517
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,522
Let me know what you think in the comments and share it around if you know someone who

518
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:20,123
will be into it.

519
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:22,084
Cheers and see you next time.
