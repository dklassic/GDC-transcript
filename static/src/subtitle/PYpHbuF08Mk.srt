1
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:02,782
I'm good?

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:03,322
All right.

3
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:06,222
This is definitely the full 30 minutes,

4
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:07,342
so I don't want to start too late.

5
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:10,483
Before I get started, everybody make

6
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,083
sure you've turned off your cell phones and all of that stuff

7
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,124
so we're not accidentally disrupting

8
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:17,184
the very important things I have to say.

9
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:20,405
I also just found out I was quoted in the New York Times

10
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:21,725
today, so you can tell I'm important.

11
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,766
The exact quote was, nerds like to party and make stuff.

12
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:27,886
So yeah.

13
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:38,014
My name's Adam. I'm making a game called Overland. We're also publishing a game called Night

14
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:42,237
in the Woods and we're doing some other things. I've been a self-employed game maker since

15
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:49,184
about 2006 and I wanted to kind of present to you guys a guide to the Fingy Greenlight

16
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:53,808
process which is sort of how we decide what to work on and what to invest in.

17
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:57,915
The simplest way to describe indie games, I think,

18
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,537
is that the bar for selling games

19
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,999
used to be really, really, really low.

20
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:08,677
Indie games used to be way worse in almost every way.

21
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:12,039
I feel like in the last five years, weird games got way

22
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:12,459
weirder.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,081
Polished games got more polished.

24
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,542
Big games got bigger.

25
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:18,623
Small games got smaller.

26
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,545
And this was never a particularly low-risk industry

27
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:23,165
to begin with.

28
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,827
Democratization of game-making tools,

29
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,168
flood of earnest and brilliant students,

30
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,610
maybe a few AAA midlife crises.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,342
These things have all kind of raised the bar, I think.

32
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,025
And there are games that I feel like were huge hits five years ago

33
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:38,707
that wouldn't really stand out today.

34
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,889
There's lots of pros and cons here.

35
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,751
I think there's lots of things about this that are amazing.

36
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:44,693
But regardless of all that,

37
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,135
this is still a real thing that's actually happening.

38
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:51,219
And on a more personal note, the bar has kind of been raised for us.

39
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,661
My wife and I run this company together.

40
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:54,458
We have a couple of kids now.

41
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:57,898
The stakes for making and selling indie games

42
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,719
feel pretty real all the time, 24-7.

43
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:04,700
And so what we work on, how we work on it,

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,521
all the potential upsides and downsides of those choices

45
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,461
impact not just my wife and I now,

46
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,261
but our kids and our stupid dogs.

47
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,122
So what do we do as a company, as folks

48
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:16,042
that sit around making indie games all day,

49
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:19,743
to sort of survive in this new environment?

50
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,164
My notes here say ruined hellscape.

51
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,724
That seems a little strong for some reason.

52
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,905
All you can do is hedge your bets, right?

53
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:31,146
There are many parts of commercial game making that are just kind of out of our control.

54
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:35,927
And this is not about guaranteeing a studio's survival,

55
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,767
which I think is kind of impossible anyways.

56
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:43,609
This is not about sort of slavishly adopting conventional wisdom in everything that you do.

57
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,029
What I want to try to talk about is sort of doing the opposite.

58
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:50,731
Let's talk about minimizing damage from and or justifying

59
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:54,114
making a weird passion project into a commercial thing.

60
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:58,457
So I think there's lots of talks and articles and blogs

61
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:01,379
about how to hedge your bets during development and release

62
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,081
and even post-release, but what about before?

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:30,471
you know, if you've been making games for a while, you have probably noticed that the earlier you can discover flaws or errors, the more flexibility you have to adapt and either solve those problems or resolve them or dissolve them and strengthen your design. And I think this holds for projects as a whole. Design and production and marketing and technological and artistic components, the earlier you find the landmines in your path, the more time that you have to adapt.

64
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,370
It's good to have a strong process.

65
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,031
It's good to take your releases seriously.

66
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:37,133
But I think for some problems, that's kind of too little,

67
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:37,633
too late.

68
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:42,517
So what about before there is even a game?

69
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,718
There's a lot of advice.

70
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,839
Conventional wisdom, right?

71
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,821
Don't make an experimental game.

72
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,442
Don't make a clone.

73
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,163
Don't make a premium game.

74
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:53,984
Don't make a free to play game.

75
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:56,105
Don't make a casual game.

76
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,686
Don't make a hardcore game.

77
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:00,558
Right?

78
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,361
But making a commercial game is really risky.

79
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:05,962
It's usually a bad idea.

80
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,543
It's not a thing to be done lightly.

81
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:13,327
So if you are going to do it, let's at least maybe acknowledge, potentially mitigate some

82
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,227
of the risks involved.

83
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,509
Let's try to still work on something that we love.

84
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,212
And so this is kind of our mantra, hedge early, hedge often.

85
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:23,934
And these are our...

86
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,563
I wrote pro strats for pre-pre-production,

87
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:29,685
which doesn't really quite roll off the tongue quite right.

88
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:30,105
That's OK.

89
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:33,488
These are things that help us vet an idea before we even

90
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,850
start work on a prototype sometimes.

91
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,213
The first one is called platonic scope.

92
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,974
It's kind of a dorky name for a thing,

93
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,496
but I want to explain what I mean real quick.

94
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,560
There's this thing that you can think

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,421
of as like a game production serveress,

96
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,362
this three-headed thing.

97
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:52,184
There's scope, and budget, and schedule.

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,361
These are basically fancy abstractions

99
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,062
for some pretty discrete resources

100
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,663
that you have as a game maker.

101
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,984
There's sort of game quality or whatever you're building

102
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,225
and whatever you're trying to output.

103
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:05,526
There's the money you have.

104
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,847
There's the time that you have.

105
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,968
And if you imagine these as kind of like three

106
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,109
points of a triangle, different games

107
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,310
are going to sort of have different triangles.

108
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,472
And different game ideas react to changes in these variables

109
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:16,952
differently.

110
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:20,874
Increasing the budget or the amount of time

111
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,675
that you have to build something may or may not

112
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:22,975
affect.

113
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:29,041
The ship date, or the budget, or the output quality, since we're trying to make games

114
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:34,185
commercially and somehow also eat food, time and money obviously matter a lot.

115
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,068
But this quality question is kind of weird.

116
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:42,563
There's this sort of philosophical notion of the Platonic ideal.

117
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:47,945
This is something that is like the most perfect or true version of itself.

118
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,786
It's somehow perfectly authentic.

119
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,326
It's an er-thing.

120
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:55,868
It is like its perfect essence or whatever.

121
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,790
our target for this quality thing that we're trying to

122
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,394
achieve, I think, is to somehow create the platonic version of

123
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:07,680
any given game idea. So this is weird because it's radically

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,643
different from game to game. The ideal sandbox game is going to

125
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,346
be really different from the ideal RPG.

126
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,576
And it's also totally impossible to actually do.

127
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:20,097
Nobody's actually going to achieve this or pull this off.

128
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,518
But I think it's still useful as sort of a target,

129
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,599
or something to aim at, or something

130
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,280
to think about when we're trying to kind of balance quality

131
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,401
and money and time.

132
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,741
So I have these three variables.

133
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:36,763
Usually for us, time and money have kind of an upper boundary.

134
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,994
And then we have this sort of like,

135
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,216
what is the best version of any particular game

136
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:46,557
according to its own rules?

137
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:50,419
What is the platonic ideal of that particular game idea?

138
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,381
And so the first way that we try to manage risk

139
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,522
when we're in the early stages of trying to decide

140
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,663
what to work on next is to just ask this question.

141
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,505
Given the time and money that we have access to,

142
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:04,186
which of our game ideas can we get the closest

143
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,207
to its platonic ideal?

144
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,065
This is a really insane question.

145
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,626
There's so many things going on.

146
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:12,708
We may not have a prototype yet.

147
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,532
Even if you do have a prototype, the kind of games

148
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,093
that we build and the reason that we build them

149
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,354
is they tend to grow in really unpredictable ways.

150
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,936
We think that's a good thing.

151
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:26,718
But you can grow a really big tree from a really small seed

152
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,219
sometimes.

153
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,821
So how do you even guess which of these game ideas

154
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,343
we can actually get the closest to this desired output quality?

155
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,266
Predicting absolutes is really hard.

156
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,601
uh, accuracy in predicting the exact budget and dev time and design complexity and the

157
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:47,164
final output quality of an original game idea is impossible, but I think you can kind of

158
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:52,108
make a relative comparison. You can pit a handful of ideas against each other, you can

159
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:56,031
imagine which one can take you farthest given the resources you have, and that might actually

160
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:56,232
help.

161
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,944
So that's where that dorky name comes from.

162
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:02,125
You may be able to make a pretty good call about which

163
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,186
of your game ideas you can take the farthest, given

164
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,347
the resources that you have.

165
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:07,888
And this isn't the end all, be all of green lighting.

166
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,929
It's kind of just sort of one of our first steps that we like.

167
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,291
The next one is the inverse pyramid test, which I think

168
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,211
sounds kind of ominous.

169
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:20,793
But inverted pyramid is this kind of nice shape

170
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,714
because it maintains the same overall profile over time

171
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,215
as you add new layers.

172
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:34,258
I think games that have this shape can decrease risk over time because you can stop prototyping

173
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:38,861
at any point and you have a game that has all the properties of the thing that you're

174
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,461
trying to achieve.

175
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:45,306
If you have vertical strata or you have a regular crappy pyramid, it doesn't really

176
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,347
have the same weird shape maintaining property.

177
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:54,257
These shapes, I think, are really obviously inherently incomplete or unstable until you

178
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:55,638
get all the final touches done.

179
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,299
So why does this matter?

180
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,680
Sometimes budget and schedule estimates end up being slightly off.

181
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:10,304
So if you end up not having as much time and money as you were hoping, somehow, do you

182
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:10,924
want to end up...

183
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:13,352
with game like this?

184
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,413
Or do you want a game that looks more like this?

185
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,494
This is also kind of known as minimum viable product, right?

186
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,614
I didn't use, I didn't make this image,

187
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,115
but I really, really like it because

188
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:29,315
this particular metaphor, they're good, they're right,

189
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:33,216
it's intelligent, but you can't use skateboard wheels

190
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:33,996
on a bike.

191
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:37,217
So you have to revisit the whole notion of wheels

192
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:38,557
each time you do this next step.

193
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,438
You have to question your old assumptions.

194
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:44,122
which I think is a nice touch when you're trying to sum

195
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:44,942
something up like this.

196
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:48,323
Not every idea is going to be a good fit for this model, right?

197
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,084
But this is kind of our whole point.

198
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:53,005
These pregame considerations that we're talking about

199
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,545
are not best practices.

200
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,426
We're not talking about design methodologies.

201
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,846
We're not talking about workflow processes.

202
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,747
These are ways of interrogating or examining

203
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,328
an idea or a concept that you have.

204
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:13,141
For us, the inverse pyramid test usually means that we end up focusing on systems-based games as opposed to content-based games.

205
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:18,124
So a game with a lot of randomly generated content might be a pretty good fit for us.

206
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,065
It takes a long time to nail down the basics,

207
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:21,546
but

208
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,347
when you're done with that step, you have a good game

209
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:28,749
that's just very small. And then you just have to sort of add new things to it, and as you do that, it

210
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,371
tends to grow in a kind of an exponential way.

211
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,014
Sandbox games tend to have this property also.

212
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:40,199
I think this is, you end up in situations

213
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,780
where you can add one thing, and it actually

214
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,023
doubles the size of the game or the expressive space

215
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:45,504
of the game.

216
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,726
And I think sandbox games being expressive,

217
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:51,249
but sandbox games also having this property of,

218
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,451
oh, we didn't get everything in that we wanted,

219
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,472
but it's still a functioning thing,

220
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,134
is one reason that they're so popular right now.

221
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,091
There's a weird thing about the shape of game too,

222
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,452
which is new layers and mechanics as you go up

223
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:05,915
might be adding disproportionate amounts of new content.

224
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,817
Because this isn't really just a triangle.

225
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:11,659
This is like a multi-dimensional sort of prism

226
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,180
that you're building as you build your game.

227
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,441
And each new layer can add a lot,

228
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,883
and it can alter and augment the existing layers.

229
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,706
So we're talking about,

230
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,087
when we're thinking about inverse pyramid

231
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,848
or trying to think about minimum viable product,

232
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,409
those are a bunch of the things that are on our mind

233
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,570
when we're looking at game ideas.

234
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:32,949
The next thing is the notion of taking creative risks,

235
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,895
or another way to think about it is taking as many risks

236
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,859
as possible without producing something

237
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,104
that is completely alienating to people.

238
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,993
to a commercial audience, right?

239
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,674
And why even bother?

240
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,656
So one reason to take creative risks

241
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,817
is this may be why you went indie in the first place.

242
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:53,299
It might be that nobody's making the game that you want to make.

243
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,841
You notice that there's a gap that needs to be filled,

244
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,782
or there's wilderness that needs to be explored.

245
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,683
It's fun and feels really good.

246
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,006
But it also is going to help your game differentiate itself

247
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,007
from other games that are on the market right now.

248
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,532
And this is kind of an apparent contradiction of commercial game making in a lot of ways.

249
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:18,719
We are trying to make a game that looks like a commercial product that people want to exchange

250
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:26,307
money for, but for practical reasons and for personal reasons, we need it to be somehow

251
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:29,090
unique and to be new and to be original.

252
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,450
to have a kind of a unique silhouette.

253
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,112
And like, if you've ever done contract work or something

254
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,312
and somebody sends you like an email, and they're like,

255
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:41,654
hey, I want something really classic, but timeless,

256
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:42,634
but modern.

257
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:44,454
Like, that's the thing that we're dealing with, right?

258
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:44,995
So.

259
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:50,727
we're trying to make a game that's not unbuyable.

260
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,849
So what is this idea of buyable?

261
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:54,709
What's a buyable game?

262
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:55,469
What does that even mean?

263
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,710
And I think there are different ways

264
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,291
of thinking about that and defining that.

265
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,752
But how big a game is it?

266
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,053
How accessible is it?

267
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,494
How sort of fair is it?

268
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:10,256
Is it an exciting power fantasy, or is this

269
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:11,977
like a brutal, inaccessible thing?

270
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:17,505
how deep do you have to dig to get to the interesting stuff versus how much of it has

271
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,726
been kind of presented to you by the designer.

272
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:25,630
The thing is, breaking some of these rules I think is a really great way to differentiate

273
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:25,990
your game.

274
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,208
And it's a way of kind of resolving this tension between

275
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:32,811
making sort of a commercial product and making something

276
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:33,892
original at the same time.

277
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,414
So do you guys know this game, Minecraft?

278
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,776
It's been pretty hot lately.

279
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,120
I don't think it's actually a particularly accessible game.

280
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,863
I don't think it's actually that much of a polished game.

281
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,465
I think it actually breaks a bunch of these rules.

282
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:51,068
But if you go back to this list, the how much game is

283
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:51,508
their part?

284
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,271
It's really, really, really good at that.

285
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,415
Gone Home is a pretty short game.

286
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,740
There's not a lot of game there in a classic, traditional sense.

287
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,564
It's very polished. It's pretty accessible.

288
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:06,990
It's about stories and themes that are new and have a kind of a broad audience.

289
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:14,007
And I don't think any of these games really follow all the normal, viable formulation for a game.

290
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:19,331
And I admire the way that these games take some progressive or challenging ideas

291
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:25,076
and they find a way to sort of somehow still fit them just enough into this commercial game box

292
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,338
to find a big audience and to support those developers doing their stuff.

293
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:33,182
And there are lots of games that do follow all the rules, and they're still really neat games.

294
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:39,700
These games, though, tend to be differentiated by just raw

295
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,744
quality, or raw superficial quality, even.

296
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,886
They're very long games.

297
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,187
They're very large games.

298
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,969
They have very beautiful graphics that you can see and

299
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:52,850
notice immediately.

300
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,193
This game, the Bloodborne game, is pretty good, right?

301
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:05,631
So these games in some ways I think are taking fewer creative risks, but they're actually a lot riskier to do as a commercial venture.

302
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,072
They have to have extremely good content.

303
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:11,255
They tend to be really expensive to produce.

304
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:16,478
You know, if The Witness had puzzles that were just bad,

305
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,441
like, that's not a thing that can support itself anymore suddenly.

306
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,037
So there's a lot of kind of internal pressure there that you have to handle.

307
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,908
And I think it's easier for small devs to differentiate by breaking some of these rules.

308
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:34,194
So another way of looking at this is the idea that you can't make everyone happy all the time.

309
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:40,157
Which we've all heard a million times, we understand this on a cognitive level, on an emotional level.

310
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:44,560
But when you're making art and you're trying to share it with the world, there's lots of tension or pressure

311
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,121
to make concessions to reach out to new audiences.

312
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:52,384
To draw in people who might not know about the thing that you're making, but you think that they'll totally love it.

313
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:55,486
And if you're not careful, it's really easy to kind of...

314
00:15:56,646 --> 00:16:01,490
sort of stair-step your way into suddenly trying to design for all audiences,

315
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,911
even though you knew at the start that that was kind of a bad idea.

316
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,753
And I think when you do this, you're kind of undermining

317
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,476
the things that made your game so interesting and so different in the first place.

318
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:14,259
You know, if you tack on a crafting system or an RPG system,

319
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:19,302
and you're starting to dilute the thing that maybe got people's attention in the first place.

320
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,378
So creative risks, feels good, helps you stand out.

321
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,519
It's a tricky balance, though.

322
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,760
You have to have a lot of confidence and humility

323
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,501
at the same time.

324
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,201
It's not easy.

325
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,982
I think it's totally worth it, though.

326
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:36,165
Last but not least, the final thing

327
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:40,668
is something that we call exposure design, which

328
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,149
is basically this.

329
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:46,317
And it's not a thing that you do or don't do.

330
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:47,899
Marketing sort of just is.

331
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,621
It's the part of your game that people can see or hear about.

332
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,315
The first time someone sees a screenshot of your game

333
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,757
is kind of also the first time they experience your game.

334
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:57,898
And I think those first impressions matter a lot.

335
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,339
Some things that are marketing.

336
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,381
Let's play, seeing it on someone's phone on the bus.

337
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,322
You saw a cool screenshot on Tumblr.

338
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,503
You're looking at the loading screen,

339
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,404
waiting for the game to actually start eventually.

340
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,565
Somebody was just shouting at you last night

341
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:13,626
about how cool it was.

342
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:17,308
So if your project or your game is an iceberg,

343
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,569
I kind of think of marketing as the 10% that

344
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,450
sticks up out of the water.

345
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:22,773
And that's called exposure.

346
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,576
So marketing to us is basically exposure design.

347
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:31,338
And I think it's really, really, really important.

348
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:34,240
It's the only way that people get into the strange world

349
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,520
that you put inside your game.

350
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,182
And for us, exposure design is the idea

351
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:41,884
that you can and should pay a lot of attention

352
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:43,845
to designing that little top piece.

353
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:50,020
Because it bears a huge design burden. It's kind of a gate into your game. It's often

354
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,824
it's kind of a teacher. It needs to sort of be tempting. In some ways it's sort of like

355
00:17:55,864 --> 00:18:01,628
a restaurant menu. It's kind of this, it's the outer layer of this weird psychic playground

356
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:04,010
thing that you built and that you're trying to share with other people.

357
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,497
And it's a fundamental part of building a commercial game.

358
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:10,119
And it's not a question that you can answer

359
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,761
before you've started working on the game,

360
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,824
any more than you can sit down and write a full game design

361
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,326
document without even starting your prototype, right?

362
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:24,572
Building original games tends to be the process of designing

363
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:25,633
them and vice versa.

364
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,654
But you can still think about this

365
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,775
starting really, really early.

366
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,773
So these are kind of within this way of interrogating

367
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,915
our early game ideas or early prototype ideas.

368
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:39,618
We also can sort of interrogate our marketing ideas.

369
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,741
Does the 10% that's sticking out of the water

370
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:45,584
communicate some of the qualities

371
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:50,989
that make the game fit into that kind of marketing box?

372
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,631
Does it also communicate?

373
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:57,561
the part where you broke the rules and you did things that don't normally fit in the box and

374
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,904
that make it stand out and make it seem different. And does it say that clearly and

375
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:06,087
efficiently to the people who are going to like those things that you put into your

376
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:13,333
iceberg? It's really difficult. It's also really, really easy to test. Um...

377
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,332
I've, on a lot of previous games that we've worked on, we've been able to come up with a pitch,

378
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:24,175
decide like, oh, these are the magic words, this is the elevator pitch, this is the screenshot we need to show,

379
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,816
show it to people, and if they don't care, then you're doing it wrong.

380
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,577
And you just go back and try again.

381
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:32,109
So that part of it is kind of nice.

382
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,750
There's a lot of trial and error,

383
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,991
but at least you can get really clear feedback really,

384
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:36,571
really easily.

385
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,373
The other thing that's weird is it's not about explaining

386
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,573
the whole game in five seconds.

387
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,494
It's way weirder than that.

388
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,255
You're trying to communicate some kind

389
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:46,316
of essential experience and not just game mechanics.

390
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,158
So there's a reason that this list

391
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,899
doesn't include over-explaining everything that your game does

392
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:52,400
all the time.

393
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:59,641
And because you are trying to communicate this essential experience, not just mechanics or story,

394
00:20:01,122 --> 00:20:05,765
the way that you design the exposure, the way that you do your marketing,

395
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,407
is going to vary enormously from project to project.

396
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:16,789
And differentiation in exposure design or marketing has even more pressure because they

397
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,630
don't even get to spend time with the whole game yet.

398
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:21,293
They just have this little piece at the top that they're trying to check out.

399
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:25,797
So what's going to make someone's eyes or ears or brain kind of stop and rest on that

400
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,718
point before moving on to the next thing?

401
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,883
What's going to sort of engender desire in them to talk about the little bit that they

402
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,825
saw and to share it with their friends?

403
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:41,197
This sounds really dramatic, but in a world of infinite icebergs, what makes yours so

404
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:41,598
special?

405
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:46,923
Whatever that quality is, can you tell by looking at that little top piece?

406
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,397
And it's really tempting to think things like, well,

407
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,838
the game is going to speak for itself,

408
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,059
or I told lots of people about it.

409
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,321
I already posted about it on Twitter twice.

410
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,422
So we're pretty much fine.

411
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:02,325
And in indie games for a while, we've

412
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,647
been talking about this idea of the Chang infinity hypothesis,

413
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,469
which is named after Jamie Chang from Clay, who's

414
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,670
been a big inspiration for us.

415
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,812
It's sort of the notion that there are always

416
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,974
more people out there who want to know about the thing

417
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:16,414
that you made.

418
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,936
And Tom Francis, who's a former game journalist and now game designer,

419
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:28,440
made a game called Gunpoint a little while ago that was, by all accounts, a pretty great, successful indie game.

420
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,762
And he went and crunched the numbers and found that if you round to the closest integer,

421
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,644
0% of Steam users own a copy of Gunpoint.

422
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,233
And he still sold more than enough

423
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,794
to fund his entire current project, which

424
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,655
is looking really good.

425
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,436
Anyway, I think it's really tempting to think of marketing

426
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,597
as something that you do later, as something

427
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,398
that you do external to your game.

428
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,619
And instead, I think you have to,

429
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,900
it's not even whether or not you want to do this.

430
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,041
Whether you like it or not, marketing

431
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:02,242
is a very integral and natural part of your game design.

432
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:08,100
So yeah, so these are kind of our main pregame considerations

433
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,842
when we are greenlighting projects at Fingy.

434
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,784
We try to think about how good can we

435
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:17,027
get this idea with the resources that we have access to.

436
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:20,429
What happens if we run out of time or money?

437
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,950
Is the project going to be salvageable,

438
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,213
or is it going to be kind of time to start scrambling?

439
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:27,835
Is this an idea that we?

440
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:32,721
that we personally are passionate about and that we think will stand out

441
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,924
because it's so different from everything else that's out there

442
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:41,293
and how hard are we going to have to work to be able to expose those special qualities

443
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:44,859
to people who have never played this before and have no idea what it is.

444
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,152
And kind of as a counterpoint, so I had all these games up here

445
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,713
before because I think they take really

446
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,973
interesting creative risks.

447
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:59,275
FMV games were not a super hot genre up until pretty recently.

448
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:01,256
These games are expressive.

449
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:01,956
They're beautiful.

450
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:02,697
They're smart.

451
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:05,438
They're also really bad fits for the way

452
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:06,958
that we actually make games.

453
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:09,099
I probably wouldn't green light these projects

454
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,800
because I don't know how to manage their scope.

455
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
I don't know what to do.

456
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,242
if their budget was running low partway through.

457
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,404
But I think these games are very good fits for the people that

458
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,285
actually made them.

459
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,927
These are games that were playing

460
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:28,050
to the strengths of those teams in a really powerful way.

461
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:35,356
This is a recent example of a game that I think is really smart, and this is the kind

462
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:40,460
of thing that I feel like I understand pretty well, and I think that we would have probably

463
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,882
greenlit and gone forward with.

464
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:43,623
It's called Double Daggers.

465
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,465
It doesn't have a whole lot of moving parts.

466
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,528
if they decide to expand it later by adding a new piece.

467
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:52,809
The core game is still there.

468
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,511
The new piece isn't going to change the overall shape

469
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:59,373
of that, but it may potentially make it bigger, deeper, more

470
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,054
complex, more interesting in the future.

471
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:03,595
It breaks some rules.

472
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:06,737
It's a 3D FPS that just doesn't have any levels at all.

473
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:11,459
And I think the screenshots have a pretty clear identity.

474
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,641
And they do a pretty good job of showing most

475
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:15,662
of what you do in this game.

476
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:15,962
And that's it.

477
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:22,559
pretty much you'd shoot orange finger lasers at skulls. That's, that's everything. That's

478
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,481
the whole game. They boxed it up. Um, so does this mean that all arena shooters are a really

479
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:32,524
good idea? No. Uh, but the mix of ingredients and ideas for this particular thing I think

480
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,504
is really intelligent.

481
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,551
So it may not even be that important that you follow all

482
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,052
of our rules or whatever, right?

483
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,735
Instead, you can start to think about what

484
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,855
do these mean for you?

485
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,457
What do they mean for your background?

486
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:48,797
What do they mean for your skills?

487
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,258
What do they mean for your audience?

488
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,460
What do they mean for your creative needs?

489
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:58,304
And even more broadly, just think about anything,

490
00:24:59,104 --> 00:24:59,605
kind of, ever.

491
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,653
We've had this experience over and over and over in the last year where somebody runs

492
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:09,814
up and they say, hey, just quit our job, invest our life savings in this thing.

493
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:13,436
We didn't pay attention, we didn't do any of these steps at all.

494
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:20,278
We just went in, we made something that looks a lot like other things and it's halfway done,

495
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,100
but we ran out of money and we're just kind of wondering, you know, what's the next step?

496
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,421
Do we do some marketing or get a loan or what?

497
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,942
And it's like way too late.

498
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,081
there's no good version of what to do next in that scenario.

499
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,303
And I think a little bit more care a little bit earlier,

500
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:45,245
just like in a game design, where you would start

501
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:46,766
prototyping some of your core mechanics

502
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,827
before you decide what the final boss battle is.

503
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:52,710
Getting some of this stuff earlier, I think, helps a lot.

504
00:25:55,231 --> 00:26:03,063
So that's our advice. Hedgerly, hedge often, and that's actually all I have.

505
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:07,070
I think I was done like a minute early or something. So yeah, thank you.

506
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:15,174
Oh, and I will be in the wrap-up room afterward if you guys want to hang out or chat and also

507
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:22,539
they are going to email you some evaluations about this session. I would encourage you

508
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:28,583
to compliment me on my looks. And yeah, that's about it. Thanks.
