1
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:10,151
In the fall of 2013, I walked into my kitchen and saw a blood dragon burst out of my chest,

2
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,253
crash through the wall, and fly off into the horizon.

3
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:15,074
This was not a daydream.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,476
It was a full-on, vivid hallucination.

5
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:22,939
My brother Seth and I had just published our second game and were working on an endless

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:26,842
runner for mobile, something we had designed to pay the bills and not really much else.

7
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:31,460
The Blood Dragon began to visit more often the further we moved into dev.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,901
First, it would show up once a week or so,

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:37,482
a reality break I came to expect when moving between rooms.

10
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,203
And then it picked up the pace.

11
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:43,725
Like clockwork, every day the dragon would intrude on my daily routine.

12
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,946
It got so curious that I mentioned it to Seth,

13
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,227
my brother, co-founder, and game dev partner.

14
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:53,629
We chalked it up to postpartum depression from our previous game release

15
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:54,850
and soldiered on.

16
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:57,627
My energy started to decline.

17
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:02,911
I began waking up later and later and requiring more and more coffee to sustain my work.

18
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:09,215
The dragon came to visit more often still, and the vision of its blood-soaked wings became

19
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,917
a common thing that I eventually learned to simply ignore.

20
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:17,421
I figured I was struck with a strange virus, something I had picked up while hiking out

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:17,741
east.

22
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:24,738
I decided to start going to the gym more and eating healthier to combat the growing sense of fatigue that was starting to overtake me.

23
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:32,680
My left pec began to swell up as well as my left lat, which I attributed just to my increasingly intense gym regiments.

24
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,182
The dragon started showing up nearly every time I walked into a room.

25
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:40,683
And then the fever came.

26
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:47,845
Hot boiling temperatures consumed me beginning at 530 p.m. each day and put me to an exhausted sleep by 7.

27
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,705
I'd wake up at 3 a.m. covered in a bucket of my own sweat.

28
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,666
I visited a doctor who sent me home with headache medicine.

29
00:01:56,527 --> 00:02:01,809
My generally cheerful disposition hadn't been impacted by being sick all the time, and it

30
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,130
made the doctors think that I was doing just fine.

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,251
I was 23, after all.

32
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:11,413
I called to get a second opinion and was told that I would have to wait four weeks to get

33
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,414
an appointment with the doctor.

34
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:17,576
And something about the mention of time caused a sudden panic in me.

35
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:22,182
I told the nurse on the phone that I absolutely could not wait and that I needed to see someone,

36
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:23,703
even if it wasn't a doctor.

37
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:29,805
She lined me up with one of the doctor's assistants for the very next day, and I drove in, took

38
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:35,287
my shirt off as directed, and watched as fear flashed through her eyes and then was smothered

39
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,507
by a professional demeanor.

40
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:41,049
She practically ran out of the room and came back with a doctor who I told wasn't going

41
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,149
to be available for four weeks.

42
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:46,902
The doctor came in and squeezed the now sizable lump

43
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:48,143
on the left side of my chest.

44
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,847
He felt my left pec pushing hard under my clavicle.

45
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,752
All these places where I thought my extra gym time

46
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,594
had just been doing a hell of a lot of good for me.

47
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,096
And then he stepped back from the table

48
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,278
and he told me I had cancer.

49
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,367
The next few weeks was a flurry of tests, scans, and biopsies.

50
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:11,729
When you get diagnosed with cancer, the first step the doctors take is nailing down just

51
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,811
which one you have, because some, I've been told, are better than others.

52
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:20,133
Each time a test came back for me, though, my results were worse.

53
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:24,895
First it was lymphoma, then a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is more difficult

54
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,275
to treat.

55
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,196
And then I was staged at 4B.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,841
That's shorthand for saying that the doctors genuinely did not know how it was that I was up and walking around.

57
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,782
The stage beyond four is supposed to be death.

58
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,803
They guessed that I would have died if I waited four weeks for that appointment.

59
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:47,024
And I learned just several months ago that my projected survival rate at the time clocked in at seven percent.

60
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,166
It turns out that dragon I'd been seeing wasn't some weird mental slip.

61
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:57,527
It really was in me, growing more dangerous with each day that passed.

62
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,766
My name is Sam Koster.

63
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,808
I'm co-founder of Butterscotch Shenanigans,

64
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,769
and today I'm gonna talk to you about life,

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,231
death, and game development.

66
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,314
I told myself in preparing this talk

67
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,955
that I would leave nothing on the stage today,

68
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:15,098
so if I get a little choked up, please bear with me.

69
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,441
Once the tests were completed,

70
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:21,523
the doctors chose a regimen of chemotherapy for me,

71
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:22,624
and I was sent off to the clinic

72
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,145
to get all sorts of poisons.

73
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,012
For those of you who have not had the good grace

74
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:28,993
to go through chemotherapy,

75
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,974
let me try to put it into easy words what it feels like.

76
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,135
How many of you have been hung over before?

77
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,597
How many of you have been like really hung over before?

78
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:40,918
All right.

79
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:44,439
It basically feels like that, just worse,

80
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,680
and also it lasts a lot longer.

81
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:51,406
Some of the other procedures that you get done are a little less easy to quantify,

82
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:55,551
like getting a bone marrow biopsy, of which I've had the good grace to get seven.

83
00:04:56,492 --> 00:05:00,696
It feels like someone punches a dime-sized hole in your backside and then pulls one of your legs out through it.

84
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,001
Just for a second, though.

85
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,345
The worst part of the whole thing, though, really, is the underlying sense that maybe you're doomed.

86
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:14,840
That's really the hard part that sets diseases like cancer apart from most other illnesses.

87
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,241
It forces you in no uncertain terms to confront and walk with death.

88
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:23,542
But it turns out that recognizing that you're going to die has a couple benefits too.

89
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,864
The day after my first chemotherapy session, Seth and I sat down at the whiteboard

90
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,185
for the first time in basically a month.

91
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,326
A whole lot had changed and yet here we were.

92
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:38,327
Looking at the design and production plan of that silly endless runner we've been building before I got diagnosed.

93
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:43,484
The whole day passed without the intrusion of the blood dragon, and my energy was actually

94
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:48,447
soaring despite the chemo, largely due to an enormous dose of steroids and a whole lot

95
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,087
of tumor death.

96
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:54,451
When Seth left for the day, I cracked open Game Maker Studio, our engine of choice, and

97
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,291
began prototyping.

98
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:59,334
I needed to make something to get my mind off the sense of doom that was trying to break

99
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:03,576
in, so naturally I prototyped what was basically a Roomba picking up leaves.

100
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:08,339
Once it picks up ten leaves, they turn into sandals.

101
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,179
Incredible.

102
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,066
The thing is, this was not compelling in the slightest.

103
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,007
We remade this recently.

104
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,127
This is basically what it looks like.

105
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:18,148
The next morning, when Seth arrived,

106
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,769
eager to work on the plans we had laid down the day before,

107
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,389
I showed him my Roomba.

108
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,750
I told him about this crazy world we could build,

109
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,131
something that was, it was huge.

110
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,891
It was gonna have crafting and tons of stories

111
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,512
and characters and items to interact with.

112
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:32,472
It was gonna be something ridiculous

113
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,393
to get us through treatment.

114
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,274
Something so ambitious that we'd keep ourselves alive

115
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:37,954
just to do it.

116
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,682
He asked me why I wanted to build it,

117
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:42,363
and the words fell out of my mouth

118
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,383
before I realized what I was saying.

119
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,505
No offense to those of you who make Endless Runners in here,

120
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,466
but this Endless Runner is not the last game

121
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,707
I want to make before I die.

122
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,548
I wanted to make something that mattered,

123
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:54,649
not just for money.

124
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,290
Seth signed up on the spot.

125
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,391
We were gonna build this enormous game

126
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:00,392
in an enormous world,

127
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,413
and it was gonna be a mix of Diablo, Terraria, and Pokemon,

128
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,514
and it would be funny because that's what we needed.

129
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,386
But of course we had no idea how the fuck to do that.

130
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,508
Our previous games were making 1500 bucks a month,

131
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:14,851
which was enough to keep me alive by Midwestern standards.

132
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,232
But Seth actually hadn't been paid yet.

133
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:19,734
We launched two games up to this point,

134
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:22,216
each of which only took 48 work days to complete,

135
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,038
from inception to market.

136
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:25,959
Neither were known very well,

137
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,801
and nor were they known for their worlds,

138
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,082
their stories, or for making much money.

139
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:32,765
This was reckless by every standard.

140
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,706
It was not a business decision.

141
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,451
It was an answer to the question that we,

142
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,892
living in a relatively safe and affluent society,

143
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,213
scarcely have to ask ourselves.

144
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,514
What would I do if I were gonna be dead in a year?

145
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,836
What plans for the future might you have

146
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,217
because you assume that you'll be around to enact them?

147
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,019
There's a good number of people in this room.

148
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,161
What if I told you it's not statistically unlikely

149
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,362
that someone's not coming back here next year,

150
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:01,582
not because they didn't buy a ticket?

151
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,323
How would it change your plans and your behavior now?

152
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,504
When would you build whatever it is that you're building?

153
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:11,986
For myself and my family,

154
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,827
the question of what to do with life became clear.

155
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,669
We do the big things we really wanted to do

156
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,630
because the worst thing that could happen already did,

157
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,211
and we didn't even think about

158
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:21,312
that happening in the first place.

159
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:26,055
Getting sick and being given a rough expiration date

160
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,176
suddenly made me ask a bunch of design questions

161
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:28,676
about my life.

162
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:30,718
Things I never considered before,

163
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:31,938
like do I really want to do this?

164
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,082
Does this make me fulfilled?

165
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:36,043
Is this worth my scarce time?

166
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:38,724
It made me approach my days

167
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,204
as if I were actually a game designer,

168
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:42,365
trying to craft the best experience for myself.

169
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:45,367
Why I had never done this before became a mystery to me

170
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,247
because my sense of fulfillment soared

171
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,488
despite being critically ill.

172
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,549
I remember giggling nervously when my mother,

173
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,310
who does health and wellness for corporations,

174
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,571
walked me through this four quadrant model.

175
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,232
There are things in life that are urgent, non-urgent,

176
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,273
important, and unimportant.

177
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:06,057
Everything you can do fits into this box of categories.

178
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:10,358
Yeah, there's a cat in the wood chipper, you gotta be careful.

179
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,160
The problem for most people is that they neglect the important but non-urgent things until

180
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,221
they slip into the urgent category.

181
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,302
Things like hanging out with your family, spending time with your loved ones, working

182
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,162
on your game.

183
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:26,963
Most people, in fact, don't run their lives, but rather are run by their lives.

184
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:31,519
So it seemed a little crazy, but I managed to pare down nearly all of my activities

185
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,103
to the things that were just important.

186
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:37,786
Cancer gave me a whole lot of clarity.

187
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,709
We even developed a phrase for it, which was pulling the C-card.

188
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,033
When someone tried to pressure me into a situation that wasn't actually important,

189
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,334
according to my own distinction,

190
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,978
I could always fall back on the fact that I was dying and they would have to leave me alone.

191
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,816
My family and I got done the schedule of going to the hospital every 21 days for that routine poisoning,

192
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:57,776
and I always brought my laptop along.

193
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:02,837
Now, while I do all the art for our studio, I do not consider myself an artist by trade.

194
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:06,498
I'm not the sort of person who's been scribbling on every surface available since they were three.

195
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,599
In fact, I just started doing art four years ago,

196
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,960
when we started the studio, because my brother Seth is better at programming than I am.

197
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,581
Much to the horror of nearly every game artist I've met, I use a mouse to do all of my art.

198
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:23,021
The one fringe benefit of this is that it makes it incredibly easy to continue working

199
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,003
from pretty much anywhere.

200
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:29,066
You can work from a bed, you can work from a hospital chair, you can work while getting

201
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:29,446
poisoned.

202
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,807
It's fantastic.

203
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:35,611
And being able to work from all those positions makes it easier to endure treatment.

204
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:39,934
Because I wasn't just a passenger along for some crazy roller coaster ride, I was actually

205
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:44,077
able to continue participating in my own life in much the same way that I was before.

206
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,548
At this early time, the working title of our game was literally

207
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,469
fuck cancer dot GMX.

208
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,492
This only changed about four months into development when my prognosis improved

209
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,653
due to the response my cancer had to chemotherapy.

210
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:02,635
And the work was definitely therapy for us. I know a lot of people say that

211
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:06,257
making games is hard, and I originally wanted to get up here and say, yeah, well

212
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:08,598
making games while you're dying is really fucking hard.

213
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:15,617
But the truth is that making games while going through treatment made treatment easier,

214
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:19,660
and weirdly, going through cancer treatment made making games easier.

215
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,023
It allowed me to focus in a way that I hadn't thought I'd be able to before.

216
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,426
Work also became therapy for my brother.

217
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,689
It was his way of helping in an otherwise helpless situation,

218
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,771
and it was my way of keeping that creeping doom at bay.

219
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,814
Every day I'd wake up with a list of important things to do.

220
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,072
And Seth would be right there to assist.

221
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:43,595
He'd take time in his evenings or when I was conked out from pain or drugs or both

222
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,097
to add more things to the game to get me excited to get up again.

223
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,920
A great example of this happened when I was interned in the hospital

224
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:53,323
for a particularly poisonous drug called methotrexate.

225
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,065
Seth asked if he should come by to visit.

226
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:57,367
And I told him,

227
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:58,147
No.

228
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,109
You get that planting logic done,

229
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,211
because I want to build a fucking garden in my bed tonight.

230
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,422
He laughed and cranked on the project from home,

231
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:09,003
and a few hours later, a new build arrived in Dropbox.

232
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:12,464
I was able to plant a garden for my hospital bed.

233
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,307
The name of the game eventually graduated to Four Corners.

234
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,408
The reason was that Seth was having a hell of a time

235
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,568
figuring out how to generate an infinite world

236
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:24,969
that didn't take up so much memory

237
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,650
that it crashed everything that it was put on.

238
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,050
Keep in mind that all of our experience up to this point

239
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,931
was on the mobile market, and that's what we were aiming for.

240
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,072
So we needed low RAM overhead.

241
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,892
With Seth's best world building algorithm,

242
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,953
the game took seven minutes to generate

243
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,353
and four minutes to walk across.

244
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,174
I remember feeling really glum about this

245
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,695
because it suddenly forced us

246
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:45,356
to scale down the vision for the game.

247
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:48,257
And then Seth suddenly said,

248
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:50,918
fuck this, if Minecraft can do it, so can we.

249
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:56,275
And he did a bunch of googling, and he found out about this thing called Perlin Noise,

250
00:12:56,995 --> 00:13:00,597
which for those of you, I see a lot of heads nodding, for those of you who build procedurally

251
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,898
generated worlds, that's the way to do it, without taking up too much memory.

252
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,059
Give it a googling, figure it out.

253
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,482
With these limitations removed, we suddenly had to abolish the name of the game.

254
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,422
Four Corners no longer existed.

255
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,823
We essentially had a bunch of different infinities to work with.

256
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:19,274
We figured we'd be done with the game in about two months.

257
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,335
Now this is back in February of 2014,

258
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,376
about four months into treatment and dev on the game.

259
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:26,856
We decided to call it Crashlands.

260
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:31,217
GDC of 2014 rolled around a week

261
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,057
after my fifth chemotherapy session.

262
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,138
With a severely damaged immune system

263
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,198
and an intense dragging sense of fatigue,

264
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,039
I boarded a plane along with Seth to come here

265
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,399
and see if we couldn't wrangle up some press

266
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,240
for our new title.

267
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,812
We'd already worked twice as long on this thing as anything we'd previously built,

268
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,914
and we were really excited to see what the critics thought.

269
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:54,018
And basically everyone we met with was completely unimpressed.

270
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,460
This is something to keep in mind.

271
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,325
I mean, the masters at Pixar talk about this with how every movie they make starts out as complete and utter garbage.

272
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:05,808
And I think a lot of games work the same way.

273
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,429
At least Crashland certainly fit the pattern.

274
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,611
We returned from GDC a little down but inspired.

275
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,253
We took time each week to jam out a new game

276
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,354
in just eight hours.

277
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,877
We needed a break from crash lands

278
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:19,718
like I needed a break from being poisoned

279
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,420
and luckily at the end of March,

280
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,381
I finally got that break

281
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,623
because my sixth and final treatment finished.

282
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:26,865
I rang the bell on the chemo ward

283
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,086
which signaled the end of treatment,

284
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,328
celebrated for a day and then we got back to work.

285
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,091
My scan had come back, not totally clean.

286
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:39,650
but the doctor said it was probably just healing in the affected areas from all the chemotherapy.

287
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,791
They said it was probably nothing to worry about.

288
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,893
Seth and I settled into the grind work of dev. We were in that process of

289
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,695
of the game development point where you know everything you need to make, you just gotta put in a ridiculous amount of time to get it done.

290
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,856
And then something funny happened.

291
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:59,277
Once the clamber from GDC died down and the scan came back relatively okay,

292
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:01,298
we realized we had a problem, which is that

293
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:03,839
I wasn't gonna die.

294
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,862
Turns out being alive means you have a lot of work to do.

295
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:08,943
Uh...

296
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:16,486
We had to turn this game, or this toy that we had really been making for the past six

297
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:19,828
months into an actual full-fledged sellable title.

298
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:25,410
Our trip to GDC had really ripped the wool off our eyes regarding whether or not Crash

299
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,091
Nintz was good.

300
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:30,513
It was more of a boring toy with a few tiers of crafting equipment shoved in.

301
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:36,184
I still had a scan coming up in June, but I was feeling great, had no obvious lumps,

302
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:40,925
and the doctors were pretty confident that I was in the clear, so we just decided to

303
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,645
look forward and start building for the future.

304
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:46,326
June rolled around, and I went in for my scan.

305
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,827
We waited patiently for the results, and finally, they came through.

306
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,748
The doctors found something.

307
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:58,549
The constellation of nodes under my left arm where all the mess started were glowing again.

308
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:03,717
The doc told me I had cancer and needed to prepare for salvage chemotherapy,

309
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:09,020
which is as bad as it sounds, plus not one, but two stem cell transplants.

310
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,002
These were designed to simultaneously nuke my cancer into orbit and then lock

311
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:17,904
it out by giving me someone else's blood and immune system permanently.

312
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:20,666
My world exploded.

313
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:25,248
I really felt like I had mined the first cancer experience for all sorts of wisdom.

314
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,229
And I wasn't even mad about it.

315
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:31,329
I felt like I had gained so much from facing my own mortality,

316
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:35,471
but to have to do it again and have it somehow be worse.

317
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,332
Just like, what the fuck was this?

318
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,693
My girlfriend and I left the hospital numb.

319
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:45,314
We went to a nearby park where I made her a ring

320
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:46,674
on a clover and we laid in the grass.

321
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:50,236
It talked about the future that we were not gonna have.

322
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,277
My parents, who both work in medicine,

323
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,838
clamored for a biopsy before we called the case closed

324
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,118
and I was interned again.

325
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,459
The doctors gave us some pushback,

326
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,340
but eventually yielded and decided to take a huge needle,

327
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,541
stab it into my chest, and bite out pieces

328
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:06,901
of where they thought the tumors were.

329
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,122
We waited a tense few days for what were gonna be

330
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,762
the legitimate results to this whole thing,

331
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:14,283
during which time I asked my girlfriend to marry me,

332
00:17:14,823 --> 00:17:15,903
and she became my fiance.

333
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,004
A day or so later, the doctor called.

334
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,364
She told me I didn't have cancer.

335
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:21,665
Great.

336
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,225
Three of the five biopsy reports

337
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,606
had come back from pathology, and they said it was all fine.

338
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:30,015
We rejoiced and began carrying on with our lives,

339
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,137
feeling sufficiently yo-yoed by the whole thing.

340
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:35,640
But before we could make it to lunch, the doctor called back.

341
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,362
Those remaining two biopsy reports

342
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:39,523
had been given to a different team,

343
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,585
and they sent her a note about the abnormality

344
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:43,386
they found in the cells.

345
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:45,768
She told me I had cancer again,

346
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,189
and I needed to pack my bags

347
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,930
and head for salvage chemotherapy the next day.

348
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,074
The next morning, I woke up with my bags packed.

349
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:54,855
All the way out the door,

350
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:56,376
received another call from the doctor.

351
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:01,726
She had investigated the genetics team's claims and found that the cells weren't cancerous.

352
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:06,369
They were just abnormal, and again, what looked like consistent patterns based on healing

353
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:07,229
from chemotherapy.

354
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,774
Turns out I didn't have cancer, but I did get a fiancé out of the deal, so after taking

355
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:20,918
a long and furious nap, we decided to fix our focus on just getting this goddamn game

356
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,679
done so we could close the chapter on this whole cancerous escapade.

357
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,941
And luckily, help was on the way.

358
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,701
Our third brother and final co-founder of the studio, Adam,

359
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:33,083
had been trapped in Texas getting a PhD in molecular biology.

360
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,025
Once I got sick, he made the call to wrap up his PhD

361
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:39,266
as quickly as physically possible and join us in the studio.

362
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,868
Seth, myself, and the rest of our family flew down to Texas,

363
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:46,290
watched him give us a defense, and not more than 20 minutes

364
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,591
after being minted as a card-carrying PhD,

365
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,412
we gave him his butterscotch business cards

366
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:51,833
and stole him away from academia.

367
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:58,030
Adam's fresh eyes let us re-examine a lot of the systems that we had built in Crashlands.

368
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:01,532
We were trying to build toward a feeling rather than from a mechanic.

369
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,893
And this was a method of dev that we weren't familiar with up to this point.

370
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:09,035
The feelings we were trying to hit were simply exploration and joy.

371
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:13,617
Anything that got in the way of those two things we ripped out or nullified as best

372
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:14,478
as we possibly could.

373
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:18,019
But one thing had been giving us a huge amount of trouble.

374
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,940
That was inventory.

375
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:25,148
Crashlands was shaping up to be an enormous crafting game with over 400 components that

376
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,149
built into 540 different recipes.

377
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:32,290
That naturally meant that players had to spend a lot of time collecting resources and managing

378
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,011
them, and it also meant that players' exploration hunts were always cut short by a lack of bag

379
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:37,371
space.

380
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:42,193
Seth and I both hated this, but the best we'd managed to do so far was to keep adding slots

381
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,133
to the player's bag.

382
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:46,474
By the time Adam came around, the player had 80 inventory slots.

383
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,793
Adam played the game and simply asked a question that neither Seth nor I had had the presence

384
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:52,593
of mind to pose.

385
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,896
What if we just didn't have an inventory?

386
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:02,659
This question really had echoes of those same questions I asked about life when I first

387
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:03,500
got diagnosed.

388
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,323
Something as basic to a crafting game, as traditionally minded and glossed over as having

389
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,584
an inventory, was up for negotiation.

390
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,600
Did we actually need this?

391
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,543
Was this a tool that was helping and serving our players,

392
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,185
or was it merely something we were doing

393
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,206
because that's what people do?

394
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:23,850
Removing the inventory did seem mildly insane,

395
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,471
but on closer inspection, we found a truth.

396
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:27,493
The only way to get rid of the friction

397
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:28,995
between exploration and crafting

398
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,697
was to literally destroy the concept of a limited inventory.

399
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,854
We decided to make the inventory infinite and completely non-searchable,

400
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,115
meaning players couldn't open up a bag to see all the stuff they had.

401
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:43,557
Instead, the total number of items that a player had would show up when they needed to,

402
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,257
like when they're about to craft a recipe.

403
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,899
This ended up being a huge design win for Crashlands.

404
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,399
It freed up tons of player attention for the game world

405
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,101
and put the focus back on exploration rather than sack management.

406
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,141
In other words, it gave us and our players more clarity.

407
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:01,696
Adam brought some other firepower to the bear for the studio.

408
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:06,479
Seth and I had been so focused first on the studio surviving, and then on me surviving,

409
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:12,342
that we never had the bandwidth to step back and ask how we could better operate as an entity.

410
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,825
We were trapped in this vicious cycle of just making games,

411
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:19,367
without ever spending the time necessary to build the infrastructure to help ourselves.

412
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:23,654
So things like email lists, marketing tools, art pipelines,

413
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,455
command build line tools, we just didn't have the time

414
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:27,036
to investigate.

415
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,777
I mean, I was dying in the studio, basically had no money.

416
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,079
Adam's arrival signaled a big shift though,

417
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,480
because since he wasn't trapped on the game side of things,

418
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,401
he started thinking about how we could improve

419
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,322
our odds of success in the long term.

420
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:41,243
Game over game.

421
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:45,169
Through a bunch of discussions, we realized that our biggest hang-up in growing a studio

422
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:49,532
and securing ourselves for the future was one of player retention between games.

423
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:54,616
Because at this point, that we had accumulated 3 million players between all of our other free titles,

424
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,397
we had no way to communicate with them.

425
00:21:57,698 --> 00:22:01,761
That meant that with every title we launched, we had to effectively start from zero again

426
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,422
and beg, borrow, and steal to get on the front page of the app store

427
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,484
and simply recollect our fans.

428
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,966
That's an exhausting and non-optimal long-term strategy.

429
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:15,440
So our solution was to build our own proprietary login system called Bscotch ID.

430
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,784
With basically no knowledge in web programming, Adam pulled a Tony Stark in a cave and somehow

431
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,106
pounded the first version together in the span of a few weeks.

432
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,390
It was basically an email capture system with a bunch of other features, chief among them

433
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,991
our own cloud saving system.

434
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,907
And this would allow people to move their saves

435
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,628
between PC and mobile,

436
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:36,388
something we refer to as a save bridge.

437
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:37,929
So you could play on something like Steam,

438
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:40,649
pick up your device, take it on the road with you,

439
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,670
and play your same save.

440
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,911
The advent of Bscotch ID and MyGoodHealth

441
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,071
had us thinking really far downrange

442
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,192
because we were finally building for the future

443
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:50,292
and it felt great.

444
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:52,673
We saw what Crash Games was shaping into

445
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:54,694
and decided it was possible for us to launch

446
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,555
not just on the mobile storefronts, but also on Steam.

447
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:01,995
And with the Save Bridge in place, we could launch simultaneously across all three

448
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,417
and cause as much ruckus as possible, given that we had no money for marketing.

449
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,360
It was the end of 2014 by this time, and the game was still very much in process,

450
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,021
despite all of our hopeful pushing otherwise.

451
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:15,824
It turns out that Crashlands wasn't actually anywhere near done.

452
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:20,007
And it turns out that my cancer wasn't anywhere near done either.

453
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:25,290
In December of 2014, I was showering and felt a lump on the side of my chest.

454
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:30,689
Salvage chemotherapy began a few weeks into 2015.

455
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,371
I was placed in the hospital for three days every 21 days

456
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:36,932
and given a more intense blast of chemo than before.

457
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:40,433
And all the while, we kept plodding away on crash lands,

458
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,574
adding more and more assets and expanding the game world.

459
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,036
I admit that this phase of the cancer

460
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,576
is extremely difficult to talk about.

461
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:50,457
I was in a dark place.

462
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:53,278
My focus on process, one of the gifts

463
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,739
from the previous bout with cancer,

464
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,259
was about the only thing getting me through.

465
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,537
I simply focused on the very next asset for the game,

466
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:01,938
the next couple minutes I had with my fiancé,

467
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,319
or the next episode of Parks and Recreation.

468
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:08,260
My feeling of having a future was basically obliterated.

469
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,021
The chemotherapy was so harsh this time around

470
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,322
that I would throw up every few hours in the hospital

471
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,302
and be unable to walk up a flight of stairs

472
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:17,903
without becoming exhausted for weeks once I left.

473
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,795
Further, the treatments were starting to affect

474
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:21,875
other parts of my body,

475
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,076
which meant we started facing several delays

476
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,456
due to complications.

477
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:27,657
Hope was in short supply.

478
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,198
And at the same time,

479
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,759
Crashlands was also experiencing its own bout of darkness.

480
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,960
While the game had shaped into a wonderful crafting RPG,

481
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,561
it dawned on us that the game had no differentiation points

482
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,201
whatsoever from other crafting games,

483
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,242
aside from the infinite inventory concept.

484
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,423
And that to us didn't sound like something we could sell.

485
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,728
The game would, if left unchanged, look like every other crafting game on the market.

486
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:54,790
It didn't have a unique hook, despite the level of innovation we had brought to the design.

487
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,592
And this brought us to a discerning point that we now keep in mind as we build our games forward.

488
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:05,896
Differentiation within a genre is simply not nearly as good as separating yourself from existing genres.

489
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,358
Present players are not interested in improvements.

490
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:15,161
They want whatever is new, and Crashlands, for all of its innovations, was very much focused on the small stuff.

491
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:19,185
It was pretty far in the weeds of the crafting genre as far as where all the innovations lied.

492
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,927
So we needed to get out of the weeds and move a mountain.

493
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,509
We needed to alter the landscape we were in so we could

494
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,072
so we could pitch the game as effectively different from other titles like Terraria and Don't Starve.

495
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:32,554
Otherwise we weren't going to be selling much of anything.

496
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:34,475
The future looked bleak

497
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:38,999
because the project meant to pull us through the destruction of Cancer felt like it was going nowhere

498
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,001
and the Cancer wasn't going the fuck away like it was supposed to.

499
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,603
So we started asking questions.

500
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:50,022
What can we do to make this game stand out from other crafting titles?

501
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:53,686
What could we do that would also add a sense of exploration to the world?

502
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,670
The answer fell out of one of our brainstorming sessions like an anvil.

503
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,951
We could use a story.

504
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:02,575
There weren't any crafting games with long-form, hilarious narratives,

505
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:04,017
at least, none that we could think of.

506
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:07,300
Most didn't have much to say beyond throwing players into the woods

507
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,922
and making them punch trees to survive.

508
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,561
Seth plugged a hard-coded question to the game to see how it felt, and it felt really good.

509
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:17,703
So Adam got to work building a back-end tool that would let us make these stories,

510
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,264
and we were suddenly back onto something.

511
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:23,947
And not a second too late, because GDC 2015 was right around the corner.

512
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:28,250
It was just a few days after my second of three rounds of salvage therapy.

513
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,712
The doctors warned me that I'd be attending the conference

514
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:34,294
at the low point of my entire immune system.

515
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,975
They told me not to go, in fact.

516
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,362
So I told them to find me a doctor buddy in San Francisco who could save me from a fatal

517
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:42,824
neutropenic fever if that happened to happen.

518
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:45,586
I agreed to wear a mask on the plane, and that was that.

519
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:50,310
We showed the game to our press contacts at Touch Arcade, to a few of our contacts at

520
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,553
the app stores, and a few other media sites, and I tried desperately not to touch my hair

521
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,974
because it started falling out.

522
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:58,216
Our contacts were excited.

523
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:02,839
The game looked like a hilarious, weird adventure by this point, so press started to roll in

524
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,141
and built a little tiny hype fire around us.

525
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:11,422
We returned from GDC, buoyed and feeling like we had done the right thing, so we dug back into the work.

526
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,107
Shortly after, my eyebrows fell out.

527
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:19,171
We carried on slamming content into the game as fast as we physically could.

528
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:23,815
We had for some arbitrary reason decided the game needed three biomes worth of content.

529
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:29,381
Each one ended up taking six enemies, twenty resources, about eighty components, as well

530
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:33,825
as six tiers of armor, each of which had a helm, gloves, chest, and pants.

531
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:36,808
And then there were all the weapons, the gadgets, the trinkets, and the furniture.

532
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,740
This is one big game, so word of the wise,

533
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,842
crafting games require a shitload of content.

534
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,463
Had I actually died that year,

535
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:45,863
the game would never have gotten done.

536
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:48,745
As we ran up to May of 2015,

537
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,647
my first stem cell transplant loomed.

538
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,848
The doctors warned me that it would be incredibly painful.

539
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:57,770
The chemotherapy regimen a patient receives

540
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,811
for this sort of transplant I was getting

541
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,072
is ominously enough called BEAM.

542
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:06,715
Adam and Seth were nervous that they'd be trapped away from me

543
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,077
from the duration of my time in the hospital.

544
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:11,899
This was because I could have a minimum of visitors.

545
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,261
Anytime someone came to see me, it

546
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,722
would risk me dying from picking up some plague vector

547
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:19,724
they were carrying while I had no immune system.

548
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,285
So they decided to stay out, and they just

549
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,607
kept building chunks of crash lands while my chemo dripped

550
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:24,847
away.

551
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:29,110
And the chemo goes in slow for six hours a day,

552
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,171
and it has a lagged effect.

553
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:35,974
I was actually so nervous about how the treatment would go this time around that the only thing

554
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,395
I could do was escape.

555
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:38,916
And escape I did.

556
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:43,099
While the nausea rolled in, I picked up Dragon Age Inquisition.

557
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,642
On the sixth and final day of chemotherapy, I actually beat the game.

558
00:28:48,202 --> 00:28:51,044
As a spoiler alert, you kill a dragon in the end.

559
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,477
Something about the symbolism perked up my spirits

560
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:57,677
as I headed into that second week,

561
00:28:57,697 --> 00:28:59,237
and it's a good fucking thing it did,

562
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:02,838
because I don't think I understood what sickness was

563
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:05,119
until the second week of that transplant.

564
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,440
I got a 103 degree fever that lasted for four days.

565
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,281
During that time, I was vomiting every 45 minutes or so,

566
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:15,921
crapping out my insides and coughing away

567
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,082
like a broken leaf blower.

568
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,103
At one point, I had to stand for 60 seconds

569
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:21,023
for a chest X-ray.

570
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,583
I nearly passed out and then vomited.

571
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:27,738
Adam and Seth continued working on the game,

572
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:29,459
but couldn't handle the extreme stress

573
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:30,440
from the hospital stay.

574
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,021
They'd simply be getting drip-fed texts

575
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,541
from my fiance or my mom,

576
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:37,743
which read, fever at 104 and not breaking.

577
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:39,784
He's coughing so hard he's vomiting.

578
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,707
They dove into the work to escape,

579
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,228
but Crash Lens was now too sensitive.

580
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,769
It was our project,

581
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,070
and I was very much out of the picture.

582
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,350
They built a small puzzle game, kind of like threes,

583
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,632
and sent it to my phone so I had something

584
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,753
completely non-taxing to take my mind off of.

585
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:04,635
I played that game while I was cramped over

586
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:07,336
the hospital toilet for so long that my legs went numb.

587
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:11,519
I was running on fumes and transfusions at this point

588
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:12,820
for more than two weeks.

589
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,021
I watched some movies during this time,

590
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,002
but I don't remember any of them.

591
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,284
I don't remember an entire week of this whole experience.

592
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,743
I truly feel that I was pushed through the veil of life to the other side when my doctor

593
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:27,045
just held on to my pinky toe and then dragged me back across.

594
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:33,430
I did recover after a time, but the depth of that suffering sat with me for a very long

595
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:33,711
time.

596
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:39,775
I got out of the hospital a month after being interned, and I was restless, vaguely traumatized,

597
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:41,157
and really ready to build some shit.

598
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:45,580
The three of us brothers sat down and specced out what we had left to finish the game.

599
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:49,199
Adam had completed the backend systems for story creation,

600
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,041
and most of the in-game content was ready,

601
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:53,002
so now we really just needed the story.

602
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:56,624
But we also needed to go about getting on Steam Greenlight.

603
00:30:57,945 --> 00:31:00,327
We did a bunch of research on Greenlight's process

604
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:03,169
and realized that we need at least six weeks of lead time

605
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:04,309
to make sure that we were in the clear.

606
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,791
After looking at the games available on there

607
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:08,632
and seeing what their pitfalls and successes were,

608
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:10,534
we decided the majority of the focus

609
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:11,955
should be on the trailer.

610
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:17,987
We banged out a script for a ridiculous, voiced-over trailer inspired by BattleBlock Theater.

611
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:24,871
We finished the trailer and launched our Greenlight campaign on June 19th of 2015.

612
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:27,773
42 hours later, bright and early on Monday morning, we were through.

613
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:29,955
And we just had to finish the game.

614
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,257
Work on the story began in earnest.

615
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,180
Great writers suggest that you write stories from what you know.

616
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:43,226
So keeping that in mind, we decided we'd write the story of someone just trying to do their job while the whole world fucked with them.

617
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,946
Because we knew a whole lot about that by this point in time.

618
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:51,027
I dove back into the hospital in August of 2014 for another four weeks stay,

619
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:56,608
this time to receive the donor immune system that would, in theory, keep my cancer at bay for the rest of my life.

620
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,029
This one was shockingly easy. Aside from one allergic response, those four weeks breezed by.

621
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,490
Rather than disappear into work, I flung myself again into a game, Skyrim.

622
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:11,611
In adventuring across the world that Bethesda built, I was reinvigorated to complete crash

623
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:14,132
lanes and I also killed a shitload of dragons.

624
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:20,315
This was our goal, to create a place that people could escape into, full of joy and

625
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,436
exploration and it was now about time to pay it all forward.

626
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:27,818
With my hospital stays completed, we had nothing but open road in front of us.

627
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:32,220
We still didn't know if I had cancer or not, but we knew that we had done literally everything

628
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,061
medically known possible to help by this point.

629
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:37,348
We finished the story, the content for the game,

630
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:38,828
and got the marketing engine spun up,

631
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,949
which largely consisted of a spreadsheet

632
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,050
with lots and lots of email addresses in it.

633
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,512
For those of you marketing your own project,

634
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:49,554
there's a phenomenal 45 minute video from TotalBiscuit

635
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:52,115
about how to approach press and YouTubers.

636
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,177
The big lesson is make it easy for them to participate

637
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:58,178
in the way you want that's mutually beneficial.

638
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,480
Here's what our email to press ended up looking like.

639
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:07,916
You'll notice that the embargo date is very small at the bottom.

640
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,898
We'll come back to this error later on.

641
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:17,783
Another tool I suggest, since you should value your time as much as a dying person does, is Mail Merge for Google Sheets.

642
00:33:18,884 --> 00:33:20,285
It's cheap. It's like $30.

643
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:25,229
And it lets you send 1500 emails per day in a highly automated fashion.

644
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,813
Plus it has great open tracking, so you can actually A-B test your own press emails.

645
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,389
So as our press engine got rolling,

646
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,230
we started talking about beta testing.

647
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,072
Having nearly died a few times,

648
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,934
you can imagine that I was quite impatient

649
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,515
to get this fucking game out the door.

650
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:43,198
I was firmly in the camp of get it out by the end of 2015.

651
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,901
And the main reason honestly is because I was terrified.

652
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:50,465
My first cancer scan since receiving the stem cell

653
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:53,707
treatments was scheduled for December 6th of 2015.

654
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,790
That'd be the first one in the whole year

655
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:58,271
of treatment in the relapse.

656
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:01,114
and I didn't want to have anything getting in the way of getting the game out.

657
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:05,455
My brother Adam, ever the scientist, talked me down from the ledge.

658
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:09,295
He created a beta testing tool that let players report bugs from within the game.

659
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:14,956
Each feedback item also uploaded the player's save,

660
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:18,177
so if we were confused about what was happening, we could simply pull it down,

661
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,737
walk through it on our own device, and discover for ourselves.

662
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:24,818
We recruited 170 people who were in that Biscoch ID system we built,

663
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:26,778
and they tested the game for us.

664
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:32,678
Now since I had played through it in its entirety while I was building the story, I figured we'd find maybe a handful of bugs.

665
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:36,461
However, the game had grown to over 40 hours of content by this point.

666
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:41,385
So imagine my surprise when our testers found over 2,000 bugs in one month.

667
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:47,611
And more than bulletproofing the game, they came up against problems that challenged some of our original design pillars of exploration.

668
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:52,815
So we made several sweeping changes to the game's content and systems, alongside crushing all the bugs.

669
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,458
But there was one that we left out.

670
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,575
Players really wanted a quest tracker.

671
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:05,798
And in Crashlands, we chosen to give all the quests to players in the form of actual written dialogue that they had to read.

672
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,640
Their quest log, instead of having a list of tasks, had a list of conversations.

673
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,862
Arrayed as though through text message that they could read for clues.

674
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:16,643
In the same breadth of feedback, players would applaud the story

675
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:19,325
and their connection to the wily characters that we had built,

676
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:21,966
and then request a punch list of tasks to complete.

677
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:27,794
not realizing that if we provided a punch list that the narrative would have fallen to the wayside.

678
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:32,535
So it turns out if you want players to read your content, you could just make them do it.

679
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:33,475
We certainly did.

680
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:37,537
Without the beta testers, this game would have been absolute garbage.

681
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:40,637
Now that beta had wrapped, we were looking at our calendar

682
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,418
and sitting next to our platform contacts to see when a good launch window would be.

683
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:48,692
It turned out the third week of January 2016 was going to be calm.

684
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:53,253
So we began researching launch dates for other titles to see what we could do.

685
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:57,494
While we pondered our timing, I prepared for my scan.

686
00:35:57,534 --> 00:36:01,835
And on December 6, 2015, I went to the hospital with my heart in my chest.

687
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,356
I had never had a clean scan,

688
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:08,237
even when I'd been mistakenly declared cancer-free back in June of 2014.

689
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:11,218
I called my grandfather.

690
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,353
He's an Iowan farmer with a brutal work ethic who,

691
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,814
months earlier, had fallen off of a cattle walk

692
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:19,695
and broken six ribs, but decided to finish out

693
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,216
six hours of hard manual labor

694
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:22,757
before getting some ibuprofen.

695
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:26,098
I told him I was nervous for the scan

696
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:27,299
and about what the result would be.

697
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,120
There was a pause on his end of the line,

698
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,640
and then he said,

699
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:34,202
no matter what happens, it won't change anything.

700
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:38,964
I rolled back and forth in the PET scan machine

701
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:40,545
and felt a calm clarity building.

702
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:41,653
He was right.

703
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:44,475
I'd been thriving under the thumb of cancer

704
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,636
for the past two years.

705
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,257
I'd arguably done my best work.

706
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:49,539
I'd been my best for my fiance and brothers.

707
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,961
If the cancer was still there,

708
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:54,242
I'd still be doing the same thing as if it wasn't,

709
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:55,884
just with a few more interruptions.

710
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,226
If I wasn't gonna be dead, I wasn't gonna be done.

711
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,408
We went upstairs and waited in the doctor's office

712
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,529
for what felt like an eternity

713
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:04,630
for the oncologist to come by.

714
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,311
And she entered the room smiling,

715
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,132
but she's always smiling, so you can never tell.

716
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:11,766
Without much fuss, she finally told us the news.

717
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:14,349
There was nothing, nothing on the scan.

718
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,752
The cancer was gone.

719
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,655
The blood dragon, the real one that had plagued me

720
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,597
for two years, was dead.

721
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:24,841
We claimed January 21st as our launch date,

722
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:27,204
and suddenly had a fire under our asses

723
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:28,966
to make sure that everything was ready to go.

724
00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:34,163
The lead up to launch felt very similar to getting that final scan because we had done

725
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:38,088
everything we knew was possible under our own power and to the best of our ability over

726
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:44,356
the past two years, and now we were simply waiting in an eerily calm manner for the market

727
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,958
to tell us if we had done things correctly.

728
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:51,578
No one guaranteed us anything on launch day.

729
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:54,280
While we had strong confidence in several sites

730
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,680
that would be covering the game on day one,

731
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,282
we had no direct confirmation from any one of the more

732
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:01,024
than 1,000 press and influencers we'd emailed.

733
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,446
Further, the storefronts themselves will never tell you

734
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,988
if you're gonna get a feature, especially if you're an indie.

735
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,177
While we kept in contact with other people at Steam,

736
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,758
iTunes, and Google Play, we genuinely did not know

737
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:15,040
if we'd be getting featuring treatment on day one,

738
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,321
and we desperately needed it,

739
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,182
because again, we had no marketing dollars.

740
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,384
This was a straight PR campaign we were running.

741
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,306
So despite the insane level of uncertainty,

742
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:25,067
the three of us were comfortable.

743
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,008
We kind of learned to be so

744
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:28,789
from the previous two years of nonsense.

745
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,851
We were confident that we had done the best that we could,

746
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,412
and so we resigned ourselves.

747
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,921
to, we resigned our fretting to the realm of uselessness

748
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,802
and simply tried to relax instead.

749
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:42,623
That is, until our press embargo was broken.

750
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,204
So here's the email from earlier, again,

751
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:47,985
note that we put the press embargo date

752
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,445
at the bottom of the box.

753
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,566
A big YouTuber decided to play the game and loved it,

754
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,547
so he made and scheduled some videos

755
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:56,627
and didn't pay attention to the embargo date.

756
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:00,148
His videos went live a full nine days before launch.

757
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:06,163
The internet is a remarkably fickle place, and we thought that if the gates opened and

758
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:09,584
all of our YouTubers launched their videos a week early, that by the time our actual

759
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,764
launch rolled around, we'd be long forgotten.

760
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:14,665
Timing was critical for this whole operation to work.

761
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:17,625
And then angry emails started coming in.

762
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:22,646
Other YouTubers who had read the embargo date were upset that we gave this person an exclusive.

763
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,787
And they started threatening to pull coverage.

764
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:29,288
And you have to understand why, which is that the first video that launches is almost guaranteed

765
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:30,308
to lead in search results.

766
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:36,194
Which naturally means that other YouTubers will be at a huge disadvantage when it comes to gaining views on a popular game.

767
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,116
So we began strategizing for how to contain the damage coming out of this.

768
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:45,038
The easiest way by far was simply to reach out to the YouTuber and ask him to pull the video down for a few days.

769
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,059
We sent him an email,

770
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,261
and were met with an automated on vacation message.

771
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,804
He had scheduled three more videos over the next few days and hopped on an international flight.

772
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:06,079
We frantically reached out to him via Twitter and a couple other means but could not get a hold of him in a day pass, and a second video popped up.

773
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:11,163
Now other smaller YouTubers who had planned coverage of the game started telling us that they would have to pull out.

774
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:14,426
This was heartening in at least one way, which was confirmation.

775
00:40:15,627 --> 00:40:19,310
Up until this point, we had no guarantees that anyone gave a shit about what we were doing.

776
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,833
And now we suddenly had a crowd of people talking about their coverage for the game.

777
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,435
They were furious, of course, but they were talking.

778
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,234
We went back into strategy mode and examined our options.

779
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:33,716
We couldn't trust that the YouTuber in question would be responding to any of our communications

780
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,356
by the time his suite of videos came out.

781
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:39,618
And that meant there was a guaranteed flow of Let's Play videos coming from one person,

782
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:44,159
which meant that we were guaranteed to be generating ill will with the entire YouTuber community

783
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,100
if we didn't put a stop to it.

784
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,701
It seemed our only option was to lift the embargo.

785
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,461
Just for YouTubers.

786
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:52,062
And explain what had happened.

787
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:58,027
This was not ideal in every way, as we wanted players to be able to purchase the game the moment that they saw it.

788
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:02,290
But we were cornered, since we'd want to work with all these YouTubers in the future.

789
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:06,793
We emailed everyone and explained the situation and lifted the embargo.

790
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:09,015
We have a saying in the studio,

791
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,616
there's no such thing as a good launch.

792
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:16,680
Something or everything will go wrong and threaten to derail all of your work.

793
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,003
Luckily, our training and keeping a calm head and researching our options from the previous

794
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,444
two years made it easier to figure out what to do.

795
00:41:24,804 --> 00:41:28,226
With the Let's Players unleashed, a small amount of hype around the game began to build.

796
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:34,169
Several prominent YouTubers released videos with view counts in the hundreds of thousands,

797
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:37,010
and we watched each one with a mix of excitement and terror.

798
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,972
Then we found that these people were having a genuinely good time with the game.

799
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,638
Relief kind of started to settle in.

800
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:46,499
We knew if nothing else happened,

801
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,160
we at least made something that was good.

802
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:50,322
Launch day loomed.

803
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:52,544
We gathered whiskey, wine, and our spouses

804
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:55,626
in my small apartment and prepared to launch the game

805
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,047
on mobile on the evening of the 20th.

806
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,589
And then an email came in from Steam.

807
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,512
My heart sank in my chest thinking we somehow

808
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:04,073
missed something and we were gonna get delayed.

809
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:05,914
They quickly skimmed it and found out

810
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:06,875
that the opposite had happened.

811
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:11,653
Due to the hype surrounding the game and the preview coverage we'd gotten, Steam was taking

812
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:12,293
a chance on us.

813
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,294
They were going to give us a pop-up feature spot for the weekend.

814
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:17,075
We could hardly believe it.

815
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:21,957
We hit the button at 11pm on January 20th and Crashlands went live on mobile.

816
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:26,059
The next morning Adam and Seth arrived at 7am and we launched on Steam.

817
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:27,440
And then we waited.

818
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:32,979
Crashlands received an incredible amount of featuring support from the storefronts.

819
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,821
On Steam, that weekend pop-up kept our sales numbers high for four days,

820
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:40,003
and on iTunes, we received the Editor's Choice Award for iPad,

821
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:41,264
which is a full week of featuring.

822
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:43,925
Google Play gave us a little front-page nod.

823
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:47,227
All of these were due to us building relationships

824
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:49,748
with the platform holders over the previous year.

825
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:52,469
Simply an email here and there, showing press coverage,

826
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:55,191
showing that we were still working on the game, and keeping them excited.

827
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:57,031
We sold 131,000 units in ten days.

828
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:00,956
between all three platforms.

829
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:04,298
We made back 10 times our meager dev costs.

830
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:07,720
More importantly, players loved the game,

831
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,780
especially on mobile.

832
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,322
We even stood as the highest rated mobile game

833
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:12,702
of all time for a few weeks,

834
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:14,723
and we remained toward the top to this day.

835
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,365
Our reviews were glowing across the board,

836
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:19,446
and though we didn't strike at the heart of the PC crowd

837
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,346
as much as we'd like to,

838
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,888
we still secured a solid review from PC Gamer,

839
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:24,469
which is our first PC review.

840
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,350
And then came the notes from players.

841
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:31,998
People who knew nothing of the origins of this game

842
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:35,181
wrote to us, telling us about how it was helping them

843
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:35,681
get through life.

844
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,804
One man suffering from PTSD found relief

845
00:43:40,844 --> 00:43:43,286
for the first time in months for 60 hours.

846
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,248
Another dealing with the death of a loved one

847
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:48,349
found comfort in the ridiculous stories we'd read.

848
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:52,912
And yet another who had just started chemotherapy

849
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:54,053
and picked the game up on a whim

850
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:55,814
found his treatments forgotten.

851
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:01,644
Crashlands, the game we made to escape our own reality,

852
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:04,765
was now casting a spell on hundreds of thousands of players

853
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:07,626
and it worked and it mattered.

854
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:14,469
To date, Crashlands has sold 374,157 units

855
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:15,789
across all three platforms.

856
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,370
It's swollen the ranks of our Bscotch ID system

857
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,311
to more than 350,000 people,

858
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:22,591
meaning our next game launch

859
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:25,052
is likely to be even more powerful than this one.

860
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:28,204
We were nominated for Best Mobile Game of the Year

861
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:29,724
at DICE just last week.

862
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,745
We got a nod from Time Magazine.

863
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:33,806
That's one of the top 10 games of 2016.

864
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,107
And we won the much-coveted

865
00:44:36,147 --> 00:44:38,108
Touch Arcade Game of the Year award for mobile.

866
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,549
With revenue from Crashlands,

867
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,190
we've even managed to expand our studio,

868
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,991
so it's no longer just the three of us brothers

869
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:44,951
struggling to get by.

870
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:47,352
With the addition of our four hires,

871
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,113
Andy, Tifa, Shuren, Monique,

872
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:51,634
we've begun an expedition into creating meaning

873
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:52,435
in a whole other way,

874
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,016
through creating a studio and a vibrant work culture.

875
00:44:56,856 --> 00:45:00,659
When my brothers and I spoke about Crashlands before launch, we all agreed on what it meant to us.

876
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:07,464
This game, the story, and the work on it all represent the biggest monument of hope and retaliation that we could craft.

877
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:11,227
It's the single biggest fuck you to cancer that we could deliver.

878
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,972
Making games and meaning out of life is hard.

879
00:45:19,364 --> 00:45:22,867
If you take a designer's eye to the work you do and the way you live, you'll come to find

880
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:27,231
that the unimportant, falsely urgent activities that take up much of your time will begin

881
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:27,771
to fall away.

882
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:33,877
If you focus on your processes rather than your goals, if you stay grounded in the world

883
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:39,101
around you and control what you can, if you rely on those around you, and if you approach

884
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:43,585
work as the daily act of making meaning in your life, the way you live and the games

885
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:45,306
you produce will naturally get better.

886
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,561
Most importantly, you'll get to create the experiences

887
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:50,122
that give other people meaning

888
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:52,483
when their world doesn't seem to have any.

889
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:56,064
So when the press ignore your emails,

890
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:59,826
when your launch fails or your family forgets your birthday,

891
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:02,387
and when your doctor tells you

892
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,827
you might not be around for another year,

893
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:06,108
and when you experience setback after setback

894
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:08,249
as you try to make something meaningful out of your work,

895
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:12,351
just keep in mind this basic fact of life in Gabe Dove.

896
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:15,752
If you're not dead, you're not done.

897
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:17,235
Thank you.

898
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,409
Thanks.

899
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:54,391
Sit down, sit down, you rascals.

900
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:54,871
Sit down.

901
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:58,694
Oh, good God.

902
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:02,617
Anybody got any questions?

903
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:03,337
I'm an open book.

904
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:04,038
Thank you.

905
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:04,578
Yeah, of course.

906
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:07,541
Hope it's worthwhile.

907
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:11,403
If you got any questions, feel free to snag the mic.

908
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:13,325
If you got personal stuff you don't wanna talk about,

909
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:14,265
you can just shoot me an email.

910
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:15,386
It's always good too.

911
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,048
My voice is cracking all over the place.

912
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,837
And if you have any specific questions about, you know,

913
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:26,418
mobile and cross-platform game dev stuff,

914
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:28,118
we know a lot of technical things too,

915
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,939
besides all of our story nonsense, so.

916
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,262
Hello.

917
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:43,263
Hello, hello.

918
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:47,564
Lookup88games, I've got a question about launching on.

919
00:47:48,571 --> 00:47:51,175
mobile and steam at nearly the same time.

920
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:54,902
I've kind of, in my experience that.

921
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,232
Mobile games, if you're coming from Steam,

922
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:57,972
that's a good thing.

923
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,754
If you're going from mobile to Steam,

924
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:02,375
you sort of maybe looked down on a bit.

925
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:03,055
Correct.

926
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,077
How was your experience doing it at the same time

927
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:07,518
and any lessons learned there?

928
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,700
Yes, I think, this is honestly one of the things

929
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,261
we did not, I think, control very well

930
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:13,962
with our marketing message regarding the game.

931
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:17,264
Our goal at the studio is to build cross-platform games

932
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:18,985
that essentially don't exist,

933
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:20,686
they don't exist on any platform,

934
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:23,247
they flex to play really well on any,

935
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,648
and so they're not just like a shitty port.

936
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:27,568
And the problem is, if you're going from mobile to PC,

937
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:29,690
as you said, there's just this general idea

938
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,052
that if you're on mobile, then the game is terrible.

939
00:48:32,873 --> 00:48:34,274
And we did have that happen.

940
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:36,976
Actually, it was noted in our PC gamer review

941
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,837
that the controls seem simple,

942
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,098
the game seemed kind of simple.

943
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:41,399
And the interesting thing about it is

944
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,902
we actually employed control scheme changes.

945
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,463
We added controller support a few months later.

946
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:48,345
A reviewer came by at PAX

947
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:49,506
and played the game with a controller.

948
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,508
And he said, wow, this seems way more complex.

949
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,070
We said, yeah, we split one interaction

950
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,251
into 14 different buttons.

951
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,132
Like, it was all there before, you know?

952
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:03,992
So there's a lot of that messaging

953
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:06,173
that I think is hard, honestly very hard to control.

954
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:07,914
There is a natural bias there.

955
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,435
I honestly think for us, it's gonna be a matter

956
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:13,336
of sort of controlling that upfront.

957
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:14,796
Crashlands was originally talked about

958
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:17,618
first as a mobile game, and then we added PC on later.

959
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,359
So I think we kind of shot ourselves in the foot

960
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:21,239
in a couple ways with that,

961
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:23,600
because our marketing messaging was never really controlled

962
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,540
because we didn't know what we were doing.

963
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,842
So I think approaching that from the angle of saying,

964
00:49:26,862 --> 00:49:29,504
this is a cross-platform title, as opposed to saying

965
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:31,626
a mobile title or a PC title should help a lot

966
00:49:31,646 --> 00:49:33,087
with alleviating some of that stuff in the future.

967
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:34,309
Thank you.

968
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:43,617
Hello.

969
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:44,217
Hello.

970
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:49,314
So, I was incredibly impressed with your, the Butterscotch ID,

971
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:56,038
with kind of trying to create a sustained player base, or

972
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:59,481
communication system between multiple games. I was just

973
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,882
curious if you could talk about that a little bit more, like

974
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:03,323
what the inspiration was for that. And as...

975
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:08,745
with how you came from it from free mobile games leading into Crashlands?

976
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:14,329
Yeah, so the question is basically the inception of Bscotch ID as our back-end proprietary

977
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:18,752
login system and what we're trying to hope to do with it, I think, in the future.

978
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:23,655
So what we saw from our, we launched four games, two of them right before we started

979
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:25,256
working on Crashlands and two we actually launched.

980
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:31,180
During two of those eight hour games that we made we spun out into slightly larger projects the first of which had

981
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,102
basically our first experiment with Bscotch ID in it and

982
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,664
What we found is that we used we wanted to use it to roll

983
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:41,127
So everyone's played Katamari Damacy right like a roll the ball forward make it bigger and bigger

984
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:42,889
This is basically the problem we had

985
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,090
is we were looking at our game dev stuff

986
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,111
and we're like, all right, we have three million players,

987
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,413
but we can't just roll them forward into our next title.

988
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:52,494
And so the idea was that if we could just get an email

989
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,676
and then provide a suite of other services

990
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:57,978
to players that sort of sweeten the pot

991
00:50:57,998 --> 00:50:58,998
to keep them active in there.

992
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,939
So there's actually friends, there's a friend system,

993
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,680
there's a perk system.

994
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,962
So if you achieve something in Crashlands,

995
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,163
like you beat a specific boss,

996
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:09,964
it'll actually unlock content in one of our other games

997
00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:10,945
if you're logged in.

998
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:13,934
So it starts doing this sort of cross-promotion

999
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:16,516
of the games themselves, and then we use this,

1000
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:18,317
we sort of watch players' activity,

1001
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,038
and we can send them specific messages

1002
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:22,800
regarding certain games that they're likely to play

1003
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,581
based on what we've seen

1004
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:25,542
from other user statistics in the past.

1005
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,224
So we actually, we don't use Flurry.

1006
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,645
We don't use any of those things.

1007
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,766
We found them generally, analytics to generally

1008
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:32,488
be overwhelming and not useful data,

1009
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,229
almost across the board.

1010
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:36,450
And with this sort of stuff, we've slowly started

1011
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,571
piecing this in together so that our whole portfolio

1012
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:40,272
is back and forth supported.

1013
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:41,992
So when we launch the next game,

1014
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:44,133
we'll send an email to 350,000 people,

1015
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:46,795
which we've estimated is going to be about 50,000 people

1016
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:49,396
on launch day who will open the email and see it.

1017
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,399
We don't know what the buying rate is yet, but we'll be able to talk about that hopefully in like six months.

1018
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,820
And then from there, you know, if they get into the game, if they're a new person getting into the game,

1019
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:00,522
we're going to put perks in the next title that we launch

1020
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:04,363
that retroactively go into crashlands that go into our previous four titles.

1021
00:52:04,803 --> 00:52:07,104
So you'll basically fall into our portfolio.

1022
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,346
And a big inspiration for it was actually Blizzard with Battle.net.

1023
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:14,028
a lot of the cross-game stuff that they do,

1024
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,829
and also they're sort of fully independent.

1025
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:17,810
And our goal is to be a fully independent studio

1026
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,432
and sort of reverse a lot of the needs that we have

1027
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:22,354
for being completely reliant on the platforms.

1028
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:24,135
Like we love all three of our platforms, of course,

1029
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,176
but it's really terrifying,

1030
00:52:26,316 --> 00:52:27,877
given how many games are coming out nowadays,

1031
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:30,539
to know that with very few marketing dollars,

1032
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,302
that if you don't get a feature spot with a premium game,

1033
00:52:33,682 --> 00:52:34,443
that you're kind of doomed.

1034
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:36,986
So we wanted to kind of take some control back

1035
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:37,846
into our realm for that.

1036
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:39,969
So as a quick follow up to a question of that,

1037
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:42,832
if you don't mind, is the plan then

1038
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:45,294
to, as you go on releasing new titles,

1039
00:52:45,414 --> 00:52:48,658
to continue doing even just small updates

1040
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:50,580
to your existing library?

1041
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,641
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so things like adding,

1042
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:54,042
you know, adding a few new achievements

1043
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:56,264
and that sort of thing, doesn't take very long for us.

1044
00:52:56,804 --> 00:52:58,165
We actually built in, there's a bunch of hidden ones

1045
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:59,306
that people have already unlocked

1046
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:01,047
that point to the other games

1047
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:02,469
that just don't do anything right now.

1048
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:03,870
So we'll just go back in and update them

1049
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,552
and people will get new ships in like a previous game

1050
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:07,672
based on some of their activity there.

1051
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:10,054
So yeah, we'll keep on updating stuff.

1052
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:11,015
And then eventually at some point,

1053
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,317
if it's like, you know, five years down the road

1054
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:15,178
and we got 12 games or something crazy going on,

1055
00:53:15,198 --> 00:53:16,719
then we won't worry about some of the older titles.

1056
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,861
But yeah, cool.

1057
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:23,188
Anybody else?

1058
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,691
Hey, you mentioned using storytelling to differentiate

1059
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:31,571
from other crafting games

1060
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:37,114
And I was just curious how you and your brothers collaborated on the writing you know if one person was in charge or a few

1061
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:41,375
You kind of shared that responsibility. Yeah, yeah, so

1062
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:46,517
So everything we do is so we have is just extremely collaborative work environment. I guess and so

1063
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:50,593
It was basically the case we all huddled for like three days

1064
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:52,414
and came up with the major beats of the story.

1065
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:55,376
So a lot of the really good advice I've seen is

1066
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:56,537
if you have a beginning and an end,

1067
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:58,098
then you can just fill it in.

1068
00:53:58,118 --> 00:53:59,599
So we kind of figured out what exactly that was

1069
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:00,659
and figured out what the theme was,

1070
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,601
which is essentially this, in the case of Crashlands,

1071
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:06,343
it's a delivery driver who's just trying to essentially

1072
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,944
ship their fucking packages.

1073
00:54:08,104 --> 00:54:10,065
And like, they get stolen from you in the beginning,

1074
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:11,706
your ship crashes, and then you have to go through

1075
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:14,468
and you essentially solve a world domination plot

1076
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:15,268
that an alien has.

1077
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:18,570
unrelated you're just trying to ship your goddamn packages and so

1078
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,312
And so we thought this was a hilarious thing like we wanted to subvert the usual sort of you're the only one

1079
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:25,553
Like now you're like a UPS driver. It's fine

1080
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:30,955
So we actually started we basically started out with that front and back side of it

1081
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:34,204
And then Adam finished building this backend tool.

1082
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:36,005
So it's almost like story programming.

1083
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:37,806
It's called the Creator, it's a little thing

1084
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:38,626
we built in the backend.

1085
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:40,687
And so you can go in there and you can trigger,

1086
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:43,208
you trigger events, you can trigger changes in the world

1087
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:45,849
based on players completing quest objectives.

1088
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:49,191
And so I basically went in and just laid down

1089
00:54:50,031 --> 00:54:51,954
I think it took about three months to write the whole thing.

1090
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,439
It's about 50,000 words, basically a book.

1091
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,142
56,000 words and I would lay down sort of the broad strokes,

1092
00:54:58,162 --> 00:55:00,245
just go through and power through the whole thing.

1093
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:02,749
And then Adam would come back in and clean up stuff

1094
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:04,792
and add funny jokes and things.

1095
00:55:04,812 --> 00:55:06,153
I think one of my favorite things actually.

1096
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:09,003
Like, the creator lets you do all sorts of crazy shit,

1097
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:10,844
but my favorite one is there's this one story

1098
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:14,706
involving a tendrom, which is like a furry goat person.

1099
00:55:15,406 --> 00:55:18,008
And they have, they're trying to hide

1100
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,669
from the villain in the game.

1101
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:21,289
And when you walk up to them,

1102
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:23,371
you find out that like they're hiding in a plant.

1103
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:26,612
And then they, like, as the quest trigger shifts,

1104
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:27,272
then they appear.

1105
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,253
So it looks like they're transforming

1106
00:55:29,273 --> 00:55:30,654
from a plant into a creature,

1107
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:32,795
when in reality we're just swapping these assets out.

1108
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:34,175
And so like having a few different people

1109
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:36,696
tackle this thing actually showed,

1110
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:37,857
like I didn't realize we could do that

1111
00:55:37,937 --> 00:55:38,797
with the engine, essentially.

1112
00:55:39,177 --> 00:55:40,978
So having a bunch of these sort of collaboration points

1113
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:42,939
was fantastic for getting all the work done.

1114
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:43,759
So essentially we do,

1115
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:46,380
we sometimes refer to it in farming terminology

1116
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,221
as plow, seed, water.

1117
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,284
So one person comes in, does like 90% of the work.

1118
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:55,207
Next person comes in, finishes and polishes stuff up,

1119
00:55:55,568 --> 00:55:56,729
and then someone comes in and looks at it,

1120
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:58,090
it's like tweaking some stuff here and there.

1121
00:55:59,051 --> 00:55:59,231
Thank you.

1122
00:55:59,432 --> 00:55:59,572
Hmm?

1123
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:05,098
Cool.

1124
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:08,341
Well, if that'll be all, I think you guys are free to go.

1125
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:09,703
Thanks so much.
