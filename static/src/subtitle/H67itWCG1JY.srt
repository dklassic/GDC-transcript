00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:04,570
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,071
My name is Michael Molinari,

3
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:08,673
developer of a failed game called CityStream,

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:12,035
an experimental live game launched in January 2016,

5
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:15,998
lasting for a whopping two months before we shut it down.

6
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:19,160
While this is a talk about the ultimate failure of the game,

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,702
there were many interesting things that came out of it,

8
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:23,303
so I'd like to cover those as well

9
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:25,745
to help paint a clearer picture of its history.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,863
CityStream was a strange combination of idle games, Twitch Plays games, and real-time DMing.

11
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:37,546
It was created as a way to counter the experience of earlier Twitch Plays games like Twitch

12
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,867
Plays Pokemon or our previous game, Choice Chamber.

13
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:44,369
The game was still played via the chatroom of a live internet broadcast, but this time

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,471
the aim was to make each player's actions feel like they mattered, no matter how many

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,792
concurrent active players there were.

16
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:55,629
While the game's potential popularity was unknown before launch, we still prepared the

17
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:00,772
engine to be able to handle thousands of simultaneous players using staggered update cycles and

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,494
accelerated variables to compensate.

19
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:08,358
Our peak player count was around 100, so things never quite took off as we had hoped.

20
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:14,030
In the previous game we made, Choice Chamber, we added a few viewer interactions that celebrated

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,590
individuals.

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,912
While they were small successes, we wanted to make a game that championed every action

23
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:21,413
of every player, making anyone's efforts feel worthwhile.

24
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:26,154
The most obvious design change was to almost completely remove timed polls and instead

25
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,716
allow players to interact at their own pace, performing tasks as they saw fit.

26
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:34,277
This ended up being realized as a collaborative city-building game with elements of tower

27
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:35,278
defense and RPGs.

28
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,632
Each player had their own avatar, responsibilities, stats, and inventory, persistent across play

29
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:45,493
sessions, and all saved locally on our host machine.

30
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:50,756
Saving all data to a single file wasn't a very safe or smart method, as crashes and

31
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,618
bugs forced us to keep a daily backup should the world state need to be rolled back.

32
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:59,320
In one case, some players exploited a glitch overnight for which they apologized the following

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,600
morning.

34
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,362
The saved data needed to be rechecked against the previous days to roll back specific players

35
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,303
as a punishment for abusing a broken feature.

36
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:12,501
While the idea of a job wasn't formally assigned, most players took responsibility for what

37
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,744
they did best, forming a community that did in fact work together as a team.

38
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,708
There was even a player that was present at every stream, every day, for two straight

39
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:20,989
months.

40
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,073
This isn't to say any given player did one thing while playing, but enough time playing

41
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,655
with the same group of people allowed them to become quite efficient.

42
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:33,781
Since the game was played from the Twitch chat, there was no additional software to

43
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,044
download, no additional logins to create, and no cost to play.

44
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:41,910
This low bar for entry excited us, though we soon realized such a feature was relatively

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,653
lackluster when the game itself had troubles getting people excited.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,002
Most importantly, it was only playable from one channel,

47
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,385
ours, giving us full control over how and when people

48
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:52,146
experience the game.

49
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:55,769
This was especially useful in monetizing the experience

50
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,411
for those who wanted to help support development.

51
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,274
It's not uncommon for a Twitch viewer to want to

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,556
continually pay money directly to a broadcaster

53
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,558
to not only show support, but to make sure they can

54
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:05,599
continue doing what they do.

55
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:10,298
Players who made contributions were rewarded directly in the game in real time.

56
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:14,440
Most perks were cosmetic as a way of literally showing support, though there were some perks

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,281
that acted as super attacks during battle.

58
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,823
In those instances, the super attack would benefit all players, not just the contributor,

59
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:23,604
helping to cement the idea of this being a team effort.

60
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,505
We didn't want a player to feel like they were inferior because they couldn't afford

61
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:28,926
to spend as much money as someone else.

62
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,220
The cosmetic perks were helpful in showing support in the game while advertising their

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,704
benefits but weren't quite enough to entice a lot of players.

64
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:40,971
They were also permanent, missing an opportunity to continue receiving income from players

65
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,552
who wanted to help.

66
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:47,158
CityStream went through constant iteration, both before and after launching.

67
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:51,599
We were in a rush from Twitch to launch in time for their Twitch Plays Gaming category,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,341
debuting with the smallest of core loops after a mere six weeks of development.

69
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:59,603
We would go on to add new content to the game every day for two months, including tweaks

70
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:00,223
and bug fixes.

71
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:05,274
Timed polls are a major element from almost every Twitch Plays

72
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:06,774
game, including our own choice chamber,

73
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,195
but they turn a group of people into a single number,

74
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,296
making an individual's vote not seem to matter.

75
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,176
We noticed in other games that viewers

76
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:14,637
would participate most often when

77
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,638
their decision had the chance of making them feel special.

78
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,298
For this reason, we wanted to do away with polls completely,

79
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,299
but a few remained for major group decisions,

80
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,700
accounting for less than 2% of all possible commands.

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,181
We eventually moved polls to the top of the screen

82
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,741
to prevent city progress from halting

83
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,402
for one minute at a time, a feature request from players

84
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,023
who had a schedule to keep in the city.

85
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,824
All other interaction in the game was done as an individual player, where the sum of

86
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,926
all players' actions contributed to game progress.

87
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:43,870
To prevent the already flooded chatroom from being more crowded, we added a whisper bot

88
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,993
to have a private chat with any player, informing them of their status, inventory, and other

89
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:48,833
events unique to them.

90
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:53,677
This also helped out with the video delay that could range from 15 to 60 seconds, dictated

91
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,098
by a viewer's location and connection.

92
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,801
We actually needed to get whitelisted by Twitch,

93
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,686
so we weren't marked as a mass Whisperbot, which we were.

94
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,591
This worked fairly well, aside from a few nights

95
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:04,794
when the Whisper servers were down,

96
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,619
forcing us to manually tell individual players their status.

97
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:11,263
Much of the game's progress was gated by time,

98
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,144
to both add weight to players' decisions

99
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,006
and to make a rather simple game

100
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:16,527
last far longer than it really should have.

101
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,629
Every action took time to execute,

102
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:20,550
some taking seconds, others hours.

103
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,812
We encouraged teamwork by allowing most actions

104
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,614
to complete faster as more players helped out.

105
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:26,335
Diminishing returns were added

106
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:27,977
where each additional player contributed

107
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,519
less than the one before to prevent a mob of players

108
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,901
from going around completing every task immediately.

109
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:37,841
Most buildings would perform their functions linearly as players entered, such as offensive

110
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:41,104
towers shooting lasers equal to the combined powers of all players inside.

111
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:46,169
Other buildings like the XP farming disco stopped operating if too many players were

112
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,212
on the dance floor, forcing them to manage work and play carefully.

113
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:52,499
These kinds of things led to emergent specialization,

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,281
which was pretty cool.

115
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,323
Suddenly players would have to communicate

116
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,945
outside of regular play to decide

117
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,668
where each one's skills could be best utilized.

118
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,912
Some even created chatbots to automate certain processes,

119
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,935
though they soon retracted them when they realized

120
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,557
how much fun that removed from the experience.

121
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:10,819
One interesting thing we added was a building that buffed adjacent buildings, but only if

122
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:11,919
they were all the same color.

123
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:16,441
This led to players designating neighborhoods, territories, and even having gang wars as

124
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,021
they fought for control of different districts.

125
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,163
Where they were once arbitrarily deciding building colors, they were now arguing over

126
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:26,664
the benefits of having a chocolate lookout post versus a smoke research lab in a particular

127
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:26,924
spot.

128
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:32,479
Tying into the game's end goal of reaching the moon, we had special events occur during

129
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,741
real world moon phases to add to the narrative.

130
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:39,025
This made players change up their strategies, even planning ahead based on the lunar calendar.

131
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:46,151
After the game had finished, we had a one-day special revival of CityStream on April Fool's

132
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:47,172
Day called CityStream.

133
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,033
Extreme! Where all variables were cranked to 11, there were 9 moons and a bunch of rainbows and

134
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:55,897
explosions. Players accomplished as much that day as they did in the first one and a half months

135
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,640
the first time. Though this can also be attributed to the game actually containing all of its

136
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,461
content from the beginning.

137
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:06,151
Early on we felt it would become boring to stare at the same steady grid for hours, even

138
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:12,500
days at a time, and decided to create a narrator, Beep, to connect with players and give them

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,346
a focal point for communicating with the game, similar to how you see a green screened human

140
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,089
player in the corner of any other Twitch channel.

141
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,498
Beep was supposed to be driven by AI

142
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,280
to have dynamic conversations with players,

143
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,282
but we couldn't get something so complex

144
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,784
working in the short time we had.

145
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,807
Not wanting to have him have predictable,

146
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,128
canned responses to everything,

147
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,770
we took shifts playing as Beep

148
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,612
to respond back to players directly,

149
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,274
acting as a man behind the curtain.

150
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:39,080
They loved him so much, we continued DMing as him each day,

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,381
making sure to keep players engaged through the mundanity

152
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,302
of crafting a city one resource at a time.

153
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,663
Unfortunately, this meant we had to cut the broadcast

154
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:48,044
to about eight hours each day, using the rest of the day

155
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,306
to continue working on new content tweaks and bug fixes.

156
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:53,367
We continued expanding Beep's arsenal of MCing

157
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,608
from a dozen animated emotions to wearing hats

158
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,549
for various occasions, such as a general's hat

159
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,350
during battle and a nightcap when it was time

160
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,171
to end the day's stream.

161
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:04,595
It was so important to us that Beat maintained this relationship with players that we created

162
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:08,499
a system to remotely control his responses by sending private whispers to the game via

163
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,421
the Twitch mobile app.

164
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:13,445
This was especially attractive to us as it didn't require creating additional software.

165
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,949
It allowed us to go out to dinners and functions completely ignoring our friends.

166
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,622
Our original idea was for this to be a 24 hour live channel

167
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,225
that ran itself, only needing to be taken down for servicing.

168
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:26,327
But with having to play as Beep during the day

169
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:27,969
and working on the game in the evenings,

170
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,671
our days turned into double shifts.

171
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,374
Combined with poor revenue and retention overall,

172
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,597
this ultimately forced us to discontinue the game

173
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:35,217
after two months.

174
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,612
We could have continued making tweaks and adding ways to get players excited,

175
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,513
but working 14 plus hours a day at less than minimum wage

176
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,494
made us consider the possibility that maybe we should cut our losses

177
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,254
and apply what we learned in future projects.

178
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,835
That's the only picture I have of our battle station.

179
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,236
That's Chelsea playing as Beep.

180
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:53,437
The players could actually tell when I was playing as Beep

181
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:54,337
and when she was playing as Beep

182
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,998
because she was a much better storyteller than I was.

183
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:01,097
Monetising a game like this was tricky since it was unlike anything else out there.

184
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,519
Not surprisingly, this is where our design fell apart the quickest.

185
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,403
We offered additional cosmetic and gameplay perks to players who subscribe to the Twitch

186
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,764
channel or donated via a third party system.

187
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:12,902
However, almost all perks were permanent,

188
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,844
offering little reason to continue supporting.

189
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,206
This is a missed opportunity for diehard players

190
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,607
to have a long-term contribution.

191
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,749
We noticed our most generous players

192
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,730
go from throwing hundreds of dollars at us

193
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,473
to tossing a few coins after just a couple of days,

194
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,175
mostly because the game wasn't compensating them accordingly

195
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:29,716
but also because we never thought someone

196
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,357
would want to donate so much at a time,

197
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,799
thereby never designing for it.

198
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:33,919
Oops.

199
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,181
It actually says oops on my slide here.

200
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,532
To avoid constant grinding, we added a wishing well,

201
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,134
where players could offer some or all of their inventory

202
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:43,675
in exchange for a chance at winning big.

203
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,697
Some players became addicted, gambled away everything,

204
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,398
then grinded resources to do it all again.

205
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,720
We tried to break this habit by time-gating

206
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,201
additional wishes after jackpots,

207
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,342
but that simply let them grind more resources

208
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:55,183
at a casual pace.

209
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:59,186
We also didn't monetize wishing for legal and moral reasons.

210
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,009
Despite this, there were still ways to manipulate the system,

211
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,010
allowing some players to build entire districts

212
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,911
on their own overnight.

213
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,794
It was a broken system, even after continued tweaking.

214
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,857
Battling was a huge component of the core loop,

215
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,519
where players would stop building to defend the city

216
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,500
from an army of creatures.

217
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,962
Offensive buildings would fire from afar,

218
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,904
while brave players would use melee attacks

219
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,025
and weapons on the battlefield.

220
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,532
and if a creature made it to the city and destroyed a building, it was permanently gone

221
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:25,953
from the game.

222
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:30,175
The difficulty of those battles was intended to be automated by a system that accounted

223
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:34,598
for the number of active players and their combined potential power, curating the experience

224
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:35,699
to be challenging yet possible.

225
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,222
This system also did not get finished in time, so while we were playing as the narrator Beep,

226
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:42,583
we were also deciding how and when every battle unfolded.

227
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,687
Even with this human control, many battles appeared either too easy or so unfair we had

228
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:50,609
to roll back the save file because every building was destroyed.

229
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:56,275
We improvised these moments to players, usually mentioning a time machine of some sort, but they knew we screwed something up.

230
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:03,340
Even the final battle had to be painstakingly curated to make sure it lasted more than a few minutes, but didn't erase two months of work.

231
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:13,067
Unbeknownst to us, some players had been stockpiling on explosives via the wishing well, and decided to use all of them at the same time, defeating the final boss faster than we can give it another health boost.

232
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,473
Another problem that only got worse over time was onboarding new players.

233
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:23,735
As the city, UI, and commands grew more complex, the game became ever more puzzling to a pair

234
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:24,375
of fresh eyes.

235
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:28,557
This was largely because all information had to be on screen at the same time, and a late

236
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:30,277
game newcomer couldn't start at the beginning.

237
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,960
We tried to ease the introduction via a helper bot and an online manual, but despite the

238
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,921
efforts of these and chatroom moderators helping out, we got this same question up until the

239
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,521
final moments.

240
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:41,842
How do I play?

241
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,824
We realized this was a problem as soon as we had trouble

242
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,525
ourselves telling someone in person what things to do first.

243
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:50,906
In addition to our struggles with the game itself,

244
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,587
it was tough for Twitch to promote a game

245
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,128
that didn't present well at a glance,

246
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,908
even with Beep telling jokes in the corner.

247
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,469
Other than a launch day promotion on the front page,

248
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,810
it took one and a half months to create a spotlight feature

249
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,071
to continue help spreading the word.

250
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:04,852
This isn't necessarily a failure on our part,

251
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,652
unless you consider our designing a game

252
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:07,673
that doesn't catch one's eye,

253
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,793
but it does help paint a picture as to why we had trouble

254
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,174
getting new players regularly.

255
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:16,253
CityStream was a fun experiment that certainly taught us a lot about dealing with emergent

256
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:20,755
multiplayer ecosystems, but a time pressure combined with too many design and UX flaws

257
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:22,276
prevented it from taking off as we had hoped.

258
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:26,577
We still believe to this day that all major issues with the game are solvable, especially

259
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,138
after having experienced them fall apart over the course of a couple months.

260
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:35,260
However, when the final building on the final spot was upgraded to its final level, we called

261
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,102
it the end of Season 1 and sent players where they had always intended to go to the moon.

262
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,108
Our final stream was a two-hour-long rocket ride

263
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,551
through outer space featuring a dynamic rolling credits

264
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,553
of every player who ever stepped into the game's world.

265
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,536
As players rode their rocket tower through space

266
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,937
and collided with passing stars,

267
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,660
they gained the ability to shoot fireworks into the galaxy,

268
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,902
giving back light to a fastly dimming world.

269
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,406
With that, Beep put on his nightcap for the last time,

270
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:02,967
wishing everyone a good night.

271
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,849
Thank you, everybody.

272
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,202
I believe Adrian is going to be next.

273
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,457
Hello everyone, I'm Adrian De Jong.

274
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,779
I'm a game designer, programmer, business,

275
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,260
marketing person, indie I guess.

276
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,601
I just released Hidden Folks, yay.

277
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,043
But today I wanna, thank you, wow.

278
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,712
So today, now, I want to reflect on the closure of Game Oven,

279
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:21,373
the studio I co-founded.

280
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:23,854
In case you didn't know Game Oven,

281
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,496
it was founded by programmer Bojan Androvski

282
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,537
and game designer Adriaan de Jong.

283
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:30,138
That would be me.

284
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,601
and we were later joined by marketeer Eliene Meuris.

285
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:37,645
We had an office in the Dutch game garden in Utrecht,

286
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:41,970
the Netherlands, and we made Fingal, Planet Challenge,

287
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:47,456
Bamfoo, Friendstrap, Bounden, and Jelly Reef, six games.

288
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,711
We were best known for Fingle, which is a sort of like

289
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,373
Twister-like finger rubbing game.

290
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:59,015
And some people know us for Bounden,

291
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,996
which is a mobile dancing game for two people.

292
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,997
And it actually has choreography

293
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,498
by the Dutch National Ballet.

294
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,319
I showed this at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop

295
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:07,900
two years ago.

296
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,172
So my talk to you today will have two parts.

297
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,316
One of what it's like being a company

298
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:18,221
and sort of our perspective on closing the company

299
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,824
and being a team and all the dynamics

300
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,867
that happened within our team.

301
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,171
Alright, part one, being a company.

302
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:29,092
So, GameOven was founded by Bojan and I

303
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:33,835
because at some point I had this prototype, a Fingal,

304
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,976
and it was sort of weird and fun,

305
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,437
and it was just awkward, and we,

306
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,118
Bojan and I both saw, oh, maybe we need to

307
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,480
make a actual game out of this and put it on the App Store,

308
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,941
but to do that, we needed a legal entity.

309
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:49,443
So we were like, hmm, maybe we should just dive into it

310
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,003
and make a company, and Game Oven was born.

311
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:56,245
Our business plan became to make enough games

312
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,445
to collectively bring in enough money

313
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:01,326
to cover the costs of the company, and hope for a hit.

314
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,909
somewhere along the way, and we wanted to run the studio

315
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,171
sort of on the long tail of games.

316
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,792
So long tails usually look like this,

317
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,294
but the thing is, if you zoom in,

318
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:14,875
this is what you see, right?

319
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,877
So there's various games, and the money they bring in

320
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,199
every day stacks up, and that's what covers

321
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,760
the cost of the company every day.

322
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,557
So Game Oven employed one designer, a developer,

323
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,139
a marketing person, and we usually had

324
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,701
an art or a developer intern.

325
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,063
The biggest challenge to this structure

326
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:37,006
was balancing prototyping games and marketing

327
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:37,967
and doing business.

328
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:42,251
We hired Elina with the promise to overcome that challenge,

329
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,573
but when it got real hot in the oven,

330
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:47,075
we still found ourselves helping out with marketing.

331
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:52,618
And looking back at this, it seems like prototyping and actual game development

332
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:58,221
are much easier roles to mix for one person than making and selling a game.

333
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,223
But this is my gut feeling, I don't have any scientific data on this.

334
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:07,913
So aside from our in-house roles and skills,

335
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:10,494
we always required at least a number of contractors

336
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,434
with every project.

337
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:13,595
So we always needed one or two full-time artists,

338
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,336
a music composer, a sound designer,

339
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:18,277
a filmmaker to make our trailers, localization company,

340
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:20,958
sometimes an extra developer,

341
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,319
and for a bound we needed a choreographer,

342
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,479
so that was weird.

343
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,244
But let's talk about costs, because the minimum wage

344
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,368
of one person in the Netherlands costs the company

345
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,111
about 1,800 euros per month.

346
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,172
That is about $1,900.

347
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:40,577
And this includes taxes and administration fees.

348
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,642
With three employees, rent, software, administration,

349
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,143
and all sorts of little things,

350
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,706
game often costs about 6,500 euros per month.

351
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:53,549
We think it's not really cool to share

352
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,370
how much our collaborators asked of us,

353
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,913
but this chart can give you a little bit of a sense

354
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,054
of what all these projects cost.

355
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:02,717
So, yeah, on one side there's the collaborators,

356
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:04,759
how many of them we needed to make the game,

357
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,840
and on the other side is the studio time and months.

358
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,562
So, Bounden and Jelareef were definitely

359
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:09,703
one of our bigger projects.

360
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,006
So counting the months on this chart

361
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:17,349
and knowing that Game Oven existed for three and a half years

362
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,771
all the studio time listed here

363
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,992
doesn't add up to three and a half years.

364
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:24,855
Because in between these projects we prototyped,

365
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:27,376
we maintained the engine and our previous games

366
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:29,638
and we did some contracting work here and there.

367
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,985
But more importantly, this in-between creative downtime,

368
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:38,528
or project downtime, was still studio uptime.

369
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:42,452
And it cost the studio as much as working on a project.

370
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,034
So you can imagine what kind of pressure

371
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,376
this put on our creativity.

372
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,197
How can you have peace of mind

373
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:50,239
when you know you're burning money every day,

374
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,042
and you don't find that next big thing?

375
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,444
And this is one of the reasons we decided to close Game Oven,

376
00:18:56,644 --> 00:19:00,305
because being responsible for the upkeep of the studio

377
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,487
and being creative is damn difficult.

378
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,507
And yeah, we couldn't find a way.

379
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,369
Because, well, let's talk about Game Oven's income.

380
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,076
So in total, more than two and a half million people,

381
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,738
more than two and a half million apps have been downloaded

382
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:20,561
with grossing about 155,000 euros,

383
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,122
which is about $165,000.

384
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,886
Compared to other apps on mobile stores,

385
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,487
these numbers are not amazing,

386
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,448
but they're definitely not bad either.

387
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,170
Speculating over what drove our game sales,

388
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,691
we think it's...

389
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:40,594
We think we made unique games and potentially appealing to non-gamers and using phone features in unique ways.

390
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:46,860
But we were always constrained by the designs of our games to mobile platforms, which already has a lot of competition.

391
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,143
And we weren't really in the mood for a free-to-play business model.

392
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:58,180
From 2012 to 2015, piracy in our games was just crazy.

393
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,983
So most of our Chinese, Russian, and Turkish players

394
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:04,748
pirated our premium games, both on the iOS and App Store.

395
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,992
And yeah, especially with Bounden's release,

396
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:11,596
we were baffled by how much percentage it was.

397
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,020
So, in the end, what we made off our sales

398
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,224
wasn't, strictly speaking, enough to cover the costs

399
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,527
of the studio and pay our collaborators.

400
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,350
And so we hunted for additional source of income.

401
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,921
Lots of subsidies, government grants, contracting work,

402
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:35,163
Humble Bundle, App Campus, which is or was a program

403
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:39,145
by Windows to get more games to their platform,

404
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,805
and we won various awards.

405
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,747
So with all these additional sources of income,

406
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:47,108
about a total of 144,000 euros,

407
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:48,969
we were actually easily able to cover

408
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:49,889
the cost of the studio.

409
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,310
And in the end, we probably even had enough funds

410
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,431
to do another project.

411
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,554
So again, Game of Ents income wasn't the main reason

412
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:00,855
we closed the studio, but rather the pressure

413
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:04,258
of our monthly burn rate on the creativity

414
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,079
for that next project.

415
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,342
Okay, so that's part one, being a company.

416
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,824
Let's talk about being a team.

417
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,626
Because as founders, Boyan and I had,

418
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,268
you could say, some struggles during our three and a half

419
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:19,229
years of working together.

420
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,711
And I might present these struggles here

421
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,753
as if they were really straightforward,

422
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:26,695
but we went through months of reflection

423
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:29,517
and to try to understand what happened

424
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:32,039
and why we were occasionally so frustrated with each other.

425
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:41,580
My deep motivation to make games has always been very different from Boyan's motivation to make games.

426
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:45,536
I've always had this thing for truly social games,

427
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,018
whatever that means, while Boyan didn't necessarily.

428
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:53,179
And as an example, Boyan really, really did not

429
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:55,260
like friend strap, while I consider it

430
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,641
one of my best working concepts ever.

431
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:01,302
And Boyan became father after Bounden,

432
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,863
money and being sustainable became

433
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,964
even more important motivators to him.

434
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:12,235
So before Jelly Reef, the last game Game Oven made,

435
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,757
Boyan had not been able to motivate or convince me

436
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,518
to work on any of his game ideas,

437
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,700
mainly because I looked for a social component

438
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,462
in Boyan's ideas that he never focused on.

439
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:24,743
To me it felt like...

440
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,544
Boyan never understood what he wanted to accomplish

441
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:30,325
with his games, or that his games didn't have

442
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:33,006
a bigger vision, and for Boyan it felt like

443
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,046
I never took his ideas seriously.

444
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,308
And this kind of frustration was actually

445
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:40,588
very difficult to deal with for both of us.

446
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,050
Okay, the other struggle.

447
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,681
I was primarily the face of Game Oven.

448
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:50,643
I was maybe a bit more extrovert

449
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:52,604
and better connected internationally.

450
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,268
But unfortunately, many interviews with journalists

451
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:59,751
presented me as the sole creator of Game Oven's games,

452
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,274
even though they were made as a team effort.

453
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:07,920
There was one particular interview on Bounden

454
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,161
that hurt Boyan most.

455
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:12,937
writing about me as the genius inventor of Bounden,

456
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,079
while never mentioning it was made by a whole team.

457
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:19,221
And this struggle actually came back quite often,

458
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:21,523
too often as what should be necessary.

459
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,606
Everyone wants to be credited for their hard work,

460
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,788
and so simply making this very explicit to journalists

461
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:30,710
keeps everyone happy on the team.

462
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,093
So if you're a journalist, please take this seriously.

463
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,635
Like, I actually know for a fact we are not

464
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:38,936
the only ones who have struggled with this.

465
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:43,548
Okay, the biggest struggle however,

466
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:48,491
that we faced resulted from never strictly defining

467
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:49,351
our roles.

468
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:53,513
So, Boyan didn't want to narrowly define our roles

469
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:56,915
as he wanted to have a say in business and marketing

470
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:59,496
and design as well as being the technical lead.

471
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,719
Having a say in all aspects of running a game studio

472
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,240
for a small studio like that was why he wanted

473
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,761
to be a founder in the first place.

474
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,203
And I think that's very reasonable.

475
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:15,370
But unfortunately it resulted in a pretty bad,

476
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,052
few pretty bad scenarios.

477
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:20,597
And I wanted to give you guys three of these scenarios

478
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:22,480
because, yeah, I want you to understand

479
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,023
how important this was for our decision

480
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:25,884
to close Game Over.

481
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,303
So after the quite underwhelming launch of Bamfoo, our second title,

482
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:36,245
I decided after maybe three or four months of prototyping

483
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:39,247
that Game Oven's next production was going to be Friendstrap.

484
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:41,908
And this quirky little game with no beef

485
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,550
other than being really awkward and weird,

486
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,732
Boyan just didn't feel anything for making it.

487
00:24:48,712 --> 00:24:52,256
To me, feeling that studio uptime pressure,

488
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:55,038
it was one of the prototypes with the most potential

489
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:57,100
we had at that time.

490
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,223
But to Boyan, it felt like he had no say

491
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,924
in whether friendship should be made or not,

492
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:05,327
but he did feel as responsible for it as much as I did.

493
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,490
But I took the best decision I could,

494
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,254
and I still think we didn't have

495
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,215
any better alternatives back then.

496
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,906
So the lesson here is defining roles comes down to trust

497
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:23,672
and letting go of the things you too feel responsible for.

498
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:31,667
One long argument Boyan and I had was about a timer in Bounden.

499
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:34,128
So at some point during the project,

500
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,168
Bounden took on the challenge of making a timer,

501
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,549
one that should convey where you are within the dance.

502
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:42,490
But while he was making it, I came to realize,

503
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,710
and I saw in play tests, that the timer

504
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,091
was actually not as relevant

505
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,651
to the broader picture of the game.

506
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:50,131
And so I...

507
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:54,913
sort of had to discard the idea within the whole design

508
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:57,173
and replaced it with a much simpler solution.

509
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,394
But at this point, it felt to Boyan

510
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,555
as if I only wanted to include my own designs

511
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,736
while I was only trying to model

512
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,796
a coherent player experience for Bounden.

513
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,739
And so the lesson here is, I was often not able

514
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,222
to communicate my bigger vision of the game fully to Bojan,

515
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,844
which made it very difficult for Bojan

516
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:22,446
to understand why his contributions

517
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:26,670
could sometimes, should sometimes not be included.

518
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,152
And what complicated matters was that the vision

519
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:33,235
and execution of that vision changed constantly,

520
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:34,456
sometimes even radically.

521
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:41,447
So another difficult scenario was Jelly Reef in its entirety.

522
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:44,950
So from the start, with all our previous issues in mind

523
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,451
and all our struggles in mind,

524
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,674
I wanted Boyan to be the creative owner of Jelly Reef.

525
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:51,635
And he filled that role well.

526
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:53,517
But somewhere along the way,

527
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:57,340
Jelly Reef turned into a procedurally generated game,

528
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,683
which meant that my role for Jelly Reef became unclear.

529
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:04,664
I wasn't able to help Bojan code it.

530
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,845
I was just not a good programmer like that.

531
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:12,507
And so not only did I have to leave

532
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:14,908
most of the design up to Bojan,

533
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,868
I also had to work on a game that didn't align

534
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:20,589
with my deep motivation to make games in the first place.

535
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,791
And it was at this time that I got us together

536
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:27,851
and said those four painful words, I want to quit.

537
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,880
Boyan and Alina understood that I was a fundamental member

538
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,982
of Game Oven, so we decided together to finish Jell-O-Reef

539
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,643
and close Game Oven afterwards.

540
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,044
But finishing Jell-O-Reef with a disbanding team

541
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:45,565
was a nightmare.

542
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:52,556
Boyan worked his ass off to make the game happen regardless,

543
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:56,258
but he was increasingly frustrated with the lack of effort

544
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,259
by his team members.

545
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,300
Everyone had their minds on the future.

546
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:02,642
And in hindsight, I think we should have just disbanded

547
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,624
right there and then,

548
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:08,926
and even though that felt maybe too disruptive

549
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:10,327
to our lives at that point.

550
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:16,311
Okay, so those were three struggles that we had.

551
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:20,706
But I do want to end on a positive note,

552
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:22,688
because only talking about our struggles

553
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,210
makes us look like we should have never

554
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,551
worked together in the first place,

555
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:28,094
but we obviously had super fun times too.

556
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:29,755
Going to the office every morning

557
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:30,876
was like a little adventure,

558
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,980
and we'd make something new quickly that day together,

559
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,961
figuring out how the hell to do it.

560
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:38,264
And even with all the struggles that we had,

561
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,646
Boin and I didn't close the studio

562
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,088
hating or disliking each other.

563
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:46,075
We've had times where we could punch each other in the face,

564
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:47,998
but not when we closed the studio.

565
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,583
And in a way, our struggles are...

566
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:54,835
Still marginal compared to our achievements, I think.

567
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:58,278
17 awards and nominations for Fingle and Bounden,

568
00:28:58,338 --> 00:28:59,699
major features in the App Store,

569
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,581
stories of relationships crushed and babies made

570
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,442
because of Fingle,

571
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,984
working together with the Dutch National Ballet,

572
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:07,646
coverage in the New York Times,

573
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,708
the Guardian, BBC, The Verge, Mashable,

574
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:12,670
and more than 14 and a half million play sessions.

575
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,711
That's a crazy ride.

576
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,114
I want to conclude Game Oven with you.

577
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,956
In contrast to what most people initially think,

578
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:23,658
Game Oven did make enough money to sustain itself.

579
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:26,140
So strictly speaking, our game sales weren't enough

580
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,301
to keep us running, but only looking at

581
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,202
one of our sources of income

582
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:32,424
would be a narrow point of view.

583
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,965
What was difficult for us to maintain

584
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,007
was the rigid structure of a studio,

585
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,008
as opposed to the flexible structure

586
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:42,610
of hopping on and off individual projects.

587
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,820
our problem was studio uptime during project downtime.

588
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,702
And we worked really hard to close the gap

589
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:54,024
between our projects, but leaving responsibility

590
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:57,065
scattered throughout the team, keeping our roles vague,

591
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,707
magnified the pressure between us,

592
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,408
and caused many struggles between us.

593
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,009
And eventually, those personal struggles

594
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:05,810
made us decide to close the studio.

595
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,911
And ultimately, that is the more

596
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:10,573
nuanced conclusion to Game Oven.

597
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:16,426
So I hope you draw lessons from Game Oven, our failure.

598
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,729
And if you have any questions, please do come talk

599
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:20,589
to me afterwards.

600
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,310
Thank you.

601
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,511
Thank you.

602
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:22,751
Thank you.

603
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:23,952
Thank you.

604
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:25,093
Thank you.

605
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,054
Thank you.

606
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:29,297
Thank you.

607
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:33,361
Thank you.

608
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:33,601
Tim?

609
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,043
You're up next.

610
00:30:55,842 --> 00:31:04,099
everybody. I'm going to go ahead and get started. I'm going to

611
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:14,205
Oh, hello everyone. My name is Tim Rogers. I am the founder and director of

612
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:19,867
Interactive electronic object research design development and

613
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:24,789
Consultation studio action button entertainment I

614
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:32,091
Am the game designer and director of video ball video ball is a digital sporting good product

615
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:34,591
Which is available now?

616
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:36,803
As if this makes a difference.

617
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,927
For personal computers and for PlayStation 4

618
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,812
or Xbox One video game console hardwares.

619
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:47,697
Somebody commented on the YouTube video

620
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,539
of my talk last year that it sounded like

621
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,680
I had to go to the bathroom.

622
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:52,743
I really did.

623
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:56,442
I really do right now.

624
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,063
So, I need to stop doing this.

625
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:00,543
Alright, okay, so.

626
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:03,504
Video ball is a four-player sport

627
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:05,085
in which two teams of two players

628
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:08,125
each project triangles at circular balls to push them.

629
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,786
Push a ball into your opponent's goal to score a point.

630
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:12,827
The longer you hold the button,

631
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,247
the bigger your eventual triangle.

632
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,548
The bigger triangles push harder.

633
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,569
Triangles also stun players and eliminate one another.

634
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,331
Regulation video ball is played with three balls

635
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:22,351
on the screen at all times.

636
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:26,794
And here's a little video of some experts playing the game.

637
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,376
So, video ball represents an attempt to make

638
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:34,338
a serious electronic sport.

639
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,359
So through what I can hopefully unpretentiously describe

640
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,560
as a scientific game design process,

641
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,860
we started with simple core rules

642
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,860
and eventually arrived at what I call,

643
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:50,101
quote unquote, a compact expression of all sports mechanics.

644
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,562
Video Ball launched on 12 July 2016,

645
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:57,302
and my life has been a garage sale ever since.

646
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,243
One of my earnest goals with Video Ball was...

647
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,332
was, this being perfectly honest now for the first time,

648
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:09,673
one of the earnest goals of Video Ball

649
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:13,177
was to make the Burberry scarf of video games.

650
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:14,999
Up here on stage last year I said

651
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,840
the Muji coffee cup of video games.

652
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,302
That was me being modest.

653
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,005
I wanted to make the Burberry scarf of video games,

654
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,727
a luxury video game.

655
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,510
So you can buy a scarf for a dollar

656
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,751
and it will keep your neck warm.

657
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:31,453
Or, you can pay roughly $400 for a Burberry scarf.

658
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:32,854
So why pay the extra,

659
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,355
I never meant to charge $400 for video ball.

660
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,916
So, but why pay the extra $399?

661
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:42,559
Well, a Burberry scarf represents a perfect intersection

662
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:44,160
of history, science, and art.

663
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,021
So I personally don't really have any history or art,

664
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,842
but I know a little bit about science,

665
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,683
so I thought that I could, you know, fudge the other two.

666
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:55,025
So Burberry, the company has existed for over a century.

667
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,926
The founder, Thomas Burberry, invented Gabardine,

668
00:33:57,986 --> 00:34:00,727
a waterproof fabric, which is still appreciated today.

669
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,808
And their trademark check pattern,

670
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:06,210
their trademark check pattern

671
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,611
is a monolith of graphic design.

672
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:12,072
So I would define a Burberry scarf as a fine thing.

673
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:15,273
And this would be what I would want in my video game

674
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:16,914
that is the Burberry scarf of video games.

675
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:19,455
So to run through the list, a fine thing is,

676
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:22,616
not too hot, not too cold, lovely to touch,

677
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,238
beautiful to look at, and wonderful to think about.

678
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:29,679
So, I am not, however, a ridiculous enough person

679
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,381
to vocalize this mission statement while promoting

680
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,942
Video Ball before it's released, but.

681
00:34:36,982 --> 00:34:37,903
The game's been out for eight months,

682
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:39,763
and I'm wondering now if maybe I should have been

683
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:40,924
that ridiculous.

684
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,844
I'm always checking my ridiculousness.

685
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:47,325
So instead we promoted Video Ball

686
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:49,226
as a digital sporting good product.

687
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:51,367
Video Ball will empower the players,

688
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,487
the players are the characters, the game is a thing.

689
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,588
And I'm working on another game right now,

690
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,469
I'll tell you about it later.

691
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,270
And my mission statement just in my head,

692
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,710
that my mantra is video games can be things.

693
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,051
And hopefully that will be my GDC talk in 2018.

694
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,032
That'll be the title.

695
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,392
Video games can be things.

696
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:11,692
Look forward to it.

697
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,293
Or you don't have to if you don't want to.

698
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,914
Okay, so I got a lot of weird copywriting

699
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:19,254
out of the Video Ball mission statement.

700
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:22,015
And my favorite thing is something I said here last year,

701
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:24,936
which is Video Ball has the best graphics of any game ever.

702
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:29,863
Because Videoball is a perfect one-to-one simulation of itself.

703
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,269
And this, in addition to being a funny joke,

704
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:38,590
is also, that was something I sincerely believed.

705
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,351
I thought, why not make a game like that?

706
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:45,212
Wouldn't it be cool if there was something like that?

707
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,973
So here's how we advertised that mission statement

708
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:48,553
in the trailer.

709
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:53,114
And if you want this guy to do a voice in your trailer,

710
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:53,975
there's a few more tracks.

711
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,975
Think of video ball as a pool table.

712
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:58,396
Think of video ball as a ping pong table.

713
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:01,516
Think of your television as a dinner table.

714
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:04,317
And Videoball is what's for dinner.

715
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:09,958
Videoball doesn't need fairies, elves, space marines, tanks, or even helicopters.

716
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,899
Videoball has the best game characters ever.

717
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,099
Real human beings.

718
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,800
That's right. When you were born, you were already a Videoball character.

719
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,040
Want a new costume for your Videoball hero?

720
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,701
Put a hat on, buddy. I mean, put a real hat on your real head.

721
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:28,401
Boom!

722
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,408
You just made D.L.C.

723
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:36,349
So I, you know, hey, you know,

724
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,271
I thought that was pretty good.

725
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,954
It got a lot of views on YouTube,

726
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:44,616
most of them saying that the announcer

727
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:45,978
sounded like he had a stuffed nose,

728
00:36:46,158 --> 00:36:50,382
so body functions keep getting into my PR.

729
00:36:51,423 --> 00:36:54,205
So basically, in keeping with the

730
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:55,426
put a hat on buddy message,

731
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:58,609
we made hundreds of shirts, many of them unique.

732
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:00,583
Most of them unique.

733
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:01,924
I promoted these shirts on the web,

734
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:03,486
and I even sold some of them up here

735
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,088
at the podium last year at GDC,

736
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,551
if anybody remembers that.

737
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:10,014
I would say make some noise if you're wearing a shirt,

738
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:12,517
though I have surveyed the audience with my eyes

739
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:14,640
and determined that that would be too much noise.

740
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,178
I actually have the last video ball shirt.

741
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:21,559
It is a medium-sized American Apparel.

742
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,059
You can't, it's not gonna, I'm sorry.

743
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,660
You're a robust gentleman.

744
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,421
You're tough, you're stronger than me.

745
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:32,223
So keep in mind that I have diabetes

746
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:33,803
and I can't afford medicine,

747
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,204
so if somebody wants to pay me for this.

748
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:37,165
All right, so.

749
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:45,692
One of the video ball shirts was printed on a 1950s vintage French girls terry cloth t-shirt

750
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:51,977
and I was very scared to print on this. I have a collection of vintage European sweatshirts

751
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:53,218
I mean, because lots of people do.

752
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:59,783
And so this shirt ended up being the object of a bidding war, and the highest bid, and this is a callback,

753
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:00,384
it was $400.

754
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:05,348
And the bidder was a person I actively dislike, so I did not sell.

755
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:13,617
However, pleased with its having obtained a $400 bid,

756
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:16,519
I felt comfortable selling it for $50

757
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,321
to a wonderful couple from Belgium,

758
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:23,744
because I like Belgium, and also because they'd promised me

759
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:25,265
that they would do something good with it.

760
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:27,587
So, months later, they sent me.

761
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:35,363
couple of photographs. So upon seeing this photo I realized that in fact my

762
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:40,629
first daily mistake my entire life had always been not knowing that a statue of

763
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:44,733
Jean-Claude Van Damme as he appears in the 1988 film Bloodsport literally

764
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:49,338
stands in a park somewhere in Belgium. But despite Jean-Claude's best efforts

765
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,401
it was already too late. VideoBall had cost me all of my money.

766
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,643
And when the game shipped, I was broke.

767
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:59,547
I could not afford to spend even a daily hour promoting it.

768
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,809
So, by now you may be thinking,

769
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,593
how can a game with a $400 T-shirt

770
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,155
on a Jean-Claude Van Damme statue

771
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:14,600
in a park in Belgium be considered a failure?

772
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:20,198
Well, I'm glad you asked, because strictly speaking,

773
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,819
it's not, because that rules.

774
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:26,760
Video Ball is not a failure because it is my favorite game.

775
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,400
However, on the other hand, I have literally five

776
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,021
broken teeth in my mouth.

777
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:34,282
And I dared to have a dental checkup last month,

778
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:36,282
and the dentist's words were, and I quote,

779
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,843
you've got a lot going on in here.

780
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:41,942
That's not even a joke.

781
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:45,585
So, put bluntly, Videoball is a failure

782
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,086
because we spent too much time,

783
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,408
and our message was weak.

784
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:54,583
Okay, so, and let's get into what I mean

785
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:57,083
by too much time and week.

786
00:39:57,584 --> 00:40:00,685
So, Thanksgiving weekend 2013, we played video ball

787
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,225
for more or less 20 consecutive hours.

788
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:05,566
So, video ball was perfect two years before we released it,

789
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:08,047
and I can't prove this to you

790
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:10,748
because I don't have two hours to talk.

791
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:13,669
But, so, I did give a two hour lecture

792
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:14,489
about why video ball is,

793
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:15,930
there's a couple people who were at that lecture.

794
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,071
So, Black Sunday 2013.

795
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,512
So two years before we released Video Ball,

796
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,093
some friends and I gathered in my house

797
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,374
in Oakland, California for what we called

798
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:28,195
the first annual Little Caesars Hot N' Ready Bowl.

799
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,657
Because we're idiots, and because I maybe wanted to die,

800
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:35,939
we bought four Little Caesars Hot N' Ready cheese pizzas.

801
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,200
This was back when they were only $5, now they're $6.

802
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,400
This economy, huh?

803
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:49,419
So, among us, we had over 2,000 hours of video ball

804
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,280
experience in the room.

805
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,442
We played at long tournaments on a grand scale.

806
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:54,744
So this is a very prototype looking video ball

807
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:55,745
that we were playing.

808
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:57,547
This was during the game design process,

809
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,669
that aforementioned scientific process.

810
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,251
So we played a long tournament on a grand scale.

811
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,773
So here's a clip of the final round.

812
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:06,496
You're going to hear a cacophony of voices

813
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:08,137
shouting bizarre phrases.

814
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:15,421
I realized today that any game able to provoke this reaction in my friends despite its flaws should have been released as immediately as

815
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:21,583
Possible instead of us taking extra years to polish it instead. We perpetrated a cataclysmic waste of time

816
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:23,404
so here's the I

817
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:28,226
Mean it the game looks like nonsense, but listen to these people screaming. There's a part

818
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:33,268
There's like 12 people in this room

819
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:37,170
Somehow there was still two slices of pizza left

820
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:38,748
At this point.

821
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:39,429
Oh, what?

822
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:40,109
Yeah.

823
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,532
Oh, what?

824
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:44,193
Oh!

825
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:47,036
Oh, yes.

826
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:48,317
We're back in this.

827
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:49,518
We are back in this.

828
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:51,000
There it goes, yeah.

829
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,642
You're back in the sort of app now.

830
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:54,022
Oh!

831
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:54,563
No!

832
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:56,485
Oh!

833
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:56,745
Oh!

834
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:57,346
Ha ha!

835
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:01,870
Yes!

836
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,590
Oh, yes!

837
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:03,091
Oh, gosh.

838
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:11,937
Eat it!

839
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:13,238
Yeah!

840
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:13,738
Eat it!

841
00:42:13,758 --> 00:42:14,638
Yeah!

842
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,259
I would kill everyone.

843
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:17,880
Get it out.

844
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,080
Boom!

845
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,421
Take this shit down real quick.

846
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:21,282
Time it!

847
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:25,184
Get these kids out of my neighborhood!

848
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:25,684
Touchdown!

849
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:26,684
Bam!

850
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:27,805
Boom!

851
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:30,946
Finish it Tim.

852
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:31,607
Finish it.

853
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:32,427
I can't, you help!

854
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:32,607
Boom!

855
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:32,847
Yeah!

856
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:33,828
I got it.

857
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:34,268
Boom!

858
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:34,888
Boom!

859
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:35,229
Boom!

860
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:35,429
Boom!

861
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:35,689
Boom!

862
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:35,909
Boom!

863
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:36,129
Boom!

864
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:36,309
Boom!

865
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:36,489
Boom!

866
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:36,589
Boom!

867
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:38,722
Yeah!

868
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:39,643
Keep him dizzy.

869
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:40,083
Johnny, go baby!

870
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:40,243
Come on!

871
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:40,303
Go!

872
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:40,563
Get it!

873
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:40,663
Oh!

874
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:40,763
Yeah!

875
00:42:40,783 --> 00:42:41,323
Johnny, you motherfucker!

876
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:41,404
No!

877
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:41,544
Go, Jim!

878
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:41,824
Come on, man!

879
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:41,884
No!

880
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:42,024
Oh, God!

881
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:42,164
Oh, God!

882
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:42,344
It hurts!

883
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:44,205
This is a little longer than I thought it was.

884
00:42:44,225 --> 00:42:44,745
No, I'm not letting you go!

885
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:44,805
No!

886
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:44,985
McKee!

887
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:45,245
You fuckers!

888
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:45,305
No!

889
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:46,126
Yeah!

890
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,426
I'm not letting you go!

891
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:48,107
I'm not letting you go!

892
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:48,647
I'm not letting you go!

893
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,107
I'm not letting you go!

894
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:49,667
I'm not letting you go!

895
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,368
I'm not letting you go!

896
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:50,888
I'm not letting you go.

897
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:51,408
I'm not letting you go.

898
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:51,908
I'm not letting you go.

899
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:52,269
Don't let me go.

900
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:52,749
I'm not letting you go.

901
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:53,349
I'm not letting you go.

902
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:55,270
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

903
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,070
Don't let me go.

904
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,251
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

905
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:58,512
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

906
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,512
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

907
00:42:59,532 --> 00:43:00,733
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

908
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,373
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

909
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,134
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

910
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:05,115
I'm not letting you go, I'm not allowing you go,

911
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:07,736
I'm not letting you go, I'm not letting you go,

912
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:13,416
I'm beating the shit out of you!

913
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:14,816
Oh my god!

914
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:16,457
Okay, uh, so...

915
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:18,157
So...

916
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:22,858
I look at that and it's like compared to

917
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:24,878
if the sound were off, I would be like

918
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:26,719
man, yeah, this game sucks

919
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:28,439
like, uh

920
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:30,680
and that's, you know, what I thought then

921
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm like, oh, there's a whole lot of stuff I want to do with this game

922
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,261
and, you, I would just forget about that.

923
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:43,083
the next day, immediately after resuming work on the game, I would forget, for some reason,

924
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:49,633
what's wrong with me. I would completely forget that those people had that much fun playing that game.

925
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,803
we should have released it pretty much right away.

926
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,525
So that's what I want to talk about real quick here.

927
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:58,286
We should have released the game simpler and differently.

928
00:43:58,547 --> 00:44:00,708
So let's talk about simpler and differently.

929
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:03,550
So here's why we didn't release it simple and different.

930
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,573
So the terrifying screams the video ball prototype caused

931
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:10,134
were so voluminous as to attract a publisher.

932
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:13,076
So I signed with the publisher because they offered money

933
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:14,657
and I like that.

934
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:22,681
The money would be enough for myself, Brent Porter, and Michael Kirwan, my partners, to concentrate on finishing the game.

935
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,122
It didn't seem impossible. It was a game we wanted to make anyway.

936
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:32,844
I hated the contract work that I'd been doing on the side to support the development, and I liked the guy who was the publisher.

937
00:44:34,736 --> 00:44:41,540
But so what happened we agreed to the publishers expectations, which was simultaneous launch on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360

938
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,564
Steam PlayStation 4 and Xbox one which is a lot of work for three people to do in six months

939
00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:51,347
They also expected cross-platform online multiplayer which

940
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:55,150
which quite hilariously did not happen.

941
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,654
So we were now being paid to work on

942
00:44:59,674 --> 00:45:00,794
what we'd been doing for fun,

943
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,836
so we subconsciously divided the work

944
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,117
into stuff we had to do,

945
00:45:04,678 --> 00:45:06,919
such as getting it running on all the consoles,

946
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,301
and the unnecessary stuff we wanted to do,

947
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:11,203
such as graphical polish, new options,

948
00:45:11,623 --> 00:45:12,864
new modes, new arenas.

949
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,287
So we'd somehow decided that we were being paid

950
00:45:16,787 --> 00:45:18,449
just for the boring stuff,

951
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:19,850
which is a really,

952
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:22,032
bad trap that we fell into.

953
00:45:22,413 --> 00:45:24,135
And so we kept doing the fun work for fun,

954
00:45:24,676 --> 00:45:27,459
and eventually we were working 16 hour days on this game.

955
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,782
And I crunched some numbers,

956
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:31,864
and it turns out we averaged about $4.50 an hour

957
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:33,186
for the work we were doing, which is,

958
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:33,767
that's pretty bad.

959
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:42,545
So, and then eventually we took so long making our game

960
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:43,906
that our publisher went out of business

961
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,187
and we had no choice at this point.

962
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:47,528
We needed another publisher.

963
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,330
I could get into that, but that's scary.

964
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:53,753
But so our friends at Iron Galaxy rescued us

965
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:55,754
and so we ended up releasing the game a year later.

966
00:45:57,942 --> 00:45:59,984
Now one of the bigger problems here with the game

967
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:01,645
was that our first time user experience

968
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,066
was too difficult in the wrong environment.

969
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:06,608
I accidentally said user and it says game right there.

970
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,849
Sorry about that.

971
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,813
So we had cultivated an abstract color-coded visual style

972
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:18,196
because we found this the coldest, most legible way

973
00:46:18,236 --> 00:46:21,198
to inform players and spectators of the events of the game.

974
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:24,039
Legibility was our primary concern,

975
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:26,241
which meant the game ended up with a look

976
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:28,842
that I have described as preschool industrial,

977
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,044
which is this look here.

978
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:34,466
So the first time players of Video Ball

979
00:46:34,506 --> 00:46:37,347
presumed that the game was as stupid as it looked,

980
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:42,050
and the disgusted glares I suffered from EVO attendees

981
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:44,932
left a layer of frostbite on my brain,

982
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,233
which likely remains today.

983
00:46:46,593 --> 00:46:48,177
That's an actual quote from a review.

984
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:51,446
It's basically Pong made for the millennials,

985
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:53,431
and I can't get enough of it.

986
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,501
I don't know, millennials are cool, whatever.

987
00:46:57,622 --> 00:47:00,865
Okay, so we had designed our game under a strict law

988
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,587
that it would be all skill, no luck.

989
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,889
The player's first experience is not as important

990
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:06,990
as their 1,000th.

991
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,072
And we knew that this was not a billion dollar

992
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:09,973
mainstream idea.

993
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:12,074
We had decided with conviction that our game

994
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:15,297
would not possess the immediately understandable metaphor

995
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:18,340
and simplicity of a game such as Rocket League.

996
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:23,924
Meanwhile, the press had decided that soccer was in fact

997
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:26,566
Rocket League without cars

998
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:30,934
So we could have released our game before Rocket League

999
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:36,885
We ended up releasing after and eventually players at PAX were shouting to their buddies. Hey, look

1000
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:40,267
Someone made 2D Rocket League.

1001
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,291
And our game's, I mean, Rocket League rules,

1002
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:47,997
but I mean, that was people's first, I don't know, I cried.

1003
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,162
So it was that first-timers pressed one button

1004
00:47:52,322 --> 00:47:54,204
over and over, firing dinky little triangles,

1005
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:56,287
barely pushing balls, or they'd ram into the,

1006
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:57,188
I actually was a...

1007
00:47:58,446 --> 00:48:01,831
I was going to show you a video on YouTube, but it's all messed up.

1008
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:06,697
So, or they'd ram into the ball repeatedly and drop the controller in anger when nothing happened.

1009
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:09,520
Some people didn't even realize the circles were balls.

1010
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,164
And those who did would recommend,

1011
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:15,408
hey, maybe the ball should move when you touch it, you know, like in Rocket League.

1012
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,770
And, you know, again, I was like,

1013
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,891
I've done science here, man.

1014
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:23,873
So, video ball requires four players to optimally enjoy,

1015
00:48:24,053 --> 00:48:25,173
and so at game conventions,

1016
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,635
people don't tend to be walking around with three friends.

1017
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:31,577
And they also, I mean, that's not a diss or anything,

1018
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,577
I mean, that's just what I noticed.

1019
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:35,318
And they also are surprisingly not always in the mood

1020
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:37,738
to get into screaming fits with three total strangers.

1021
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,719
And if just one player understands the rules of this game

1022
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,200
and plays well, the other three players feel terrible.

1023
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,941
And I noticed this a lot.

1024
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:50,282
So video ball requires cooperation and observation.

1025
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:53,863
And if there's just one player of the four who's good,

1026
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:56,783
most players are not willing to observe and learn

1027
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,344
from the behaviors of total strangers

1028
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:00,064
in the presence of an expert.

1029
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:01,885
No matter how hard.

1030
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:04,147
a guy wearing a Notre Dame football jacket

1031
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:08,831
over a dress screams at them.

1032
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:13,195
That was me at PAX 2014.

1033
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:16,438
That was Christine Love's dress that she loaned me.

1034
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,342
So number seven, we put too much stuff into the game.

1035
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:32,461
So in our two years of polishing, we filled the game with a bounty of rules, score variations, music tracks, voice announcements, backgrounds, line variations, ball markers, and 35 drastically different arenas.

1036
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:38,464
We put in an arcade mode for one or two players. We put in one-on-one and three-on-three local multiplayer. We put in AI bots.

1037
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:42,106
We did all this even though we knew for certain the best experience was two-on-two.

1038
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:47,708
So when we released the game, streamers and Let's Players were playing almost exclusively one-on-one.

1039
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:50,410
Furthermore, they never touched the customization options.

1040
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,892
Our game ended up looking dinky and plain.

1041
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:55,654
We knew it was actually ferocious and flamboyant.

1042
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,816
When we played the game, we saw the 1995 NBA Finals.

1043
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:00,457
When Let's Players played the game,

1044
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:03,499
we saw a lone, untouched field hockey ball

1045
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,200
sitting in a tray of fresh kitty litter.

1046
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:08,762
I swear to God we could have remade this menu

1047
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:09,823
if we'd had one more week,

1048
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:11,824
and it would have been perfect to Dave Lang.

1049
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:14,286
I'm not gonna talk about that menu.

1050
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:16,727
That goddarn menu.

1051
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:20,353
There's a very simple solution.

1052
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:25,018
We spent much, much, much less than one million dollars

1053
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:25,898
promoting Video Ball.

1054
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,701
We spent zero dollars promoting Video Ball.

1055
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:32,785
Had we spent a million dollars, I promise you,

1056
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:33,826
I would not be here today.

1057
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:36,208
I would be at the Success Workshop next door.

1058
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:44,557
And, uh, the profits would have likely been large enough for me to buy a 1999 Honda Civic Si,

1059
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,785
which is vastly preferable to the car I have now, and for reference, this is the car I have now.

1060
00:50:51,826 --> 00:50:54,709
I don't think it's safe, it's a Halloween costume with wheels. It's like...

1061
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,531
It's like, what if Dracula were a cop?

1062
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,311
If you ever see this car driving up out of a lake,

1063
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:03,312
I pushed it in there, and it's coming back for me.

1064
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:09,413
So I had five conversations with venture capitalists,

1065
00:51:09,674 --> 00:51:11,414
which I drove this car to all those meetings,

1066
00:51:12,214 --> 00:51:14,175
who said they wanted to invest in video ball,

1067
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:16,355
and none of them invested in video ball.

1068
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:19,336
Maybe I didn't give them a pitch that was any good at all.

1069
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,636
My plan hadn't been good enough,

1070
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:22,897
and hindsight being what it is,

1071
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:25,157
I now kind of do have a plan, which, you know,

1072
00:51:25,177 --> 00:51:25,717
it's a little late.

1073
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:32,321
But uh, so here's the lessons we learned real quick. The most important lesson is that our game is great. We can make great games

1074
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:35,642
And I love this goddarn game man

1075
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:39,444
So it is amazingly easy to lose confidence in yourself when you're tooling around

1076
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:44,647
Alone in the dark with the minutiae of a game which is meant for four live human players

1077
00:51:45,627 --> 00:51:49,489
Despite my many experiences with the living room full of friends screaming in ecstasy ecstasy

1078
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:54,632
I could not help feeling an inadequacy which drove me to implement too many modes and too much stuff

1079
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,034
We didn't need all that stuff because video ball is great.

1080
00:51:58,135 --> 00:51:58,815
The other thing I learned,

1081
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:00,897
game conventions are loud and stupid.

1082
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:03,139
We should not have taken video ball to PAX.

1083
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:06,742
PAX is great for many, many games, but probably not ours.

1084
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,204
I reside in the San Francisco Bay Area.

1085
00:52:09,624 --> 00:52:11,445
I could have taken the game directly to journalists,

1086
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:14,788
streamers, cool people, colleges, schools,

1087
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:18,271
instead of preparing for yet another laryngitis.

1088
00:52:19,912 --> 00:52:22,514
So, showing VideoBall at PAX required a lot of explanation,

1089
00:52:22,674 --> 00:52:23,994
and man, that place is loud.

1090
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:26,356
On day two, somebody always came back

1091
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,257
bringing their friends, so I could take a break

1092
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:29,298
while they played with their friends,

1093
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:31,299
and then they told their friends how to play.

1094
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:34,120
And it occurs to me now that we already had

1095
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,821
a perfect place to show the game, which was.

1096
00:52:36,182 --> 00:52:37,803
the Oakland Video Ball Sunday Club,

1097
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:40,065
which I invited people to come over to my house

1098
00:52:40,165 --> 00:52:41,807
every Sunday for about eight months

1099
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:42,968
while we were polishing the game.

1100
00:52:43,568 --> 00:52:44,529
And it was open to the public.

1101
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,812
One week a kid, a college student from Berkeley came,

1102
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,294
and then the next week he brought six friends.

1103
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:53,457
That's like six people you're getting on a bus

1104
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:55,379
to come play a game at a guy's house.

1105
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,181
But I should have taken that as a sign,

1106
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:00,362
but here's a photo of some people playing video ball

1107
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:04,165
at the GDC 2014 Sunday Club.

1108
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:06,266
Dan Tabar took that photo, I love that photo.

1109
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,827
Yeah, so it's so clear to me now,

1110
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,329
we should have shown the game at university-sponsored events.

1111
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,790
We could have taken it to events.

1112
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:13,951
I showed it at a high school,

1113
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,872
and it was way better than showing it at PAX.

1114
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:17,012
Should have done more of that.

1115
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:20,795
I could have sent, kids were asking me,

1116
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:22,156
I call them kids, because I don't know,

1117
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:23,096
they're in college, and I'm...

1118
00:53:23,777 --> 00:53:24,798
I'm almost 40 years old.

1119
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,162
And so the kids were asking,

1120
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:29,726
hey, can I have a build of the game to play with my friends?

1121
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:30,988
And I was like, man, no.

1122
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:32,110
I should have done it.

1123
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:34,133
I should have sent a stripped down build

1124
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,976
and let them evangelize the game for me.

1125
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:37,539
I don't know.

1126
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:38,701
I don't know, man.

1127
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:42,203
And then we went on to not even let online players organize.

1128
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:43,945
So this is like the worst thing that we did.

1129
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:46,686
Our online was divided into ranked and exhibition.

1130
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,168
And then further divided into one-on-one,

1131
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,429
two-on-two, and three-on-three.

1132
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,250
This was an utter waste of time

1133
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,592
and a flagrant display of idiotic hubris.

1134
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:56,834
You can't just make an esport.

1135
00:53:56,894 --> 00:53:57,874
An esport has to happen.

1136
00:53:58,395 --> 00:53:59,755
and we should have left it at two on two,

1137
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:02,236
won arena, and made all matches ranked.

1138
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:04,618
By including a triple A's worth of options

1139
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,278
in our online multiplayer for our game,

1140
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:08,319
we could not afford to advertise.

1141
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,161
All we did was dilute matchmaking into oblivion.

1142
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:12,981
So that was a huge disaster.

1143
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:15,723
So here's a comment from a review.

1144
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:16,883
This is an actual line.

1145
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:19,124
I can't recommend video ball on the basis

1146
00:54:19,164 --> 00:54:20,905
of its online multiplayer, however,

1147
00:54:21,565 --> 00:54:23,966
because there don't seem to be too many players

1148
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:25,507
playing it online at this point.

1149
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:29,330
So, you know, if you would recommend it,

1150
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:30,831
there would be people.

1151
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,132
This was like an 8.8 out of 10.

1152
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:33,933
Like what is, 8.8?

1153
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:36,355
I don't know.

1154
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:38,456
So, finally it's very clear to me

1155
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:40,217
that we could have made a dumber game,

1156
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,779
and I use the word dumb very, very affectionately.

1157
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,221
I love dumb games.

1158
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:47,002
I love the abstract nature of video ball.

1159
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:48,803
I love its devotion to its concept.

1160
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:49,864
It's my favorite game.

1161
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:51,265
That's the kind of person I am.

1162
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:53,406
However, maybe it should have been

1163
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:54,968
the professional edition.

1164
00:54:56,354 --> 00:54:59,135
of a much loopier, floppier, cartoonier game

1165
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,316
full of vehicles, characters, special weapons,

1166
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:04,177
anime girls, loadouts, modes, graphics, costumes, hats,

1167
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:07,018
and a robust, roguelike single player mode.

1168
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:08,819
That's Video Ball X right there.

1169
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,320
Thanks to Dan DeSalt for that fan art.

1170
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:16,242
So a wonderful man named Waseem Salman

1171
00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:17,623
referenced Frank Lloyd Wright

1172
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:20,664
in a beautiful essay about Video Ball, and I blushed.

1173
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,589
However, a student who had attended a two-hour lecture I gave at DePaul University

1174
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:29,233
about the scientific process of balancing video ball speeds and timings

1175
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:34,680
such that the average match was three minutes in length later sent me an email celebrating my

1176
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,303
process as one Bertrand Russell would approve of.

1177
00:55:37,884 --> 00:55:38,825
I almost passed out.

1178
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,667
I know and appreciate Bertrand Russell as an expert of many occupations.

1179
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:48,030
Yet I take it this specific student's comparison saw video ball as the electronic game equivalent

1180
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,072
of the fact that Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead in their book Principia Mathematica

1181
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:54,293
famously wrote 362 pages, proving that 1 plus 1 equals 2.

1182
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,197
That's, that's a, I don't know anybody who's ever read that book and I haven't either,

1183
00:56:02,377 --> 00:56:04,218
cause why would you? I already know that.

1184
00:56:04,718 --> 00:56:06,399
You know, I'm like, I'm, I'm, uh.

1185
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:08,840
So, uh, uh, basically that's a rule of thumb.

1186
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,861
Unless you already possess financial security,

1187
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,303
consider any comparison between your video game and the work of Bertrand Russell

1188
00:56:14,763 --> 00:56:16,704
to be the darkest possible omen.

1189
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,185
But can I save Videoball?

1190
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:20,967
Uh, well Videoball's primary concern is timelessness.

1191
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,088
It runs at 300 frames per second and 8K resolution.

1192
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:24,889
Uh.

1193
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:26,249
I mean it does.

1194
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,671
That sounds like, I promise I'm not joking.

1195
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,812
So if our game is meant to survive intact

1196
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:34,013
as good design for at least a thousand years,

1197
00:56:34,373 --> 00:56:36,234
calling it a failure and giving up after eight months

1198
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:38,354
is quite frankly, a little bit ridiculous.

1199
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:40,836
So we can simplify the product.

1200
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:43,697
We can remove most of the menus, no more arena select,

1201
00:56:43,877 --> 00:56:45,117
leave in only the basic arena.

1202
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:45,898
Sorry, but you.

1203
00:56:46,398 --> 00:56:47,358
That's where video ball was born.

1204
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:48,379
It was pong for the millennials.

1205
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,420
No more rules options.

1206
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,421
Every match is two on two.

1207
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:52,961
Three balls first to 10, no time limit.

1208
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:54,522
We gut the matchmaking.

1209
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,023
Every online match is two on two.

1210
00:56:56,043 --> 00:56:57,544
Three balls first to 10, no time limit.

1211
00:56:57,684 --> 00:56:58,424
Every match is ranked.

1212
00:56:58,444 --> 00:56:59,465
There's a pattern here.

1213
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:00,765
No more customization.

1214
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:02,466
All the visuals are all random all the time.

1215
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:04,367
We make the game free.

1216
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:06,649
We support it with tasteful ads.

1217
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:15,014
We tasteful ads we always intended for video ball to be a digital sporting good product. You know like a principal blank t-shirt

1218
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:19,276
So here's a version of video ball video ball white label as we call it

1219
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:23,459
We have done for various clients and organizations who want their their own

1220
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:27,741
Branded video ball we did this for PAX

1221
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:30,383
2016 we were the final round of the Omega Thon and PAX East

1222
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:34,484
So yeah, then we can take on sponsors, build an audience.

1223
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:35,306
I don't know.

1224
00:57:36,128 --> 00:57:37,471
If I were giving my pitch to...

1225
00:57:38,603 --> 00:57:40,523
those venture capitalists a year ago,

1226
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,884
this is what I would have told them

1227
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:43,804
I wanted to do for the promotion.

1228
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:46,905
And if eSports happens, it happens,

1229
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,245
and if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.

1230
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:51,706
So if you're a venture capitalist with no common sense,

1231
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:53,947
and you'd like to talk to me,

1232
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:55,267
my Twitter DMs are always open.

1233
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:58,208
And that phone number right there, it's not fake.

1234
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:00,709
So photograph this if you must,

1235
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:02,649
but please do not tweet my phone number.

1236
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,730
So in closing, Videoball is a failure

1237
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,870
because I need insulin.

1238
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,922
In closing, video ball is not a failure

1239
00:58:09,962 --> 00:58:11,383
because it is my favorite game.

1240
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:14,304
And if you'd like to play it at my house on Friday night,

1241
00:58:14,965 --> 00:58:18,066
or Saturday afternoon, or Sunday evening,

1242
00:58:18,647 --> 00:58:20,047
or if you're around next week,

1243
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,829
my Twitter DMs are always open,

1244
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:24,730
and that phone number right there is not fake.

1245
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,051
Please do not tweet my phone number.

1246
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,072
Thank you.

1247
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:30,413
Thank you.

1248
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:31,813
Thank you.

1249
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:32,914
Thank you.

1250
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:34,635
Thank you.

1251
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:34,915
Thank you.

1252
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:35,175
Thank you.

1253
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:35,455
Thank you.

1254
00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:35,736
Thank you.

1255
00:58:35,756 --> 00:58:36,016
Thank you.

1256
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:36,296
Thank you.

1257
00:58:36,316 --> 00:58:36,536
Thank you.

1258
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:51,725
One more thing. One more thing. Truck hick. Truck hick. Okay, bye.
