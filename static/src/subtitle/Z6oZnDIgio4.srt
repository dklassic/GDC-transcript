1
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,842
All right, welcome everyone.

2
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,783
So my name is Daniel Brewer,

3
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:11,544
and this is my co-presenter, Rez Graham.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,805
Here at the Summit over the years,

5
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,746
we've spent a lot of time discussing

6
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,367
how agents make decisions,

7
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,468
all of sexy different algorithms.

8
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:25,070
But one thing that we don't spend enough time on

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,692
is the data that is used to make these decisions

10
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:29,352
by these algorithms.

11
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,853
And the quality of these decisions

12
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:33,794
is far more dependent on this data

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:35,575
than it is on whatever algorithm you're using.

14
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,756
So today we're gonna talk about knowledge representation.

15
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:42,077
And I can see some of you nodding off already

16
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,437
at the back there.

17
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,037
But stay with us.

18
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:48,699
So we're gonna provide an overview of some common techniques

19
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,060
used to provide data to agents

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,080
and show how richer behaviors can be crafted

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,481
by paying attention to this data.

22
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:58,583
So if the slides will work, there we go.

23
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:03,193
When the players are playing your game, this is what they see.

24
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:06,376
And the human brain is amazing at taking this input,

25
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:09,559
identifying the important bits, and then deciding what to do.

26
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:13,982
But this is what our agents see when they're playing your game.

27
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:18,186
Or maybe it's a little bit more like this.

28
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:22,129
Our game worlds are made up of structs and pointers

29
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:23,510
and polygons and textures.

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,113
And we need our agents to interpret all of this

31
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,574
to identify the important bits.

32
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:32,530
to see the patterns in the matrix, right?

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,011
Blonde, brunette, redhead.

34
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:40,675
And so we need to provide our agents with the information

35
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:44,378
they need to allow them to make better decisions

36
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,999
and exhibit the behavior that the designer wants.

37
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,301
And it's helpful to think about this behavior falling

38
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,542
into three broad categories.

39
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:54,724
Static environment data, dynamic spatial data, and then

40
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:55,905
entity information.

41
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:01,858
So static environment data, as the name suggests,

42
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:06,100
is kind of representing the physical world to your agents.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,921
This data typically does not change

44
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,882
a hell of a lot at runtime,

45
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:14,423
and your agents use this really predominantly

46
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:16,224
to find their way around or search for positions.

47
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:20,786
Navigation and pathfinding are some

48
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,827
of AI's eternal problem spaces.

49
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,147
As environments grow more complex

50
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,728
and the movement requirements get more crazy,

51
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:30,049
the representation of the navigable space

52
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,269
needs to get more complex too.

53
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,690
It's this bit of an arms race between graphics programmers

54
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,550
and AI programmers.

55
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,832
So agents are no longer just merely required

56
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:43,153
to wander around the level in open boxes.

57
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:46,274
If we take this kind of simple environment here,

58
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:47,935
it's an open square,

59
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,496
but our designers will usually throw a challenge at us.

60
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,571
So we need to have a way for our agents to know

61
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,071
that they can stay on the pathways,

62
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,951
but they shouldn't go in the grass.

63
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,512
However, if a student is late for class

64
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:04,753
and there's no professors around,

65
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:07,873
or maybe the school is under attack by space aliens,

66
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,374
then they're gonna run across that grass anyway,

67
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:10,114
because who gives a damn?

68
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:16,216
So if using a grid for your navigation representation,

69
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,396
it's relatively simple, right?

70
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,117
You can mark up each cell in your grid

71
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,717
with the terrain type.

72
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,547
And then you can construct a cost function

73
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:27,308
that will guide your agent along the pathways.

74
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,008
When you're using a nav mesh, however,

75
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,749
things are a little bit different.

76
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,769
A typical nav mesh might look like this,

77
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,569
but this isn't good enough

78
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,330
because we don't know where anything is here.

79
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,951
So we need to provide some tools to our designers

80
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,331
to allow them to mark up this environment

81
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,632
so that they can tell the agents where the grass is

82
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,832
and where the walkways are.

83
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,327
and then we're good to go from there, right?

84
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,369
This is adding more complexity to our navigation graph,

85
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,671
but as we've seen from the Horizon talk earlier

86
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:56,532
and Nathan's talk,

87
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,234
adding this extra weight and markup

88
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:00,054
does help with the behaviors.

89
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:03,837
We use this technique in the darkness too.

90
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:07,660
Back in the day, we actually created cutting volumes

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,903
from the light cones and cut our NavMesh with those volumes,

92
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,344
and then we measured the illumination and marked that up,

93
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:15,146
and that allowed our darkling character

94
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,827
to remain in the shadows and avoid the lights.

95
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:26,147
And then once you have this information in your representation,

96
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:28,027
it's relatively easy then to construct a different,

97
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,849
choose a different cost function depending on what behavior you want to run.

98
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,092
If you use an ID to represent your terrain,

99
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,072
then you're kind of restricted to only using

100
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,813
a single type of consideration at a time.

101
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:46,214
Whereas if you use a bit mask to represent your terrain types,

102
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:49,334
you can then start combining these different weighting

103
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:54,175
factions together.

104
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,496
Now, moving along, smart objects are

105
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,936
one of the unsung heroes of a game AI knowledge

106
00:04:58,936 --> 00:04:59,596
representation.

107
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,960
The Sims is really the poster child here

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,620
for how smart objects can be used

109
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,741
to extend the capabilities of agents

110
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:09,601
and make them seem much more aware of their environment.

111
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,122
But we can use them all over the place in other games too.

112
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:16,003
F.E.A.R. used this to great effect.

113
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:19,443
At the essence, a smart object is an abstraction

114
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:23,044
and it encapsulates some arbitrarily complex logic

115
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,305
behind a simple interface.

116
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:26,445
And it ties that to a particular location

117
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,265
or entity in the world.

118
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,485
And now your agents don't need to know any of that complex

119
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,065
information.

120
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,666
They just need to know, they just

121
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,247
need to select which smart object to use.

122
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,489
And all the data, all that logic is

123
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,089
embedded in that smart object.

124
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,812
So all you need to do to make your games have raving AI

125
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:52,136
reviews is just add smart objects to your game.

126
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:55,718
Now, a lot of decisions in action and strategy games

127
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,459
revolve around.

128
00:05:57,177 --> 00:06:00,379
where should the agent move and how we should get there.

129
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,241
So it's beneficial to have an understanding

130
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,222
of the overall flow and structure of the level.

131
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,364
What are the main regions of the map?

132
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:08,624
How are these regions connected?

133
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:11,746
Where are the choke points?

134
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,468
So your navigation representation can certainly help here,

135
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:15,629
but it's often too detailed.

136
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,830
It's like trying to find the forest amidst all the trees.

137
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,453
So it's useful to have a higher level representation.

138
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:26,583
In Warframe, we use a rough corridor map as our structure

139
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,964
to represent this information.

140
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,085
We call it our tactical map.

141
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:33,589
And it represents the flow of the level at runtime.

142
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:37,012
We add a whole lot of extra markup into this graph.

143
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:38,973
We know where all the doors are and what state they're in.

144
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,835
We add our cover points and spawn points in there.

145
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,137
A whole lot of different systems use it.

146
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,539
Our AI director uses it.

147
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,421
The NPCs use this to find cover and to patrol.

148
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,549
The designers can write scripts that'll search through this graph to find objective locations.

149
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:59,812
It's a very useful abstract representation for the level.

150
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:04,613
Now dynamic spatial data is used for representing spatial relationships that are affected by

151
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:06,274
the environment and change over time.

152
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:10,535
So even though the physical structure of your level may be static,

153
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,610
The positioning of units can change at runtime,

154
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,392
and this will create a lot of dynamic situations.

155
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:19,493
And it's useful to be able to predict and react

156
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:21,114
to these situations.

157
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:25,416
So this is where it's useful to have some map of values

158
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,538
tied to specific areas in the map that represent information

159
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,819
and allow that to flow through your map,

160
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,640
through the environment, and respond to it.

161
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:38,372
Influence maps are really the go-to algorithm here,

162
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:41,613
and Dave is going to give a huge talk tomorrow about it.

163
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:42,734
It's an hour and three minutes, I think.

164
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:46,655
So I'm not going to go into detail on them,

165
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:47,936
but I'm just going to cover a couple of uses

166
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:50,217
that we found useful in Warframe.

167
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:54,078
Firstly, instead of just spreading out influence

168
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:58,059
from your characters, you can insert influence

169
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,120
where characters take damage or where they die,

170
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,281
and now you've got a danger map.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,583
And you can use this to draw enemies into the conflict zone

172
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,705
as reinforcements, or you can push enemies away,

173
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,346
characters away from that conflict zone.

174
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,698
You can also simulate environmental hazards

175
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,040
like a hull breach in a spaceship.

176
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,642
Right, when you get a window blown out,

177
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,323
you can source some influence from that window

178
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:24,985
and spread that out through your influence map.

179
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:27,427
We run our influence maps on our tactical map

180
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,488
so we know where the doors are,

181
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:30,229
we know what state the doors are in,

182
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:33,211
and then we can modify our spread of this influence

183
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,573
so that the doors will contain that vacuum in those areas.

184
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:42,058
And you can use this for fire or floods or any other environmental feature that can spread

185
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:42,439
through the map.

186
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:49,044
An objective distance map is useful for knowing where the objectives are.

187
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:54,149
You can see all the objectives in the level with a distance of zero and then use Dijkstra

188
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,372
to flood fill out the distance from any point in the map to that objective.

189
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,513
Now you've got a table lookup.

190
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:04,856
and you know how far away you are, an approximation for how far away you are from the closest objective.

191
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:08,038
You know which direction to go to get to that objective.

192
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:12,780
You can make your NPCs take cover between the players and the objective.

193
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,041
We use this a huge number of different ways.

194
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:23,225
And now you can also pay attention to the changes in influence and start to make predictions.

195
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,950
So if influence is spreading out from your characters,

196
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,593
as your characters move, the influence

197
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:32,075
is going to be rising up in the areas ahead of where

198
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:35,259
they're moving, and it'll be dropping down behind them.

199
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,461
So by looking for areas that have a positive change

200
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,264
in influence, you can predict where the player is headed.

201
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,406
And that is also quite useful.

202
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,845
Entity data is data that's used to make decisions

203
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,445
about the other active entities in your game.

204
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,906
And this is the broadest and most varied type of knowledge

205
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:57,807
that you have to deal with, and it's also highly dependent

206
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,768
on the type of game you're making.

207
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,929
In an action game, this is usually information

208
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,249
about the possible targets.

209
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,850
In a racing game, it's gonna be information

210
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,650
about the other race cars.

211
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,471
In a high strategy game, this could be information

212
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,352
about the other civilizations,

213
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,072
what technologies they've developed,

214
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,513
what resources they have to trade.

215
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,091
From my background, I've been focusing more on action games,

216
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:22,533
so that's what I'm gonna talk about here.

217
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,695
And here you'll want to track information

218
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:26,136
about possible targets.

219
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:28,518
And usually you'll have some perception system

220
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:31,340
that feeds you information about which targets

221
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,683
your agent is aware of and what he knows about them.

222
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:37,986
And you can maintain this information in a target list.

223
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,927
And this is basically just an array of structs

224
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,729
with the information that you know about those targets.

225
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,295
Now there's two important reasons why you'd want to separate your knowledge like this.

226
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:55,822
And firstly, caching this information from the world allows you to separate your AI systems

227
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:01,146
from your world and it allows you to run things asynchronously more easily because then you

228
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:05,631
don't have that dependency of your AI system pulling stuff directly from the world.

229
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:10,075
And secondly, if your agent only has access to the information he has perceived...

230
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,905
It allows your players to play tricks on your agents.

231
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,166
He can manipulate them.

232
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,506
And that's starting to get where the fun in game design is.

233
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:20,367
So what information should you store?

234
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,087
Well, at the very least, you need to know

235
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:24,568
that your target is visible or not,

236
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,228
what his last known position is.

237
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,529
Splinter Cell does a great job of that.

238
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,529
It can be useful to have the time since seen as well,

239
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,990
because that allows you to have a little bit

240
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,890
of extra robustness against a temporary obstruction.

241
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:42,058
Additionally, it's useful to keep track of the type of information perceived.

242
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:47,240
If an agent hears a noise, you don't want it to go straight into combat or run for the

243
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,380
alarm.

244
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,882
You want them to first turn around and react to see the source of that noise first.

245
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,963
And we saw an example of that in the previous talk.

246
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:59,965
If you're sharing information amongst agents, it's useful to know whether the information

247
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,206
you have is first-hand or second-hand.

248
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:06,846
because a hidden agent that the player can't see,

249
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:10,148
if he ran for the alarm based on the second-hand information,

250
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,370
it wouldn't feel fair to the player.

251
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,492
The player has no idea that that other agent was there.

252
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,834
So it would be better for the first agent,

253
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,855
who does see the player first-hand,

254
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,696
to run for the alarm.

255
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,138
This is more believable to the player,

256
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:27,499
and it also allows your player the opportunity

257
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,681
to stop that guy from triggering the alarm,

258
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,222
which is a slightly better gameplay, arguably.

259
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,317
It's useful to have an is-reachable flag as well,

260
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:39,821
so that you know whether the target

261
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,182
that you're trying to reach has,

262
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,143
you can actually reach him,

263
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,405
your pathfinding has succeeded.

264
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,367
If your pathfind fails,

265
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,889
you can mark him as unreachable,

266
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:47,750
store his position,

267
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,892
and then you don't need to pathfind to him again

268
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:52,715
until the situation has changed significantly.

269
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,177
Then once things have changed,

270
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,919
you can then clear your flag and try again.

271
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:01,019
You can also build in fallback behaviors.

272
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,681
A melee-focused enemy might choose a different target,

273
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:07,285
or he might switch weapons, and attack from a distance.

274
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,468
Some other information that's useful

275
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:14,132
is the target's aim and what weapon he's wielding, right?

276
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:15,293
You don't need to dodge someone

277
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,316
who's aiming at you with a sword,

278
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:19,418
but a ranged weapon would be appropriate.

279
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:24,228
And we can take this further if we're making a swashbuckling game and the target has a

280
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:25,989
flintlock single-shot pistol.

281
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:31,194
The one agent who's been targeted by the player might want to kind of hang back and be cautious

282
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,297
while his teammate could flank around.

283
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:38,721
And once the player has fired his shot and switched to his sword, then everyone can just

284
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:39,061
rush in.

285
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:45,529
And finally, since I'm on Warframe and we work with our directors a lot,

286
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,510
I'd like to touch on a subject here that has to do with pacing and intensity measurement.

287
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,371
So over the years, we've been looking at Warframe and the intensity of measurement of the game

288
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,832
because we want to manage the pacing dynamically at runtime.

289
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:03,913
And I've been thinking more and more about this intensity measurement

290
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:04,913
and coming up with a different metric.

291
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,206
So firstly, as the players progress through the level,

292
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,527
there'll be a varying amount of threat.

293
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,849
And this is the potential for harm to be done to the player.

294
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,991
So more enemies means more threat.

295
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:21,473
The tougher the enemies are, the more threat.

296
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:24,615
And the closer the enemies are, the more threat.

297
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:28,357
Now, players have a certain amount of resources

298
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,858
that they use to handle threat.

299
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:33,778
You've got defensive resources, and these are health and shields.

300
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:40,860
And then you've also got offensive resources, which is your ammo, your magic power level.

301
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,641
And so resources can be spent to overcome threat.

302
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:54,123
So losing health when the player gets shot is effectively spending defensive resources.

303
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:58,904
Spending ammo to shoot back is effectively spending offensive resources.

304
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,405
And now we have a measure of intensity.

305
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,430
So if the player is reducing threat

306
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,332
by only a small loss of resources,

307
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,133
then the encounter is a little bit too easy.

308
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,235
It's not challenging enough.

309
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:14,316
However, if lots of resources are being spent

310
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:15,937
to overcome that threat,

311
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,938
then that means that that encounter is quite hard

312
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:20,400
and challenging and more intense encounter.

313
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,242
Now an interesting situation happens

314
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,423
if the player is sneaking around or hiding, right?

315
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,365
Then you have a high threat level,

316
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,506
but no resources are being spent.

317
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,003
But here, the potential for the intensity

318
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:34,284
is growing over time, right?

319
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:36,627
The potential for conflict is there.

320
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:40,211
And this is a situation of rising tension.

321
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,533
And so, intensity is directly related

322
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,337
to spending resources to overcome threat.

323
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,619
However, while the threat is high,

324
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,321
it represents the potential for conflict,

325
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,744
and hence, a situation of rising tension.

326
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,889
And so this is the model that we're currently using on Warframe and we're tweaking it still.

327
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,491
But it gives the AI director richer information about what is going on around the players

328
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:03,133
at runtime and that's what this talk is about, right?

329
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,555
Providing richer information to your AI system so that they can make better decisions.

330
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:10,496
And now I'll hand you off to Rez.

331
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,083
Okay, so I'm gonna slow it down a little bit

332
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,945
and talk about representing long-term knowledge.

333
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,187
So everything we just heard was about representing

334
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,589
some of the more short-term knowledge

335
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,371
for combat encounters and that kind of stuff.

336
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,534
So I'm gonna focus more on long-term stuff,

337
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,636
stuff that might be more appropriate for simulation,

338
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:34,599
RPG, strategy games, that kind of stuff.

339
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,342
It can be used for anything for long-term, you know.

340
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:39,045
relationships and things like that.

341
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,529
The two major things I'm going to talk about

342
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:42,791
are stats and tags.

343
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,355
So those are the, I think we get a lot of mileage

344
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,377
out of those two things.

345
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:49,763
And everything that Dan said applies to these types

346
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:50,925
of games as well.

347
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:51,986
So, you know, go nuts.

348
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:53,474
Okay, so number one, stats.

349
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:58,518
Stats are, they're really just fuzzy values.

350
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,680
They're values that represent some kind of fuzzy state.

351
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,221
You know, how hungry am I?

352
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,462
How much fun am I having?

353
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:06,783
How much social have I gotten?

354
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:07,604
That kind of stuff.

355
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,586
Or, I like you by this amount.

356
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:11,747
Or really, any of these things.

357
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:12,887
My skill is this high.

358
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:15,569
My relationship, my diplomatic relationships

359
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,571
are at this point.

360
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,932
You know, my people have these types of needs.

361
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:20,333
So,

362
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:27,147
Stats are almost always either normalized or clamped in some way, so there's some normalized

363
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,590
value and that could be literally normalized 0 to 1.

364
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,493
On the Sims they were typically negative 100 to positive 100.

365
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:37,398
And this gives you a range of comparisons so you can easily compare and contrast them

366
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:39,740
and have them mean various different things.

367
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,042
They can be ticked, so that's another thing that you can do.

368
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,663
And what I mean by that is they can decay.

369
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,185
So on the Sims, often your emotes would decay.

370
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:52,087
They can be timeouts, cooldowns, simple things like that.

371
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,488
Which also means, of course, that they can be as simple

372
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:58,431
as literally float and then some value or some identifier,

373
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:02,093
or they can be larger complex for like big objects,

374
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,253
which is what they were on the Sims

375
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,714
and many of these other types of games.

376
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:07,390
They can also be calculated values,

377
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,453
and what I mean by that is truly derived

378
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,914
from a variety of other things.

379
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,176
And I'll get into that more when I talk about things like tags

380
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,778
and how you can derive this kind of stuff.

381
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,680
And this is one of our major things used in decision making.

382
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,242
If you're using utility or whatever method

383
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,664
that you happen to be using under the covers,

384
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:27,147
we spend a lot of time using that to integrate that

385
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,790
into whatever our decision making system is.

386
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:30,890
So.

387
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:35,474
As I said, they're numbers that represent fuzzy values.

388
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,358
Oh, and I said all this stuff.

389
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,630
Sometimes clamps are just...

390
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,050
Right, so I missed this.

391
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,891
The last two points on this little slide are

392
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:44,211
they want to provide,

393
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:47,192
they're good for providing very subtle behavior.

394
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,533
So, and like micro changes, and I'll give you an example.

395
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:54,274
If you look at something like The Sims or other such games,

396
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,594
a lot of the core interactions on The Sims

397
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,135
are these small micro interactions.

398
00:18:59,135 --> 00:18:59,975
Socials, for example.

399
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,336
I'm gonna go up and I'm going to say hello

400
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:03,796
to this particular Sim.

401
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:06,617
I'm going to give this Sim a hug, that kind of stuff.

402
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,598
And so that can be very, very, those are like,

403
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,679
that's the inner loop.

404
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,460
You're doing these small interactions

405
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,962
which slowly increment this value over time.

406
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:19,765
That along with many values go into larger calculations.

407
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,067
And so you get, in my opinion,

408
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:25,429
you get much more emergent type behavior.

409
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,911
I'll give you a direct example from a game

410
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,873
that I'm sure 100% of you have heard of.

411
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,594
Barbie Diaries High School Mystery.

412
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,937
Let the jealousy wash over you, it's fine.

413
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:40,538
Back in 2005, many, many moons ago, I worked on this game.

414
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,218
And believe it or not, there's a little simulation

415
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,639
that happens under the covers.

416
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:47,539
There's a little utility-based AI thing happening.

417
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,860
And the reason that I created this is

418
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,081
because it's a high school simulation,

419
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,301
or a high school adventure game, really.

420
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,622
So we formed little cliques.

421
00:19:55,822 --> 00:20:01,369
And the way we did that was, it was just basically a hash table of entity ID to floats

422
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,854
that determined how much I wanted to talk to particular people of particular types.

423
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:09,679
So you had the jocks and the goths and the popular girls and the nerds,

424
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,626
and they rarely interacted with others of their opposite kinds.

425
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,547
And it was a trivial thing.

426
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,908
I mean, I did this in like two hours or something.

427
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,629
But it created enough behavior that other people were like,

428
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,890
hey, what happened to the AI?

429
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,990
Something happened.

430
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,231
Some subtle thing happened that made it significantly better.

431
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:29,412
So through small things like this,

432
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,013
you can get significant behavior.

433
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,175
On a game like The Sims, you can,

434
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,637
is a good example of taking this even further.

435
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:39,099
So we did have a relationship score

436
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,400
from negative 100 to positive 100,

437
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,762
but we actually had several of them.

438
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,683
So if you look down there at Courtney,

439
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:47,205
we have two different tracks.

440
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,027
So one is a green meter and one is a pink meter.

441
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:51,589
That's friendship and romance,

442
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,670
which are two totally different axes.

443
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,913
And mixing and matching these axes becomes very interesting

444
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:02,918
because the common path is friendship and romance march forward together, mostly.

445
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:05,401
But you can get some really interesting behaviors

446
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:08,944
when you do interactions that sort of lower one

447
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:12,026
and then do interactions that raise the other.

448
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,168
And so you can get like, what does it look like

449
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:17,291
when you have something like high friendship, low romance

450
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,932
or low friendship, high romance?

451
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:23,076
So high friendship, low romance, maybe you're friends,

452
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,678
really good friends, and you tried something,

453
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:25,859
but it didn't quite work out.

454
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,861
Whereas low friendship, high romance,

455
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,503
there's some, is there some kind of like

456
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:32,165
codependency happening, or are you actual

457
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,767
bitter enemies that sleep together?

458
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:37,891
So you can get some really interesting subtle behavior,

459
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:41,194
and you can add, you can sort of multiply this behavior

460
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:43,897
considerably and get all sorts of crazy stuff.

461
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,264
The other thing that I want to talk about,

462
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,925
the other kind of big thing, are tags.

463
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,485
And I'm going to use this.

464
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:55,446
So tags are chunks of information that you hang on entities,

465
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:59,487
sort of like ornaments on a Christmas tree.

466
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,628
You know, X is this type of thing, that sort of stuff.

467
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:05,369
And so they let you say like, oh, it's this race.

468
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,490
These are Ls, and this is what Ls mean.

469
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,571
So it's kind of like a runtime type information.

470
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:13,031
Or I belong to this faction.

471
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,972
And tags are really cool and they're very contextual,

472
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:19,254
so it's hard to give very, I'll give some examples,

473
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,217
because you can do things like history, right?

474
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,939
Because of this history, I very much am trying

475
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:29,021
to find the six-fingered man who killed my father, right?

476
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:33,404
And so you can use tags to like, this is his drive.

477
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,265
This is his entire purpose.

478
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:38,187
And fascinating at the end of the movie when he says,

479
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:41,069
you know, I've been in the revenge business for so long

480
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,470
that now that I'm out, I don't know what to do

481
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,910
with the rest of my life.

482
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,052
So what happens when those tags are removed?

483
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:48,013
It can define your whole life.

484
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:49,134
You can be the chosen one.

485
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,514
And then what happens?

486
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,809
or curse or states or anything, right?

487
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,312
These tags can be used for just about anything.

488
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,835
They can even drive short-term behavior.

489
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,437
Maybe you're looking for the antidote

490
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,959
to the poison that you just drank.

491
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:08,989
So tags are ways of just identifying pieces of information

492
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,050
and pieces of things that we want to keep track of.

493
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:16,414
I'll give several examples, but first, similar to stats,

494
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:21,518
it can just be an enum somewhere, or it can be full-fledged,

495
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:25,361
full-on classes, which they are in games like The Sims.

496
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:32,986
I want to talk and also bring back the deriving stats from tags thing with a game called Crusader

497
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:36,347
Kings 2 because I think they do this masterfully.

498
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:41,910
I think this is they because they also solve another interesting AI problem.

499
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,031
So first this is Earl Lawrence.

500
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:48,513
This is one of my vassals in this particular game and he's being kind of a dick.

501
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,741
at negative 18.

502
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:50,981
So why?

503
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:52,182
Why is he being a dick?

504
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,846
Well, they solve the first rule of AI pretty trivially,

505
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:56,766
right, the first rule of AI is

506
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:59,949
show the player what you're doing.

507
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,311
So there's a lot of stuff here.

508
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:04,153
You know, we generally,

509
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:05,934
if you look at the last three, for example,

510
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:10,038
we generally believe the same things.

511
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:11,279
And so we're generally nice guys,

512
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,001
but oh, look at this.

513
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,602
I hold a lot of duchies,

514
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:16,364
and he super wants one of them.

515
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,840
So, you know, I can manipulate him by doing that,

516
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,801
but that's gonna drive a lot of his interactions,

517
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,883
a lot of his desires, and I can see it right here,

518
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:27,264
and it all boils down to one number, which I can look at,

519
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,326
derived from these different tags that come into play.

520
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:34,104
So they do it really well, I think.

521
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:36,245
We do something similar on The Sims.

522
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:41,169
So there are these things called emotions.

523
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,010
So The Sims is very sad.

524
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,772
And there's two little things down there that tell you why.

525
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:47,054
And I'll show a different example because I found a

526
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:47,834
screenshot for it.

527
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,056
This sim is playful.

528
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,777
And why is this sim playful?

529
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,598
Well, I can hover over these little things

530
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:56,399
and they'll tell me.

531
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:59,100
This thing says plus three because there's playful decor.

532
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,761
So because this sim happens to be in a room

533
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:04,503
that has playful decor, we can detect that,

534
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,884
oh, okay, there's playful decor,

535
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,385
we're gonna give this buff or tag, we call them buffs.

536
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:15,872
And all we do is we sum up all of the different emotional weights on each of the different tags that they have and

537
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,913
the one that has the highest value wins.

538
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:22,898
That's the emotion the sim is in. If the sim were to leave this room, one of those others might take place.

539
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:26,401
There's a couple of sort of more happy slash playful emotions on the right.

540
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,103
This then unlocks other interactions that you can do,

541
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:33,026
which can even further drive more playful buffs and tags

542
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:33,687
and stuff like that.

543
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,329
So you can sort of go down this rabbit hole.

544
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:37,791
And we've all experienced that, right?

545
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,273
How many times have we been sad or depressed

546
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,194
and like we're our own worst enemy

547
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:43,776
when we get into that state?

548
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,218
Or happy, and you go around other people who are happy,

549
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:47,299
and now you're even more happy,

550
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,001
and then you drink, and you're even more happy.

551
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:50,601
Or sometimes not.

552
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:51,042
You can...

553
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:58,058
You can also kind of go the other way around,

554
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,019
or like really combine them in more ways.

555
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,541
So I'm gonna kind of blast through this little part.

556
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:08,105
These two guys are lovers and they're best friends

557
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,607
and all of these came from the stats.

558
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:13,028
So they did a bunch of interactions with each other,

559
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,969
and that raised their stat to a certain point.

560
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,490
So they went from acquaintances to friends to best friends

561
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:17,810
and so on.

562
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,572
But also, down there at the bottom, you'll see promised.

563
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:25,774
So that's basically like, we're going steady,

564
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,394
or we're going to get engaged.

565
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:31,656
And marriage has nothing to do with how high or low

566
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,236
your romance is.

567
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:34,137
Like, you don't reach a certain part in the romance track

568
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:36,118
and instantly become married.

569
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:37,679
So we had both.

570
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,959
We called them relationship bits,

571
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,300
but they were just tags.

572
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:46,396
Okay, now against all wonderful medical advice,

573
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,357
I'm going to do a little demo.

574
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,978
I wanna show you something.

575
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:50,558
It's really nice.

576
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,519
And we're gonna see if this actually works.

577
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,760
Oh cool, it doesn't.

578
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,380
There we go.

579
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,981
Let's see.

580
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,741
Great.

581
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,302
Now it's showing everything on this monitor

582
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:00,563
and nothing anywhere else.

583
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:00,943
That's fine.

584
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,083
I'll make this work.

585
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,484
So this is a little town,

586
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:05,725
and while this is happening,

587
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,526
I'm gonna try and see if I can get back to,

588
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,886
where's duplicate?

589
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:09,927
Which one is it?

590
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:10,227
That it?

591
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:10,427
Okay.

592
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:15,598
Yay, okay, I totally practiced this

593
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:17,539
in the speaker lounge too, and it worked.

594
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:22,421
Okay, so we have this nice little spot here,

595
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:26,183
and none of my input is working, which is also cool.

596
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:28,284
So if I just look at some of these guys,

597
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:29,765
oh, it crashed, I think that's what happened.

598
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:29,945
Sweet.

599
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:34,427
Okay, great, we're back.

600
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,471
So I have these, you know, this is a little simulated town.

601
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:42,152
These little green things are little houses

602
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,793
where people live and these are where people work.

603
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:45,094
And this is the inn.

604
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,555
And there's like a little blacksmith shop.

605
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:47,295
So I can like click on these

606
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,316
and I can see blacksmith's forge.

607
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:51,497
And so they kind of all have their own little schedule.

608
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:54,179
They'll go back and forth for a while doing their thing.

609
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,679
And if I click on one, oh no, you left, come back.

610
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,920
And I click on one of these people

611
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,621
and there's like tons of information here.

612
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:02,343
So I have like stats and things like that

613
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:03,663
that mostly I just made up.

614
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:08,006
But in terms of actually driving behavior,

615
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:11,088
I have things like, I'll pause this

616
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,810
and kind of draw on my little thing here.

617
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,732
I have things like object ownership.

618
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:21,356
So they will choose specifically this desk, this bed,

619
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:24,698
this table to do their work in.

620
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:27,380
Their schedule and all that stuff is relying on that.

621
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,481
These are their various different.

622
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:34,925
There are various different relationships and stuff like that.

623
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:40,950
And so as they kind of go about their day, you can kind of see that all of this stuff

624
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,033
can really drive behavior in some fairly significant ways.

625
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,435
This guy's moving.

626
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:51,859
I don't know what this guy's doing.

627
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,580
Sneak out.

628
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,041
Sneak out at intable.

629
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:59,425
Oh, this person has a trader trait.

630
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:02,057
which I just injected.

631
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:07,980
Oh shit, this guy is, this girl, Jasmine, is our trader.

632
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,441
So if we look at data and see what's going on,

633
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,222
we can see that because of this demo,

634
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:15,083
I hacked in this little trader trait,

635
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,644
and if we look at what the trader trait does,

636
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,744
and notice I'm showing no code, this is all data.

637
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,945
I have this little trader trait,

638
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:22,726
and all it does is it says, hey,

639
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:25,808
your decision, do this thing on top of this as well.

640
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:27,928
And if I go here, I can say, oh look,

641
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:28,829
and I'll zoom this way in.

642
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,491
I can say, oh, look, here we go.

643
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:33,292
From 1 a.m. to 2 a.m., do this action.

644
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,313
I have it set at high priority

645
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:36,895
because I'm doing a demo at GDC

646
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,336
and maybe you wanna see that actually happen,

647
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,398
but you could have this at any priority that you want

648
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:42,679
so that it doesn't happen every night.

649
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,240
It happens some nights, and trivially,

650
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,342
with three small data entries

651
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:47,863
that you could have easily added

652
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:50,945
in whatever significant XML tool that you've added,

653
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:54,988
you now have this fancy behavior, and this person's back.

654
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:55,188
So.

655
00:29:57,618 --> 00:30:01,160
That is basically it.

656
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,221
Where is my slide thing?

657
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,322
We're gonna pretend it's this.

658
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:07,363
Oh no, I've lost it.

659
00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:08,784
Great.

660
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:09,584
This will work.

661
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:10,345
There we go.

662
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:10,465
Years.

663
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:15,288
So in conclusion, fuzzy values provide subtle

664
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:16,168
and emergent behavior.

665
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:19,610
They're really good for things like microchanges

666
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,451
and tags are really good for chunks of information

667
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:23,012
like event-based things that happen.

668
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:25,553
I've gone to war with you and all that kind of stuff.

669
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:29,261
So they can be used together for great effect.

670
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,788
That's it. That's us. Thank you so much.
