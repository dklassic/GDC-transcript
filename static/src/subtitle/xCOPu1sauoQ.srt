1
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,665
All right.

2
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:12,868
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:14,489
My name is Jim Brown from Epic Games.

4
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,973
I have been fortunate enough to have been in this industry

5
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:20,234
for about 20 years now.

6
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:23,677
But I actually got into doing this.

7
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:26,218
I came into the industry with a background in biology

8
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:28,520
and behavioral science.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,642
And I wanted to share a little bit of that with you today

10
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:34,165
to show how you can use that in level design.

11
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:34,965
Because.

12
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,490
I want to talk about choice theory.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:44,614
And when someone sits down to play a video game, they are very much at our mercy.

14
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:49,978
They are constrained by our rules, they're locked into the path of the world that we

15
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:54,901
build, and they're limited by the controls that we set up for them.

16
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,498
But we never want them to actually feel that way.

17
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:04,721
If we're doing our jobs well, then the player will always feel like they're the one who's

18
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,382
actually in control.

19
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:12,824
We want to give them the illusion of choice so that they can continue to have a great

20
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:13,885
time.

21
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:20,987
And by understanding how people actually make choices, we have a much better chance of maintaining

22
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:21,668
that illusion.

23
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,098
Now, how we choose is, of course, this huge topic,

24
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,679
and there's no way I can cover it all in 30 minutes.

25
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,021
So I wanted to kind of give you three introductory concepts,

26
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,282
the paradox, availability, and sunk costs.

27
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,143
And I'm going to talk about each one individually,

28
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:39,604
just kind of in a general context,

29
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:42,685
before moving on to showing you how you can use them

30
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,606
in terms of level design.

31
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,387
So starting with the paradox.

32
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:54,307
This is Temple Grandin. She is a behavioral scientist who developed this special chute

33
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:59,730
for funneling herds of cattle into the slaughterhouse. As the cows move into this chute,

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,754
they are understandably uncooperative and scared, and then the chute gets narrow and turns and gets

35
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:11,157
narrow and turns and narrow and turns, and it keeps doing that until the cows have no choices left.

36
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:17,080
The only thing that they can do is funnel forward calmly in a single file line.

37
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:23,561
And Dr. Granny was able to develop this by studying her own mind because she suffers

38
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:28,685
from autism, a disease which makes it very easy for her to become overwhelmed by even

39
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,388
the most simplest of everyday choices.

40
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:37,513
Through her research, she was able to show that we could actually be happier with less

41
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:38,814
choice in our lives.

42
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:45,088
And that concept has become known as the paradox of choice.

43
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:48,951
We know that choice is essential to player autonomy.

44
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,534
But new research is showing that that's only true up

45
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:53,515
to a certain point.

46
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,617
Beyond that threshold, the vast number

47
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:59,500
of choices that we're faced with can actually be overwhelming.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,361
Your brain starts to panic.

49
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,923
You feel like things are spinning out of control.

50
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:11,407
And this is why it's so important that we maintain that illusion of choice.

51
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:17,771
Too much actual choice and we can actually break our player's flow state, which makes

52
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:21,373
the game, in their eyes, less fun or interesting.

53
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:28,098
And I found it curious, Wired Magazine did a review of Fallout 4, call out to Joel, he's

54
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:28,358
gonna be...

55
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:32,644
a lot in this talk today, and they said, and I quote,

56
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:36,226
released from your pod, the swirl of emotions and questions

57
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:41,148
threatened to overwhelm right when you need to remain focused.

58
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:45,130
You have no idea where to begin, and it's a stark introduction to just how

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,093
vast and open this world is. But, despite the near futility of your

60
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,134
situation, the seamless introduction of mechanics

61
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,895
and systems has you feeling prepared to face

62
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,116
whatever you might discover.

63
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:06,519
In this case, Bethesda is purposefully using the paradox of choice to evoke an overwhelming

64
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,723
emotional state in the player, and it works because it's all an illusion.

65
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:15,846
The elements of the game unfold logically.

66
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:22,310
New environments, new controls are seamlessly introduced, and the actual game elements themselves

67
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,472
never break that player's flow state.

68
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:28,577
And this shows you that once you know about things like the paradox, you can actually

69
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:31,059
use them as a tool to your advantage.

70
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:37,905
Next concept is something that's called the availability heuristic, which basically means

71
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:44,011
that the more familiar something is to you, the more you are likely to believe it or to

72
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:44,471
like it.

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,111
And this is as much, this is due as much to our biology as it is psychology.

74
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:56,573
If you think of your brain as this crazy, complicated web of billions of neurons, and

75
00:04:56,573 --> 00:05:00,974
if you want to get a thought from one end of that web to the other, those neurons will

76
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:08,696
actually start to form little shortcuts, little hops, little skips that form to help us make

77
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:09,876
decisions quickly.

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,485
Something that happens to you more often creates more of these shortcuts,

79
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:20,028
and therefore becomes more and more available to your memory.

80
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,969
Hence the name.

81
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:27,294
This means that as a designer, you are much more likely to implement a design

82
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,377
that meshes with your own personal experiences,

83
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,239
instead of one that's better or more meaningful for your players,

84
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:37,043
even when you are purposely trying not to do that.

85
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:42,801
How many shooters have you played where you end up in an air conditioning duct?

86
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:48,167
How many RPGs have you played where you end up exploring the sewers beneath the city?

87
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:55,645
These aren't great original experiences, and we all know that, yet we keep building them.

88
00:05:55,645 --> 00:06:00,591
After a lifetime of playing them over and over, they are familiar to us.

89
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:08,299
So our brains shortcut to referencing them as fun experiences, because familiarity breeds liking.

90
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,792
The effects of availability heuristic can be incredibly subtle.

91
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:18,236
You probably don't even realize that they're affecting you like they do every day.

92
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:22,600
At one point we wanted to update our classic Unreal Tournament logo.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,081
It was a little bit too old school.

94
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:26,583
We wanted to give it a more modern, fresh design.

95
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:31,307
We found a couple that we liked and then we realized that the new logos had been designed

96
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,810
by someone who had been playing a heck of a lot of Quake.

97
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,511
Now, the availability heuristic doesn't just affect you, it affects your players as well.

98
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:49,853
And it makes them make choices that are much more vivid in their memory.

99
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:53,714
Now, vivid choices can stand out in a number of different ways.

100
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:58,936
They can stand out physically, like in this image, your eyes are drawn to the bright doorways,

101
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:05,038
and you're very likely to miss the actual exits, the doors that are on the right-hand side.

102
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,198
Vivid choices can also stand out emotionally.

103
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:11,849
In Bioshock, did you harvest the Little Sisters, or did you save them?

104
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:17,111
According to the statistics, the vast majority of players actually saved the Little Sisters,

105
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:22,934
at least on their first playthrough, because saving children has a vivid emotional pull.

106
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:29,526
But vivid choices can also stand out simply because they are present.

107
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:35,308
I know a ton of people who actually thought that the settlement quests in Fallout were

108
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:41,050
the main storyline and the main point of the game, because they're always there in your

109
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,570
quest log.

110
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,852
They're always there, they're always present, right at the very top, so they feel like they're

111
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:46,812
more important.

112
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:55,715
When we fall victim to the effects of the availability heuristic, we're actually succumbing to fake choices.

113
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:04,558
And the effects of this will start to creep in to all of your levels and take away feelings of autonomy and choice from your players.

114
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:12,237
The other factor that dramatically influences player choice is the concept of sunk costs.

115
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:17,861
This is the fallout dude, he's giving you that one last chance to finally

116
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,763
finalize and change your appearance.

117
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:24,126
But usually, once you've made a decision like this,

118
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,627
you are going to stick with it.

119
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:30,951
It doesn't matter that the path that you chose is too difficult.

120
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:35,055
It doesn't matter that you can easily turn around, go back, and make another choice.

121
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:40,311
There is a cost that is associated with making a decision.

122
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:46,719
And once we make that choice, our brains are immediately invested in the outcome.

123
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:51,705
This is a big part of what drives free-to-play games.

124
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:55,827
Once you've put time and money into setting up a base for yourself,

125
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,388
you're going to keep rebuilding that base.

126
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,589
Even if making a new base is clearly the better option,

127
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,570
you're more likely to keep rebuilding your old one

128
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,912
because you've already sunk your efforts into that original decision.

129
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:14,833
Now, as usual, this is due, in large part, to our biology.

130
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:23,234
What you want is actually a different part of your brain than what you like.

131
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,195
You can control what you want.

132
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:29,759
Right now you could say, I want to go sit outside in the sun.

133
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,960
But you can't control what you like.

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,305
You can't suddenly decide to like the taste of broccoli if you don't already do that.

135
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:45,887
And because what you like is unconscious, that means it'll always take priority over what you want.

136
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:52,794
So once our players start down a path, a bad path,

137
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:57,137
whether they want to or not, they are going to continue

138
00:09:57,137 --> 00:10:00,080
because they're already invested in that initial decision.

139
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,644
And your brain actually robs you of that choice to turn back.

140
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,144
So there's three quick principles that explain how we choose,

141
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,306
and now I want to show you some examples of how that can influence

142
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:17,449
three different types of level design, linear, open-world,

143
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,411
and, of course, multiplayer, my bread and butter.

144
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:25,796
Linear games generally considered to be the absolute bane of level design

145
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:29,699
because we are putting the player on rails.

146
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,201
And this is probably the best-known image that explains

147
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:35,163
how most people feel these days about linear levels.

148
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,159
But E1M6, the Doom map on the left here,

149
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,420
was actually a completely linear level,

150
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,881
just like the other one, but it was disguised.

151
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,122
You were given colored keys that you had to collect

152
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:52,182
and then you had to backtrack,

153
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:54,123
and we refilled those spaces

154
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:55,383
with different types of encounters.

155
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:58,064
Occasionally we gave you a different type of shortcut.

156
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:08,090
The real difference between these two levels is that the Doom map maintains player autonomy.

157
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:15,432
Now, when people talk about choices, they very often confuse the concepts of agency and autonomy.

158
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:23,014
Agency is our capacity to choose, to do whatever we want, whenever we want.

159
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:28,456
Autonomy, on the other hand, is our capacity to make an informed decision.

160
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:35,841
It's less about choice and more just your brain agreeing to go with the flow,

161
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:39,663
because you've decided that that's the best option.

162
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:43,804
Autonomy means that you endorse the path that you're on,

163
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,285
even if that path is completely linear.

164
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,614
And nothing highlights this better than speedruns.

165
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:55,941
These players are on an extremely linear and unforgiving path,

166
00:11:55,941 --> 00:12:00,066
but they still feel like they're the ones who are in control at all times.

167
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:06,801
Now remember that no matter how open or how linear a level actually is, the player is

168
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:10,803
always on a path from A to B. That's basic game theory.

169
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:15,706
I give you a starting point and a goal, and you move along the path to that goal.

170
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:22,170
And it's totally fine if there's only one path to get to that goal, as long as the player

171
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,012
has the autonomy to feel like it's the path that they chose.

172
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:27,333
Now...

173
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:35,740
That's not new, but there are a couple of problems with the way that we typically try and do that sort of thing.

174
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,385
Because of the availability heuristic, our players are already going to have a built-in set of expectations about what's coming.

175
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:48,949
So to get around that, we throw things at them. We try and distract them with,

176
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,692
oh look, here's something bright, you should look over here, bright or colorful.

177
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,374
Or hey, here's an interesting encounter to distract you for a while.

178
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,575
I'll give you a side quest to do over here.

179
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:04,460
But every time you do that, you're more and more likely to actually push them past that line of paradox,

180
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,842
where they end up feeling lost or overwhelmed.

181
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:12,485
And at that point, there's this special part of your brain that kicks in

182
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:17,209
that is 100% devoted to filtering out all distractions.

183
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,852
The only thing that it wants to do is get from A to B.

184
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,966
So you put all this together, you have your brain pushing you forward, overwhelmed by

185
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:34,953
distractions that it is desperately trying to ignore, but refusing to stop because the

186
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:40,278
sunk cost principle means that you're already invested in reaching that destination.

187
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,663
Basically, this is no longer a fun experience.

188
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:49,954
So, rather than overwhelm the player with all these distractions,

189
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:56,156
I'm proposing that we could try and use something called the peak-end rule

190
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,397
to focus them.

191
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:00,378
When you look back on something that's happened to you,

192
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:03,119
your brain looks at how you felt

193
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,400
at the very peak of that experience and at the very end.

194
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:11,405
And over time, those two points, and only those two points,

195
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:15,266
become the brain's reference for our overall emotional

196
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,546
experience.

197
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:20,987
Stress, boredom, frustration, annoyance, all of those

198
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,988
have no effect on your long-term memory

199
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,449
if they're far enough removed from the peak and the end

200
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:27,969
points.

201
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:35,590
So if you can focus on making just those two points the most vivid for your player, again

202
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,574
remember back to the availability heuristic, they become the most available to their memory

203
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:47,777
and then you can focus your design in a way that maximizes the enjoyability of that level

204
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,598
even if it's completely linear.

205
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:55,144
This is one of the reasons that people can suffer for hours through extremely difficult

206
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,734
levels in Bloodborne and still come away feeling like they had a great experience.

207
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:08,332
On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, we have open world designs, which probably

208
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:14,494
seem like they offer more choice to the player than any other type of level, but even with

209
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:22,077
an open sandbox, the player's choices still have to happen within the constraints of the

210
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:23,958
game's rules and systems.

211
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,899
And I look back personally.

212
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:31,812
on completing the Thieves Guild quests in Skyrim and certainly Oblivion

213
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,756
as some of my all-time favorite moments in gaming. Another shout out.

214
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:41,321
But I guarantee that if you did the Thieves Guild 2,

215
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:47,126
then you and I followed the exact same quests. And we had the exact same outcome.

216
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,679
You made the decision to start that quest chain,

217
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,661
but you had no choice in the order or the outcome

218
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,724
of the specific quests involved in that chain.

219
00:15:56,724 --> 00:16:01,547
You did have good autonomy along the way,

220
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,129
and that gave you the illusion of choice.

221
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,812
Your Thieves Guild experience probably felt

222
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,954
a lot more unique and special than it actually was.

223
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,445
People also feel the same way about MMOs.

224
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:19,549
They go in feeling like they have almost completely unlimited choices and unlimited options.

225
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:23,973
But in the end, it too is all an illusion.

226
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:31,919
There is a huge sunk cost that goes into setting up a character and bringing that character

227
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,680
all the way to max level.

228
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:41,189
There's really only one right path to get them all the way there and get all the necessary gear that you want.

229
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:48,495
So guilds go in and they practice their raids over and over until there's really no choice left

230
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:54,800
and it's just a performance where everyone has to be in the exact right place at the exact right time

231
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,443
and do the exact right thing in hopes of getting the exact right gear.

232
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:04,099
Now, I'm not saying that there's no choice in these levels.

233
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,000
Obviously, there is.

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,923
But open world doesn't necessarily

235
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,685
mean more choice for the player.

236
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,168
And it doesn't necessarily mean better choice for the player.

237
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,411
When we give someone the option to go left, right, left, right,

238
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,532
over and over and over and over.

239
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:24,759
That's not choice as much as it is just simple decision-making.

240
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,720
That's the kind of thing, exactly the kind of thing,

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,681
that leads to players feeling overwhelmed.

242
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:33,642
Real choices, and I say that in big air quotes,

243
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,543
are meaningful, where the player has autonomy

244
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:39,344
and feels responsible for the outcome,

245
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:41,305
whether that outcome is good or bad.

246
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:51,623
Which brings me to multiplayer, where players arguably have higher levels of autonomy than in any other type of design,

247
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:55,785
because in multiplayer, choices really matter.

248
00:17:55,785 --> 00:18:01,549
They have this butterfly effect that impacts everyone else's choices in the server,

249
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,431
as well in this constant loop of cause and effect.

250
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:09,034
Multiplayer experiences are social.

251
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:17,962
And more people means more information, and information is the currency of choice.

252
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:24,543
With more information, you can make better choices, and that's what makes those decisions

253
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:26,584
actually feel more meaningful.

254
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:32,925
But of course, the multiplayer designer still has influence over player choice, and the

255
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:39,526
goal is to make sure that the impact of that influence doesn't take away from player autonomy.

256
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:47,059
Even very simple changes in architecture can affect how players make choices in a map.

257
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:53,802
Here's a shot that has two different versions of the same map, and in the left image, players

258
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:56,944
almost always chose to take the left-hand path.

259
00:18:56,944 --> 00:19:02,626
The visuals unintentionally were funneling them in that direction.

260
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,682
by removing that doorframe, as we did in the right-hand image,

261
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,224
we opened up lines of sight and got a much better distribution

262
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:13,226
of players across the entire map.

263
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:16,809
Because players were able to make that choice

264
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,291
without our influence and without us actually adding

265
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,293
in more pathing options.

266
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:28,057
Because pathing decisions in multiplayer maps

267
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,818
shouldn't be complicated.

268
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:36,754
If you look at the most popular map in virtually any multiplayer game, you'll start to notice a pattern.

269
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:41,036
They leave very little path choice to the players.

270
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:46,779
This is Dust and Counter-Strike. You spawn in, you can choose A or B. It's one of two options.

271
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:54,403
If you look at virtually any intersection in the entire map, you have two, maybe three choices in the direction to go.

272
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,785
Even MOBAs. This is Summoner's Rift, League of Legends.

273
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:02,546
two, or in this case, three real lanes to go down,

274
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:08,048
and those paths are very, very distinct and very, very obvious.

275
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:11,530
Last one, Gears of War, Gridlock was our most popular map.

276
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,911
It had exactly one path.

277
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:16,192
Players ran down it until they ran into each other

278
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:17,852
and started shooting each other in the face.

279
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:27,197
These complex, choice-filled games are actually most successful when they respect the paradox

280
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:30,499
and actually remove choice.

281
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:36,322
By reducing the overall cognitive load on the player, it allows them to focus on what

282
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:43,806
they perceive as the most important choices—increasing autonomy and overall happiness.

283
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:51,447
So how can you use this information to put meaningful choice and autonomy in your own

284
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:52,208
maps?

285
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,795
Following my magic formula, I have exactly three tips for you.

286
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:59,699
Starting with design without intent.

287
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:04,975
Now I'm not just spouting that as some weird philosophy.

288
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:10,540
There is actually a technical term that is used by architects and engineers called design

289
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,060
with intent.

290
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,946
That means employing a strategic design to purposefully influence someone's behavior.

291
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:22,966
When you go to Disneyland, the pathways and the architecture

292
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:26,350
are purposefully designed to reduce traffic jams

293
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,253
and help guide you with landmarks through the park,

294
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:30,675
which is pretty cool.

295
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,878
When you go to Vegas, the casinos

296
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:36,282
are designed to purposefully disorient you and make

297
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:39,185
you lose track of time, which isn't quite so cool.

298
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:44,580
We guide our players with color and light and architecture,

299
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,687
and usually we're really good about doing that around key landmarks.

300
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:54,096
But everything that we build has an impact.

301
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,517
And we're very inconsistent about when we actually

302
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,177
pay attention to that.

303
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:02,218
We have more influence than we intend to,

304
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,918
simply because we're sloppy.

305
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:08,320
In the example here, one choice has been highlighted by default.

306
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,481
And that means that players are significantly more

307
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:15,062
likely to select it, even if they only do so by accident.

308
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:19,266
Now, advertisers use a lot of similar techniques.

309
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,288
There's a list of them here.

310
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,990
I don't have time to go into all of them.

311
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,872
They are important, so take the time

312
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,634
to look them up if you care about this stuff.

313
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:29,479
But if your goal is autonomy.

314
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,160
These techniques are all flawed.

315
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,086
They work because they activate that subconscious decision-making part of your brain.

316
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:46,473
These techniques all actually reduce player autonomy by abusing the effects of the availability

317
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:52,660
heuristic and the sunk cost principle to make players do things against their rational will.

318
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,607
So, when I say that we should design without intent, I'm not saying that we should be haphazard

319
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:00,247
or sloppy.

320
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:07,154
I'm saying that we should give our players options instead of influences, so they can

321
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:10,158
make their own choices and find their own meaning in the outcome.

322
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:15,255
Next, avoid chaining decisions.

323
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:20,919
If you stack decisions too closely together, the player's brain will fall into the trap

324
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,600
of the sunk cost principle.

325
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,803
The dominoes start to fall, and they can't turn back.

326
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,642
And the effects of this are cumulative.

327
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,647
So the effort in making every new decision in a chain

328
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,230
becomes increasingly more difficult.

329
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,413
And eventually, as I've already said,

330
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:41,637
the brain shuts down, that illusion fades away,

331
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,820
and players feel less autonomy.

332
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:49,690
The Witcher does a really interesting thing with this, where I've actually seen reviews

333
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,251
that people say there's too much for you to do.

334
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:57,653
There's too many moral dilemmas, there's too many ways for the narrative to play out.

335
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:03,054
Now I don't necessarily agree with that, but I can see why someone might feel that way,

336
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:07,736
because it's always human nature to wonder about the path that you didn't take.

337
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:16,077
over and over, over and over, until you start to believe that no matter what you choose,

338
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:21,041
you've chosen incorrectly, or that the other path is better, or that you're missing out on something.

339
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,684
And so, regardless of how you feel about the volume of choice in The Witcher,

340
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:29,887
they did do one thing very, very well.

341
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:33,230
They spread out the important choices,

342
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,332
so that by the time you get from one to the next,

343
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:39,035
you can feel the impact of your choice

344
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:42,117
and see its actual effects on your player,

345
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:44,059
on the world, and on the story.

346
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,245
This helps the player's brain differentiate those peak and end points of the experience,

347
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:55,408
so there is a better chance that they'll find meaning and autonomy in the outcome.

348
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:59,531
Lastly, let your players make second-order decisions.

349
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:05,736
Now, second-order decisions are rules or strategies that people use to

350
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:10,079
avoid getting frustrated by their own indecision.

351
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:16,574
For example, I personally have a set of rules that I always follow when I'm gaming.

352
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:21,277
Whenever I'm given the option, I always choose ranged attack over melee.

353
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:26,740
When I walk into a new area, I always go right first.

354
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,081
I don't have to think about it, I just go.

355
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:36,177
And that's the whole point. When I reach a fork in the road, deciding which way to go has become

356
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:43,460
a second-order decision because it falls behind my initial rule to always go right.

357
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,563
Now, Assassin's Creed handles this very well by offering this huge web of interconnected

358
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:56,287
activities. You can decide as the player to do everything in just one single neighborhood.

359
00:25:57,145 --> 00:26:02,709
Or you can follow a single quest line across neighborhood borders.

360
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:05,151
Or you can focus on just a single type of activity.

361
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:10,295
Or you can just do things randomly as they happen when you're walking down the street.

362
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:16,145
There are hundreds and hundreds of potential activities in a game like this,

363
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:21,189
but the player decides when to approach each one and how to group them,

364
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:25,672
so they don't have to think about them all at the same time.

365
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:29,795
This maintains that illusion that the world is impossibly large,

366
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:32,257
that there are unlimited amount of activities,

367
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,519
and that there's more choice in the outcome than there actually is.

368
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:42,153
If you allow them to use second-order decisions, the player is applying their own individual

369
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:48,719
biases, so your influence from the availability heuristic has less effect, and it allows each

370
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:54,364
person to find their own golden path through the level, which means that they'll find their

371
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:59,348
own memorable peak and end points and construct meaning from that experience.

372
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,757
Now, all of this of course barely scratches the surface of how this impacts game theory

373
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:11,181
and choice and a million other related topics that I don't have time to go into today.

374
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:15,325
So I would strongly encourage you to look some of this stuff up and read up on it and

375
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:19,209
see how you can use that knowledge to improve your level designs.

376
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,691
Thank you for your time.
