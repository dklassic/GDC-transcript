1
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:10,624
This is an apology in the sense of a Greek apologia,

2
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:16,227
the systematic defense of an opinion or position.

3
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:21,510
It's a defense of Roger Ebert, the Pulitzer Prize winning film

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,632
critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, who,

5
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:28,453
for a little over five years ago,

6
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:32,315
annoyed our industry by declaring that, quote,

7
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,196
video games can never be art.

8
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,556
For those few of you unacquainted with this controversy,

9
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,919
I'll spend just a few minutes recounting what happened.

10
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,520
It all started with a bad movie.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,563
On October 21, 2005, Universal released its adaptation

12
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:51,425
of the classic first-person shooter game, Doom.

13
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:54,748
I didn't see Doom, but Roger Ebert did.

14
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:56,749
He rewarded the movie one star.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,011
In his review, he wrote, quote, towards the end of the movie,

16
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,492
there is a lengthy point of view shot looking forward

17
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:16,393
over the barrel of a large weapon.

18
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,233
Monsters jump out from behind things

19
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,794
and are blasted to death in a sequence that

20
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:24,095
abandons all attempts at character and dialogue

21
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,896
and uncannily resembles a video game.

22
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:30,056
A few days later, a reader from Missouri

23
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,557
responded on Ebert's blog.

24
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:33,037
He wrote that.

25
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,565
Doom the movie is Doom the game brought to the screen without messing around too much

26
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,126
with the original.

27
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:40,087
Doom works as a tribute because it fails so utterly as a movie.

28
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:40,608
Ebert's reply was terse.

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,831
There are sites on the web devoted to video games, and they review movies on their terms.

30
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:45,371
I review them on mine.

31
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,175
Ebert couldn't resist throwing in just one more zinger.

32
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,336
Quote, as long as there is a great movie unseen

33
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:13,538
or a great book unread, I will continue

34
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:17,059
to be unable to find time to play video games.

35
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:19,800
The response from gamers was prompt.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,561
Hundreds of indignant blog comments

37
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:26,822
poured in from everywhere.

38
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:30,763
At first, Ebert seemed willing to discuss his opinion.

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,294
When a reader from Denver asked, are you implying that books are better mediums or just better uses of your time?

40
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:45,759
Ebert responded, I believe books and films are better mediums and better uses of my time.

41
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,542
But how can I say that when I admit I am unfamiliar with video games?

42
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:56,106
Because I have recently seen classic films by Fassbender, Ozu, Hertzog, Karzaysi and Kurosawa,

43
00:02:56,106 --> 00:03:00,689
and have recently read novels by Dickens, Cormac McCarthy, Bellow, Nabokov and Hugo.

44
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:06,135
And if there were video games in the same league, someone somewhere who was familiar

45
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:11,677
with the best work in all three mediums would have made a convincing argument in their defense.

46
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:16,239
The comments increased in volume and temperature.

47
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,661
On November 27th, a reader wrote, I was saddened to read that you consider video games an inherently

48
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,501
inferior medium.

49
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,362
Was not film itself once a new field of art?

50
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:33,077
Did it not also take decades for its respectability to be recognized?

51
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:38,679
Ebert responded, yours is the most civil of countless messages I have received,

52
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:44,361
after writing that I did indeed consider video games inherently inferior to film and literature.

53
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:48,282
There is a structural reason for this.

54
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:52,003
Video games by their nature require player choices,

55
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:55,505
which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature,

56
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,325
which requires authorial control.

57
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:05,037
He continued, I am prepared to believe that video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated,

58
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,258
challenging, and visually wonderful.

59
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:13,720
But I believe the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
stature of art.

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,762
To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of

62
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,543
comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists, or composers.

63
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:33,348
that a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept.

64
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:39,910
But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available

65
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,673
to make ourselves more cultivated, civilized, and empathetic.

66
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:51,856
After this, aside from an occasional snark, Ebert appeared to have written everything

67
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:52,876
he cared to say on the subject.

68
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,577
Now to many of you...

69
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,150
This issue probably seems like a thoroughly dead horse.

70
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,351
I thought it was dead too, not because anything was actually

71
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,292
decided, mind you, but because after nearly five years

72
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,772
of table-pounding, everyone seemed

73
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:07,972
tired of arguing about it.

74
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:08,233
Oh, OK.

75
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,353
Hold on a minute.

76
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,133
What's the matter?

77
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:10,673
Oh, it's no good.

78
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:11,594
Is this one off now?

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,094
Hold on, they're switching me to higher technology.

80
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:39,842
Can you hear me?

81
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,684
Sound better? Good.

82
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:49,049
But a few weeks

83
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,131
after GDC ended last March,

84
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,753
the flame war erupted again.

85
00:05:55,281 --> 00:06:02,943
The Fuse was a TEDx lecture by Kelly Santiago, co-founder and president of That Game Company.

86
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:09,684
Her lecture was titled, Stop the Debate, Video Games Are Art, So What's Next?

87
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:17,406
She cited three games, Waco Resurrection, Braid, and her own company's Flower, as examples

88
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:21,307
of games that she believes already qualify as art.

89
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,908
A video of her lecture appeared on YouTube.

90
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,055
Some troublemaker recommended it to Roger Ebert.

91
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,676
On April 16, Ebert posted a critique

92
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:36,037
of Santiago's lecture under the blunt headline,

93
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:39,178
video games can never be art.

94
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:42,339
He dismissed Waco Resurrection, Braid, and The Flower

95
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,160
as, quote, pathetic, and sternly predicted

96
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,341
that no video gamer now alive will survive long enough

97
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,782
to experience the medium as an art form.

98
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:51,862
Thousands of comments followed.

99
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,006
nearly all of them in fierce protest.

100
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:01,747
Finally, on the 1st of July, just before the call

101
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,608
for submissions to this conference was announced,

102
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:08,169
Ebert posted what again seemed to be his final word

103
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:08,869
on the subject.

104
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:13,991
Under the title, OK, kids, play on my lawn, Ebert wrote,

105
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:19,772
I declared as an axiom that video games can never be art.

106
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,053
I still believe this, but I should never have said so.

107
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:30,111
He went on to admit that his arguments might be more convincing if he actually bothered

108
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,392
to play some games.

109
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:34,095
He also appeared to backpedal a little bit.

110
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:38,739
He wrote, what I was saying is that video games could not in principle be art.

111
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:44,223
That was a foolish position to take, particularly as it seemed to apply to the entire unseen

112
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,805
future of games.

113
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:49,007
It is quite possible that a game could someday be art.

114
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:49,808
His weary conclusion?

115
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,246
I have books and movies to see.

116
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:59,127
I was a fool for mentioning video games in the first place."

117
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:03,609
Having heard all this, you may be wondering, what is there left to defend?

118
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,029
Ebert caved.

119
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,931
He admitted games could be art eventually, didn't he?

120
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:10,692
Given enough time, anything not impossible is inevitable, right?

121
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,192
Well, maybe.

122
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:14,113
But that's not the part of Ebert's argument I'm here to defend.

123
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,837
I'm here because of this sentence.

124
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,199
No one in or out of the field has ever

125
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,781
been able to cite a game worthy of comparison

126
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:33,184
with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists,

127
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,285
and composers.

128
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:39,389
Kelly Santiago conceded this point in the first 60 seconds

129
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,711
of her TEDx lecture.

130
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,433
And as Ebert himself never retired of pointing out,

131
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,376
not one of the thousands of comments he received

132
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,598
seriously attempted any such comparison.

133
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:49,698
Now.

134
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,260
Although I'm not as experienced as Roger Ebert,

135
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,121
experienced being a polite euphemism for elderly,

136
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,601
I'm no spring chicken either.

137
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,882
My formal education is in English.

138
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:07,502
I've read many of the great books in our language,

139
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,063
and in other languages in translation.

140
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,103
I've also watched a number of great movies,

141
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,804
seen a number of great paintings and sculptures,

142
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,585
and heard a lot of fine music, although never as much as I

143
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:18,025
would like.

144
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:23,298
I've also been in the video game industry for nearly 30 years.

145
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:30,182
Unlike Mr. Ebert, I have played many of the games widely regarded as great and seminal.

146
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:34,125
I have the privilege of knowing many of the authors personally.

147
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:43,450
But as much as I admire games like Mule, Balance of Power, SimCity, and Civilization, it would

148
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,453
never even occur to me to compare them to the treasures of world literature paintings.

149
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:50,117
or music.

150
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:56,102
And I'm pretty sure the authors of those particular games wouldn't presume to either.

151
00:09:56,102 --> 00:10:03,788
Why are some people in this industry so anxious about wrapping themselves in the mantle of

152
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:04,568
great art?

153
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:10,973
It occurred to me that an art museum might be a really good place to think about this.

154
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:15,557
As it happens, there's a really good art museum just a few blocks east of Worcester Polytech,

155
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:17,158
where I teach game design.

156
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,018
So late one morning...

157
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:22,711
I find myself in the galleries of Wham, the Worcester Art Museum,

158
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,913
wandering among the Monet's and Manet's, Matisse's, and Magritte's.

159
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:30,274
One canvas in particular caught my eye.

160
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:36,638
It was painted in 1730 by James Northcutt, a member of the British Royal Academy of Arts.

161
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,479
Northcutt was amazingly prolific.

162
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,180
Over 2,000 works are attributed to him.

163
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,603
He painted historic and current news events, scenes from the Bible, classic literature,

164
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,103
together with hundreds of portraits.

165
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:51,639
It was his animal paintings that attracted the most attention,

166
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,640
though.

167
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,160
Northcutt made a fortune with his dramatic depictions

168
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,181
of jungle cats, elephants, dogs, and birds.

169
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,682
A rival artist, Henry Fuseli, is said

170
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:04,843
to have remarked, Northcutt, you are an angel and an ass,

171
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:06,463
but an ass and an angel.

172
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:10,525
This Northcutt in the collection of the Worcester Art Museum

173
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:12,645
is not, for the most part, about animals.

174
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,826
The chess players shows a pair of gentlemen

175
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,247
pondering over an end game.

176
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:22,836
There's a boy standing behind one of the players and a little dog sitting in the corner.

177
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:27,298
If you study this painting for a while, you'll notice a couple of interesting details.

178
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:32,381
For one thing, the chess players are clearly not the center of attention.

179
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:38,024
They're dressed in dark, sober colors that recede into the space of the painting.

180
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:41,326
By contrast, the boy appears in blazing gold.

181
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,687
It looks as if he's under a spotlight.

182
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,708
Yet he shows no interest in the chess game.

183
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:50,352
His attention is directed away from the world of the painting.

184
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:54,893
In fact, he appears to be staring directly at you, the viewer.

185
00:11:54,893 --> 00:12:00,714
In his left hand is a sheet of paper covered with undecipherable characters.

186
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:04,255
His right finger appears to be pointing at something.

187
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:04,635
But what?

188
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:06,335
The sheet of paper?

189
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,536
The head of the man beside him?

190
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:10,036
What's that stupid little dog doing there?

191
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,577
Well, we'll probably never know.

192
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:20,556
Everyone connected with the creation of this painting has been dead for generations.

193
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:26,457
I spent a long time sitting in front of the chess players on the bench.

194
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:33,359
The elements of this painting came to symbolize for me the predicament I faced by choosing

195
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:36,920
to defend Roger Ebert at the biggest game conference in the world.

196
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:44,882
The two chess players are like the game industry, self-absorbed, satisfied.

197
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:51,774
confident that they will soon earn their place among the fine arts if they haven't already.

198
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:58,897
And the golden boy is art itself, silently watching us, pointing at a secret he longs

199
00:12:58,897 --> 00:12:59,137
to share.

200
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,217
In preparing this lecture,

201
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,409
I plowed through a 700-page anthology of Western art

202
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,131
philosophy, including the writings of Plato, Aristotle,

203
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,913
Plotinus, Augustine, Ficino, Kant, Schelling, Hegel,

204
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:15,695
Schopenhauer, Shastri, Croci, Nietzsche, Dewey,

205
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,256
and Heidegger.

206
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,518
I also read a deadly boring book on 20th century aesthetic theory,

207
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:22,520
including the writings of White, Dickey, and Danto.

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,163
Nowhere in 25 centuries of philosophy

209
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:31,187
did I find a single author who regarded games or sports

210
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:31,967
as a form of art.

211
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:37,658
When they're mentioned at all, they're dismissed as a pastime.

212
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:41,280
Harmless at best, an evil destroyer of youth at worst.

213
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,002
Now, it's true that a number of art museums

214
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:48,545
include antique toys and games in their exhibits.

215
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,107
Some of them, including occasionally MoMA, the Whitney,

216
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:55,030
and soon the Smithsonian, even display antique video games.

217
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,332
It's also true that games, usually dice or cards,

218
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:01,775
have often been the subject or theme of great art.

219
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:08,244
I found a website with over 220 pictures of people playing chess, and it doesn't even

220
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:09,805
include this one by Northcott.

221
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:16,149
It's also true that certain 20th century art movements, including Dada, Fluxus, and New

222
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,771
Games incorporated rules and play into their works.

223
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:26,014
These are remembered now chiefly by academics, except for Fluxus, which is famous because

224
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,155
one of its members married a beetle.

225
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:32,558
and you'll occasionally come across a philosopher or artist who admires the

226
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,418
playful aspect of games

227
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,819
or the elegance of a chess problem.

228
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,000
Some people admire the elegance of math equations too,

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,721
but nobody confuses mathematics with art.

230
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,221
There are different categories of human activity

231
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:49,903
and that's how philosophy has traditionally regarded art and games.

232
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,403
Categorically different.

233
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,464
Suggesting that a game could be great art

234
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:54,744
is radical.

235
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,385
On the other hand...

236
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:02,696
The idea of great art is itself somewhat radical.

237
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:04,416
It only dates back about 500 years.

238
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,277
Before that, art was essentially practical.

239
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,797
You valued the thing an artwork represented, not

240
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:11,958
the artwork itself.

241
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,358
Since that time, the definition of art

242
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:17,739
has undergone a continuous evolution

243
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:20,080
as new ideas and technologies appeared.

244
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,460
This process has never been rapid or easy.

245
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:28,999
It took many decades for photography and cinema to earn their places among the Hegelian fine

246
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:35,785
arts of painting, sculpture, poetry and drama, music, dance, and architecture.

247
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:40,890
Now it's natural and tempting for us to expect that games will follow the same pattern.

248
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,252
But there's a big difference.

249
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:46,495
Photography and cinema were new technologies.

250
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,037
Games are not new.

251
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,613
They've been part of our culture for thousands of years.

252
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,254
They're much older than the bell arts of the Renaissance,

253
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,795
older than the representational art of the Greeks,

254
00:15:56,795 --> 00:16:00,236
older than the cave paintings of prehistory.

255
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:08,099
By what right do games suddenly demand the status of great art?

256
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:12,741
If chess and Go, arguably the two greatest games in history,

257
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,362
have never been regarded as works of art,

258
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,623
why should Missile Command?

259
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,745
Are digital games somehow privileged, somehow more artistic than analog games?

260
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:25,546
Or does the fact that video games are now almost as big as dog food somehow entitle

261
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,767
them to a free museum pass?

262
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:30,248
Now before we can proceed any further, we need to pause and address the basic semantic

263
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:30,548
problem.

264
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:31,748
You knew this was coming.

265
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:31,908
All of us.

266
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:52,089
Even Roger Ebert can clearly say what a video game is.

267
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,791
Can any of you tell me what great art is?

268
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:05,234
Trying to define great art is like trying to define experience.

269
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:12,837
We all have an internal sense of what it signifies, but articulating it is really difficult.

270
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:18,220
And the intellectual fad of relativism makes it practically impossible.

271
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,746
Here's a classic demonstration.

272
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:27,228
Suppose I'm walking along a beach and come across a stick of driftwood.

273
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:29,468
I stop in my tracks.

274
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,449
I don't touch the driftwood.

275
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,649
I don't say anything.

276
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,890
I don't point out the driftwood to anyone.

277
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,951
Right there, in that moment, is that driftwood a work of art?

278
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:42,492
I pick up the driftwood, and without changing it, bring it home

279
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,993
and put it on my mantelpiece.

280
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:45,793
Is the driftwood art yet?

281
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,964
I sign and date the driftwood and send it to an art gallery.

282
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,725
They put it on a pedestal under a spotlight.

283
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,306
Are we having art yet?

284
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,647
An art collector buys the driftwood at auction

285
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,809
for over a million bucks.

286
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:04,071
What did that collector buy?

287
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:05,632
Let's play the art game again.

288
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:09,493
This time, I walk into a plumbing supply shop

289
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:12,875
and pick out a standard white porcelain urinal.

290
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,937
I sign and date the urinal and ship it to an art gallery.

291
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:16,857
Is that urinal art?

292
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:22,792
I am being completely serious when I inform you that Marcel Duchamp's fountain is considered

293
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:26,755
by many critics to be the single most influential artwork of the 20th century.

294
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,497
It would probably also be the most valuable artwork of the 20th century if it had not

295
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:33,539
been accidentally thrown away with the gallery trash.

296
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,719
Luckily, all was not lost.

297
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,061
So less than 11 authentic replicas, individually certified by the artist.

298
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:52,573
are available for your contemplation at various art galleries.

299
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,674
One of these was auctioned in 1999 for $1.7 million.

300
00:18:54,674 --> 00:19:02,239
A number of so-called performance artists have been arrested for trying to pee in these

301
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:02,919
replicas.

302
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:10,844
Most of them are now protected in transparent plastic cases.

303
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:14,067
The replicas, not the performance artists.

304
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:21,626
Duchamp and his so-called ready-maids broke the Renaissance idea of art wide open.

305
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:28,270
He and generations of so-called conceptual artists changed the focus of modern art appreciation.

306
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,934
Instead of aesthetic value, the emphasis shifted to novelty value.

307
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:39,158
By the 1960s, Marshall McLuhan was being only a little cynical when he wrote, art is anything

308
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:39,699
you can get away with.

309
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:40,879
It seems totally fair to ask.

310
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,980
If a piss pot can be great art, why not a video game?

311
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,424
Another argument for games as art goes something like this.

312
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:57,387
Video games incorporate and even generate still and moving pictures,

313
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,329
which everyone agrees can be great art.

314
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:04,192
They incorporate and generate writing, music, sculptured objects, and architecture,

315
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,653
which can also be great art.

316
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:10,290
Suppose I design a platformer with backgrounds by Michelangelo,

317
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,351
black and white characters from Igmar Bergman movies,

318
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:15,191
pop-up quotations from Shakespeare,

319
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:18,172
and music from the well-tempered clavier.

320
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:26,915
I call it, All Your Art Is Belonged to Us.

321
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:30,477
The presentation of that game is filled with great art.

322
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:34,338
Games can obviously be a context for presenting great art.

323
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,095
Roger Ebert admits this.

324
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,396
But is this enough?

325
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,917
Does artistic presentation make a game art?

326
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,459
Of course it doesn't.

327
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:47,642
None of you would presume to call that game art unless you had a chance to play it first,

328
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,823
or at least watch somebody else playing it.

329
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:56,007
The identity of a game emerges from its mechanics and affordances, not the presentation that

330
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,468
supports them.

331
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:03,512
But can an arrangement of mechanics and affordances, rules and goals, itself constitute a work

332
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:03,872
of art?

333
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:11,018
Before you scream yes, explain to me why chess is not regarded as a work of art.

334
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:21,506
Before you scream it is, ask yourself, are we so willing to dismiss the wisdom of ages

335
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:22,107
to flatter ourselves?

336
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:27,631
Does it even make sense to speak of mechanics and affordances apart from presentation?

337
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,432
Isn't it all one piece?

338
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:33,015
Or is it all just mathematics with a sprinkle of positive psychology?

339
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:37,385
The gamificationists certainly seem to think so.

340
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,966
It's hard for anybody, even so-called experts,

341
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,387
to agree on what constitutes great art.

342
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:45,648
Back in 1900, the trustees of the Boston Symphony Orchestra

343
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:47,449
commissioned a beautiful new auditorium.

344
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:49,690
Around the edges of the gold proscenium,

345
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,671
they mounted a series of nine flat plaques, three

346
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,372
on the left, three on the right, and three across the top.

347
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,813
The plan was to inscribe these plaques

348
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:01,355
with the names of the world's nine greatest composers.

349
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,255
We can imagine the names that were being thrown around.

350
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:07,434
You know, Bach, Mozart, Halden, Haydn, Brahms.

351
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:10,074
But when it came time to actually sit down and determine

352
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,755
which composers would be honored,

353
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:15,276
the trustees couldn't make up their minds.

354
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:20,157
And so for the past 111 years, visitors to Boston Symphony Hall

355
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:24,518
sit before a gold proscenium with eight empty plaques.

356
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:28,159
Only one at the very top of the stage contains a name,

357
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,820
the only one the trustees could all agree on, Beethoven.

358
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:37,207
Everyone has their own taste, right?

359
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:38,868
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

360
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:45,111
This commonplace was noted by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who strongly criticized it.

361
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:47,252
His argument went like this.

362
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:52,715
If you declare that something gives you pleasure, nobody can argue with you.

363
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:58,218
Subjective pleasure is absolutely in the eye of the beholder, assuming that the eye is

364
00:22:58,218 --> 00:22:59,258
the organ involved.

365
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:02,180
But if you announce that something is beautiful...

366
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,844
You have made a public value judgment.

367
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:09,326
You've identified that thing as a source of pleasure that can be enjoyed by anyone.

368
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:15,029
In making such a declaration, you exercise the faculty known as taste.

369
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:19,152
It makes no sense to say that everyone has their own taste.

370
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:23,834
This is tantamount to claiming there's no common pleasure at all, only personal pleasure.

371
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,556
But our everyday experience tells us that's not true.

372
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:29,437
People agree that objects are pleasant or unpleasant all the time.

373
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:33,089
Psychologists even have a fancy technical term for this kind of agreement,

374
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,771
where an emotion is shared by more than one person.

375
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:39,373
They call it intersubjectivity.

376
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:42,595
Certain people make it their business to exercise taste.

377
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:48,078
These people are called, pinkies up, connoisseurs.

378
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:51,921
If a connoisseur's disinterested exercise of taste

379
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:56,223
earns the agreement of many over time, he or she is called an expert.

380
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:57,184
Such an expert.

381
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,833
Here is a point I hope we can all agree on.

382
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,253
Roger Ebert knows movies.

383
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:08,834
He's been writing about them since the 1960s.

384
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:14,015
He's reviewed hundreds and hundreds of films in print,

385
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:16,175
on the web, and on television, and published

386
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:17,115
over a dozen books.

387
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,116
It's no exaggeration to call him one of the world's best

388
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:23,016
known and most widely read film critics.

389
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,116
His opinion about the relationship between video

390
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,857
games and art may be plausibly dismissed as uninformed.

391
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:29,477
Dismissed as uninformed.

392
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:30,915
He admits this.

393
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:34,916
He admits that he doesn't play video games and doesn't even want to play them.

394
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:40,779
Nevertheless, most of us would hesitate to dismiss his opinion on the relationship between

395
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,499
movies and art.

396
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:50,222
So what does the tasteful expert connoisseur Roger Ebert have to say about the relationship

397
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,323
between cinema and art?

398
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:56,844
He says this, hardly any movies are art.

399
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,330
Maybe Roger was having a bad day.

400
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,291
Let's move right along to another one of the world's

401
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:04,931
great film critics.

402
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:07,932
Here's what the late Pauline Kael wrote about the

403
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:10,873
relationship between movies and art.

404
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:12,133
Listen carefully.

405
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,134
Quote, there is so much talk now about the art of the film

406
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:19,295
that we may be in danger of forgetting that most of the

407
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:21,976
movies we enjoy are not works of art.

408
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:27,498
Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate

409
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:28,418
great trash.

410
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:32,867
We have very little reason to be interested in them.

411
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:39,910
So here we have two of the world's great film critics sadly assuring us that most movies

412
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,351
are not great art.

413
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:44,872
Defining great art apparently won't be enough.

414
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:48,994
We also have to figure out how to distinguish great art from trash.

415
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:53,976
But first let's set aside a couple of issues regarding the word art.

416
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,956
In English the word art has several meanings.

417
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,533
In one sense, art is used as a synonym for craft.

418
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:04,757
Any artifact made by an artisan is a kind of art.

419
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:08,219
In another sense, any exercise of skill, any practice,

420
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,100
can be spoken of as an art.

421
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,482
The art of cooking, the art of war,

422
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:15,064
the art of motorcycle maintenance.

423
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:19,727
In these senses, the products and practices of game making

424
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,889
are obviously qualifying as art.

425
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,142
But Ebert and Kale weren't using art in either of those sentences.

426
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:31,764
When Ebert refers to art, he means and actually spells art

427
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:38,748
with a capital A. Great art, fine art, or the term I prefer,

428
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:42,930
sublime art, art that deeply rewards

429
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,552
a lifetime of contemplation, art that's good for you,

430
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,793
the kind of art that, in Ebert's words,

431
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:52,094
makes us more cultivated, civilized.

432
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,890
and empathetic.

433
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,531
Well, that kind of talk has earned Mr. Ebert

434
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:01,992
that most deadly of anti-intellectual epithets,

435
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:02,252
elitist.

436
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:06,433
The horror novelist Clive Barker led the mob,

437
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:11,335
dismissing Ebert as, quote, an arrogant old man, pompous,

438
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:14,696
high-handed, while adding, if the experience moves you

439
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:18,657
some way or another, even if it only moves your bowels,

440
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:20,657
I think it's worthy of some serious study.

441
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,977
Hey, it made you laugh.

442
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,518
He's right, it is art.

443
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,958
Many people seem to share Barker's belief

444
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,280
that the function of art is to elicit emotion,

445
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,061
to make you feel things, to move people.

446
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:42,682
Let's quickly dispose of this.

447
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:45,223
Last April, the US Supreme Court ruled

448
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:50,165
that videos of small animals being deliberately stomped

449
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:53,666
to death was a constitutionally protected form of free speech.

450
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:57,994
Would you like to see one of these videos?

451
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:03,455
If I press that play button, I promise you will experience strong emotion.

452
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:09,057
Staunt videos may make me feel things, but I reject them as art.

453
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:16,279
And I look forward to the High Court's opinion on whether or not video games are also constitutionally

454
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,699
protected speech.

455
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:22,140
The function of art is not merely to elicit emotion.

456
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,729
A slip on a banana peel can do that.

457
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:33,051
The function, not the purpose, the function of all art, high or low, from Angry Birds

458
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:39,292
to Hellraiser to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, is attraction.

459
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,173
Art has no practical purpose.

460
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:42,773
Nobody needs art.

461
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:47,334
Why would anybody bother to make art that nobody would be attracted to?

462
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,435
But how do we distinguish?

463
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:54,190
Sublime attractions from the common attractions Pauline Kael dismisses as trash.

464
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,351
Why do Ebert and Kael believe that very few movies are sublime art?

465
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:03,253
And how can Ebert predict with such confidence that no video game is ever likely to be sublime

466
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:04,434
art without even playing any?

467
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:07,515
And if he's wrong, if a game really can be sublime art, why hasn't anybody made one?

468
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:10,536
Such are the questions I pondered as I sat before Northwood's chess players.

469
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:23,816
It seemed to me as I studied the painting that there are three reasons why video games

470
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,657
have failed to deliver sublime art.

471
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:36,022
These reasons are neatly symbolized by the three major elements of the painting.

472
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:40,624
The most obvious has been staring you in the face since two o'clock.

473
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:41,164
It's not the chess players.

474
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:43,425
It's not the golden boy or his secret if he has one.

475
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:43,826
It's the dog.

476
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:47,227
We don't know who, if anyone, commissioned this painting from Northcote.

477
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,213
But if it was a commission, we can say one thing with a high degree of certainty.

478
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:53,273
Whoever it was had plenty of money.

479
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:57,194
In the early 18th century, when the chess players was painted,

480
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:59,614
there were generally two classes of people in Europe,

481
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:02,155
the well-to-do and the near starving.

482
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:02,575
Get used to it.

483
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,936
We'll be there again soon.

484
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:10,557
Most 18th century people didn't worry about buying paintings.

485
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:14,817
It was all they could do to keep their families alive.

486
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:17,038
But things got a little better in the 19th century.

487
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:22,735
Political changes, urbanization, improvements in mass production, and education gave rise

488
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:25,797
to what we now call the middle class.

489
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:30,739
These people had enough money to keep their families reasonably comfortable with a little

490
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:33,701
money left over for the occasional small luxury.

491
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:39,104
As their social standing improved, the petite bourgeois wanted some of the things the rich

492
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,167
people enjoyed, like books, nice clothes, and decorated homes.

493
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:50,808
So around the 1860s or 70s, a market developed catering to their limited budgets and tastes.

494
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:57,232
They still couldn't afford commissioned art, but there were plenty of second-rate painters

495
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,735
happy to provide a quick knockoff to hang over the fireplace.

496
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:09,561
These paintings resembled great art, picturesque landscapes, idyllic domestic scenes, portraits

497
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,242
of celebrities.

498
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:16,321
The art dealers of Munich were apparently the first to nickname this new mass market

499
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,562
art.

500
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:21,544
Some scholars think it was a mispronunciation of the English word sketch.

501
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:27,648
Others claim it was a contraction of a German verb which means to make cheaply.

502
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:32,090
Whatever its origin, by the 1920s, this nickname had become the international expression for

503
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:39,674
those pink flamingos, velvet elvises, and adorable puppy dogs we all know and love as

504
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:40,115
kitsch.

505
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,312
Quite a few books have been written about the aesthetics of kitsch.

506
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:48,615
One of the best is by Thomas Kolka of Tel Aviv University.

507
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,997
Kolka argues that kitsch is not bad art.

508
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:59,063
He sees it as a unique aesthetic category, a special kind of art characterized by three

509
00:31:59,063 --> 00:31:59,643
properties.

510
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:06,068
One, kitsch depicts objects or themes that are highly charged with stock emotions.

511
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:11,312
Kitsch is about simple feelings, universal ideas.

512
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:15,716
good and evil, happy and sad.

513
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,898
Your response to these ideas is automatic.

514
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:25,362
You know how you're supposed to feel about sad clowns, James Dean, and horses running

515
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,804
along a windswept beach.

516
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:33,587
In fact, part of the appeal of kitsch seems to lie precisely in recognizing that as you

517
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:37,149
look at it, you're feeling the way you're supposed to.

518
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:38,350
Kitsch validates you.

519
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:46,571
The objects or theme depicted by Kitsch are instantly and effortlessly identifiable.

520
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:50,592
Kitsch art is utterly conventional.

521
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:54,134
There's never any doubt about what it is you're looking at.

522
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:57,935
It's a leprechaun and only a leprechaun.

523
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:01,596
It's Santa Claus and only Santa Claus.

524
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:05,057
Kitsch art is surface art.

525
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:07,338
It's just what you expect.

526
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:09,939
Three, and most important.

527
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:15,060
Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations relating

528
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,201
to the depicted objects or themes.

529
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:21,962
The last thing kitsch wants to be is challenging.

530
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:29,303
Pure kitsch is never ironic, ambiguous, troubling, or innovative.

531
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:36,525
Kitsch art is popular art, and nearly all popular art is kitsch.

532
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:42,926
Our mass market culture is so thoroughly imbued with kitsch,

533
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:46,827
it's the only kind of art many people ever experience.

534
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:56,231
Broadway musicals, theme parks, casinos, rock stars, cable news, all kitsch.

535
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:58,591
All advertising is kitsch.

536
00:33:58,591 --> 00:34:01,813
All media driven by advertising devolves into kitsch.

537
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:06,414
Sequels, spin-offs, knock-offs, reboots, and adaptations from other media

538
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:07,595
are automatically kitsch.

539
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:14,381
Politics thrives on kitsch, and Roger Ebert has spent over 40 years in dark theaters sitting

540
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:20,744
through thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of shameless Hollywood kitsch.

541
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:27,066
Could anyone be more familiar with what happens when you apply commercial pressure to popular

542
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:27,387
art?

543
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:35,270
Is there anyone on the planet more qualified to predict that video games will suffer the

544
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,030
same fate?

545
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:44,396
Listen to this review of Call of Duty Black Ops, published in the New York Times a few

546
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,917
days after it was released last December.

547
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:54,540
Quote, I never play video games twice, but Call of Duty Black Ops has made a happy liar

548
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:54,901
out of me.

549
00:34:54,901 --> 00:35:01,323
I wanted to try to assassinate Fidel Castro again, and break out of a Soviet prison camp

550
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:06,765
again, and pilot a gunboat through the Mekong Delta again, shooting up sandpans while listening

551
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:07,906
to Sympathy for the Devil.

552
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:11,935
The Cold War has never been so much fun.

553
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:15,898
Black Ops does not really innovate,

554
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,759
but it doesn't have to.

555
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,501
Rather, it reflects a keen intelligence

556
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:22,663
and a rigorous, disciplined understanding

557
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:26,445
of each individual element of modern game design.

558
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:29,147
It then executes and delivers in a way that

559
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:33,430
demonstrates how well-oiled a game-making machine Robert

560
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,012
A. Kotick, Activision's chief executive, has created.

561
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:51,603
Call of Duty Black Ops made more money faster than any entertainment product in history.

562
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:52,984
How?

563
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:58,305
By depicting instantly identifiable themes, highly charged with stock emotions.

564
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:02,567
By not trying to enrich players' associations with those themes.

565
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,047
By not innovating.

566
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,548
Video games are an industry.

567
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,182
You are attending a giant industry conference.

568
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:13,962
Industries make products.

569
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:18,365
Video game products contain plenty of art.

570
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:22,267
But it's product art, which is to say, kitsch art.

571
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:25,869
Kitsch art is not bad art.

572
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,951
It's commercial art, art designed to be sold easily

573
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:30,671
and in quantity.

574
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:34,093
And the bigger the audience, the kitschier it's going to get.

575
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,975
Kitsch is a risk reduction strategy.

576
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:49,677
A risk reduction strategy time-tested and good for business.

577
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:52,877
Kitsch is robust.

578
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,418
Details of execution don't matter very much.

579
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:58,038
You can change stuff around without affecting its utility.

580
00:36:58,038 --> 00:37:01,019
But sublime art is fragile.

581
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,859
It lives or dies in the details.

582
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:07,300
There's nothing superfluous or out of place.

583
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:15,488
As author C.S. Lewis wrote, that word and no other, in that place and no other.

584
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:21,293
Kitsch is like Duchamp's urinal, you flush it when you're done using it.

585
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:27,478
Kitsch is fundamentally standard and when standards change it first becomes irrelevant

586
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,902
and then corny and finally the subject of nostalgia.

587
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:35,886
Sublime art is either always relevant or not at all.

588
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:42,000
It is never the subject of nostalgia, but often the subject of discovery.

589
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,481
Kitsch can be brilliantly executed, wonderfully entertaining,

590
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,781
and culturally significant.

591
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:51,822
It is often mistaken for great art and awarded with honors,

592
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:55,483
especially by those industries that specialize in it.

593
00:37:55,483 --> 00:38:01,984
One way to deal with the overwhelming prevalence of kitsch

594
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,904
is to celebrate it.

595
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:04,865
While you're here in the city.

596
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,669
Take a trolley up to the Fairmont Hotel on Knob Hill.

597
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:11,351
Down in the sub-sub basement, you'll

598
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:15,074
find one of the best surviving examples of 40s tiki kitsch,

599
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:16,975
the Tonga Room.

600
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:17,095
Yes.

601
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:23,100
The food in the Tonga Room is practically inedible.

602
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:30,585
But after the second faux Polynesian umbrella cocktail

603
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:33,047
served in a real pineapple, you won't care.

604
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:39,099
In the middle of the room, there's an artificial pond with a little island that floats around.

605
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,221
A band on the island plays tinkly pop music.

606
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,101
But here's the best part.

607
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:47,483
Every hour, there's a simulated tropical thunderstorm.

608
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:50,585
It rains around the edge of the pond.

609
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,306
The Tonga room is delightful.

610
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:54,947
I smile when I walk in there, and I'm smiling even more when I leave.

611
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,748
The technical term for the celebration of Kitsch is camp.

612
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:06,676
Welcome to San Francisco, the camp capital of the world.

613
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:13,040
Ultimately, though, camp is an evasive strategy.

614
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,522
Camp embraces kitsch, but refuses to commit

615
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:19,164
to the risk of creating art.

616
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:21,845
We shouldn't expect publicly traded game studios

617
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:25,487
to produce anything but kitsch.

618
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,648
But what about the indies?

619
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:31,771
Indies are small and nimble.

620
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,763
Their stockholders are the employees.

621
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,864
They can afford to risk creating art, right?

622
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,384
Well, that's the fantasy.

623
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:43,085
In reality, Indies are under the same commercial pressures

624
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:44,105
as the big studios.

625
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:49,647
They have a little more wiggle room for innovation and risk,

626
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:50,567
but only a little.

627
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,528
And if they fail, they have no cushion.

628
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:57,168
If anything, there's even more pressure never to fail.

629
00:39:57,168 --> 00:40:02,550
As a result, most Indies secretly, or not so secretly,

630
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,801
aspire to produce authentic looking kitsch.

631
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:11,264
Kitsch with an edge if they're good, but kitsch nevertheless.

632
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,446
The well-oiled game-making machines manufacture kitsch.

633
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,128
The indies struggle to imitate them.

634
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:20,329
Who's left to create sublime art?

635
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:25,592
The people who create art anyway, the artists.

636
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:29,375
If anyone is going to pwn Roger Ebert,

637
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,636
they'll probably be the ones to do it.

638
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:37,666
There is genuine hope there, but there is also a subtle danger.

639
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,888
If you consciously set out trying to make an art game,

640
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:45,129
it is possible that you will instead create an arty game,

641
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:52,292
a game with the trappings of sublime art, solemn themes,

642
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:57,253
classical music, literary quotations, participation

643
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,594
from artistic celebrities from other media.

644
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:02,475
These things don't necessarily make a game artistic.

645
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:05,547
I should know.

646
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,288
I've tried them all.

647
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:10,391
But this warning should not be taken as an excuse never to try.

648
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:19,496
Many embarrassing failures would be worth the effort if they culminated in a single

649
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:21,117
authentic work of art.

650
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:28,582
The dog is in the painting because whoever bought the painting asked for a dog.

651
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:32,625
But the kitsch that dogs our industry isn't the only reason we fail to produce sublime

652
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:32,845
art.

653
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:36,436
Consider again the two chess players, masters of the game.

654
00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:39,176
All art forms depend on mastery.

655
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,557
Painters, sculptors, writers, magicians, filmmakers,

656
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:43,997
and architects all require tools, instructions,

657
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:48,058
and years and years of hard, actual practice.

658
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:49,879
We game developers are no different,

659
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:52,500
but we are at a distinct disadvantage.

660
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,800
The tools and technology we work with

661
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,721
are and always have been slippery.

662
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:01,302
In 1894, Thomas Edison and William Dixon

663
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,742
introduced the kinetoscope.

664
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:07,540
It used plastic 35 millimeter film perforated on both sides.

665
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,243
Each image frame occupied four perforations.

666
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:13,546
The film ran vertically through the camera and projector

667
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:16,529
at a speed of about 16 frames per second.

668
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:19,531
Within a few years, Edison's 35 millimeter film standard

669
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:22,755
became the worldwide de facto type of film.

670
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,696
Cameras and projectors improved.

671
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:31,216
A few minor changes were made for the introduction of sound, but the basic format, the fundamental

672
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:35,597
engineering parameters controlling the design, production, distribution, and exhibition of

673
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:41,338
movies remained virtually unchanged for over 115 years.

674
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:46,039
Compare this to the first four decades of video gaming.

675
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:48,540
Dozens of computer architectures.

676
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,548
Seven generations of consoles.

677
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:54,611
Zero uniformity in processing power, memory, resolution,

678
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:55,632
color space, or audio.

679
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:58,875
A bewildering array of platforms, from cell phones

680
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,457
to pimped up Alienwares.

681
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:03,980
Now let's talk about the business of video games.

682
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,921
During the five years I worked at Lucasfilm,

683
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:09,184
the management of the games division changed six times.

684
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:12,046
Acquisitions, layoffs, cancellations,

685
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:14,689
closing studio doors, lawsuits, you've all been there.

686
00:43:15,364 --> 00:43:17,425
How could a potential artist hope to accumulate any deep practice in this maelstrom?

687
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:18,865
How come they create in such an atmosphere?

688
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:21,446
The third reason why video games have failed as a sublime art is the most subtle, the most

689
00:43:21,446 --> 00:43:22,387
speculative, and maybe the most important.

690
00:43:22,387 --> 00:43:23,207
Is there, as Roger Ebert suggested, a structural

691
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,534
Intrinsic reason why video games cannot be sublime art.

692
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:52,277
Let's turn again to the golden boy.

693
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:56,698
As you meet his haughty gaze, let me read you some of the

694
00:43:56,698 --> 00:44:00,139
things Roger Ebert has written about video games and art.

695
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:04,641
Quote, I believe art is created by an artist.

696
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,722
If you change it, you become the artist.

697
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,003
Quote.

698
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:16,474
Art ceased to lead you to an inevitable conclusion, not a smorgasbord of choices.

699
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:22,179
Video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves

700
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:26,282
more cultivated, civilized, and empathetic.

701
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:31,066
At one point, Clive Barker pleaded with him, I'm just saying that gaming is a great way

702
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:34,488
to do what we as human beings need to do all the time.

703
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:38,451
to take ourselves away from the oppressive facts of our lives

704
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:42,773
and go somewhere where we have our own control.

705
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:45,074
Ebert's retort to this was icy.

706
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:49,676
I do not have a need all the time to take myself away

707
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:52,397
from the oppressive facts of my life,

708
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:55,038
however oppressive they may be, in order

709
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:58,200
to go somewhere where I have control.

710
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,781
I need to stay here and take control.

711
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:08,931
These quotes are boulder-sized clues as to Ebert's sensibilities.

712
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:14,454
He objects to the idea of self-directed effort as a means of experiencing art.

713
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:18,157
He sees the intention of a single artist as primary.

714
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:20,298
He speaks of inevitability.

715
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:25,382
He's jealous of his free time, those precious hours he has left for cultivation.

716
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:31,746
He sees art not as an escape from life, but a way to understand and accept life as it

717
00:45:31,746 --> 00:45:32,106
is.

718
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:40,739
No doubt about it, Roger Ebert is, like me, a hopeless romantic.

719
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:48,364
Arthur Schopenhauer is the philosopher most closely associated with Romanticism.

720
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:50,425
You think Roger Ebert's a curmudgeon?

721
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:54,208
Way to meet you, Schopenhauer.

722
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:58,831
When he was appointed lecturer at the University of Berlin in 1820, the faculty included the

723
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,732
world famous philosopher, George Hegel.

724
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,401
The young Schopenhauer considered Hegel to be, quote,

725
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:05,822
a clumsy charlatan.

726
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:12,147
He scheduled his lectures at exactly the same time as Hegel's

727
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,749
to draw his students away.

728
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:15,010
Well, it didn't work.

729
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,691
His classrooms were empty.

730
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,914
He eventually left academia in disgust.

731
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:23,257
Schopenhauer once wrote that marriage is like, quote,

732
00:46:23,257 --> 00:46:26,519
reaching blindfolded into a sack, hoping to find

733
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,421
an eel among the snakes.

734
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,704
He was also an atheist.

735
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:40,025
He did not believe in a personal, omnipotent God.

736
00:46:40,025 --> 00:46:46,607
Instead, Schopenhauer believed that the essence of the universe is being.

737
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:54,949
A blind, irrational, unquenchable thirst to exist he called Will zum Leben, and that everything

738
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:59,190
we perceive is a representation of this will to live.

739
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:06,694
Because we ourselves are products of will, we spend most of our lives trapped in a cycle

740
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:10,276
of striving and boredom.

741
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:15,658
We're constantly willing ourselves to attain our goals, but when we do attain them, we're

742
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:22,302
disappointed and move on to something else again and again until the final disappointment

743
00:47:22,302 --> 00:47:23,542
of death.

744
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:30,406
To Schopenhauer, free will and real choice were cruel illusions.

745
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,981
and desire a prison."

746
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:38,083
Schopenhauer does have a reputation for being pessimistic, but he really wasn't, because

747
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:43,845
he also believed that there's a way to leap off the wheel of desire.

748
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:56,551
That way is the contemplation, the contemplation of sublime art.

749
00:47:56,551 --> 00:48:00,612
Sublime art is the door to a perspective on reality.

750
00:48:00,993 --> 00:48:03,555
that transcends will.

751
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:07,418
It frees us from the agony of contingency and causality

752
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:14,965
and gives us a brief, precious glimpse of what we really are,

753
00:48:14,965 --> 00:48:19,709
one thing, already complete and perfectly ambiguous.

754
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:23,372
Bob Dylan echoed Schopenhauer when

755
00:48:23,372 --> 00:48:28,436
he said that the purpose of art is to stop time.

756
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:36,038
To Schopenhauer, the creation of sublime art was the noblest of human undertakings,

757
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:44,466
and artists, especially musicians, were the high priests of civilization.

758
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:50,511
Not surprisingly, a lot of 19th century artists really like this guy.

759
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,533
Brahms, Tolstoy, Mahler, Proust, Einstein, Freud,

760
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:56,516
and Jung were all strongly influenced by Schopenhauer.

761
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,237
Richard Wagner was practically a disciple.

762
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:04,889
If we could go back now and ask Schopenhauer whether or not a game, any game, could become

763
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:08,851
a sublime work of art, how would he respond?

764
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:15,293
He'd probably just pat you on the shoulder, shake his head, and chuckle.

765
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:17,794
Why is this?

766
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:22,216
As you all know, games are about choices.

767
00:49:22,216 --> 00:49:29,118
Sid Meier famously defined games as a series of interesting choices.

768
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:34,787
is a fundamental expression of will.

769
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:40,992
How can an activity motivated by decision making, striving, goals and competition, a

770
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:48,017
deliberate concentration of the force of will, be used to transcend will itself?

771
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:51,519
You might as well try to smother a flame with oxygen.

772
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:58,504
Game designers are taught that the ideal player experience is something called flow.

773
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,543
Flow is that magical state of highly focused motivation, a kind of skating on the fine

774
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:07,024
edge of effort and challenge.

775
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:08,664
Flow leads to a state of euphoric exhilaration.

776
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:12,186
Bow before Chief St. Mihaly and Poppins, the prophets of flow.

777
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:13,687
Game flow is work made fun.

778
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,668
Flow keeps you joyfully working, even in your free time.

779
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:16,308
You heard it here first.

780
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:32,358
Game flow will be the harness of the new labor class.

781
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:42,662
Flow is painless effort.

782
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:47,785
But pain management is not the business of art.

783
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:50,586
Entrancement is not insight.

784
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:54,948
Flow is an aesthetic.

785
00:50:57,667 --> 00:51:04,768
In my digital game design one class, I define play as superfluous activity.

786
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:12,990
I define a toy as something that elicits play and a game as a toy with rules and a goal.

787
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,310
Games are purposeful.

788
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:20,472
They are defined as the exercise of choice and will towards a self-maximizing goal.

789
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:22,372
But sublime art is like a toy.

790
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:25,553
It elicits play in the soul.

791
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:33,188
And the pleasure we get from it lies precisely in the fact that it has no rules, no goal,

792
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:34,349
no purpose.

793
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:42,990
Oscar Wilde was not being flippant when he wrote, all art is quite useless.

794
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:51,532
If the romantics were right, if the purpose of sublime art is to solve the mystery of

795
00:51:51,532 --> 00:51:56,393
choice, it's hard to see how goal chasing can be anything

796
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:58,106
but a distraction.

797
00:51:58,106 --> 00:52:03,087
We can admire an elegant game design from the outside,

798
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,908
like a museum game under glass.

799
00:52:05,908 --> 00:52:08,749
But once you enter Wiesinger's magic circle

800
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:11,270
and start groping at preferences,

801
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:14,450
the attitude of calm, radical acceptance

802
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,331
necessary to cultivate insight is lost.

803
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:24,713
The concert pianist Glenn Gould characterized

804
00:52:24,713 --> 00:52:26,413
the romantic conception of sublime art.

805
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:35,427
most vividly when he wrote, the justification of art is the internal combustion it ignites

806
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:42,752
in the hearts of men and not its shallow, externalized, public manifestations.

807
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:51,299
The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline, but is rather

808
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:56,603
the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder.

809
00:52:57,965 --> 00:52:58,766
and serenity.

810
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:08,273
The conference program promised that I would offer you my own definition of art.

811
00:53:08,273 --> 00:53:12,276
Here it is, in all its moldy old romantic splendor.

812
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:20,342
Sublime art is the still evocation of the inexpressible.

813
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:27,268
If these definitions of art do not speak to you, ignore them.

814
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:29,750
Time is on your side.

815
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:35,394
But if they do speak to you, beware.

816
00:53:35,394 --> 00:53:40,338
You too may someday be dismissed as a tiresome old fool

817
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:41,879
who doesn't get it.

818
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:47,423
Games have been good to me.

819
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:51,246
I love playing them, and I love giving my students a space

820
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,427
to learn about them.

821
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:55,890
An hour or two spent playing Defense Grid or Plants

822
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,352
versus Zombies isn't a waste of time.

823
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:01,834
There's nothing wrong with recreation.

824
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:02,854
We need it.

825
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:03,835
I need it.

826
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:05,455
It's good for me.

827
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:12,598
But when I feel the need for reflection, for insight,

828
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:16,940
wisdom, or consolation, I turn my computers off.

829
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:23,843
These needs are the ambit of the sublime arts, which

830
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,824
are inspired and informed by philosophy.

831
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:38,964
And by faith, all sublime art is devotional.

832
00:54:38,964 --> 00:54:43,065
24 game developers conferences ago, I sat in Chris Crawford's

833
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:46,706
living room together with a few dozen other young hopefuls

834
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:50,047
and imagined a future in which video games would be recognized

835
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:53,368
as a great art form, as important as the movies they

836
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:55,929
reviewed every week on Siskel and Ebert.

837
00:54:57,697 --> 00:54:58,197
Look at us.

838
00:54:58,197 --> 00:55:01,938
Video games are now bigger than movies.

839
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:07,160
But they didn't need to be great art to get here.

840
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,540
They just needed to be great fun.

841
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:16,603
You can argue that this kitschy dog spoils the effect

842
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:18,784
of Northcott's painting, but I've

843
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:21,444
come to kind of like the little guy.

844
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:23,525
He keeps the chess players and the golden boy

845
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:26,126
from taking themselves too seriously.

846
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:33,347
I'm told that the Fairmont is tearing down the old Tonga room pretty soon to make way

847
00:55:33,347 --> 00:55:35,108
for some fancy new high-tech condos.

848
00:55:35,108 --> 00:55:42,710
Tell you what, what do you say we all go up there right now, one more time, raise a few

849
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:55,373
Mai Tais to Roger Ebert, share a few laughs, and listen to the rain.

850
00:55:55,373 --> 00:55:55,593
Thank you.

851
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:17,162
Thank you very much.
