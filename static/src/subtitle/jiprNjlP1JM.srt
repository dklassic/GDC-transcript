1
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:07,484
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:11,410
And there's a lot of you today.

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,412
This is good.

4
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:13,714
Thank you for waking up this morning.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,337
And thank you for coming to join me today.

6
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:18,582
This is a talk on how to create a development culture that

7
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,403
embraces change.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,101
For your awareness, there are exits at the back of the hall.

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:27,963
My goal for this is that nobody's going to use them for the next 30 minutes.

10
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:34,306
Also you're going to get a survey at the end of this, or a questionnaire, and it is vital

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,348
that you do that, and it actually helps in the talk as well.

12
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,150
Feedback is the core of being able to change and adapt, and your feedback to me allows

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,232
me to improve and change how I present and improve over time.

14
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,113
And that's why you're all here, right?

15
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,835
We're here to improve, changing for the better.

16
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,286
And that can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be.

17
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,106
And actually, we're always changing.

18
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:57,947
That's a concept to take into what you're working at here.

19
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,747
Every single day, you'll do something a little bit

20
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:01,067
different.

21
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,028
And what we're going to talk about is how we turn those

22
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:05,608
little changes into something a little bit bigger and make

23
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:07,228
it more comfortable for everybody who's involved.

24
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,809
What we're going to do through the talk today is use

25
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,910
RuneScape as a series of examples on some practices

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,910
that I'm hoping that you'll be able to take back to your own

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,190
teams.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,362
I suppose this is a great chance for me to actually introduce myself.

29
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:22,883
My name is Connor.

30
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:26,445
I'm the director of game development at Jagex Game Studios.

31
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:32,269
And I suppose like most of the people in this room, I love games, but I also really love

32
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:32,830
making games.

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,932
My goal really is to better make better games.

34
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:38,473
So we're going to continue to improve over and over again.

35
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:45,206
I got the pleasure and privilege of being able to manage and lead RuneScape for a number

36
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:45,546
of years.

37
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:49,848
And for anybody who isn't aware, RuneScape is a 17-year-old veteran MMO.

38
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:56,471
It has lived through the rise of free-to-play, social media, and streaming.

39
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:00,633
And for all three of those, it's managed to embrace them and make them a strength for

40
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:01,733
it rather than a challenge.

41
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:07,415
We use RuneScape's structure as a template for how we build service teams at Jagex.

42
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:11,337
And we continue to build teams within the studio on that model.

43
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:16,839
Jagex, I'm expecting fewer people are aware of Jagex than they are of RuneScape.

44
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,640
The game kind of leads the company.

45
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,601
Our goal is to become the home of living games.

46
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,343
And we see living games being the next step after games as a service or live service games.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,922
something that moves beyond a hobby and becomes a lifestyle for our players.

48
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,725
And that means that we need to build things that are evergreen and everchanging and can

49
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:39,407
always be there for our players, that adapt to what they need and adapt to the market.

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,031
This demands our teams to be flexible and adaptive.

51
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:49,354
And our goal is that with that, we can change with the market, or preferably ahead of it

52
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:50,355
to make things better.

53
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:51,556
I'm going to cheat.

54
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,257
I'm going to let, well, I'm going to let you guys cheat.

55
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,519
I'm actually going to give you the takeaways at the start.

56
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,279
So...

57
00:02:57,282 --> 00:03:00,003
If you do end up having to use the doors, you can at least take something away with

58
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:01,743
you, at least you get some value from today.

59
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:06,405
So the first part we're going to look at is talking about how improvement is not immediate.

60
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,726
And that sounds like common sense, but the number of times you're going to try and make

61
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:13,847
a change and immediately expect everything to be perfect would probably cause a challenge.

62
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,167
So taking that into mind is important.

63
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:22,049
We'll be talking about pillars for your development process that can support the change process.

64
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:26,312
We'll go through how smaller teams can help that and help that adaptation.

65
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,935
And then for me, the most important thing is distributing decision-making down into

66
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,777
your teams and giving ownership to your developers.

67
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:36,582
And then also, because I'm not going to completely throw everything away, there is a super secret

68
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,525
end of the talk takeaway, that if you do wait for the 30 minutes, you'll be able to see

69
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:39,926
what that is.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,485
Okay. So, change is hard, right? We know change is hard, so why don't we plan for it? When

71
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:51,868
we are going from today to this bright and shiny future, we expect this lovely path of

72
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:55,731
continuous improvement and getting everything better all of the time. I mean, the real fact

73
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:59,374
is it actually looks a little bit more like this. The expectation that you bring something

74
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:04,598
in and it will immediately cause your teams to feel a little bit uncomfortable and it

75
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,320
is change and it is different. The habits that people formed before will no longer be

76
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,662
useful when you go into this state.

77
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:14,068
Going into the process, understanding that there's going to be an impact means that you

78
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,489
can look for how to improve, how it's going to cause the improvement in the future.

79
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,770
You can look for small wins and look for a turnaround.

80
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,211
You have to get over that first kind of the stumbling blocks.

81
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,652
I'll give you an example from RuneScape.

82
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:33,093
There was a time, fairly like, I'm kind of ashamed at how far into the development, RuneScape

83
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,054
didn't have source control.

84
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,014
We had 100-odd developers all working from a network share.

85
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:37,995
That's crazy, right?

86
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:41,144
Actually it has a lot of benefits.

87
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:45,606
You have access to everything everyone has done and is doing right now.

88
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,308
The level of sharing and collaboration is incredible.

89
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,269
The level of flexibility that you have is amazing.

90
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:55,110
You don't have to worry about being able to, or what's your branching strategy or where

91
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,371
are you going to grab a particular asset.

92
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:57,832
Everything is available to you immediately.

93
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,053
Sounds great, except for the fact that if anybody breaks anything on your login script

94
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,554
the whole team is taken out, so that's not good.

95
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:08,247
So we decided to change and we looked at how we could roll source control into a team while

96
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,527
continuing to run a live service.

97
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:13,149
I'm hoping no one ever has to do this by the way, it's an awful experience.

98
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:17,251
Also you have to train everybody on how to use source control because many of them never

99
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,072
had even seen it or knew it existed.

100
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,853
And when we did make the change, that was difficult.

101
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,195
Suddenly all that flexibility wasn't present.

102
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:28,906
We had artists who were like, well, there's a texture that someone's using for an update

103
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:29,646
that's coming out in a couple of...

104
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,107
I want to use it.

105
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:34,069
And you're like, well, that's coming out after yours, so we've got to plan around this now.

106
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:38,392
And we started to put in all these processes and structures to improve things, and eventually

107
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:38,932
it got better.

108
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:42,254
We looked for those quick wins, or those early wins, and looked for those small changes to

109
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,595
suggest we were going in the right direction.

110
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:48,618
We had an easy one, the login scripts weren't being changed and knocking the entire team

111
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:50,459
out every couple of minutes, so you know, that was good.

112
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:56,355
But looking for those kinds of wins, uptime inside the development team, release cadence

113
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:59,976
becoming stable, all that kind of structure coming into place, demonstrating to the team

114
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:03,757
that the improvements were happening, allowed us to continue to improve to today where it

115
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,237
is just our habits are formed again and everything is fine.

116
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:12,359
If we had gone in without expecting to stumble and without expecting everything to be rosy

117
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:16,820
and perfect at the start, that turnaround to bring the team on board would have been

118
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,640
far more difficult.

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,021
And I'm guessing a lot of people in this room have experienced something similar.

120
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:22,038
in a different type of change in the past.

121
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,482
But with this, some of the ways that we'll try and be able to support those kinds of

122
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,664
changes in the future is our development environment and process itself.

123
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,646
So I'm going to go through our development pillars.

124
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,668
So I'll try and go pretty quickly.

125
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,689
I'll give everybody a bit of time to ask questions at the end.

126
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,739
So if anybody knows Scrum, you'll see that we ripped these straight from Scrum.

127
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,320
They're just the three pillars.

128
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,460
But actually they're really good.

129
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,462
We're talking about transparency, being open with information and open with each other

130
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,582
on what's actually happening.

131
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:56,864
Inspecting because being open is pointless if nobody's actually looking at that information.

132
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:58,945
You're just generating random useless data.

133
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:03,127
And then adaptation because inspection is pointless if you don't actually make a change.

134
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,528
You're just sitting there having a discussion and then going away afterwards.

135
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:09,170
So the three of these build on top of each other and the core of how we work.

136
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:12,910
Let me go into each a little bit more in depth.

137
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:17,675
To give you an idea of the level of transparency that we have at Jagex and why I say you can

138
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:23,340
always be more open, our personal development and our objectives for each individual inside

139
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,402
the organisation are open.

140
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:29,633
For me, all of my objectives for the year are available for every single member of the

141
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:30,314
company to see.

142
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:35,421
Everyone from player support, QA, design, marketing, and my own direct reports know

143
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,583
exactly what I'm trying to achieve.

144
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:38,906
And they also know if I am achieving them.

145
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:40,749
My progress and everything is available too.

146
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,977
In terms of our products, every piece of data is available to anybody who works at Jagex.

147
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:50,679
You can delve into our current conversion rates, our retention rates, all monetization

148
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,721
detail and down into the individual little details around engagement in particular pieces

149
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,042
of content that exists in RuneScape.

150
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,483
That's the level of transparency that we try to get to.

151
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,664
It's important that people are able to see how those things work.

152
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,266
To try and get to this level of transparency, it's something that you can take on to yourself.

153
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:16,364
If you are putting any piece of information together, for us the default is to be open

154
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,126
and closing down access is the exception.

155
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,829
For yourself, ask yourself why you're not sharing something wider, why you're only choosing

156
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,530
a small subgroup to get involved in something.

157
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,052
You don't have to tell everybody you're doing it, but don't lock down their access to it.

158
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:33,255
You can also think about the time you're looking for information.

159
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:37,108
And if it was difficult for you, what's going to happen when the next person looks for that

160
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:37,828
piece of information?

161
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:42,072
How can you make it easier for them to be able to find it and grow that culture of transparency

162
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:42,992
inside your organisation?

163
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,035
And then transparency is really tough.

164
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,177
It's difficult to be open with everything that's going on.

165
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:55,502
So being vulnerable yourself first will show those in your team that that's kind of the

166
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,102
way that you want to work.

167
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:04,252
To give you an idea of where we've used openness on RuneScape, let me go through a tough, harsh

168
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:06,294
truth that we went through at the start of 2016.

169
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:11,039
We launched a very significant update, trying to kick off the year.

170
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,100
We brought out a new skill.

171
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,465
And for anyone who's not aware, RuneScape has a number of skills that players can progress

172
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:17,286
by engaging with them.

173
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:21,030
Adding a new one is a significant amount of new content for somebody.

174
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:25,240
And when it went out, we noticed that day one was really good.

175
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:26,401
Reception was strong.

176
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,183
People were enjoying what was there.

177
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:30,925
But then we noticed the progression was way too fast.

178
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,047
They were getting through the content very quickly.

179
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:34,688
We half expected that.

180
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,269
It was driven by wealth.

181
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,031
People could just liquidate their wealth

182
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:38,812
and get through the skill.

183
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:41,494
We thought people would do that, but we had to look deeper.

184
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,596
Now, RuneScape gathers about two terabytes of data every day.

185
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,719
That's driving some of our heuristic analysis

186
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,881
and a lot of the metrics that are given to the team.

187
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,544
It meant that we had a lot of information coming back.

188
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,307
But you'll see that when something bad is happening,

189
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,549
a lot of people jump on assumptions and guesses.

190
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,351
You'll have red herrings flying around.

191
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,453
Having the level of transparency and openness

192
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:02,975
in the information allowed us to cut those down

193
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:04,977
and go directly to where the problem was happening.

194
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,898
How are the people who are progressing fast

195
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,100
really engaging with the game?

196
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,381
What exactly are they doing?

197
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,001
And that information allowed us to see the cause, identify a fix, and roll it out in

198
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:19,083
an incredibly short time frame, which is immediately dropping out of my head right now.

199
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,464
I think it was in a week or two.

200
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:27,326
So the kind of cycle that we're doing on how we're altering the game is driven by the fact

201
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:28,806
that the information is available to everybody.

202
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,288
But of course, that required us to actually delve in and inspect the information.

203
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,669
And data is...

204
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:39,207
worth nothing if it's not observed and understood.

205
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:43,369
Anybody can look at a page of stats, but understanding what those stats mean is the most important

206
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:43,609
part.

207
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:52,213
So another example of where we've used this in RuneScape and why it's important, the most

208
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:56,996
important part for us in sprint cycle is the retrospective, that element where you come

209
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:00,457
together and look at what's worked and what's not worked and how you can improve over time.

210
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:06,940
We rolled out a marketing initiative, it's called Premier Club, it's a year's membership,

211
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,781
it has perks, you'll be familiar with it for a lot of games.

212
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:16,183
And one year it went reasonably well, the stats came back, they were strong, but we

213
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:16,963
felt like we could do better.

214
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:20,265
The process internally could have gone much better, there was some confusion, some conflict.

215
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:24,186
So we ran a retrospective, gathered everybody together, we talked about what worked and

216
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:24,686
what didn't work.

217
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:30,850
We documented it, made it open, had some good honest open conversations about what we were

218
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,692
going to do next and then we documented it and put it away.

219
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:37,174
The important thing is coming back to that, inspecting it and understanding it.

220
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:41,297
The next year we brought that back out when we were about to run the project again.

221
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,019
It was like a letter from the future.

222
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:45,975
Which was just telling us all the things we were about to do wrong.

223
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:49,796
Allowing us to make sure that the next session was much better.

224
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,336
And it was.

225
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,217
The development was much smoother.

226
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:54,057
There were no conflicts, there were no issues.

227
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,538
People knew exactly what was going on.

228
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,658
The communication lines that we needed in the first year were much better in the second

229
00:11:58,678 --> 00:11:58,819
year.

230
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:00,179
And our performance was up as well.

231
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,440
So we saw tangible change in the performance of the product, not just in the performance

232
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:04,800
of the team.

233
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:10,802
So making sure that you are inspecting information and inspecting any information that is there

234
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,943
to make your future efforts much more valuable.

235
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,398
And of course the most valuable part is actually adaptation.

236
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,121
So like I was saying, retrospective is the most important part of our process.

237
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:28,104
For us, we try and make sure that change is an expected part of our day-to-day.

238
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,546
Give you a really tiny example.

239
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,266
Not all changes have to be big.

240
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,267
We do free fruit inside in the studio.

241
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,347
It was getting a bit stale.

242
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,968
It wasn't really exciting.

243
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,729
So we did weird fruit Wednesdays to try and liven it up a bit.

244
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:41,509
Small little change.

245
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,829
Make people feel a bit more excited.

246
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:43,830
It didn't work.

247
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,710
Nobody ate the weird fruit.

248
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,710
So we've gone back to the other one.

249
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,511
But not all changes work out.

250
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,972
A much bigger change that we went through.

251
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:56,433
This level of saying change is one thing, but actually doing it is completely different.

252
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:01,498
A lot of people will have experienced transferring an established team from a kind of a waterfall

253
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:04,620
step-by-step method into an agile framework like Scrum.

254
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,441
We did that on RuneScape.

255
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:11,883
Looking for ways that you can make small incremental improvements or small changes or pilot those

256
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:16,585
changes, creating a movement for your change rather than an immediate dictation of altering

257
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,866
can be very useful.

258
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,367
We did that with RuneScape by creating a small Scrum team.

259
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:23,709
Gave them an isolated area of the game and allowed them to continue to improve.

260
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,133
It didn't work out immediately, so it's a good thing we didn't change the whole team,

261
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,634
and we altered how that process worked.

262
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,898
Because we went through our cycles and we were open with all the information, we inspected

263
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:37,663
it and we adapted as we went along, it allows us to refine that process in a small section

264
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,004
without impacting the whole team.

265
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,886
As it was improving, we rolled it out to a bigger and bigger group.

266
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:46,165
The people involved at the start created a movement that allowed the overall team to

267
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:46,866
start to change.

268
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:51,610
Now eventually we did actually have to go for a big, you know, that last big bite of

269
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,311
a burger and trying to get that last thing done.

270
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,193
So we had to do that and it was a little bit more difficult.

271
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:59,496
But at least we knew we were going in the right direction because we had tried and made

272
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,697
an example of this already.

273
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,242
So we make sure that we're always changing and we make sure that our process is designed

274
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:06,642
around it.

275
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,066
But what does our actual structure look like and how we make sure that we're making those

276
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:11,626
changes happen?

277
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,913
So I like to think of this as if you think of a large development team, RuneScape itself

278
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:22,977
is over 100 people involved, so trying to move all that can be difficult, like steering

279
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:23,397
a tanker.

280
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,919
Well, we cut it up and we try and make it more like a fleet.

281
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,741
So each of this fleet have their north star, their direction of where they're going.

282
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:34,698
They understand the general direction they're trying to go, but they have the flexibility

283
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:37,881
to be able to move and adapt and adjust as necessary.

284
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:39,362
Each one can be an individual.

285
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:42,706
One ship having a problem doesn't mean that the whole fleet is in trouble.

286
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:45,448
You can continue to adapt and cover people's changes.

287
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,523
We started this with one small team, not the team that did Scrum, a completely different

288
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:51,604
team inside in RuneScape.

289
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:53,725
We called them the Ninjas.

290
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:59,228
I actually did a talk a couple of years ago about creating these autonomous smaller teams.

291
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,570
And Ninja featured heavily in that.

292
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,871
We give them complete autonomy and control over what they're trying to do.

293
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:11,139
They don't need to be told what needs to happen next.

294
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,241
You give them the ownership and the capability to be able to deliver improvements into the game

295
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,663
over and over and over again, constantly improving.

296
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,344
But they know the direction we're going.

297
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:24,507
So if you look at the leadership structure broadly, how the team is working,

298
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,568
you kind of have these six groups.

299
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,590
They all have their development and their art and their QA.

300
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,051
Each of them are building out their content.

301
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,952
And if an injury were one of those, they're given guidance by that product leadership

302
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:38,152
group.

303
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,974
But actually one of the most important things that we found was that trying to put that

304
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,635
ownership into the team was difficult.

305
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:49,656
So we actually built a small little structure within those teams which are allowing each

306
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,277
of those development teams to operate as its own group.

307
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,358
They're small enough that they're almost telepathic in how they communicate.

308
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:59,710
So even though you have that single focal point, everybody knows what everybody else

309
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,852
is doing, but they feel like they have the control.

310
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,676
They don't just feel like they have the control, they do have the control.

311
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:06,719
They can choose how they're going to do something.

312
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,983
The leadership group decide what generally needs to happen.

313
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,547
How we achieve it is all down to the team that is trying to develop it.

314
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:18,225
To give you an idea of the level of control that they have, one of those teams was taking

315
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,806
on a fairly major release for us.

316
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,207
It was God Wars Dungeon 2.

317
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:25,429
God Wars Dungeon is a very old dungeon in RuneScape.

318
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,471
We launched a second one of those also in 2016.

319
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,633
I promise not all of my examples come from the same time period.

320
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,354
That team took ownership of what they were going to try and develop.

321
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,481
Everything from the visual identity of that project, in keeping with RuneScape as itself,

322
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,442
being given guidance by the leadership group.

323
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:49,604
The communication plan, marketing plan, and then also the release rollout.

324
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:55,586
How would we do the lead-in over a number of weeks and how would the actual event of the launch feel for the players?

325
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,467
That control was given into the team.

326
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,368
They got advice and they got guidance.

327
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,429
There were suggestions coming from leadership.

328
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,889
We made sure that everybody knew what we were trying to achieve.

329
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,791
And they worked with the other departments inside the team, our publishing and marketing

330
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:11,772
groups, our community group, to make sure that they had everything they needed for a

331
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:12,492
positive launch.

332
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,934
And making a significant dent in player behavior in a game that's been running for 17 years

333
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,795
is difficult, I'll tell you that from first-hand experience, but they did it.

334
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:25,856
And it was by allowing them to have the ownership over what they were trying to do and lay out

335
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,717
what needed to happen, gave them that level of control.

336
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,018
But sometimes that can be difficult, right?

337
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:33,599
Having that level of control into a team.

338
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,959
So I'm hoping I can give you something that will help a little bit.

339
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,260
Pure freedom.

340
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:41,624
It's probably not a great way to approach this, especially if your team hasn't done

341
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,024
it before.

342
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:47,530
So if you think of the concept of freedom within a frame, set your boundaries, set the

343
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,891
space that somebody can operate within.

344
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:53,956
Some examples would be, depending on the size and the level of awareness in your team,

345
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:59,248
You have maybe one of the boundaries is the cost of the team or the cost of the project

346
00:17:59,268 --> 00:17:59,808
you're trying to do.

347
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:01,109
You have an amount that you can spend.

348
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:02,549
There's an expected return.

349
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:03,770
I mean, these are pretty basic ones.

350
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,371
The quality that you're expected to deliver.

351
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,933
All of us have our expected, like, please don't ship a class A bug day one.

352
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:15,175
And then the satisfaction and the expectation that you'll come back from the players.

353
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:18,216
Those four antagonistic expectations.

354
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:22,148
And allow the team to have complete control within that space.

355
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,610
Not telling them what the update's going to be, not going to tell them what the creative

356
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,371
direction should be.

357
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:29,933
Or I could, that might be one of the boundaries that we're going to set.

358
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,335
But really, it allows that team to feel like they have that control.

359
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:37,837
The borders create the constraint that allow them to feel the freedom that they need.

360
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,259
As that gets better, maybe you can extend out those boundaries.

361
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,920
But that's up for you.

362
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,343
The boundaries that work for a team depend on the team, your own teams themselves.

363
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:54,445
So let me try and bring all of those four ideas together as a single concept.

364
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:58,668
We're going through something right now.

365
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:00,249
So let's go through these.

366
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,529
Our pillars for change.

367
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,492
First of all, we have been looking at how RuneScape has been performing.

368
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:11,696
We've noticed that there has been some ways that we could improve some little bit of stagnation

369
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:15,499
in some portion of the community that we need to energize, we need to really do better.

370
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,521
So looking at that, we took a lot of player feedback, a lot of feedback from within the

371
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,702
team, a lot of open and honest and good conversations.

372
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:27,163
None of them ended up with people arguing or shouting or screaming at each other, I

373
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:27,463
promise.

374
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:33,925
But we made sure that we also interrogated that data, delved into it, really understood

375
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:34,345
what it meant.

376
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:37,806
Were we just seeing things or were we seeing things that weren't there?

377
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,166
Was the data backing up what our expectations are as a team?

378
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:41,727
And it was.

379
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:42,847
So we went a little bit further.

380
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:48,959
We look at the fact that we can change, so we considered whether our small changes were

381
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,559
doing enough.

382
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,722
And the fact was we were always changing, so the problem was there, so obviously the

383
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:54,823
changes that we were doing weren't enough.

384
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:58,786
We had to go bigger, we had to do something a lot more bold.

385
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:04,150
So we spoke very closely with the team that distributed decision making.

386
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,372
This isn't one leadership group dictating what's going to happen.

387
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,915
This is a collaboration, working with the team and discussing what people are expecting.

388
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:15,861
From within the team, we were looking for more control within the developers.

389
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,543
I've already told you about a team that felt like they had control.

390
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:19,905
We wanted more of that.

391
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:24,830
Those teams are very close to the player base, so being able to give them that level of ownership

392
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,570
was really important.

393
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:31,076
And they wanted to be able to have more awareness of the direction of the game and make sure

394
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,077
that that was really clear.

395
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:34,099
People felt like it was starting to diffuse a bit.

396
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:39,306
Looking at the players, they really wanted good releases very regularly.

397
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:45,690
I've asked our data analytics group about how we should approach releases and they gave

398
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,912
me the very helpful advice of they want more, bigger, better, faster and more oftener.

399
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:53,655
So I suppose we have to do all of those things, so we will try.

400
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:58,106
So with that discussion after happening, we decided it was time to change.

401
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:01,570
And I realize I said small teams, but we went smaller.

402
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,735
So we're looking at giving that ownership almost to the developer level.

403
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:11,201
We work in pairs with QA support as well, but really going very, very small.

404
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,683
Consider it to be more like a swarm.

405
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:20,330
Instead of having six fairly large teams, we now have nine or ten, possibly 11, depending

406
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,270
on the time of day.

407
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,593
Each of those teams has a feeling of identity, but the important thing is you can bring them

408
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,174
together on a larger project or spread them apart as necessary.

409
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:35,377
It's that kind of flexibility where you see people bringing together developers for major

410
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,537
features and splitting them apart.

411
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,760
We're trying to create the team identity, but also have that flexibility.

412
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,690
I may be trying to have my cake and eat it, right?

413
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:47,452
We're right in the middle of this change, so maybe I'll come back later on and tell

414
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,313
you if this actually worked.

415
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:53,155
We're trying to give them as much autonomy as possible, but still giving them that north

416
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,816
star from the leadership team to give direction.

417
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,873
And so then it's understanding that improvement is not immediate.

418
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,535
Like I said, we're at early days on this.

419
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:07,280
But I'm hoping that if you consider this graph from earlier where that's yesterday and the

420
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,264
future is off there in the future and I'm not going to go along that lovely dotted line

421
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:15,468
of to accept that and I'm going to cause problems when we start the first change, I feel like

422
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:15,989
we're about here.

423
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,152
We went through a lot of difficulty when we started.

424
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:24,638
It hit the teams quite hard trying to understand what was going on and trying to get that ownership

425
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,140
into a smaller group, making sure they're all aligned.

426
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,820
That was difficult.

427
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,963
But we knew what we were getting into and we understood that there was going to be a

428
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:34,987
challenge and we started to see wins in the past couple of weeks even.

429
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,372
Shortly before GDC, this slide today was a little bit further back along that line.

430
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:45,764
We've already seen a couple of updates come out between the middle of February up to today

431
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:51,068
and we launched a large new quest in the past week or so and it's going down very well.

432
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,070
Players are seeing that ownership and they're seeing the change in our direction.

433
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,951
Our development teams are seeing their impacts.

434
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:56,892
We're not there yet.

435
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,233
We are still below where we were.

436
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,654
We still need to do better.

437
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:02,696
But we know we're coming around the hump and we're seeing major changes.

438
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:07,299
Every day, and it's not just me, it's the whole group, can see those improvements starting

439
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:10,301
to happen and we look out for them and we celebrate those small wins.

440
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,755
And then to just kind of really confuse ourselves,

441
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,977
RuneScape's actually going to be coming cross-play to mobile

442
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:18,958
later this year.

443
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:21,319
So looming on the horizon for that swarm

444
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,661
is a fairly major change in approaching cross-platform

445
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:25,061
development.

446
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,162
So we'll have to go through the process again.

447
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:30,444
So I'm supposed to wrap everything up and give you

448
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:31,625
a little bit more detail, and of course,

449
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:33,186
give you that super secret end of the talk takeaway

450
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,686
that everybody is still sitting here waiting for.

451
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:37,948
The first thing is improvement is not immediate.

452
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,745
You need to become familiar with the change before you see major benefits.

453
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,026
And that's okay.

454
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:46,627
That's the same for everyone.

455
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:49,970
The smaller the change, the smaller the dip.

456
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:51,251
But it's still going to happen.

457
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,092
Be aware of that.

458
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:56,236
When you see those wins, make sure that you celebrate them.

459
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:57,417
Celebrate them as a team.

460
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:58,237
It'll feel better.

461
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:01,520
You're going to have your resolve hit by the first impact, especially if you're doing a

462
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,041
large change.

463
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,549
Consider the development processes that you're using

464
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,430
and the pillars that are there to support them.

465
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,211
What are the core concepts that you hold dear

466
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,151
as a development team?

467
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,893
We make sure that we embed change at the core of our process

468
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,274
to make sure that people are constantly adapting

469
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:20,595
and constantly improving, changing for the better.

470
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:23,377
Consider whether small teams work for you.

471
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,097
I like this one.

472
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,798
As you can see, we went even smaller,

473
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:26,978
so that's a thing I like.

474
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:28,379
May not work for every team.

475
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,748
So consider whether it's the right thing for you.

476
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:34,872
For us, having a fleet rather than a tanker allows us to spread our bets and consider

477
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:35,533
where we're going next.

478
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:39,197
It doesn't work for everyone, but I encourage you thinking about it.

479
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,339
Does it work for your group?

480
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,485
Like I said, the most important one, absolutely, is distributed decision making.

481
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:53,625
understanding that you can set what is going to happen, but that how being in the team

482
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:58,126
and allowing them to creatively approach a challenge, giving them the ownership and the

483
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,568
empowerment allows them to enter into any large change with more investment.

484
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:07,189
So I encourage everybody to consider how that could work for you.

485
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,470
Once again, this doesn't mean just tell everybody to do whatever the hell they want.

486
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:12,371
There needs to be context, there needs to be control.

487
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,432
Freedom in a frame is a good way for us to try and communicate that to people.

488
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,240
And then I suppose I should give it away.

489
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,803
Overall, I'm hoping what you've taken away from all of this

490
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:22,945
is that change isn't really a process.

491
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:23,966
It's more of a behavior.

492
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,909
How you work and how you approach your day-to-day

493
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,351
should be something that allows you to alter and adapt.

494
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:34,656
And that is creating a development culture

495
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:35,497
that embraces change.

496
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:36,978
And thank you very much for listening.

497
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,609
And I believe we have five minutes for questions, if anybody has any.

498
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,640
Oh, that's easy. Well, thank you very much.

499
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:57,534
Hello.

500
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:03,058
I know you're still early in your rollout, overall process of improvement.

501
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:07,141
What changes do you think you anticipate you would need to make if you had to scale this

502
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:10,203
out to 2 to 3x the current team size?

503
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:15,927
What I'm hoping is that by, so for anybody who didn't hear, what would I do to try and

504
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,349
scale this out to 2 to 3 times the larger team?

505
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,170
So to give you an idea, we're talking...

506
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:27,197
the core development group is about 70 people, so we're talking like 200-300 people.

507
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:34,061
I believe that it becomes the coordination of the multiple smaller teams.

508
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,283
Try to split them into other smaller areas, try to create that hierarchy of groups

509
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:41,045
or creating that ownership may help.

510
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:46,428
The clearer your direction and

511
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:49,329
the

512
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:54,871
project is the easier it is to disseminate that information to a larger team. If there

513
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:59,212
is any weakness in your vision, the more groups you start adding in, the less effective they

514
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:03,994
will become. I would look at clarifying exactly what you are trying to achieve so everyone

515
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:08,176
understands and looking at ways you can improve communication between teams. If we had like

516
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:08,216
a

517
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:08,316
the

518
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:08,676
video and the

519
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:09,276
content you

520
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:09,536
publish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

521
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:16,839
Let's say six before we go to the really small groups, but if we say six, if you added like

522
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:21,500
12 or 24 of those, then communication inside that room, even if you only bring that leadership

523
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,461
group, is communication between 24 people.

524
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:24,721
That's a challenge.

525
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:28,223
So think about layering a hierarchy inside there.

526
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:38,466
My question is how small were you able to take the teams before you got to a point of

527
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:39,766
diminishing returns?

528
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:46,923
To clarify, the question is how small can I take the teams before we see diminishing results?

529
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:52,426
There is a benefit, and so this is very much up to individual teams

530
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,747
and how different teams are working.

531
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,148
On RuneScape, the structure that we've built over multiple years

532
00:27:58,228 --> 00:28:00,649
has all been around rapid iteration and rapid development.

533
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,511
So to give you an idea, once someone writes the last line of script

534
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:09,333
to everybody in Jagex actually being able to play the change they've just made

535
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:10,993
is about 45 seconds.

536
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:16,095
So that level of rapid iteration means that we can go very small in our teams.

537
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:23,634
We also make sure that our development group are as cross-disciplined as possible.

538
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:29,778
So those scripters are writing both scripts, they're also designing puzzles, gameplay and

539
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:30,639
narrative design.

540
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:34,661
They have support in that and that's vital, just letting people do whatever they want

541
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,623
in any direction they want can cause challenges.

542
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:41,486
But giving them that level of control and then allowing leads for...

543
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:48,014
So, narrative or for conflict, combat, story and puzzle, to be able to support them means

544
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,577
that they can take more and more content onto themselves.

545
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:51,898
But that's a big challenge.

546
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,842
It's been 17 years of trying to get that right and I wouldn't say that we're perfect.

547
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:57,886
We got down to two in a QA.

548
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:09,947
Hello, so my question regards Scrum philosophy. I'm curious how much you took from that and

549
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:16,710
if how much your approach varies from classic Scrum. I mean for example the roles like Scrum

550
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,633
Master, Product Owner and the team division, Scrum Events and I'm just curious what you

551
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,214
guys did actually to make it work for your team.

552
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:28,542
I was told once about a way to approach learning new things.

553
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:32,114
The first thing is to do exactly as it's said.

554
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:39,919
So, I suppose, just to clarify, the question is how do we vary Scrum and how do we come

555
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,560
about to where we are?

556
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,583
So we started and we had all ceremonies were working exactly as you'd expect.

557
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:52,727
We had sprint reviews, sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog grooming, daily stand-ups, and we

558
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,728
have most of those already, still today.

559
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,269
We actually adhere very closely.

560
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,770
We do have Scrum Masters inside the team.

561
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,492
I just got the boxes started to get a bit messy.

562
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,870
What we try and do is the first thing is approach it, just do it as it says it in the book.

563
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,553
Don't think that you know better than the person who's actually laid out a framework

564
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:11,414
and designed it.

565
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,856
Because they've probably gone around the mill a bit.

566
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:17,680
Once you are doing it and understand that everything, or you're doing everything as

567
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,642
it says, then understand why you're doing it.

568
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:22,124
Don't assume you understand it, really understand.

569
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:23,445
Look at what it's actually achieving.

570
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:29,328
And then once you have both of those cases, learning from what's there, then you start

571
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,028
making the changes.

572
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:33,649
Because you understand what impact is going to happen from making an alteration.

573
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:36,250
So our sprint review started to get a little bit shorter.

574
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,010
Our retrospectives got more important.

575
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,731
Our product owner scrum master roles started to diminish.

576
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:45,473
When you have a swarm, then you don't really have enough people to have things so we don't

577
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,553
even meet the criteria for a minimum scrum team.

578
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,606
We make sure that people have the support that they need.

579
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:54,270
But it came from doing it by the book for a period of time to understand why.

580
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,894
Hi, great talk.

581
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:05,260
You were talking about giving ownership to the teams, but how often do the teams report

582
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,182
to the management and how formal is that?

583
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:12,823
So the question is how often do the teams report to the management and how formal?

584
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:13,544
Okay.

585
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:19,787
We have, depending on which layer of the organization we talk to, the teams themselves are regularly

586
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:22,828
catching up day to day and week to week as a leadership group.

587
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:24,089
So that product leadership group.

588
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:29,752
So that team, as a title, people are very aware of what's going on.

589
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:37,396
As you move larger in the organisation, so to give you context, I have RuneScape and

590
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:41,279
we have old school RuneScape, if people are aware, we launched that about five years ago,

591
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,380
and there's another two teams at Jagex as well.

592
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,402
Each of those will speak to me at least once a week, but I'll be in touch with the leads

593
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:52,184
for each of those groups on what's going on fairly regularly in informal discussions.

594
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:57,727
And then we have at least once a month a relatively detailed breakdown of where we are in progress,

595
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,468
what we're doing in the future and what direction we have.

596
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:04,650
And we're looking at being more thorough in quarterly chunks.

597
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,451
But depending on how close it is,

598
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:11,072
so the rate reduces the further away

599
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,053
you are from the customer.

600
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:14,233
OK, thank you.

601
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:15,594
Thank you.

602
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:16,754
Hi, thank you for speaking today.

603
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:20,836
My question is, how do you maintain cohesion

604
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:23,657
across your product when so many different teams are

605
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:24,437
making decisions?

606
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,918
Is that the leadership team, the product teams?

607
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:28,498
Who's responsible for that?

608
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:31,350
So the question is how do I maintain cohesion?

609
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,950
I suppose the easy answer is I don't.

610
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,711
It is a lot of hard work from everybody involved in developing the game and a lot of communication

611
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,672
back and forth between them.

612
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:45,953
Along with the retrospective, we do a daily review every two weeks, not daily review,

613
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:52,795
sorry, a day of reviews every sprint cycle and that is streamed within the studio so

614
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:57,516
everybody can see what's being changed and all of the teams can see all of the other

615
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,536
things that the teams are making.

616
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:01,099
That's one of the first points.

617
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:04,662
We then have the leadership group layer that I had at the bottom.

618
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,505
That group is aware of everything that everybody else is doing.

619
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,551
primary role is to, I like to think of it as like nudge and guide people in the right

620
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:19,053
direction, but when necessary try and come in a little bit more force to try and bring

621
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:23,154
people back in line. And some of that is clarifying the vision like I was saying at the start.

622
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:27,336
If people are deviating, it's not necessarily because they just want to do what they want,

623
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:31,777
it may be a case that your communication of direction and vision isn't clear enough to

624
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:35,559
bring people back in. Thank you. I'm kind of doing.

625
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,181
We are out of time.

626
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:40,822
Well, I'll do one more.

627
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:41,603
Can I do one more?

628
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:42,863
I'll do one more.

629
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:43,283
I'm sorry.

630
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:48,086
I'll ask you, how do you organize communication,

631
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,787
specifically communication between those teams?

632
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,809
Is it like single point of contact, one person represents

633
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:57,411
the team, talks to the representative of the other

634
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:00,332
team, and in case of conflict between them, how do you

635
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,573
mediate those conflicts?

636
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,312
Okay, so I'll try and do this very quickly, so I'm sorry if I don't cover everything,

637
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:10,374
but this is communication between the teams and resolving conflict when it arises.

638
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:16,637
The way we make sure the communication happens between those teams is there is like a producer

639
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:19,139
who represents multiple of the, in the swarm stand up.

640
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,332
There's somebody who represents multiple of those teams and makes sure they're aligned

641
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:27,875
and then that person speaks to somebody who represents the other swarms of people.

642
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:32,538
That's how we make sure that people are speaking between each other but also the team isn't

643
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:35,000
large enough that we have massive breakdowns of communication.

644
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,860
They're all on the same floor.

645
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,942
They all speak to each other fairly openly anyway.

646
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:44,867
The other part that we try and do to mediate conflict is open and honest conversations

647
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:48,970
are not only good for transparency, they're also good for airing conflict and resolving

648
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,110
them.

649
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,593
I'm not going to say we're the best in the world at dealing with conflict inside an organization.

650
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:57,996
We could be much better, but we do try and hit it head on when it arises.

651
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:00,898
So I'm going to wrap up because I've totally gone over time.

652
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,462
I want to thank everybody here for your time inside in the room, and I will be in the wrap-up

653
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,663
area at the other side of the hall.
