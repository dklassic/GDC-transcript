00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:13,029
Hello and welcome to The Music of Chia, channeling the soul of New Caledonia.

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,993
I'm John Uppermatz, and this is GDC 2024's audio track.

3
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:27,964
Before we get started, they asked me to remind you to silence your cell phones, your pagers, your cool watches, any other cool noisemakers, that analog pocket you've left in suspend mode for too long.

4
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:29,265
Turn those off for now.

5
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:29,766
Thank you.

6
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:31,367
Let's dive in.

7
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:33,635
So, who am I?

8
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,537
Like I said, I'm John Albert Matz, and I'm the composer on Chia.

9
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:46,660
I've also worked on games like Ambition, a minuet in power, a late Baroque slant classical period score for a game set on the eve of the French Revolution.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,102
Mythguard, a cyberpunk meets mythology fusion of electronics, orchestra, and weird hybrid sounds.

11
00:00:55,043 --> 00:01:07,574
For the King and For the King 2, a fantasy score with a soul made of early music, renaissance, medieval music, instrumentation and harmony, and Fossil Echo, the first game from Chia developers Awaseb.

12
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:17,963
A fantastical spiritual journey with a lot of interesting, vaguely world music inspired sounds, but relatively unfettered from any real world equivalent cultures.

13
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:25,569
Now, as you can kind of see from this, I'm no stranger to different sounds and styles, but Chia required a different approach.

14
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:32,774
The core development team at Awaseb hailed from this little island country between Australia and New Zealand, New Caledonia.

15
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:44,262
They wanted to make something that really spoke to their culture, that highlighted their mythology, their geography, their natural world, their customs and traditions, and this is where I come in, their music.

16
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:46,884
Now, you may have noticed something

17
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,856
I'm not from there.

18
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:53,179
I'm quite possibly the whitest kid you could ask to do this.

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,361
I'm from the Chicago suburbs.

20
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:59,104
I've barely even seen the sea, never mind swimming in it or sailing on it.

21
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:05,410
The phrase that came to mind as I was writing this was that I was probably the most uniquely unqualified person to write this score.

22
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:10,115
I think I asked them a couple times, like, are you sure you want me to do this?

23
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,217
But they did want me.

24
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:35,292
They loved what I did on Fossil Echo so much that they had to have me back with their second outing, leading from this linear, relatively simple 2D hand-drawn platformer to a sprawling open-world adventure loaded with activities, cinematic sequences, and tons of nooks and crannies to explore, scattered across this huge archipelago, a fictionalized version of real-life New Caledonia.

25
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:37,633
I had to do this right.

26
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,935
Thankfully, I had friends and artistic collaborators to draw upon.

27
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,725
The first step was research.

28
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,308
It was time for a deep dive.

29
00:02:48,488 --> 00:03:01,195
I spent months researching, like probably six, nine months just watching documentaries, reading musicological journals, digital museum exhibits, all manner of things, almost all of them in French, a language I do not speak.

30
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:15,123
I must have asked a million questions of Phil Crifo, our lead developer, and traded dozens and dozens of musical examples, references, et cetera, all working towards getting a grasp on what made New Caledonian music distinctly New Caledonian.

31
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,806
There was a real fear, and to be fair, a real danger that Chia would be perceived as indie game Moana.

32
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,687
And we really didn't want that.

33
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:29,151
Nor did we want the score to lean into anything that felt particularly Moana-ish.

34
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:41,762
As such, I tried to consciously steer away from anything that felt particularly like a big Hollywood sound and do my best to integrate as many uniquely New Caledonian timbres and musical elements as I could.

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:54,907
Now, New Caledonia is home to a host of interesting types of music, but a distinct genre that we'll focus on here, one that began to form in the 1970s and really flourished into the 80s and persists to today.

36
00:03:55,648 --> 00:04:03,293
Caneca music is a homegrown genre that blends a lot of elements from other genres with traditional New Caledonian sounds and rhythms.

37
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:16,798
Elements of reggae, rock, soul music, even rap and funk kind of infuse it, and lyrics can touch on anything from the challenges of everyday life to politically charged speech pushing for social change.

38
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:25,981
From the outset, one of the things that Phil wanted to feature in our musical landscape were several licensed tracks from notable New Caledonian artists, Guru Jele and Paul Wamo.

39
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:32,564
So everything that I wrote had to complement those while feeling distinct enough to not tread on their featured status.

40
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:52,311
Kaneka music features prominent vocals with close-knit harmonies, guitars, drums, keys, all your normal band stuff, if you will, plus a healthy dose of elements of traditional New Caledonian folk music.

41
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,876
Traditional New Caledonian music is heavily influenced by the wider music of Melanesia.

42
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:10,421
but has a lot of distinct elements that distinguish it from the music of its island neighbors.

43
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:24,793
Colonial events of the 1930s seem to have expunged a saddening amount of Native musical traditions from the record, but several do persist and are alive and in performance practice today, and as such are pretty well documented.

44
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:32,861
The notable elements we decided to incorporate were the pilu, or temperance rhythm, sometimes just called rhythm, or kanak rhythm.

45
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:38,744
It's this distinct motor that runs throughout nearly all of the traditional ceremonial dances that remain in practice.

46
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:49,728
You can boil it down to basically a sort of dotted-eighth-sixteenth pattern, with strong downbeats emphasized either by accents or just more instruments being brought to bear.

47
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,971
This varies a bit depending on where you are on the islands, but that core sound runs through just about every bit of traditional music that has a steady pulse.

48
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,712
So here's an example that's particularly emblematic of the trope.

49
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:27,318
It shows up everywhere, and even gets woven into the Kaneka genre of music I touched on earlier.

50
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:35,222
Sometimes with traditional instruments, sometimes with drum kit, and percussion more idiomatic to the reggae influence of the other genres as well.

51
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,084
Speaking of traditional instrumentation, let's touch on some of that.

52
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:47,188
Obviously we have human sounds like foot stomps and claps, but there's a ton of other percussive elements in play.

53
00:06:48,459 --> 00:07:05,417
pounding bamboo is used as a sort of a bass drum kick while bamboo logs are hollowed out sometimes made with slots or tongues to give different pitches when struck with stick beaters and then as we can see in the picture on the right here tucked under this gentleman's arm you see one of the more fascinating hand percussion instruments

54
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:12,638
The banjep is absolutely everywhere in New Caledonian music, both in traditional music and modern music.

55
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,418
It's sort of a bark beater, if you will.

56
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:23,841
Peeled bark is folded and stuffed with coconut fibers or other plant matter and formed into this sort of triangle shape to be beaten one against the other as a pair.

57
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,602
We actually made these into a playable instrument for one of the music sequences in the game.

58
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:41,397
Some larger, more circular types of beaters exist as well, called ebe, which are basically these giant balls of leaves, glommed together and bound with, which are usually played by just striking them with your open palm.

59
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,959
Think of it as like a beefed up clap.

60
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,986
The Sonai, on the other hand, are basically a sort of cowbell.

61
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:54,775
Bundles of dried seed pods are tied on dancers' feet and add this characteristic clatter or rattle sound with every stomp that they make.

62
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:59,841
Again, we made playable instruments of these that Chia can use for some of the musical sequences.

63
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,444
And finally, leaves.

64
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:04,387
Yep, you heard right.

65
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:21,276
These little dried fern leaves are so ubiquitous in New Caledonian music that Phil went so far as to bring some back home to France with him after visiting his parents over the holidays, specifically to record them so we could put them in the game.

66
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:26,198
They also 100% break down into just tiny little pieces as you play them.

67
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:29,159
So by the time we got our samples done, they were gone.

68
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,780
But I think the results work.

69
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:03,458
I appreciate them having the particle effects of them just disintegrating as you play them.

70
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:31,934
Now, I'm a brass player primarily, so winds come fairly naturally to me, and I wanted to find a way to incorporate some sounds that I could replicate myself.

71
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:39,061
The traditional Kanak flute is a transverse flute made of bamboo, with a relatively limited range and a curious mode of playing.

72
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:54,359
It's frequently used almost as more of a rhythmic element than a melodic one.

73
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,421
Think of it almost like beatboxing.

74
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:14,095
Now, unlike most of the wood, bamboo, and plant-based instruments, the wessel, which we see here on the right, or whistle, is made of metal and actually began life as a shipboard whistle from European sailing vessels, modified and incorporated into traditional music.

75
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,408
You can actually hear the ebe in the background there.

76
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,976
Just like the flute, it's used to drive and lend a piercing rhythmic motor to the traditional musical ensemble.

77
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:38,997
While we were able to use some recorded phrases of flute kanaka in the score, I needed something a bit more flexible that still had the same kind of bamboo, transverse flute character.

78
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:46,322
And I was fortunate enough to find one, an instrument, that fit the bill perfectly from a small maker when I was in LA for a conference a while back.

79
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,545
I used that to voice our villain, Meabora's theme.

80
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,967
Something mystic, mysterious, and creepy.

81
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:09,728
On the flip side, on a complete whim, I tried an experiment.

82
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:19,664
I took a metal slide whistle I had, I tuned it to the correct bass note of the real whistles, and ran it through some pitch-shifting plugins, and was pleasantly surprised at the results.

83
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:35,907
works, right?

84
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,308
So finally, we get to the vocal element, my favorite.

85
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:48,330
New Caledonia has a rich tradition of song, both homegrown and influenced by the musical traditions imported from Europe by missionaries.

86
00:11:49,030 --> 00:12:01,293
There are more than 35 different languages and dialects spoken on the islands, but the two most represented are French and Drehu, and those are what all of our songs' lyrics are written in, thanks to Merilu López Aguilera, our lyricist.

87
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:09,894
Close, largely homophonic harmonies and neat rhythmic text declamation typify a lot of the New Caledonian choral tradition.

88
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,644
along with improvisatory ostinato elements frequently using the AR pattern of arms

89
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:07,765
along with elements of call and response, little barks and shouts, usually used to cue dancers if used in a pilu setting, and trilling cries to punctuate and add extra interest.

90
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,026
So how do we bring all this stuff together?

91
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:13,828
Step two, the process.

92
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:22,072
So I've touched on a little of this so far, but actually making all this happen on an indie game budget, no less, was a real challenge.

93
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:33,228
Obviously there was the trick of getting a lot of the unique New Caledonian percussion sounds, and we were fortunate enough to be able to record some of the more idiomatically New Caledonian instruments, leaves, sonai, etc.

94
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,228
from proper New Caledonian sources.

95
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:49,551
The ones that Chia needed to be able to play were turned into audio assets and implemented in FMOD by our audio team over at A Shell in the Pit, and because I can't let something that useful go to waste, I also made custom contact instruments out of them as well, which got used throughout the score.

96
00:13:50,697 --> 00:14:03,165
Guitars are ubiquitous in Kanaka music, and we knew we wanted to feature guitar prominently, an instrument that, at least at the time I started working on the score, and arguably if you talk to any guitarist, I still do not play.

97
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:09,229
But I was fortunate enough to get to work with some of my friends, Eric Peabody, a.k.a.

98
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,970
Viking Guitar, and Grant Henry, a.k.a.

99
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,452
Stemmage, who knocked everything I threw at them out of the park.

100
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,126
For everything I didn't record myself, we recorded individual players and built up entire sections out of them.

101
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:32,359
Andrew Stephan over here played our violins and violas, Andrew Stern played cellos, basses were Travis Kindred, I played all the trumpets and horns, trombones were Daniel Romberger,

102
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,502
And finally, the most important part, the vocals, which required, honestly, the most unique approach of all.

103
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,445
The process for writing all the songs was similar, but it took a bit of refinement to get it all down.

104
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:11,574
Things start from the script, understanding where the song takes place in the story, what it is in response to, what the general feel of the song is supposed to be.

105
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:21,244
From there, I'd have an idea, make a sketch, sometimes something as simple as a voice recording, and I'd send it back to Phil, who would approve it, or come back with notes.

106
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,642
apologies for the aquarium sounds in the background

107
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,116
and

108
00:15:58,621 --> 00:15:59,121
Lovely, right?

109
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:11,970
Anyway, so if he liked it, Mary Lou would get to work on lyrics, and I'd start adding them in, sending back more examples to Phil, who'd sometimes suggest little tweaks to text setting to make it more correct and naturalistic.

110
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:19,995
Again, remember, I don't speak these languages, and checking and triple checking and quadruple checking with people who do was paramount.

111
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:29,661
From there, we'd create the assets for the singers and the recording studio in New Caledonia and get things packaged up, which, it turned out, had even more challenges.

112
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:35,710
We realized very quickly that, at least for the choir, there really wasn't much use in preparing scores.

113
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:46,275
They learned everything by rote, which meant creating mock-up stems for every voice part in every cue, in Drehu or French, and singing every part myself.

114
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:54,760
And packaging them all up with lyric sheets and performance instructions that would be translated by Merleau for the choristores, director, and recording engineers at the studio in New Caledonia.

115
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,724
Basically, starting from here with me singing all the individual parts.

116
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:08,309
And ending up here with the final recordings.

117
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:33,602
Now, while I wrote a lot of specific parts, six or more sometimes in close harmony, etc, etc, one of the things that really brought everything together, and honestly something core to a lot of New Caledonian choral tradition, is improvisation.

118
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:59,304
whole countermelodies rhythmic ideas nonsense syllables they made them up during the sessions and we ran with them because much like the orchestra recordings our choir was recorded piecemeal uh... there were only about six singers in total multi-tracked usually no more than two voices and a stem I had pretty much total control over the material which was great for fixing tuning or timing or making blend tweaks in Melodyne but also they were able to just

119
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:06,465
send me whatever other cool ideas they happen to come upon during the recording sessions to be used or not used as the case may be.

120
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:20,864
In fact, there was one cutscene score that provoked enough improvisational ideas that I wound up spinning all those off, or a bunch of them off, into another piece and wrote an entire new cue around them.

121
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,305
That's what you're hearing here.

122
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,586
It's nice.

123
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,729
I just want to, like, live here for a while.

124
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:43,036
I couldn't not use this.

125
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:48,298
So, let's take a look at one of these score cues that kind of puts all this stuff together.

126
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,881
Combining vocals, native instruments, score, or orchestral elements, and really the whole kit and caboodle.

127
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:03,205
So here we have that pilu rhythm going on.

128
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,026
We have some of the percussion elements that we talked about.

129
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,853
Some of the shouts, claps in response.

130
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,935
Some of the improvisational stuff that they came up with during choral sessions.

131
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,496
There's your flute beatboxing in the background.

132
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:26,538
The kind of vocal trills of response to that as we kind of build back up.

133
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,679
More of that cool flute stuff.

134
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,723
And now we're into the stuff where we're having choral parts that I've actually written again.

135
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,806
And now we bring the orchestra back in.

136
00:19:51,287 --> 00:20:03,736
Right, so kind of putting all that stuff together to something that hopefully has the emotional impact while still being true to the music and the culture that we're trying to respect and convey and celebrate.

137
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,426
But wait, there's more.

138
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:08,708
It's only 4.20.

139
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:10,249
We've got lots of time.

140
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,111
Chia's a musical.

141
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:14,773
Yeah.

142
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,196
It's also a rhythm game.

143
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:31,369
Ten interactive musical sequences are spread throughout Chia's story, featuring our voiced cast pulling double duty as singers and letting the player perform ukulele and a variety of other native New Caledonia musical instruments alongside in a rhythm game fashion.

144
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:42,711
Songs take place in a variety of story contexts with a rotating cast of characters, instruments, and an increase in difficulty and complexity as the game progresses.

145
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:47,415
But there's one thing that we kept in mind as we designed these.

146
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:51,118
And you can see it here on the tutorial screen for the first music sequence.

147
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:56,943
You can't win or lose at music.

148
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,485
Just have fun.

149
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,022
That was our mantra for all these systems.

150
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:04,263
And to facilitate that, we decided no fail states.

151
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,664
Only note accuracy, percentage tallies after each song.

152
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:09,865
You can't lose at music, right?

153
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:16,688
In fact, when you're playing a pitched instrument, we actually lock the default notes to the notes in the scale of the piece.

154
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:19,890
So even if you're completely wrong, it won't sound terrible.

155
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,257
more about our actual instrument mechanics shortly.

156
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:34,062
In addition, we have an autoplay system that you can switch on or off at any time, which disables the rhythmic play-along mode and turns it into basically an automatically performed music video.

157
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:37,824
This helped bandage another unsolvable challenge as well.

158
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:39,085
Subtitles.

159
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:51,478
since every song, in fact, all the dialogue in the game is entirely done in Drehu or French and a notable amount of our players couldn't be expected to speak either language.

160
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:58,703
Having the means for them to turn off the gameplay elements and just free their eyes up to read the subtitles felt a bit more important.

161
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:07,650
I know it's a bit of a hacky solution, but it let us at least have the option of having our cake and eating it too if people couldn't multitask and play and read at the same time.

162
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,634
That way we could do that without compromising on the cultural linguistic vision of the game as a whole.

163
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:21,482
Songs begin simple with the first music sequence, which we looked at earlier, being our introduction to timing and rhythm, with only one button press being required to play.

164
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:29,745
Originally, the next song was designed to introduce and teach the player how to juggle note selection with the left stick and rhythmic timing with the face buttons.

165
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:39,569
She alternates between Sonai and Wanjeps, selecting the instrument by pushing the stick up for Wanjep or down for Sonai and pressing any of the face buttons to play.

166
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:51,334
Unfortunately for my idealized tutorial goals, the sequence ended up falling so soon after the first sequence in the average play experience that it felt too much, like, too much too fast.

167
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:56,337
Literally a month or so before launch, we decided to move it to a flashback sequence later in the game.

168
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,299
It was the correct choice.

169
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:05,404
It was the right flow choice for the game, and it all adapted just fine, moving directly from leaves to ukulele in the third sequence.

170
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,546
Now, apologies for my ADHD.

171
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:20,315
This feels like the right time to do a little walkthrough of how the ukulele in the game is designed and functions, so we can then talk about how it functions differently in the song sequences and how those were crafted afterwards.

172
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:27,580
At any given moment, after a certain point in a story, Chia can unsling her ukulele from her backpack and play it.

173
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:37,148
Very, very early on, Phil knew he wanted to give players a musical tool to interact with the environment, and the ukulele was the natural choice.

174
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:46,056
Melodically capable, popular across Polynesia, Oceania, and small enough for a kid to carry with her, it was the ideal choice.

175
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,019
The pitch wheel for note selection was the first thing to go in.

176
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:11,276
You use the left stick to select a note, and then the two face buttons play either the low or high octave.

177
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:18,739
After that, we had to figure out how to fit, well, just every other thing you could do with a ukulele onto a standard controller.

178
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:20,319
Piece of cake, right?

179
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:30,303
So the system is a bit complex, but at the end of the day, it works like this.

180
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,034
Note selection is handled with the left stick.

181
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,796
Default C to C on C major scale.

182
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:43,440
Which works super well for ukulele music.

183
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:53,546
Face buttons control single note low octave, single note high octave, chords drummed down and up.

184
00:24:55,137 --> 00:25:11,407
When designing the chord system, we stuck with simple triads, omitting extended chords like 7s, 9s, 11s, etc., because at the very least, having only a triad would never present a clash, and people could always add notes to imply extended harmonies if they wanted to, with single plucks if they needed to.

185
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:15,630
Chords are, by default, diatonic to the key in question.

186
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,593
So, C major, D minor, E minor,

187
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:25,510
F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished.

188
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,732
And then, of course, the octave.

189
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:29,393
And now this is where it gets fun.

190
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:35,458
For each chord we strum, we can shift the chord quality on a spectrum with the bumpers.

191
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:41,182
Either left, making it for smaller intervals, if you will, or right, making those intervals larger.

192
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:48,768
So using C major and pushing the left bumper gives us C minor.

193
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:55,929
Conversely, using the right bumper takes us to wider C augmented.

194
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,630
This applies all the way up the scale, or down the way this chart shows it.

195
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:03,732
C can be minor, major, augmented.

196
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:07,113
D can be diminished, minor, major.

197
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,454
E can be diminished, minor, or major.

198
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,515
F can be minor, major, or augmented.

199
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,497
G can be minor, major, or augmented.

200
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:47,510
A can be diminished minor or major and B can be only diminished or minor which I admit was a little bit of a hard sell to not have a third option but sticking with the correct music theory kind of convinced them yes now that we've all covered music theory 101 let's let's move on here now I can hear you saying that's not every possible chord or even every possible note which is where I say I know because we've still got triggers

201
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:55,302
So the triggers on our ukulele control two things, or one of two things.

202
00:26:56,123 --> 00:27:02,448
If pressed after a note has been played, they let you pitch bend up or down by a half step, kind of like a whammy bar sort of thing.

203
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:02,888
It's cool.

204
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,250
You can even do some vibrato with them if you're clever.

205
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:13,918
If you press them before a note has been played, though, the entire circle shifts up or down a half step.

206
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:25,608
Now, between that and exploiting the magic of enharmonics, we've got every possible triad that we could want, all functioning and playable on a standard controller layout.

207
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:27,790
And that's our ukulele.

208
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:34,726
Thank you.

209
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:48,952
We, uh, I think I must have been on, like, four different calls with Phil for an extended period of time, which is, like, why you have that incred— he drew that incredibly sweaty picture of himself there in the corner, like, as I'm, like, describing how the music theory needs to be to make— we gotta cover everything.

210
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:49,672
He's like, what about this?

211
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:50,993
I'm like, don't worry, it'll work.

212
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:51,713
It was great.

213
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,434
Anyway, that gives us a fully functional instrument.

214
00:27:54,754 --> 00:28:01,437
You can play any melody, any chords, with a solid amount of variation, tons of round-robin recordings across the entire range of the instrument.

215
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:14,461
Also, it was super lovely, as we kind of hoped secretly, to see so many weird covers like pop up of people playing popular songs and like, you know, like The Last of Us and all kinds of other weird stuff.

216
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:14,981
It was great.

217
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:21,123
Anyhow, back to songs, and thank you for putting up with my ADHD digression, which is really like an entire chapter in a book.

218
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:27,725
Anyhow, for the actual musical sequences, we had to tweak the freeform music system of the ukulele somewhat.

219
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:35,011
For starters, we would gear shift the note wheel into the key required, with the note options becoming diatonic to the key in the piece.

220
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,533
In this example, we are in D major.

221
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:42,317
So if the player misses notes, even if they miss notes, they'll still be playing in D major.

222
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:46,640
And it can't sound that bad, because remember, you can't win or lose in music.

223
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:47,781
Just have fun.

224
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:56,969
So once we'd spell out the notes and chords in the key, I'd prepare the MIDI files for Ben, Benjamin de Porquerie, the programmer who helmed the rhythm game system.

225
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:10,245
I'd start with writing the ukulele part on just one MIDI track, or as just one MIDI track, then copy-paste it into all four, adapt it, breaking phrases up across four different MIDI tracks, one for each of the possible articulations.

226
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:14,488
Low octave pluck, high octave pluck, chord strum down, and chord strum up.

227
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:17,370
One note for each note in the game's rhythm sequence.

228
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:27,420
Those files, combined with a chart showing BPM, the BPM for every song is fixed, by the way, any kind of rubato or ralentando stuff is entirely fake.

229
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,264
Like, there is a locked BPM, we slow down and we speed back up, but it's fine, no one knows, it's good.

230
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:37,709
We can technically have those tempo changes, but I kept them to a minimum, and they really only happened at the end of pieces.

231
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,553
I'd have to, like, SMTPE lock everything, and it was a fun time.

232
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,634
Anyway, so,

233
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:55,283
Tempo BPM, meter, pertinent count off information about syncing, all the note and chord key signature info, and all the pertinent notes on each music sequence went in a document and got sent over, and then we were good.

234
00:29:55,764 --> 00:30:07,172
Now the cool thing about our system is that by breaking up all the articulations into separate MIDI stems, the actual rhythm gameplay becomes just all about using the stick to select the right note at the right time, and pressing any face button.

235
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:13,897
with it auto selecting chords strummed up or down or individual notes across both octaves without the player having to really do anything.

236
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,519
All they got to do is choose the right note, press the right button.

237
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:24,806
Remember, also, we got some bonus stuff out of this, that autoplay system I described so we wouldn't have to necessarily play and just enjoy the music video.

238
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:55,328
yeah when it takes over it just automatically triggers the midi data for those tracks in real time so the hand positions oh by the way all the ukulele hand positions are correct and accurate so they all match what you'd have for real ukulele chords etc uh and those like music notes all that stuff you just get it for free now it's super cool uh so switching it on and off can happen in real time and she continues to play the correct notes and they all animate correctly because it's tied in systemically

239
00:30:56,168 --> 00:31:11,753
Now, there's a lot more material to cover about how Chia's open world was broken up into musical zones for each biome, tons of interactive activities, or even take a deep dive into the FMOD-powered interactive music systems that make our open world and stealth combat encounters feel vibrant.

240
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:22,996
Or I could spend another 20 minutes talking about how we designed the Mwokin voices for these strange wooden creatures with a combination of blown bottle sounds, percussion instruments, and weird wood noises.

241
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:28,819
Time is a little bit short, although actually I think I've been sweating and going fast up here that we have more time than I thought.

242
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,201
So I want to end our talk on one of the music sequences.

243
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:42,466
This was originally written in the manner of one of the French folk songs, but Louise here has spent some time translating it for Chia.

244
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:49,290
And as such, when we hear it in this reprise in Drehu, I incorporated more of the native New Caledonian rhythmic elements.

245
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:50,471
Let's listen.

246
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:31,739
Koko silele koipi Fidelawi leleceo Koura sino lien kanaka sinoji

247
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:54,176
Koko ti nene koibi Fidjala, the night Onike, tewike, kolape, minulae

248
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,001
Oh

249
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,764
You can hear the Pilu elements, the Kanak elements coming into the background, in the section.

250
00:34:12,915 --> 00:34:14,216
Thank you very, very much.

251
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:17,278
That was Eleviden singing there.

252
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,961
She played Louise, and just a wonderful, adorable voice.

253
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:25,584
When I got the first recordings back for that, that just made my day.

254
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:33,510
All of the voice cast was tremendous, and all the choir members were wonderful, and it was great to kind of get to feature them in so many ways.

255
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,072
That's basically it.

256
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:41,295
It was an absolute joy to get to work on something as special as Chia.

257
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:52,141
And collaborating with so many fantastically talented folks from all over the globe to make this happen was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and one I would not give up for the world.

258
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:57,159
And now I think we have time for some questions, if you want to hit them.

259
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,242
I'm going to cheat, because I've been standing this whole time.

260
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,162
I'm going to sit over here.

261
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,505
But if we have questions, we can line up here by the mic and hit me with them, OK?

262
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,648
Unless I've answered everything preemptively.

263
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:37,515
My question, well slight preface, I'm currently working on a game that has elements that tie to a particular country and unfortunately I kind of got more of this information late into development but

264
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:46,804
The work that you've done and having the amount of time that you were given at the start of the project, is that something that you often get?

265
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:57,075
How common is it for you to get half a year to do this amount of preparation before diving into a project like this?

266
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,256
That is, I mean, it can be rare.

267
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:07,483
Like, this is, a lot of the indie game projects I've worked on have had an extremely long, like, development time, and I've been brought in very early.

268
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:13,307
So I first heard about this game, I think in 2017, and I think I wrote the main theme for it in 2017.

269
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:23,635
But, like, getting all of the, like, all of the timbral elements in play, getting everything else, the melody was there, but dialing in what made it correct.

270
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:24,796
talk talk

271
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:45,955
Like I said, when I got asked to do it, I really straight up asked, like, is you sure you want me to do it?

272
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,837
Like, maybe we can, like, maybe there's, you know, maybe there's someone better for this.

273
00:36:50,258 --> 00:37:06,387
And barring that, it was the choice of either I need to put in the work to make this happen and find the people to collaborate with to bring this to life properly, or I would feel real bad about, like, I don't know, like, faking it, whitewashing it, what have you.

274
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:07,628
talk talk talk

275
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:29,549
Thank you so much for that.

276
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:30,510
That was incredible.

277
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,493
And your music's so beautiful.

278
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:33,455
Thank you so much.

279
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:41,187
So I'm curious, the instruments that you hadn't written for before that were new to you, did you have access to those instruments?

280
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:43,030
Did you get to play them?

281
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:46,232
So the percussion instruments and the other things?

282
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:47,853
So I didn't actually.

283
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:53,577
Those, basically, we were able to record in New Caledonia, and I sampled and broke out.

284
00:37:53,597 --> 00:38:01,582
Some things like the leaves, literally, they were brought home in a cardboard box so that we could record them and brought home by Phil.

285
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:04,744
So they went to France, not to America.

286
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:10,047
And I'm like, OK, can we get up and down strokes this many times and then do some rhythmic stuff?

287
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:11,128
And maybe we can use that.

288
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:17,511
and trying to emulate the sorts of things that they use that stuff for to get the right sound.

289
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:22,113
The other instruments are like, OK, this is a very simple bamboo flute.

290
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:30,356
During the process, I was watching documentary footage in French of a guy building one of these flutes.

291
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:34,518
Going out, literally find a piece of bamboo that works properly and build it.

292
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:36,499
OK, I see how you make this.

293
00:38:37,279 --> 00:39:02,846
and there's a ton of variety so much that's one of the things that really was remarkable is so much of the of the like the native instruments are literally just like I don't want to call them like found instruments but it's like we've we harvested the plant that makes the right shape and then we modify it and like craft it into something and now you have a flute or a drum or whatever else and so it was like okay we can see I can see how these are made

294
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:05,748
How can I emulate that here with the things that I have?

295
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,389
Or can I acquire things that will do that?

296
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,552
Or can we sample the real thing and then turn it into a virtual instrument?

297
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:16,655
Because during the process of this game, there's five and a half hours of music in this game.

298
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:21,919
And a lot of that spun up as we went along.

299
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,421
We didn't know when we were starting out how big it was going to be.

300
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,322
and it got way bigger as it went.

301
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:33,566
So having virtual instruments or instruments that I had access to, to just kind of sit down and go, I need to expand this.

302
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:39,008
What do I have that I can use that will still have that authentic flavor and the right sound?

303
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,690
Like that was the stuff I went to and picked up every time.

304
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,690
Yeah.

305
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,171
Okay, cool.

306
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:43,751
Thanks so much.

307
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:44,491
You're most welcome.

308
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,212
Any other questions?

309
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:47,553
Yes.

310
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,439
Thanks for the talk, John.

311
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:52,859
That was great.

312
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,480
I kind of wanted to piggyback off of the first question.

313
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:11,106
If you had to, like, pick, like, two or three techniques when it comes to composing music that are most valuable when it comes to making a soundtrack feel, let's say, authentic or from a period, right?

314
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:15,728
Could be any sort of composition technique, anything, songwriting, whatever, music choice.

315
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,369
What would those, like, top two or three be for you?

316
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:20,334
so

317
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:46,736
is to understand the kind of breadth of the cultural music in question.

318
00:40:46,796 --> 00:41:07,328
One of the things I mentioned, it's surprising when you look at a lot of the folk music of New Caledonia because there is some stuff that happens in the early part of the 20th century where they lose a lot of their, it seems like, looking at the records, they lose a lot of their cultural musical heritage and only some sorts of things get preserved and continued.

319
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:09,409
So it almost is like a necking down

320
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:13,230
of a more broad background.

321
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,972
So understanding, OK, what do we have that we can definitely use that will connect authentically with this?

322
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:19,732
And finding an element.

323
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:23,493
In this case, it was the Pilu rhythm, which is just everywhere.

324
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:26,053
Da, da, da, da, da.

325
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:30,895
And literally, every example I can find, it's almost within 10 BPM of that tempo.

326
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:35,936
And so I'm like, OK, that has to run through the lifeblood of this score.

327
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:38,017
Because that is a thing that gets used

328
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:39,478
talk talk talk talk

329
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,001
Okay, that's a hard question to do, but hopefully that answers some of it.

330
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:11,002
Yeah, I appreciate it.

331
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:11,302
Thanks.

332
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:12,022
No problem.

333
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:12,762
Yes, sir.

334
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:19,845
Yeah, I guess I just had a question regarding when you're writing the music for the choir.

335
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:25,987
How was it, was it kind of difficult to help them vocalize what you wanted?

336
00:42:26,107 --> 00:42:31,729
Or did you have help along with, I guess, your assistant when it came to recording with them?

337
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,490
Because you mentioned about them doing their vowels really easily.

338
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,030
with

339
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:07,952
in Drehu to sing this stuff correctly.

340
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:16,375
And I know I didn't do it right sometimes because I would get back them singing it correctly, like, well, I botched that consonant completely.

341
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:27,699
It is a fascinating language and the way that has been, like, you know, as they've converted, you know, this to, like, Latin characters, you know, to write it out,

342
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:35,561
you know, I assume this is something that comes from, you know, this is the French figuring out we're going to figure out how to write this using our characters.

343
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:40,283
Suddenly it's like, okay, I don't know why they chose some of the characters they chose.

344
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:43,363
As someone who can sing in French, it still doesn't make a connection.

345
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:52,946
So, like, I would have to go back and, like, double check to see I was pronouncing it as close as I could to correct, and then make these mockups so that they could sing with that.

346
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:54,987
And, like, individually stemming out every bit

347
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:56,048
development talk

348
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:40,692
everything broken up into like one person at a time recording or two people in a section meant that if there was something that wasn't quite right or a note that wasn't perfect I could change it and it was one tiny bit and Melodyne is really good for making that kind of like granular alteration if you have the small pieces no one can really tell and so you can tweak stuff if they sang a minor third instead of a major third and you're fine

349
00:44:41,172 --> 00:45:02,244
you know so on but yeah it was it was an interesting process and i wish like everything's i wish i could have done differently are done better you know because there was no high-speed internet to like dial in and watch while they're in the studio so is very much like i wrote out as many instructions and notes as i could and sent them over there you know and they were translated and handed off

350
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:03,124
talk

351
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,903
like you're sending something to the other side of the world and they aren't even awake, and then you're getting stuff.

352
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:32,030
I was sending stuff to France when they were awake barely, and then they would go all the way to New Caledonia, and then it would come back to me, and it was this whole long process.

353
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:45,421
I'm not going to say it was smooth, but it was one of these things where at the end of the day, you put in the hours required to do it to make it good, because it matters at the end of the day.

354
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:46,681
So does that answer your question?

355
00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:47,882
Yeah, that answers my question.

356
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:49,523
Yes, hello.

357
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:52,905
Hi, thank you so much for the talk.

358
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:57,628
I was kind of wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the ukulele system design.

359
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:58,308
Sure.

360
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:05,532
And if like, like looking back at it, if there's anything that you would change or just like overall.

361
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:06,893
I would,

362
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:09,469
made

363
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:28,700
talk about

364
00:46:50,715 --> 00:47:02,981
If I had to do it all over again and we had infinite budget and time, boy, it would be cool to, like, have, like, PlayStation Touch interface stuff, like, strum properly up, down, and tap to play single things.

365
00:47:03,522 --> 00:47:05,523
But I also feel like that might be very awkward to hold.

366
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:06,063
I don't know.

367
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:08,344
I have not played around with that very much.

368
00:47:08,364 --> 00:47:10,685
It would be cool to have an even more granular thing.

369
00:47:11,106 --> 00:47:17,229
But if you did that, I feel like you also wouldn't get the half-step and chord shift, you know, with the bumpers.

370
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:25,565
So the answer is, I hope I never have to do it again, but I'm really happy with how it worked.

371
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:26,167
It'll be great.

372
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,908
Thank you so much.

373
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:28,276
Yes, hello.

374
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:29,377
Hi, yeah, thank you.

375
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:30,178
This was a great talk.

376
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:37,504
This, like, kind of tickled both the ethnomusicology background side and the music theory side of my brains, which is, or my brain, which was really awesome.

377
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:44,109
I love, like, musicology is one of my favorite things and, like, ethnomusicology is super fascinating, you know.

378
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:54,158
Learning about the music of other cultures and then trying to, you know, take that and learn from it and also, like, incorporate it is super neat.

379
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:55,719
So this was a fun project because of that.

380
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:56,259
Totally.

381
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,000
So my question is kind of along those lines.

382
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:13,130
I have a background in ethnomusicology and there's a lot of discourse in that field about representation and who we're kind of centering and how we're engaging with research and researchers and the folks that we're trying to represent.

383
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:19,454
As you mentioned at the beginning, I'm wondering if you encounter, you know, all of that takes so much time, right?

384
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:22,596
I'm wondering if you encountered any issues with

385
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:46,378
Timelines pushing back against the need for quality research and kind of how if you did how you navigated that and advocated for the answer is Not really like because I got into it so early in the game was so early that I was basically I basically like I had it I had a test piece and that I had this image in my mind of like this is the melody of this of this main theme and

386
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:55,724
And then, like, my general, so my go-to when I start a new project is I usually try to figure out what the palette is that I'm working with.

387
00:48:56,364 --> 00:49:03,849
And the way I do that is I usually have a main theme idea that is, you know, like, or the main character has a theme, and that's the idea that I go with.

388
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:07,391
And I try to build the palette around that.

389
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:08,412
talk talk talk

390
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:29,872
I abhor wasting time.

391
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:34,634
So I want to do it right the first time, or do a little bit of it, find out it's not right, and then redirect.

392
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:43,637
And in this case, I was in so early that I was able to spend that time finding the correct thing and doing all the research that was required.

393
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:54,620
The only thing I was pushing up against or pushing back against was just my own time for like, you know, because as a freelance composer, you're rarely working on one project.

394
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,061
I think I had like three going at the same time.

395
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:57,561
And so it was like,

396
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:58,863
on

397
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:14,601
talk talk

398
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:38,644
Yes, this is the glue, this is the sauce that brings it all together.

399
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:48,568
So really, the only thing I was pushing up against was my own feeling of revving my engine while the parking brake is on and not going anywhere.

400
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,329
I'm like, surely, eventually I'll get it, and then finally getting it.

401
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:53,490
So yeah.

402
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,970
talk

403
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:16,648
Yes, hello again.

404
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:33,673
Hearing your talk, it sounded like you and possibly the lead developer, I'm not exactly sure what their role was, worked very closely in tandem to get this going.

405
00:51:33,853 --> 00:51:37,874
I guess as someone who normally works with session musicians and hires, you know, folks,

406
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:46,550
diving into a realm where it's a country where, you know, where you're dealing with a language that you don't speak, how

407
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:54,139
um... could this have been as successful if without the aid of your developer in this?

408
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,043
Do you feel like you could have done... I guess I think of most composers not really needing the director's aid to get this done.

409
00:52:00,064 --> 00:52:01,284
It's kind of like, what do you need me to do?

410
00:52:01,425 --> 00:52:02,586
Okay, I can do all of it.

411
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:10,512
But it sounds like a lot of this was like a partnership in terms of help and aid from the... It really was, it was like, it was like passing a gate check.

412
00:52:10,572 --> 00:52:12,393
It was like, you gotta like, you know, if you ever

413
00:52:13,514 --> 00:52:13,614
of

414
00:52:38,158 --> 00:53:01,708
and what we needed to have for the sound that he wasn't really sure what it needed to be but he knew what it was not and he had some references and he had like choral references from like uh like the choirs the melanesian choirs and like the thin red line soundtrack for example and things like that like that is stuff that you get over there these you know church choir traditions from you know that come out of like uh you know like uh out of like uh you know uh

415
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:31,043
You know Catholic Church missionaries heading over and and teaching people how to sing and that kind of stuff So we knew knew anyone some of that stuff in there We knew you know, we had these other influences that we wanted to have in in in the score but it really was a matter of like, you know working with Phil or really checking with Phil to see if I Had gotten it to where it needed to be You know as someone who's from there and knows the kind of stuff to see if I was replicating it correctly I think like one of the final

416
00:53:31,903 --> 00:53:54,646
tricks sounds and this sounds real weird and wild was instead of using any like for our mock-ups instead of using any choir sample libraries was singing all the parts myself in the kind of vocal timbre straight tone kind of very bright forward sound that you hear uh in in a lot of that music

417
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:56,687
And that was it.

418
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:57,567
That was the final thing.

419
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:00,829
I was like, ah, that's the choir sound that I want.

420
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,992
It was like crossing that little Rubicon where you're like, oh, we've got this.

421
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:11,415
And then when we actually had the real people come in and sing it, it was a billion times better, obviously.

422
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:15,618
But yeah, it was very much a collaborative process.

423
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:21,441
But I try to collaborate pretty closely with all the directors that I've worked with, especially when it is something

424
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:23,846
Thank you very much.

425
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:48,095
It's not so much a question, just an observation of something you said.

426
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:55,582
That particular rhythm takes place within about 10 beats per minute every time it shows up.

427
00:54:56,803 --> 00:55:03,770
This happens in Balinese gamelan music, where there are specific rhythms that only appear at certain tempos.

428
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,971
And it's really interesting because it really builds that identity of the music.

429
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:09,272
It's knowing that that happens.

430
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,032
It's like everybody knows that.

431
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:16,694
When it shifts gears, it's like, oh, when it goes here and comes up here, it's this rhythm at this tempo for this amount of time.

432
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:24,057
And there's a recognizable, and we don't get this so much in Western music, of that rhythmic identity that you hear in other things.

433
00:55:24,097 --> 00:55:27,278
So I just wanted to pull that out a little bit if you want to talk about that some more.

434
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:27,498
for

435
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:43,869
talk.

436
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:06,590
You know, you get that in, like, Latin jazz, you know?

437
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:12,633
Like, if you have, like, that clave, the clave part, if you slow it way down, it's super strange, it doesn't feel right.

438
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:22,797
You know, like, there's a lot of stuff where there is a pocket that this rhythm, that this identity exists in, and outside that pocket, it starts to... it doesn't have the character that you want it to have.

439
00:56:23,377 --> 00:56:29,721
And so, like, that was the thing, like, realizing, like, the Pilou rhythm was the thing that really persisted and is in everything.

440
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:34,964
And a lot of the dance stuff is built with that pulse, but then everything else happens around it.

441
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:40,667
Like, one of the challenges that actually, you're making me... Do you mind if I spin a, like, a random, like, side digression here from this?

442
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:49,692
One of the fun bits in the game is, one of the music sequences is a Pilou ceremony, is a dance, and it is incredibly...

443
00:56:50,532 --> 00:57:06,173
beautifully choreographed thing and having watched just dozens and dozens of Examples of this stuff by this point it was like I need to replicate all of the elements that are in play here For like two and a half minutes

444
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:07,834
talk talk

445
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:54,771
I say animators, I think really it was like one person doing all that because we were a team of 12 people, you know, going back and like building the people playing drum, like the log drum on a rack, pounding the bamboo on the ground, playing wanjeps and doing, you know, sonai stomps and stuff like that in time with the music that I wrote to match what was happening in the score, in the diegetic score after the fact was a wild and cool thing to see.

446
00:57:55,211 --> 00:58:18,085
but it was also like this is the final test can I make effectively something that is mostly you know improvised around a form that everybody knows who does this stuff can I do that authentically and then you know and then weave that into score as the scene goes along was a super difficult challenge to make happen and I'm really proud of how it came out and like

447
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:19,005
talk talk

448
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:40,487
into video games, into front and center, was a really moving thing.

449
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:45,428
It was incredibly touching, and knowing that I guess I'd done it right.

450
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,449
That's the confirmation, I guess.

451
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,930
And it felt really cool to see that sort of thing.

452
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:53,730
So anyway, that's my weird digression.

453
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:58,171
I didn't have anywhere to put that in the talk, and it felt weird to just staple it in.

454
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,632
But thanks.

455
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:00,372
Anyhow, any other questions?

456
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:02,651
Cool.

457
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:06,361
We are with 32 seconds to go.

458
00:59:06,762 --> 00:59:07,384
We are done.
