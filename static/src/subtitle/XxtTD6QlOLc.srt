1
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:06,335
And again, thank you all so much for coming out.

2
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,877
So by way of introductions, my name is Leah Shinkiewski.

3
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:11,798
I'm the producer for the Dragon Age Keep.

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,120
I've been on the project, really I joined BioWare

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,723
to help build the Keep, and it's just been an amazing project

6
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:20,924
and something I've been incredibly passionate about.

7
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:24,787
So really happy to represent and kind of talk to you today

8
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:25,467
about the Keep.

9
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:29,429
So in terms of what we'll learn, really the focus of this

10
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:32,090
is to tackle the technical cross-platform challenge

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,932
and kind of how our team at BioWare got around this,

12
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,593
as well as we really feel like we created

13
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,774
an amazing web experience for players

14
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,635
and something that we hope that you can also accomplish

15
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,176
no matter what size your team is.

16
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,378
We were a relatively small internal team at BioWare

17
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:50,799
in the online services department.

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,661
as well as work with your community to develop better products with a built-in following.

19
00:00:56,062 --> 00:01:01,284
So we actually had a community beta program that really took us from what was an idea

20
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,426
or concept and helped us get there.

21
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:06,967
So we'll kind of give you some tools and tips as to how we did that.

22
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,710
So in terms of the presentation outline,

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,133
we'll take you through sort of the driving force behind this

24
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,915
and choice and why choice matters

25
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,517
and why we decided to tackle this

26
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,101
and how we went through this looking at the Save Game

27
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,844
Challenge, developing what we call the World Vault, which

28
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:24,287
is the system that stores all those plot choices.

29
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:25,849
for the future.

30
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,913
As well, the franchise ecosystem is another piece

31
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,115
that we'd like to talk about.

32
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:34,959
It's kind of the way that we started to look at

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,982
both the challenge and then translate it

34
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:39,745
into the player experience using the tapestry

35
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,027
and the interactive story summary.

36
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,048
The Keep has a few more features,

37
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,070
but this is kind of the focus of our presentation.

38
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,052
As well, we'll take you through our community beta program

39
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,914
and kind of show you how the Keep progressed

40
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:51,954
with that feedback.

41
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,597
And then just some closing thoughts to wrap up.

42
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,578
So, let's get started.

43
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:58,779
Choice matters.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,362
So, for a bit of background, I want to talk about choice.

45
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:06,929
Choice is really a key pillar for bioware games and RPG games in general, and Dragon

46
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,612
Age is no exception to this.

47
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:14,578
So over hundreds of hours of gameplay, players have shaped and become very attached to their

48
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:15,519
Dragon Age universe.

49
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,342
And historically, all these choices have been stored

50
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,365
in a single local save game file.

51
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,048
I love this quote because it kind of looks at

52
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,070
how difficult it was to make decisions

53
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,914
across the franchises, and really how much emotion

54
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:31,837
and meaning people put into the choices being made.

55
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:35,061
So that really brings us to the save game challenge.

56
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:36,643
But first, a bit of history.

57
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:42,586
So Dragon Age Origins launched in 2009, and we had 2010,

58
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,386
Awakenings came out.

59
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,848
But then finally, when we started on Dragon Age 2,

60
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,829
is where, oops, sorry.

61
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,010
These transitions are a little finicky.

62
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:55,265
Okay, go.

63
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:55,905
Yes.

64
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,148
So starting on Dragon Age 2 is when the challenges

65
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,389
really began to show up.

66
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,051
It quickly became apparent that there were problems

67
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:06,213
in the save import system and that it was impossible

68
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,294
to obviously move to a new platform.

69
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:11,497
Characters that should have been dead magically reappeared,

70
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,538
the choices you made were overturned,

71
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,880
and really it's the import logic that was

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,842
kind of the Achilles heel of the system.

73
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,927
And of course, this made fans somewhat upset.

74
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,869
And over hundreds of hours of gameplay,

75
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,030
that makes a lot of sense.

76
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,393
So what we wanted to do is look at traditional save game

77
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:31,875
import and say, OK, what are the problems here?

78
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,157
Well, first off, errors are inevitable.

79
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:36,479
Here's kind of the mapping of the plot.

80
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,782
Actually, it's sort of one of the clusters of the plot systems, and it's incredibly complex,

81
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:48,684
very difficult to QA, and really, fixes require patches to the client. So, you know, players may

82
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:52,526
not take the patches, different things like that, and really, at the end of the day,

83
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,568
there's no guarantee that we won't introduce further knock-ons into the system.

84
00:03:57,548 --> 00:04:01,730
So that's why when Dragon Age Inquisition was coming out,

85
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,091
we thought that we needed to look forward for a better solution

86
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:09,713
and really preserve that investment that our fans have made into the franchise.

87
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:14,416
The really big problem for us came with the launch of the next-gen consoles,

88
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,737
meaning that as players switched to new ones,

89
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,898
those choices, all that investment would be left behind.

90
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:22,719
And that's where we came with the world vault.

91
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,179
So like I said, the import logic was really

92
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,600
the Achilles heel of the system.

93
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,481
And solving this through a normal save import system

94
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,762
was merely going to create the same types of problems.

95
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,923
So the challenge for our team was

96
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,864
to build a future-proof solution.

97
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,941
something that would preserve our players' data

98
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,863
after sunset of the different games,

99
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,125
or you lose a particular console,

100
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:45,486
or just decide to switch over,

101
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:49,390
as well as we needed the ability to support any platform

102
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,192
and multiple clients.

103
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:53,214
And I'll talk a little bit about

104
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:55,377
kind of the concept of the franchise ecosystem

105
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,118
and why we wanted to be able to support

106
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,179
all these different things.

107
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:04,161
So here's kind of what the world vault looks like at its basic.

108
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,884
So what we did was we worked with the game team

109
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:10,367
to identify key choices against all the different games

110
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,430
from Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Inquisition.

111
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,831
Then we coupled that with the plot logic and the rules

112
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:17,952
behind each of them.

113
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:21,715
And then we created a technology called the autosolver.

114
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,738
This was the ability to solve for plot conflicts.

115
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,900
So essentially what it does is it looks at

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,462
what choices players are making and says,

117
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:31,644
okay, well you can't make this particular choice,

118
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:34,607
but let me find the next available option for you.

119
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,725
This is what we all combined into what's called the world vault.

120
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,787
And the key here is that no matter what players do,

121
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,909
they always have a valid world state,

122
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,831
so they can't get into kind of a weird position

123
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,434
where there's import errors and different things like that.

124
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:55,058
Finally, what we needed was for clients to be able to read what they care about.

125
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,541
So if you created a different companion experience

126
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,683
or you're looking at importing into Dragon Age Inquisition,

127
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:05,604
that game or that client only reads what they care about.

128
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:08,065
So we can have any number of these,

129
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,225
and we'll show you when we get

130
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,645
to the interactive story summary,

131
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,305
kind of how we manage to pull that off.

132
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:17,106
But here's our system diagram.

133
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,486
So really to solve for all this,

134
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,587
the World Vault needed to abstract the logic

135
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:21,827
and the choices from the clients,

136
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,087
and we moved them into the web.

137
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:26,108
So for us, we have a system called Orbit,

138
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:28,288
and it stores all of our online systems,

139
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,068
of which the World Vault is one of them.

140
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,870
So both the game and the keep read and write to orbit.

141
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,371
And that way, when we need to make changes to the plot system

142
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,053
or the logic, we can do so outside of the game client,

143
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,894
which gives us a ton of flexibility in fixing errors.

144
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,876
And moving forward, we can use different experiences

145
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,617
to tie in from this perspective.

146
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,343
So when we look at the world vault and how the plot flags in the solver work,

147
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:59,507
I'll kind of give you a bit more of a tangible example. It's simplified a little bit, but we

148
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:04,151
have, if you're trying to figure out, let's say, what happened to the warden at the end of Dragon

149
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:09,015
Age Origins, it's going to depend on a few different plots. Again, this is a simplified

150
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,759
example, but we have who killed the archdemon. It could have been the warden, Alistair Loghain.

151
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,659
And did Morgan have a baby?

152
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,580
No.

153
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,200
Yes, with the warden, with Alistair, with Logain.

154
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,681
So in order to make this valid, we

155
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,902
have to figure out these preconditions.

156
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:28,263
So if the warden ended up sacrificing him or herself,

157
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,543
the warden couldn't have had a baby with Morgan.

158
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:32,844
Obviously, gender also has an impact on this.

159
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,285
But if the warden's alive or well,

160
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,506
Then Morgan didn't have a baby,

161
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,408
and either Alistair or Logain killed the archdemon.

162
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:45,112
So to kind of make this a little bit easier to see,

163
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,594
this is how we took it into the keep,

164
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:52,117
and it should show you basically how the autosolver works

165
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:54,539
to take those rules and precondition logic

166
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,601
and say, okay, I'll find you an example

167
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,762
of what we need to do next.

168
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,805
So here I'm just selecting Alistair.

169
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,986
You can see that it wants to change the state of my warden

170
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:06,967
if I make that choice.

171
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,068
But you can say, no, I don't want to do that,

172
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,669
and my warden remains dead.

173
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,451
But if you go back and decide to say, OK,

174
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,452
I'd like to change my warden to alive and well,

175
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,674
it's going to ask for Alistair to be killing the archdemon.

176
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:23,516
It could also have low gain, but Auto Solver

177
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,557
finds the least path of resistance

178
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:26,417
when it's doing this.

179
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,857
So now when you look and we add the Morgan baby question in,

180
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,579
I can go ahead and select that.

181
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,901
And it's going to say, OK, great, you can do that.

182
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,463
But your warden is going to then sacrifice to the archdemon.

183
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,065
And if I accept that, you can see

184
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,947
that it's now changed the warden to being alive and well.

185
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:48,388
and the archdemon to being killed by the warden.

186
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:51,309
So what this means is that players can essentially make

187
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,190
one or 300 choices across all the different franchises

188
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,411
and the world state is always valid and intact.

189
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,352
So this was a really great example of how we kind of took

190
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:04,852
the

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,604
world vault and then made it translatable and have something that other people can use

192
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:19,428
and sort of easier to understand. But we first had to kind of look at the results of the

193
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:24,252
world vault and that the client no longer needs to do any logical calculations to figure

194
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:28,034
this out. So that means that players are able to use their saved game on any platform.

195
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:31,627
as well as carry over what's important to the franchise.

196
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,330
The logic is independent of the client,

197
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,852
which is a big bonus,

198
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,535
as well as the autosolver can manage

199
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,337
any knock-ons and dependencies,

200
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,780
and we have the ability to update that on the web.

201
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:47,323
So when we take a look, choices really do matter to people.

202
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:50,204
And I kind of like this quote because it

203
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:53,286
says that whether they're small things you're capturing

204
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,907
or larger things, that this makes a difference for people

205
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:57,928
and their experience with the game.

206
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,469
So that kind of brings us to our concept

207
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,930
of the franchise ecosystem.

208
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,450
So really.

209
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:06,565
The strength of Dragon Age as a franchise exists not only in the games, the story,

210
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:10,508
the choices that you make, but in all the other experiences across the franchise.

211
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,172
We have comic books, novels, the fantastic little plush Mumbari hounds,

212
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:19,496
and we have a really amazing active community devoted to this franchise.

213
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,439
So really, when we took a look at developing the features for the Keep,

214
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,041
it's really about respecting the things that have come before.

215
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,282
which fans have made an investment in.

216
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,624
And out of the cross-platform challenge

217
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:33,666
came the opportunity for us to preserve our fans'

218
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:36,648
investment, engagement, and emotional connection

219
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,969
across the franchises.

220
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,731
So I'll show you really quickly our,

221
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,333
kind of our Keep trailer, something that we came out with

222
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,895
to show off what the Keep's all about.

223
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:49,137
And I'll press play.

224
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:50,938
Hopefully it works.

225
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:55,301
["Keep on Kooing"]

226
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,108
You're probably asking yourself, what is the keep?

227
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,713
It's your way to discover, shape, and share your Dragon Age experience as you obsess over

228
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,096
more than 300 choices from the previous two games.

229
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:14,341
Ensure your Thedas is exactly as you left it, only maybe this time you're a dwarf and

230
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:15,242
your hawk was sassy.

231
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:16,563
You can do that.

232
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,183
And because it's a free web app, you can use it on your console, PC, tablet, phone,

233
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:26,566
or really any device with an HTML5 capable browser and an internet connection.

234
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,208
Sorry, potatoes.

235
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,951
Sit back and listen as Brian Bloom, the voice of Varric, recounts major events from Thedas.

236
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,393
Where you stood by and did nothing like a little logame.

237
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:40,256
Or maybe you're a goody two-shoes and like to help people.

238
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:41,697
That's your call.

239
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:46,320
Then, after everything is set, you can import it into Dragon Age Inquisition.

240
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,222
And that's it! Now you're ready to play on your platform of choice.

241
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:52,886
So, you know...

242
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:54,850
Go play it.

243
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:03,377
Great, so that kind of takes you through some of,

244
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,018
more of our high-level features,

245
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:07,120
but we really push for being available

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,302
on all different devices using responsive design,

247
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:14,005
and I think that was a really big bonus for us

248
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,707
in terms of the future-proofing of the solution

249
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:17,928
and having this available.

250
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:22,914
So in terms of the tapestry, which you kind of got a look at before,

251
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,539
this is really the cornerstone of the World Vault

252
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,784
and how we translated this into the user experience.

253
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:35,151
So for us, the big challenge on this one was to allow players to customize their world states.

254
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,115
make conflicts and knock-ons less confusing to navigate,

255
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,897
as for new players to the franchise

256
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:42,338
or people who are less familiar

257
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,980
with the intricacies of this,

258
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,162
this would be incredibly difficult to manage,

259
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,985
as well as create an experience, not a tool,

260
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:52,248
and cater to new and existing fans.

261
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,990
So something we really wanted to do

262
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,973
is make sure that this was easy to use

263
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:58,274
by a whole bunch of people.

264
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:04,740
So, this is the very first look at what it was like to interact with the World Vault.

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,542
It was a series of check boxes.

266
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:12,568
It's not very user-friendly or intuitive, and players who might not remember their choices

267
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,451
would have probably a difficult time navigating this.

268
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:21,573
So in the process, we worked with an external company,

269
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:25,755
WorkItPlay, to help us look at how to get this off the ground.

270
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,935
And we came up with some ideas.

271
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,356
We did some research on this.

272
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,677
And this is really similar to, I think, how many people

273
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:32,917
would go about developing it.

274
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:36,898
We did prototyping, so tested it with users,

275
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,519
as well as development when we were finally

276
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,400
OK with some of the mechanics and how this was going to work.

277
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:46,111
When we refined the concept, we added the art in,

278
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:47,711
it made a massive difference.

279
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,473
But then we needed to go to the beta program.

280
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,694
And this was really because we hadn't solved

281
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,935
all the challenges that we had with this feature.

282
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,117
When you look at it, it may be somewhat simple,

283
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,378
but it was very complex to navigate,

284
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:02,399
it was hard to understand,

285
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:04,560
and we knew that we needed to reach out to our fans

286
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,161
to say, how can we make this better,

287
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,322
and what can we do to really make this

288
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:10,843
your story in your world?

289
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,868
So with the tapestry in this very early stage,

290
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,249
we knew we were on the right track,

291
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,771
that the complex logic was simplified to the player,

292
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,411
whereas in the checklist version,

293
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:25,153
this was not something we could easily simplify,

294
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:28,274
as well as the imagery aided in the memory of the plot.

295
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,255
So it was kind of an extra benefit,

296
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:31,996
but something that made a big difference.

297
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,160
And we were able to take what was developed and start the beta program.

298
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,946
And I think that as a smaller team, this was a huge benefit to us, to get something to

299
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:45,611
a point where it was stood up enough that players could understand what we were trying

300
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,595
to get at and then hopefully push it forward.

301
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,392
So when we had sort of our initial beta feedback,

302
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,494
first impression survey, what we found was that

303
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,136
people thought it was a lot more than they expected.

304
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,058
They did think we were going to have a list of check boxes.

305
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:02,580
And they were really impressed by the art style.

306
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,821
I think that stood out beyond kind of

307
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,964
the initial feedback we got was some of the biggest pieces.

308
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,239
Now in terms of the interactive story summary,

309
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,481
this is kind of why we needed to make this feature.

310
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,084
This is the total number of valid world states

311
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,905
that you're able to create in the keep.

312
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,926
There are so many of them.

313
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:23,207
I think we did calculations.

314
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,788
There's no way that you can just sit through

315
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,149
and do this all by yourself.

316
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,353
So for us, the challenge was to really help people get caught up on the Dragon Age story so far,

317
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:36,375
as well as set a few high-level choices in real time.

318
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:41,738
We needed it to work across modern browsers and devices without using plugins.

319
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:43,559
This was a big thing for us.

320
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,302
As you saw, we wanted to target responsive design, have this work on all these devices,

321
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:53,065
and having animations like this in the browser is, of course, technically quite challenging.

322
00:15:53,805 --> 00:16:00,232
We also had, we wanted to be localized in eight different languages with French, German audio.

323
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:05,057
This is because this is sort of what Dragon Age Inquisition did and we wanted to match them.

324
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:08,039
Again, it was quite the technical challenge.

325
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,643
So we came up with the experience that we wanted to have for this.

326
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,807
And that was that people would basically see an introduction module.

327
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:20,894
then they would be able to edit their decisions in real time when playing it.

328
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,639
So if they decided that they wanted to go with what the world vault had already set,

329
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,863
or how their world state was already set up, they could do that.

330
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:31,728
And if not, if they would play the introduction again.

331
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,450
versus the outcome.

332
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,310
So it was really quite simple,

333
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,691
but the reason that we did this,

334
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,212
and then it moved on to the next module, Introduction,

335
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,374
but the reason that we did this was because in the future,

336
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:46,336
as these modules expand, we can take and remove them out,

337
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:49,257
and this gives us a ton of flexibility going forward

338
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,158
to ensure that our interactive story summary

339
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,179
doesn't become three hours when new games come out.

340
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,901
So the process for this was a little bit simpler

341
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,001
than the tapestry.

342
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,582
We really knew what we wanted, and we

343
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,183
were able to develop the script, create art assets,

344
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:07,584
set up the ISS in the world vault with those filters,

345
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:11,286
provide the API endpoints to our external development

346
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,386
team at G-Skinner.

347
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,267
And then they were able to help us

348
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,008
create the player and the animations,

349
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,888
and we integrated it back into the key.

350
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,310
This was really valuable for us as a smaller team

351
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,591
because what we could do was continue to work on development

352
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,712
while people created experiences

353
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,414
based on what was in the world vault.

354
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,275
This was really very, very helpful for us,

355
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,276
and the hardest part was really integrating it

356
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,997
back into the keep at the end of the day,

357
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:39,018
but we were very, very happy with the outcome.

358
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:41,019
So here's a quick video demonstration.

359
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,921
All the animations are done HTML5 using vector images.

360
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,243
and you're able to edit all the choices in real time.

361
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:52,245
So I'll show you a quick example of how this works.

362
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,186
You're able to press play.

363
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,967
If you believe the stories,

364
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:00,729
mankind's pride gave rise to the darkspawn.

365
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,811
With the traitorous Loghain now seated

366
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:05,292
on Ferelden's throne,

367
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,953
the warden sought help from the influential

368
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:09,594
Arl Eamon of Redcliffe.

369
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:19,768
However, they arrived in Redcliffe to find the town under siege, as each night, undead rose in waves and assailed the battered village.

370
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:30,258
With the heroes' help, the people of Redcliffe stood fast against the undead horde.

371
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,861
The Wardens reached October.

372
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:40,941
So you can see there that players are able to make choices in real time, and then it adjusts what's on the tapestry.

373
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:43,062
So the two things kind of talk to each other.

374
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:45,984
So we learned a few lessons when we were developing this.

375
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:50,808
One, that integrating with the World Vault is straightforward and it allows for standalone development.

376
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:56,932
That means that in the future, other types of companion experiences or products can hook into the World Vault,

377
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:00,595
and it makes it very easy to sort of extend what we're able to do.

378
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:05,178
The player technology can easily be adapted for future needs,

379
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,400
as well as we were able to hit our technical challenges

380
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,962
with loading in the browser, working on consoles,

381
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,503
and that was a big feat.

382
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,565
And the Varrick narration was a big hit with fans.

383
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,887
This was one of the things that in our early beta program,

384
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,009
people kind of called out and speculated

385
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,670
that we would do a feature like this and said,

386
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,571
wouldn't it be great if Varrick narrated it?

387
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:26,933
And then when we ended up coming out with that,

388
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:28,554
it was just so exciting and something

389
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,695
we were really glad to see.

390
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:33,336
So in terms of this, it's really a nice quote.

391
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:38,437
Our intention originally was to help fans kind of brush up on the events of Dragon Age,

392
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:43,479
but what we found was that people loved having their story narrated by Varric, so actually

393
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,360
being able to have it personalized and customized was really big.

394
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,181
And then what we also found was that people would really want to customize their tapestries.

395
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,602
and then watch the interactive story summary

396
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,944
as a type of introduction to Dragon Age Inquisition.

397
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,705
So we found that this feature,

398
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,706
although we kind of wanted to solve one thing,

399
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:05,688
we ended up really answering to a few different use cases.

400
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:09,070
And that kind of brings us to our community beta program.

401
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,091
So while the ISS was underdeveloped,

402
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,173
we took the features that we already had in the keep,

403
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:17,194
the tapestry, we had a hero section, a career section,

404
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,396
and we started on our community beta.

405
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,397
And like I said, this was very early on in our process.

406
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,837
I think we were about eight, 10 months to shipping out

407
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,058
when we just kind of had the idea for what

408
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:28,258
we wanted the keep to be.

409
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,398
And to do this, we knew that we needed

410
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,939
to get valuable feedback from a variety of fans.

411
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,999
And we wanted to ensure that we were

412
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,460
able to really work in an agile fashion

413
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,241
and adapt to what we were hearing.

414
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:43,421
And this kind of was a challenge for our team,

415
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,382
but something that was really big

416
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,602
was that we were able to respond and do something

417
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,563
with what feedback we were hearing.

418
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:54,868
The other thing we wanted to look at was being able to manage the feedback with a small team.

419
00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:02,276
Again, you could get lots of feedback in, so having, we have one QA lead, basically looking at all these things was quite difficult.

420
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:05,019
As well as preparing for load at launch.

421
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,472
So we designed kind of a beta onboarding flow

422
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:10,374
that might look a little bit complicated,

423
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,936
but I think it worked really well for what we were doing.

424
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,598
So what we asked people to do was log on,

425
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:18,661
sign up to the Keap beta, and once they were accepted,

426
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,884
they would log on to this site, they would accept the NDA,

427
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:25,286
and then we would have them basically move over

428
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,348
to the BioWare forums, where we prepared

429
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:28,970
kind of a welcome post that talked about.

430
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,486
you know, what the beta program was about,

431
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:35,729
the different expectations we had, how to give feedback.

432
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,470
So it was really kind of an introduction

433
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,671
to what we were looking for.

434
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,613
And I highly suggest if you're doing a beta program

435
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,634
or something similar to kind of have something like this

436
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,176
out there to help people set the tone

437
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:48,258
and why you're doing this program.

438
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,780
Then after you got to read a whole big,

439
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:56,040
introduction post, we asked you to confirm your participation.

440
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,542
And this may seem like an extra step, but we really wanted people to know

441
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:04,004
what we were asking of them and let them know that, you know, if you want to

442
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:07,745
participate, that's great. If you don't, that's totally fine too.

443
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,106
So from there, we have this wait step.

444
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,067
And this step was mainly for our team.

445
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:14,888
And I'll show you in the next slide

446
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:18,849
kind of how we needed this step to help us onboard people

447
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,409
onto the Keep while making sure that we could still

448
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,730
do regular releases.

449
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,410
And once you finish the wait step,

450
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,191
you'd receive a welcome email.

451
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:31,232
And then you'd be able to access the Keep and the beta forums.

452
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:35,813
So these tools we really used to help people kind of get

453
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:36,613
into the flow.

454
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:38,214
It kept our team.

455
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,836
freed up to make sure that we didn't get too many people

456
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,678
all at once signing up and coming in.

457
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,899
So this was really, really important to us.

458
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,401
So for our process, we used Agile development

459
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,403
and we went in two week release cycles.

460
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,025
So every two weeks we would try and put out

461
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,165
something new on the keep,

462
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:59,067
as well as we would do cohort based invites.

463
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,929
So we would look at everyone who would apply,

464
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,170
look at how far along the keep was,

465
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,712
and then invite them in based on specific criteria.

466
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,134
We also used open discussions.

467
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:11,155
This was all done on the BioWare forums.

468
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:13,637
So these kind of changed and took shape

469
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:15,958
as we moved forward in the process.

470
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:19,420
And we also needed entire dev team involvement.

471
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,702
So our team actively participated on the forums

472
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:26,044
with the beta participants to say,

473
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:27,465
okay, what do you think of this?

474
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:28,866
And really got involved.

475
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,787
This was something our team loved doing

476
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,489
and it was incredibly rewarding and positive.

477
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,852
So when we looked at kind of how our week broke out,

478
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:38,774
because we were doing these two week cycles,

479
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:41,937
on Tuesday we would always try and hit our release,

480
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,199
where we would post our release notes,

481
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,322
we would start new open discussions,

482
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:48,103
and close out old open discussions.

483
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:50,806
So our open discussions would be around things like.

484
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:52,747
How do you think we can improve this?

485
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:55,789
Or in this particular section, what would you like to see here?

486
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,490
And they were more of a guideline to say, you know,

487
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,932
how would we like to get feedback and really help us move our sort

488
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,273
of development roadmap in the right direction.

489
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,374
And then we would close off discussions

490
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,934
that we didn't want to have anymore.

491
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:17,980
Then we would send out invites to participants and announce them, typically on Twitter.

492
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,904
And then the next week we would start onboarding all of our new participants, as well as collecting

493
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,625
feedback and adjusting priorities.

494
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:31,488
So if we would see major bugs come up or things similar to that, we would investigate using

495
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:36,752
typically surveys or things like that to say, okay, who's having problems, how can we get

496
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:37,332
a hold of you?

497
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,105
as well we would monitor for different feedback

498
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,251
and trends we were seeing.

499
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,194
So when we looked at getting feedback,

500
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,734
we used a beta feedback button in the keep.

501
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,575
This was to allow us to have continuous feedback

502
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:50,715
and feedback in the moment.

503
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,156
And I'll show you in the next slide

504
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:53,756
kind of how this worked for us.

505
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:57,817
We also used the BioWare forms very heavily

506
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,898
to have our open discussions,

507
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:02,538
but we always kept them fairly restricted

508
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:05,319
in terms of what participants were allowed to do.

509
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,219
They weren't allowed to create their own discussions.

510
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,360
And this really helped us keep control

511
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,600
of sort of the scope of everything.

512
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,021
As well, we used Google Analytics.

513
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:15,382
It was a great tool for us,

514
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:18,103
mainly just to monitor site traffic,

515
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:19,904
do some comparisons,

516
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:22,585
and then surveys when we needed them.

517
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:24,386
We didn't do them too often,

518
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:26,787
but it was more to collect additional insights.

519
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,909
We needed a dedicated email account for troubleshooting.

520
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:34,545
We also installed a roll gating system on the keep.

521
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,906
This helped us with a few different things,

522
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:39,448
but one of them is that we can allow different cohorts

523
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,229
the ability to see different features

524
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,370
as they were going through beta.

525
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,091
So if we knew something was gonna be

526
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:47,713
particularly troublesome, or maybe we needed

527
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:49,815
a little bit more help on certain areas,

528
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,857
we wouldn't release them as broadly,

529
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,659
but we would take small feedback, get the bugs fixed,

530
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,241
and then release it larger out.

531
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:03,298
Finally, we had a Twitter and a Twitch account.

532
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,039
This was really important for us,

533
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:08,360
both as we got towards launch and we started to need

534
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,621
to communicate quite a bit more in terms of

535
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,322
where the keep was, what was happening,

536
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,942
and it gave us, especially Twitch,

537
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:18,723
a vehicle for people to ask questions,

538
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,904
us to demo features while we were still in beta,

539
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:24,165
and I think that gave us a bit of a jumpstart

540
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:26,986
on what to do when we got to launch,

541
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,607
the kind of questions to expect and the trouble to expect.

542
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:32,735
So here's kind of the beta feedback button.

543
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,616
And the really great thing about this button

544
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:38,297
was it allowed our participants to give us feedback

545
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,958
kind of at any point in time.

546
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:43,399
So they were able to select feedback from the menu.

547
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,759
And then what you would do is be able to select

548
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,600
specific feedback and choose an area on the keep

549
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,741
that you wanted to let us know about.

550
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:54,543
So from there, we had this little emotional indicator,

551
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,464
which we used quite a bit to help us find things

552
00:26:57,504 --> 00:27:00,426
that weren't as good, or things that people were liking.

553
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:04,108
As well, we were able to segment our feedback

554
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:06,089
based on the types of things that we saw

555
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:08,130
that people were giving us, and this really helped us

556
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,851
in terms of scalability on the feedback.

557
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:13,473
So you're able to select the different things

558
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:15,434
that you wanted to tell us about.

559
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,677
And then we would get them all kind of on the back end

560
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,461
of the keep and we kept a dashboard running up at our office

561
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,882
showing all the different feedback

562
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:25,704
that was coming in continuously.

563
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,207
So this was incredibly helpful for us,

564
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,651
even to take things like localization feedback.

565
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:34,413
And it was one of the bigger things

566
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,494
that we used on the keep.

567
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:41,836
So this was sort of the culture that developed around the beta program that was something

568
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:44,757
that we really wanted to make feel truly collaborative.

569
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:49,398
We wanted to listen to people and make sure that their ideas got integrated into the keep.

570
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:54,659
The team actively posted and communicated in release updates about what we'd heard and

571
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,999
how the team addressed it.

572
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,620
And when we didn't, we weren't able to fix things, we let people know why.

573
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,565
So in terms of our beta program phases,

574
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,947
each phase was designed to help us get the most

575
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,248
out of where we were in development.

576
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,770
So during alpha, we had a lot of things

577
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,313
that we just needed people to help us give an idea

578
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,655
of how to close them off, how to make them better.

579
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:15,876
One of the big suggestion changes

580
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:19,259
that came out of this phase was helping us solve conflicts.

581
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,201
We talked about an open discussion,

582
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:23,603
and someone said, well, why don't you just show

583
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:25,204
the things that I've changed?

584
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,647
instead of an entire giant list of everything you've changed.

585
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,550
And this really helped us completely solve a problem

586
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,372
that we'd had since the very beginning.

587
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:36,133
So I think during our alpha phase,

588
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,514
this is really what we looked for.

589
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,136
We had limited participation, so we could kind of

590
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:41,537
be very hands-on.

591
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:44,240
And we hadn't firmed up our development roadmaps,

592
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,001
so there was lots of room to move and shift.

593
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,462
We started our Twitter account about this time,

594
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,523
and we also introduced a Talk About the Keep program.

595
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,604
So while we were in beta, the Keep was under NDA.

596
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:57,404
We asked people not to share pictures,

597
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:59,485
don't talk about it publicly.

598
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:02,405
But if people wanted to, they could contact us and say,

599
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:05,606
I have a blog, a YouTube channel, and I'd really like to do this.

600
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,486
And we would just work with them to make sure

601
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,627
that that was something we were okay and we could put out.

602
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:13,548
And this was really helpful for us, both going towards launch

603
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:16,148
and kind of getting the community to know about.

604
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:20,132
the keep from someone that wasn't us, essentially.

605
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,695
Then we moved into our closed beta,

606
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,257
and we did our first public reveal around PAX.

607
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:28,200
And this is where we changed over the site

608
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,502
that was very gray to the more colorful one.

609
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,886
So we had been working kind of in tandem behind the scenes

610
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:36,348
with all the feedback that we were getting,

611
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,310
and we revealed this all at PAX.

612
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:43,633
So from there, what we kind of looked at was feedback more around how do we improve some

613
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:45,313
of the small things to make it better.

614
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:47,934
We added a randomized world state button.

615
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:52,756
We added the ability to, or well, we did that now.

616
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:58,078
We have the now ability to add hero biographies, but it was something that came up during this

617
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:58,338
phase.

618
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:02,560
So we looked for the really kind of quick hit things that we could do that made a big

619
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,681
difference but wouldn't necessarily severely alter what we were doing.

620
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:12,684
We also started a friends and family beta program as we had many people who wanted their

621
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:16,706
friends or their family to be able to come check out the keep and this was a really easy

622
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,106
way to get some extra people in.

623
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,258
Finally, we moved into open beta,

624
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:24,301
and we started our regular Twitch Q&A sessions.

625
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:28,825
Our focus around open beta was more scalability at launch,

626
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,707
making sure that what we had worked,

627
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,468
and that it worked well,

628
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:34,410
and would hold through when we launched.

629
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,994
We also knew that people who had created world states,

630
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,696
they'd be able to put them into Dragon Age Inquisition.

631
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,117
So there was kind of the...

632
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,782
It was sort of both preparation for launch as well as making sure that people were also

633
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:52,764
ready for their Dragon Age launch ahead of time and that we didn't have everyone flood

634
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:53,645
in all at once.

635
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,767
So finally for Keep Launch we had unrestricted access.

636
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:03,871
We decided to close out the beta forums and really transition over to more of the open

637
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,874
style beta forums that the BioWare forums have right now.

638
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:14,342
And then in terms of the beta program results, this is something that we're really excited about because

639
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:21,791
before we were even in the hands of public right at launch time, we'd had 6.5 million sessions on the keep

640
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:22,853
and 350,000 world states created.

641
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:27,017
people could create more than one world state.

642
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:30,999
So at the end, we had about 300,000 beta program signups,

643
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,960
which was really big for us.

644
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,901
We didn't expect to have so much,

645
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:39,224
as well as almost 50,000 items of feedback received

646
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,545
through the beta feedback button,

647
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,646
and we're averaging about 575 per day.

648
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,588
So there was certainly a significant amount

649
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:47,609
of feedback we were getting.

650
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,631
We also had about 85,000 unique users on the Keap forums.

651
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,093
I think this was great with our original goal

652
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:59,794
having people be collaborative, check into these open discussions, and we never really had any major

653
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:07,316
flare-ups on the forums. This was kind of great to see so many people participating in this. As well with our

654
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:13,177
talk about the KEEP program, we also got a lot of YouTube views and collaborations.

655
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:14,418
So I think this was a really

656
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:19,681
important thing for us because while we were under NDA and it was secret, we were also

657
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:24,504
able to help the community talk about the Keep and get more word out about what it is

658
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:29,048
as it was quite a different thing at the time and, you know, how to use it.

659
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:33,170
There was lots of helpful guides, so we really couldn't thank the community enough for sort

660
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,932
of putting all that into what we were doing.

661
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:40,335
As well, we ended up with about 10,000 social mentions during launch, and this was really

662
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,816
neat for us to see so much.

663
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,345
I guess, word of mouth and chat about the keep, uh, right up to launch.

664
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:51,633
Because the more people that came in earlier on, the better prepared we were for

665
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:54,699
launching. Uh, so that was really awesome.

666
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,561
So here I'm going to show you basically what the keep looked like

667
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:04,523
when we went into alpha. So you can see it was quite gray.

668
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:09,486
You had to click on all the different tiles and then click back out of them again

669
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:15,929
to use the site, which was a big pain for a lot of beta users commenting on.

670
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:19,190
So we just had little usability things that we wanted to work on.

671
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,131
As well, resolving conflicts, this was, again,

672
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:25,273
one of our bigger challenges when looking at the keep.

673
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:27,153
And you used to get this big, long list

674
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:30,735
of essentially everything that was going to change.

675
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,656
And it might not make that much sense to you.

676
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,457
As well, managing world states was done

677
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,978
basically in a little list format

678
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:39,979
because you could have, at the time,

679
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,399
about five world states.

680
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,080
We changed it to 10 based on feedback.

681
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,181
So you can see that we had a really far way to go.

682
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,901
And looking at the feedback, this was kind of the main themes that started to pop up.

683
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:56,704
And we really focused on kind of this theme-based approach to say,

684
00:33:57,124 --> 00:33:58,886
how do we get this to the right spot?

685
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:02,108
So one of the things that came up massively was color.

686
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,250
So people liked the imagery.

687
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,471
They found it evocative and it worked well.

688
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,773
but the color was a bit sad.

689
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:11,574
And so that's sort of one of the things that we looked at.

690
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:13,835
As well as syncing, syncing was huge.

691
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:17,457
We sync with your career data as well as your heroes.

692
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:20,498
And having your custom wardens or hawks show up on the keep

693
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,119
meant a lot to people.

694
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,200
And we had to do a ton of work on the back end

695
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,222
to get this fixed up to a sort of manageable state

696
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,283
considering Origins came out in 2009.

697
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,804
So we're working with quite old data.

698
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,286
And then I termed another category was details.

699
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:36,907
No music or sound.

700
00:34:36,947 --> 00:34:40,850
So it's the little touches that really made it more and bigger

701
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,613
and a better experience that we were just missing in there.

702
00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:48,136
So I quite like the comment about no music or sound

703
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:48,756
whatsoever.

704
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:51,218
And we did eventually end up adding sound.

705
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:54,681
I had to convince the developers that that was an OK thing

706
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:55,661
to add to a website.

707
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:56,942
We added it.

708
00:34:57,482 --> 00:34:58,282
And then choices.

709
00:34:58,382 --> 00:35:02,804
I think in the beginning around 90% of our feedback was about the amount of choices we had.

710
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:07,546
We'd started really with just what you needed to get into Dragon Age Inquisition.

711
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:10,167
But people found that this wasn't enough.

712
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,968
This didn't capture their world.

713
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:16,529
And so what we needed to do was basically take that beta feedback button.

714
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,030
We had the plot suggestion.

715
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,631
And we worked with the creative team to say,

716
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:22,232
Okay, here's what we're hearing.

717
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:23,232
Can we add these in?

718
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:27,936
And I think we added a significant amount of new plots,

719
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:31,559
and some of them even ended up being in Dragon Age Inquisition.

720
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,741
So while you're maybe not able to have everything

721
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:36,102
poured over to the next new game,

722
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,005
people wanted to capture sort of the breadth

723
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:40,726
and the depth of their story.

724
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,468
And that's one of the big, big learnings

725
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,810
that we had coming out of doing this,

726
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,892
that it sort of shifted where the product was going in general.

727
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:52,304
So here's where we decided to go.

728
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:56,167
In terms of color, we added a lot of it.

729
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:58,549
And I know that this looks quite different

730
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,550
from what we had before, and it was a little bit

731
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:03,373
nerve-wracking because we developed it in secret

732
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:05,254
and then released it out to everyone to say,

733
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,196
thank you so much, here's what we did.

734
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:15,045
Generally, the feedback ended up really positive, and it was so exciting to see iPhone screen

735
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,707
backgrounds show up with the art.

736
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,570
And we did t-shirts with the art, and it was really exciting.

737
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,156
I think something that fans, although it was a little scary at first, ended up connecting

738
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:24,356
with.

739
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:28,762
You can see we added a few other things based solely on feedback.

740
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:32,889
The addition of the banners to designate the different products.

741
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:35,572
Small thing, but really helped the usability.

742
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,118
As well, we moved around the navigation from the different sides.

743
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:43,400
And probably late in the game, we added the ability to see

744
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:46,562
if your world state had been exported to Dragon Age

745
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:47,522
Inquisition or not.

746
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,204
Very early on with that world state manager,

747
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,645
the little thing that popped out of the side

748
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:54,566
and was kind of just a list, people

749
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,927
didn't realize what world state they were working on.

750
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,208
And this could be very dangerous for us

751
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:01,769
when people imported the wrong one into Dragon Age

752
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:02,349
Inquisition.

753
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,773
So, both based on internal feedback from the QA team,

754
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,396
as well as kind of hints that we got throughout the beta

755
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:11,959
that I'm not sure people know how world states work

756
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:13,001
and how it's switching,

757
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,444
we made some pretty substantial changes to the section,

758
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:17,625
which I'll show you next.

759
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,855
But first, this modal, although very small,

760
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:25,077
was certainly one of the things that tripped us up quite a bit.

761
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:28,019
And you can see it's much smaller in terms of,

762
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,841
we only show the choices that you decided to make or change,

763
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,522
not the entire list of them.

764
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:36,564
We also added in the images so that you could easily,

765
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,445
at a glance, see what we were changing.

766
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:40,646
And then some other helpful things,

767
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:42,527
such as question mark button that tells you

768
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:43,887
why we're changing things on you.

769
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,409
So this was really kind of one of our bigger things

770
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:48,589
that we needed to solve,

771
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:50,790
but something that we were able to do

772
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,970
with the help of the beta team.

773
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:58,435
As well, here's kind of what you saw before in the video was that world state manager

774
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:03,776
with the little slide out panel with the kind of list of five world states.

775
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:08,978
What we decided to do was change this section to actually show the current world state you

776
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:13,940
were on as well as the connection like what you were going to import into Inquisition.

777
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,282
We had the hero and a few little summary choices.

778
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,583
It was kind of this safeguard against

779
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,725
maybe importing the wrong state.

780
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,687
What we found early on in the alpha group

781
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,868
was that people, or the alpha stage,

782
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,609
was that people were telling us that their heroes

783
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:31,311
have a massive connection to their world states.

784
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,192
So we started to pull in their heroes

785
00:38:33,673 --> 00:38:35,574
into a lot of the different places of the keep

786
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,155
to be sort of the cornerstone or the mark

787
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,816
to who you were importing in.

788
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:41,798
As well, you have kind of our big

789
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:45,679
check mark DAI, we're exporting this in,

790
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:48,339
which was kind of that safeguard,

791
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,360
and we were able to message and put out on Twitter

792
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,780
that if you think you have something

793
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,701
and maybe you don't, check that you have

794
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:56,241
this big check mark in your keep,

795
00:38:56,821 --> 00:38:59,482
and that means you're good and you're safe

796
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:00,862
and you imported what you wanted.

797
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:03,503
So, something that we really needed to do,

798
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,164
and kind of I think was one of the big things

799
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,324
that launched that helped us make sure

800
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,325
that people had their right world states in the keep.

801
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:17,429
The other thing that we did was we moved the entire world state section into its own brand

802
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:21,291
new kind of interface, and that's because people really wanted to have more than five

803
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:21,932
world states.

804
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:27,016
We couldn't accommodate it in the small panel we had before, but in this way people were

805
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:30,218
able to either drag or edit their world states in the tapestry.

806
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,440
gave a better sense of what I was working on.

807
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,442
I had to physically, tangibly move something

808
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:39,023
or do something to start working on a different world state.

809
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:40,985
Whereas before you just had to click on

810
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,646
a little eyeball button that was really,

811
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,027
people didn't know what that meant.

812
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:48,129
So I think that this was, again, a big thing

813
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,790
and it also allows us in the future

814
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,832
to add more world states or add different sections.

815
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:55,133
So a really great thing that we got

816
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,275
from kind of the small hints and the themes

817
00:39:57,315 --> 00:39:58,976
that we were hearing out of the beta program.

818
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:01,372
And finally, the details.

819
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,413
I really love this piece here.

820
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:06,374
This is one of my favorites about dog.

821
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:08,634
And when we went through the beta,

822
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,135
wanting to add and give things more life

823
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:14,215
and more personality, we found that one of the cool things

824
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:16,796
that we could do was rewrite all the text in the keep.

825
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:18,896
The creative director, Mike Laidlaw,

826
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,997
wrote all the text himself, so a big thank you to him.

827
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:25,358
And it just gave everything kind of that storybook feel,

828
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:28,058
whereas it used to say, did you recruit dog?

829
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:29,298
Yes or no?

830
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:34,728
So this was a big thing that we added, and it seems small,

831
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,633
but again, these details, they made a massive difference

832
00:40:37,673 --> 00:40:39,737
in the experience and what we were trying to achieve.

833
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:47,572
So I love this quote as well because it really speaks to kind of the keep evolved.

834
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:52,636
So these people who are with us during our beta program, they got to see it move from

835
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:59,241
basically this gray piece that had interesting usability problems and some confusing sections

836
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:03,504
into something that was workable for a wide variety of fans.

837
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:06,646
And we were so excited to have them involved as well.

838
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:12,038
So kind of the lessons that we learned coming out of this is to design a program around

839
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:13,279
what your product needs.

840
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:19,022
I think it's quite simple to say, but we had a really long time span.

841
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:23,165
We knew where we were with the product, and maybe if we were closer to launch or we had

842
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:24,266
a more firm timeline.

843
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:27,329
this would have been a lot harder to do.

844
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,792
So really take a look at what your product needs,

845
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:30,993
where you want to get to,

846
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,737
and then really get feedback in the moment.

847
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:36,600
This was huge for us because as we launched things,

848
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:38,582
as we put out new releases,

849
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:41,005
we could see what was really vexing for people.

850
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,240
as well, encourage your whole team to get involved.

851
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,502
I hope that this was something that my team would want to be a part of, and just to see

852
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:54,644
them get on the forums, to talk to people, to say from a developer's perspective why

853
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:59,346
a feature couldn't be implemented or why something didn't work well, was really big.

854
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:02,067
And it was something that then the community could go talk about.

855
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:07,130
And it was really genuine and authentic, and we tried our best to kind of do that.

856
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,300
And then finding the common themes and investigate.

857
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,241
Like I said, we had a massive amount of feedback,

858
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,542
tons and tons of feedback,

859
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:16,663
so we had to work really, really hard on

860
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:19,785
how to categorize this, how to make this actionable,

861
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,666
how to find out what people are really looking for,

862
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,807
and then investigate and dig in

863
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:26,208
when we needed more information.

864
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:29,437
As well, communicate openly during the process.

865
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:33,422
I think that we spent a lot of time putting up release notes,

866
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:36,166
saying what we heard, what we changed,

867
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:37,588
and what we were going to do next.

868
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:40,853
And we always tried to kind of toe that line between

869
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:47,721
things that we could do and couldn't do and wanted to do versus, you know, what we were

870
00:42:47,821 --> 00:42:51,423
actually able to do and making sure to communicate that openly and honestly.

871
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:57,386
And I think that was a big thing that kind of helped get us to where we were with the

872
00:42:57,426 --> 00:43:01,808
Keeb to get where we were in terms of some of the features, the things that we couldn't

873
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:05,270
get done, you know, sort of prepared for at launch.

874
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,051
So this was a big, big point for us.

875
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,112
And then at the end, what we did was we put up a credit section with all the people who

876
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:14,073
decided to help us.

877
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:18,435
We did use a survey so that people could tell us what name they wanted in there.

878
00:43:18,936 --> 00:43:25,119
And this was something that, again, I just loved being able to say, like, you absolutely

879
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,042
helped us get here with your work, your feedback, based on something that was...

880
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:34,867
you know, probably a year prior, a list of check boxes.

881
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,071
So that was, again, really, really special.

882
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:41,235
So I encourage you to, if you do something like this

883
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:44,198
and you're able to, give credit where credit's due.

884
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,601
And finally, some final thoughts.

885
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:50,774
So for us, don't just solve the immediate problem,

886
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:51,895
find the opportunities.

887
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:54,856
We absolutely could have gone with a list of checkboxes.

888
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,837
You could have used that as your world state

889
00:43:57,937 --> 00:44:00,078
and imported it into Dragon Age Inquisition.

890
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,460
But we wanted to respect our fans' investment,

891
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,481
their engagement, their time with the franchise,

892
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,442
and build something that would be there for them

893
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:08,703
in years to come.

894
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:13,194
As well, preserve the investment your fans have made in your franchise.

895
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:16,396
Whether it's choices, progress, anything,

896
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:20,958
those things can help carry them through to your next game, your next experience.

897
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:25,040
And it really represents what they've put into your franchise.

898
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:29,742
As well, find ways to include your community in the development process.

899
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:31,823
I can't say enough about this.

900
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:36,784
This was huge for us and it was an incredibly rewarding experience

901
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,745
and something that I really hope that if you're looking at,

902
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:44,626
considering, something that you'll just do is that it does really help

903
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:46,827
take your product in a really great direction.

904
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,781
And finally, if I have time for questions.

905
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:54,904
And thank you again all so much for coming out today.

906
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:56,525
I really, really appreciate it.

907
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:01,950
And I don't know if I have time for questions,

908
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,790
but you could ask them.

909
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:04,292
Eight minutes, OK.

910
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:11,781
like and what kind of adoption were you targeting? Like do you know how many

911
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:18,551
inquisition states got imported? Yes, so in terms of what we were looking for and

912
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:23,517
what we got, the analytics team is still working on some numbers so I can't

913
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,300
officially say we do know for

914
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,863
origin pre-orders only, it was about 50%.

915
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:34,327
So again, we didn't have massive sort of goals

916
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:37,289
in terms of adoption, but really this was something

917
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:39,331
that we felt we needed to do.

918
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,033
And if it helped people get ready for Inquisition,

919
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:42,553
that was great.

920
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:44,254
But what we're finding now actually

921
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,615
is that people are using it more

922
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,757
for their second or third playthroughs

923
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:51,179
because they can get a different experience in Inquisition.

924
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:53,201
So that's kind of what we're digging into

925
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:54,942
to try and figure out a bit more about.

926
00:45:55,342 --> 00:45:55,585
Oh, cool.

927
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:56,091
Thank you.

928
00:46:02,877 --> 00:46:05,679
All right, just a very quick question.

929
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:09,041
Sorry, my voice is kind of dead due to the AC here,

930
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:13,883
but it does look like the Keep is the most comprehensive

931
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,685
sort of storybook of all the Dragon Age experiences right now.

932
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:23,388
But what was the product oriented goal or pressure from the Inquisition team

933
00:46:23,628 --> 00:46:27,210
to include very specific things or maybe prioritize them in the Keep?

934
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:33,537
Yeah, so I think up until launch our kind of razor was help fans prepare for Inquisition,

935
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:37,703
like help them get their world states into Inquisition. And that was really kind of the

936
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:42,991
big driving goal for us. So when we had to look at other interesting features or things that we

937
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:43,932
had on the back burner.

938
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,414
kind of, if it didn't help fans get ready

939
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:48,075
for Dragon Age Inquisition,

940
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:50,917
that it kind of got shuffled off to the side.

941
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:54,039
So that was, I think, our main kind of goal

942
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:55,180
going forward to launch,

943
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,541
as well as we did have sort of our more product goals

944
00:46:57,601 --> 00:46:59,922
around creating the franchise ecosystem,

945
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:01,243
preserving our players' data,

946
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:03,024
but yes, when it came to the game,

947
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:04,425
get players ready to play.

948
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:09,608
Great.

949
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:11,872
Okay, awesome.

950
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,414
Well, if there's no further questions,

951
00:47:13,635 --> 00:47:15,938
again, thank you all so much for coming out.

952
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,321
I really, really appreciate it,

953
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:21,167
and I hope you had fun and learned a few things today.

954
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,131
All right, take care.
