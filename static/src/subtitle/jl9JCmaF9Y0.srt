00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:14,578
Hey everyone, my name is Eino Joss, and welcome to my talk titled

2
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,760
Clash of Clans, Bigger, Better, Battle Pass.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,462
The title actually encapsulates the whole talk.

4
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:23,885
So, in essence, this talk is about how we made Clash of Clans bigger,

5
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:26,206
better, and added a battle pass.

6
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,208
Before we get into the meat of the talk,

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:32,271
let's give a brief introduction to Clash of Clans.

8
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:39,176
So Clash of Clans is a build and battle game that came out in 2012.

9
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:46,669
It exploded to success back in its day and was a pretty big phenomenon.

10
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:54,072
And it grew even bigger in 2014 when the Clan Wars feature was added to the game.

11
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:55,813
What do you do in Clash of Clans?

12
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,373
Well, you build and you battle.

13
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:04,696
So, you attack other people's villages, steal their stuff, bring that stuff home to your village.

14
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:08,529
use it to build it up, and then rinse and repeat.

15
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:11,590
There's a strong social aspect to Clash of Clans,

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,731
so you can also establish clans with your friends,

17
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:19,072
and then build those clans up, take them into wars,

18
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:22,733
fight against other clans, and do other stuff together.

19
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,674
The village is really at the heart of the game,

20
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:28,255
so it's something that you start with,

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,776
it's something that sticks with you the whole game.

22
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:37,979
You build it up level by level by level and as you level it up, as it grows, it becomes more powerful.

23
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:44,742
You unlock new toys to play with, new cool ways to steal other people's stuff and new ways to wage war.

24
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:48,284
The core loop of Clash of Clans is pretty simple.

25
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:53,266
So as I mentioned, you steal other people's stuff in battles,

26
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:59,128
then you bring that stuff home and you use it to build up your own village and train armies.

27
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:05,897
You can also get a bit of resources by building these resource collector buildings, gold mines, elixir collectors.

28
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:09,418
Those will give you a small trickle of resources on the side.

29
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:10,979
So that's Clash of Clans in a nutshell.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,800
If you have been following Games Media last year, you might have seen headlines like this one.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,722
So our revenue jumped pretty drastically in April last year when we introduced a feature called Gold Pass, which is a battle pass.

32
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:29,604
You might know battle passes from games like Fortnite.

33
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:34,548
It's a system where you sign up every month

34
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:38,370
and get a progression structure to go through and get nice rewards out of it.

35
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,193
And for us that worked really well and the revenue jumped pretty drastically

36
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:49,177
and what's better we finished the year at nearly a 30% growth year over year.

37
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:52,099
And by hearing me say this

38
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:59,410
might feel like, oh these battle passes they're pretty sweet, maybe I should add one to my game

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,373
and you might be right, maybe you should, but then on the other hand it might be a terrible idea

40
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:11,176
and it really, we think, depends on where your game is at and what it needs.

41
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:16,119
That sort of brings me to the bigger journey of this talk.

42
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,655
touches on the Battle Pass and it is a big part of our success last year, but it's not

43
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:25,357
the only thing that this talk is about.

44
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:31,343
This talk is about the journey over the past two years of the things that we did to actually

45
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,545
make the Battle Pass succeed.

46
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:39,650
How we see it is that we worked on the foundations of the game, fixed some fundamental problems

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,311
that we had.

48
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:47,145
that if we had left them alone and just did our gold pass feature, it wouldn't have

49
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,285
succeeded as well.

50
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:55,347
And to give you an analogy of the infinity gauntlet, this baby doesn't work on its

51
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:58,068
own, it needs all of the stones to work.

52
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,788
Gold pass was just one of the stones.

53
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:04,115
and the other things that we did were the rest.

54
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,256
And once we did the gold pass,

55
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,697
that was the moment when everything blew up.

56
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:10,637
Given this context,

57
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:13,679
I would actually go as far as to make a bold claim,

58
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,419
which is that if we had done gold pass two years ago

59
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,740
without working on the fundamentals.

60
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:20,903
it wouldn't have been a big success.

61
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,884
In this talk, I will take you on a journey

62
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:26,365
through those two years and show you what we did,

63
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,587
why we did it, and why it actually supported the gold pass

64
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:32,288
in bringing us great results.

65
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:35,489
So you might be thinking, who am I to make this claim?

66
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:35,729
Well,

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,506
My name is Eino. I am a game designer slash game lead from an imaginary country of Finland.

68
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:49,293
I have loved games since I was a kid and that wasn't my first career choice because when we

69
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:55,720
were little and we racked up a massive modem bill playing Quake online my dad got really angry and

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,321
said...

71
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:59,333
playing all these games will never do anything good for you.

72
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:04,356
So I took heed of that and I went to get a real education.

73
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,778
I studied in Helsinki School of Economics,

74
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:11,940
majored in economics and started getting really afraid

75
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,481
of working in a consultancy or a bank

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,662
or an insurance company towards the end of my studies.

77
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:21,404
Luckily, I met this guy, Vili Leedonvirta.

78
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,326
He's a researcher in virtual economies.

79
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:30,428
I met him at a dinner party in the Finnish embassy in Tokyo and we started geeking out

80
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,390
about the economy in Ultima Online.

81
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,712
So great way to make new friends.

82
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:41,477
We ended up starting a company together and he was my mentor in getting into virtual economics

83
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:47,682
and learning more about how do virtual economies work, what can you do with them, what are

84
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,183
good ideas, what are bad ideas.

85
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,626
We did that for two years and that eventually landed me a job.

86
00:05:53,164 --> 00:06:01,968
at a company called CCB Games. I moved to work in their studio in Shanghai, worked on a game there

87
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:09,011
for three and a half years, then ended up working in Berlin, Germany at a company called Jagger

88
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:14,994
for three years, and then finally I returned to my imaginary native land of Finland to work for

89
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:15,454
Supercell.

90
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:23,822
At Supercell I started first at Boom Beach as a game designer and then moved to Clash of Clans in August 2017.

91
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:27,605
And that's sort of where our journey begins.

92
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:30,507
Beginning of the journey.

93
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:37,092
In August 2017 I moved to Clash of Clans and then September 2017 the game lead at the time told me,

94
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:44,518
you're going to take over the team now, it's going to be fine, don't be scared, I know you are, good luck.

95
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:47,112
and he went to work on a new game project.

96
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:49,733
It was an interesting time because the team was pretty new at the time.

97
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:54,334
There were quite a few new faces and a lot of movement was happening.

98
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:57,895
The game itself had been declining for a while,

99
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:01,736
so we were coming into a situation where the pressure was sort of on.

100
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:05,137
We were of course young and bright-eyed

101
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,917
and we felt that we wanted to make a difference.

102
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,758
Since we were a new team and since...

103
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:16,236
we felt that we needed to do something or otherwise the game would probably continue declining,

104
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:22,059
it felt like a good opportunity to reassess how the game was doing five years in. So the

105
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:29,523
game was five years old at this time. So how was the game doing in 2017? A small preamble.

106
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:36,286
Old games develop old game problems and Clash had been live for five years at this point.

107
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,003
and there had been a lot of content added, a lot of new things happening,

108
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:45,686
and we were starting to see problems, or it was apparent at this point that there

109
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,467
were some problems in the foundations of the game.

110
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,049
And systems that were great, had been working

111
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:55,131
very well until now, were sort of falling apart.

112
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:59,534
And when we started looking at the problems, the first one that was very

113
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,256
obvious, and we talked a lot about it at the time, was

114
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,617
the exponential economy.

115
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:07,930
So how the clash economy works is as you level up your village

116
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,674
things get more expensive and they get more expensive in an exponential way

117
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:16,037
Now this works great in the beginning of the game

118
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,581
because the costs are low but as you get to the end game

119
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:23,685
the progression can slow to a crawl and that gets really tedious

120
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:26,227
and it might make you want to stop playing

121
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,389
So quite a big problem

122
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:34,595
The next problem we had was that our top level players had absolutely nothing to do.

123
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:41,738
And the reason was that it had been over two years since we had released Town Hall 11,

124
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:47,801
and while we had done some content drops along the way, those were immediately burned through

125
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:54,725
by the most dedicated players, and they were back in square one, maxed out, nothing to

126
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:54,925
do.

127
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:01,303
This was concerning because these guys were our most active and most loyal players.

128
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:05,508
If they didn't have anything to do, there was a high chance that they would start churning out.

129
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:10,995
Third problem was that there was something weird going on in the mid-levels.

130
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,758
So we were seeing that on tunnel levels...

131
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:18,703
9 and 10, a lot of people were actually not upgrading.

132
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,884
They were getting to a maxed out state,

133
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,284
but then they were stopping there.

134
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:23,585
And that was really problematic,

135
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,786
because from our perspective,

136
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,347
if people are not progressing,

137
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,188
they don't want anything.

138
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:33,929
And it's really hard for us then to provide them

139
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,490
with cool stuff to do.

140
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,470
They don't want to move.

141
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,446
things are tough for us.

142
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,329
When we investigated this, it turned out that the clan war system that we had done

143
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,291
was actually putting some social barriers in the way of upgrading,

144
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,873
and we needed to do something to those barriers.

145
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:54,557
So the last problem we identified was that our conversion was not great.

146
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:57,719
It wasn't super bad, but it wasn't great.

147
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:01,081
We felt that maybe we needed to do something about it.

148
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:06,966
And the way we generally think about tackling problems is,

149
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:13,365
retention always trumps monetization.

150
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:14,766
So the logic for that is

151
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:18,328
if you have retention you can always figure out monetization.

152
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:23,172
If you don't have retention well monetization doesn't really matter.

153
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,995
At the end of 2017 we decided to break the exponential economy

154
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:30,157
and just to give you a little briefer on what the exponentially

155
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:33,880
exponential economy means in practice. So in clash of clans

156
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,002
the basic components are essentially resources and time.

157
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:44,975
and resources, gold, elixir, dark elixir, those you get from playing the game, stealing people's stuff

158
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:49,358
time, just something that exists, everyone has the same amount

159
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:54,462
gems you can buy with money and you can use gems to either get more resources or

160
00:10:54,462 --> 00:11:02,048
get some more, keep some time. Then the things you spend these on, well you spend them on upgrading

161
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,769
training armies, what not.

162
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:06,482
In the early game, this is all good and fair.

163
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:11,144
The sources and sinks are fairly balanced,

164
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:14,184
and you get a nice cadence of upgrades.

165
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:17,886
You earn some resources as you raid people's villages.

166
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,026
You bring those back, you start some upgrades.

167
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,267
You can get several upgrades done in a day,

168
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,227
and the durations of the upgrades

169
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,248
last from minutes to hours.

170
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:29,809
The problems start happening when you get to the late game.

171
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,530
That's where the exponential economy kicks in.

172
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:39,533
What this means in practice is that the sinks start outpacing the sources big time.

173
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:48,059
Suddenly to start a single upgrade you actually need to raid, instead of raiding one village, you need to raid 20 villages.

174
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,382
And instead of an upgrade taking 8 hours, it can take 8 days.

175
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:55,985
And naturally this will cause some frustration.

176
00:11:56,753 --> 00:12:06,260
To give you a concrete example, if you take a level 7 cannon, upgrade it to level 8, it will cost 200,000 gold and take 24 hours.

177
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,864
That's like early mid-game level, so it's still pretty good.

178
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,968
200,000 is something you can get maybe in 2 attacks, so not too painful, pretty okay.

179
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:25,615
Now, if you take the max level cannon, which is level 14, you upgrade from 13 to 14, it will take you 7.5 million.

180
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,788
and 192 hours, which is equal to eight days.

181
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:33,270
And this is quite painful already.

182
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,991
So we decided to make this better.

183
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,193
The first thing we did was we increased the income.

184
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:41,476
We found multiple places where we could inject

185
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:44,297
some resources into the system

186
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:48,520
and make it a little bit easier for people to start upgrades.

187
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,723
In a similar vein, we cut the upgrade times and cost.

188
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,804
So working the other side of the equation.

189
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:59,907
And we cut pretty drastically up to 80% of the costs

190
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,228
around tunnel levels four to 10,

191
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,790
different amounts in different levels.

192
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,333
But to really solve this problem,

193
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,977
we figured that we need something new also

194
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:14,820
that lets us deal with the problem in the future.

195
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,524
These kind of tweaking the economy is nice,

196
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,926
but it didn't really solve the fundamental problem.

197
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,967
and we needed something for that.

198
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,430
And that thing that we added was called magic items.

199
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,292
And what magic items do

200
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,935
is that they give you guaranteed results.

201
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,338
So one magic item always has the same result.

202
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:35,700
It has the same effect.

203
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:40,067
And if you use the example I gave previously,

204
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,429
upgrading level seven cannon to level eight,

205
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,790
and we use a magic item that gives you a time skip,

206
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,212
it costs 200,000 gold, takes 24 hours to build.

207
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:52,254
But if you use one of these magic items

208
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:56,196
that we just added, instead of spending 24 hours,

209
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:58,738
you can just spend one book of building

210
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,098
and it skips the timer.

211
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:03,540
And then to the second example of the max level cannon.

212
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:07,205
costs 7.5 million and 192 hours, 8 days.

213
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:10,507
Instead of spending that or waiting that,

214
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,049
you can just spend one, again,

215
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:16,172
one book of building to skip the whole timer.

216
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,433
It doesn't matter how long the timer is,

217
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,496
one book of building will always skip it.

218
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,478
So the result is always guaranteed.

219
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,700
And no matter where you are on the Town Hall levels.

220
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:30,569
you can always use one of these to get finish and upgrade immediately.

221
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,351
We thought it was pretty cool solution because it's,

222
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,252
it's something new that adds to the economy,

223
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,493
which means that it's tightly controllable.

224
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:42,956
So we can use this as a surgical way to tackle the problems where they come up.

225
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,376
And.

226
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,760
not actually have negative effects elsewhere.

227
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,142
Also, as a solution, it's pretty tidy.

228
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,765
We tried to make it as simple as possible.

229
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,908
And while it adds a little bit of complexity,

230
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:57,351
it's still, we think, better than reworking

231
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,954
the entire economy to fix the problems.

232
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:03,938
Just to give you an idea of what different items do,

233
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:04,819
we have the hammers.

234
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:09,889
Hammers give you a level directly to the thing that you're upgrading.

235
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:10,930
There's several types.

236
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,231
So there's hammers for magic items, four different types.

237
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:18,391
There's one on the left is for troops,

238
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,272
then we have something for spells,

239
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,392
then we have something for upgrading your heroes

240
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:23,753
or adding a level to your heroes,

241
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:27,153
and then finally something to add, give a level to your buildings.

242
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:28,954
A similar vein, we have books.

243
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:32,014
The first one allows you to skip timers on your troop upgrades.

244
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,515
The second one allows you to skip timers on your spell upgrades.

245
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:40,038
third on your hero upgrades and then lastly the book of building on your building upgrades.

246
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:44,141
Then we have rules, one for each resource type. These allow you to

247
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:48,764
fill your resource storages to max capacity, whatever it is.

248
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:54,588
And then finally we have potions. And potions have nice little effects.

249
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:00,251
that are temporary, you can for example boost your builders for a time, you can add levels

250
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,472
to your heroes for a time, you can get your troops to max level for a time, and so on

251
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:05,352
and so forth.

252
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:11,194
Having done magic items and all the other tweaks to the economy to make progression

253
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:18,137
better, we felt that we had succeeded in solving the economy problem and we had found tools

254
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:19,617
to best the exponential economy.

255
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:22,292
We were pretty happy. The solution was good.

256
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:26,903
The problem was that there were a lot of players who didn't really care about it.

257
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,442
So we still had the maxout players who didn't actually want to upgrade anything, so magic

258
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:32,482
items didn't matter for them.

259
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:39,086
And then we had the mid-level players, townhall 9 and 10 war players, who just didn't want

260
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:39,647
to upgrade.

261
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,828
So they didn't care about magic items either.

262
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:44,069
It was clear to us that our work wasn't done yet.

263
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:50,533
And the next thing we did, well, we proceeded in the order that we had sort of thought up

264
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:50,814
before.

265
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,054
working on giving our max level players something to do.

266
00:16:55,054 --> 00:17:00,660
This was in summer 2018 that we set out to solve the next problem.

267
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:07,196
So the problem for these max level players was that it had been so long since the release of Town Hall 11.

268
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:08,516
It had been two years.

269
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:13,238
And these guys being the most active, the most loyal players that we had,

270
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:17,839
they had been playing the game actively all the while since.

271
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,720
And they were basically constantly hitting the cap.

272
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,261
Whenever we dropped some new content a little bit,

273
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:28,402
they would immediately consume it and end up in the same state, maxed out, nothing to do.

274
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:33,175
So these smaller content upgrades weren't enough anymore,

275
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,596
and we needed to do something else.

276
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,760
And again, this was a problem that we really needed to fix,

277
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,722
because if we didn't add any content,

278
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:46,025
there was a risk that these players would start churning out of the game,

279
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,928
because, well, it's boring if you don't have anything to do.

280
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:52,591
And you might think, well, just add another town hall level.

281
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,472
But for us, it wasn't so simple.

282
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:56,894
We had this tendency to think that, hey,

283
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,460
Is it really, is this really the thing we want to do?

284
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,784
Maybe we should actually come up with a new content loop for the in-game players.

285
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:10,010
So that when you're in Town Hall 11, you graduate into something else and then you

286
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,774
enter that new loop and keep playing that.

287
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,236
Maybe that would be a great thing to keep you happy.

288
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,960
The reason sort of we thought about this, this way, was that...

289
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:25,787
We have a pretty small team and we don't have a lot of capacity for making content.

290
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:30,648
There's reasons why we have small teams, I'll explain towards the end of the presentation,

291
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:33,508
but that wasn't something we wanted to compromise.

292
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:40,890
So we always tend to look for solutions that scale nicely and allow us to stay small and

293
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,651
do things in a smart way.

294
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:47,992
Coming from this angle, we were thinking about this as a challenge, like, hey, maybe we can

295
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,252
actually get really smart here.

296
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:56,557
come up with something for the end game players that will keep them excited forever and it's going to be great for us.

297
00:18:56,557 --> 00:19:01,120
But in the end, when we thought about it more, it ended up being a really stupid idea.

298
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,384
The way we kind of concluded was that if we really wanted to pull this off,

299
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:14,010
we would need to create something that would be more compelling or as compelling as the core game of Clash is.

300
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:19,946
So we would have to, in essence, we would have to build a game that is as good or better than Clash of Clans.

301
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:30,930
And not only that, we would have to have that game speak and win the hearts of the players who love Clash of Clans.

302
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:37,153
Once we realized this, we just kind of concluded that, hey, let's stop searching for silver bullets.

303
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:42,948
let's just give the players what they signed up for and what they expect.

304
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,210
That meant doing another townhall level.

305
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,575
That said, we felt that whatever we do, the bar can't be low and we needed to do a really

306
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:57,037
good job with this update, with this townhall level.

307
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:04,052
needed to be something that really delights players and really makes them want to upgrade.

308
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:09,714
And we felt that we really needed to hit that level of quality with it.

309
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:14,415
As you might know, the thing that we did was Town Hall 12.

310
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:22,677
So to achieve this delightful upgrade level that gets people really excited,

311
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,759
and what makes them want to upgrade,

312
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,761
we decided to tackle it by adding novel, exciting gameplay.

313
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:34,722
And we did three things with this upgrade.

314
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,283
We added the town hall that fights back.

315
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:39,364
So first time ever, town hall was weaponized.

316
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,665
If you poke it violently, it gets angry.

317
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,385
It will shoot back.

318
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,006
It will try to destroy your army.

319
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,125
Then we added electro dragons, which are super powerful and super slow.

320
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:59,113
And then finally we figured that Clan Castle is pretty boring because it always deploys on the side of the village.

321
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:03,838
Maybe we could spice that up by delivering it in the middle of the village.

322
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:11,601
and we did that with siege machines. So siege machines are a new way of attacking. You put

323
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:17,006
your clan castle troops inside the siege machine and then the siege machine will deliver the troops

324
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,368
in various ways to the enemy village.

325
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:23,176
There was a slight social prestige element to the Siege Machines as well.

326
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:29,098
So Siege Machines are something that you can donate downwards to your clanmates.

327
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:34,220
This twist was nice because it made it also a nice thing for your clan

328
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,780
for you to upgrade to Town Hall 12.

329
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,442
In addition to these novel gameplay elements,

330
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:42,523
we, of course, also added a lot of content.

331
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:46,624
We added a level for nearly everything in the game,

332
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,205
from defensive buildings to...

333
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:56,323
resource storages to resource collectors to barracks to everything pretty much.

334
00:21:56,323 --> 00:22:02,813
And at the same time we added also a level to nearly all the troops that we had.

335
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:11,139
And in hindsight, that wasn't a great idea because it's actually good to hold some content back in reserve.

336
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:13,680
And we should have done this here as well.

337
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,541
But we kind of felt that, hey, maybe it's nice to, since it's been such a long time since people got new content,

338
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:26,942
maybe it's actually nice to just release all at once and give them a lot of stuff to play with.

339
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,163
At this point, we have two problems down.

340
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:38,569
one problem or two problems to go and we had nice rewards, the economy was better, we had a way to

341
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:45,172
deal with the exponential economy, we had fresh things to do with Town Hall 12, lots of new

342
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:52,817
gameplay content for the max level players and it felt like a good time to shift our attention to

343
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:57,920
the lower levels, namely the world players stuck on Town Hall levels 9 and 10.

344
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:05,412
we decided to start working on this problem next.

345
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:07,334
And this was at the end of 2018,

346
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:10,236
where we decided, let's get everyone to progress.

347
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:13,178
As I have been mentioning a couple of times,

348
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:16,380
the problem with people not wanting to upgrade

349
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,021
had its roots in clan wars.

350
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,764
And before we dive into the reasons, let's give you a refresher of what Clan Wars is.

351
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:29,588
Clash is a game where you're upgrading by day and you're being social by night,

352
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:36,554
and it's called Clash of Clans, and until April 2014, well, there were clans,

353
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:43,059
but there wasn't a lot of clashing between the clans. And then Clan Wars came along.

354
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,142
And with Clan Wars, social gameplay, social PvP, arrived on the scene.

355
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,779
And suddenly you had clan versus clan play.

356
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:57,724
You could basically take your clan, take it into a war with another clan, just at the press of a button.

357
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,205
Very easy feature to access.

358
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:04,468
And the matchmaking was geared up so that it was very casual.

359
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,231
So matches that you were getting would be always equivalent.

360
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:12,654
So if I have a town hall 11, then the opponent would have a town hall 11.

361
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:15,616
Or if we have five town hall 11s, then the opponent would have five.

362
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:20,651
If you have Town Hall 9s, five of them, opponent would have five Town Hall 9s.

363
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:24,312
So always seeking to make matches really fair.

364
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:28,974
The feature turned out to be massively popular. There had been a total

365
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:34,677
need, a hole in people's game to just play with other people and

366
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:38,658
fight against other clans and when clan wars came along it

367
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:41,980
supercharged everything and it made the game

368
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,420
rise to new heights.

369
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:49,962
So, a couple of years into Clan Wars, we started seeing some problems rise up.

370
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:56,764
The first one was that people who were really good and really serious about Clan Wars

371
00:24:56,764 --> 00:25:01,125
had started to figure out how the matchmaking algorithm really worked.

372
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,845
And this allowed them to build their villages in a way

373
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:10,526
that made them look fair to the matchmaking algorithm, but in reality was not fair.

374
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,938
And since this was the case, they would actually end up winning more often,

375
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:19,801
getting matches that were biased for them, for them to win,

376
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,001
and they would win more often,

377
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:23,142
causing a really bad experience for the other side.

378
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:27,985
Another problem was that there wasn't really good incentive socially

379
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,385
for people to upgrade.

380
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:32,027
So since you were getting always even matches,

381
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:34,488
there wasn't a reason for clan leaders to say,

382
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:37,709
hey, let's upgrade you to the next townhall level.

383
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,270
There wasn't really a reason.

384
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,791
If you upgraded your townhall level.

385
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:45,451
let's say you went from 9 to 10, your opponent would go from 9 to 10.

386
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:49,554
So, there's a zero-sum game.

387
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:55,600
And in fact, the best strategy was that you would upgrade to the max of a level

388
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,005
and then stay there, because that would give you likely a worse opponent in the matchmaking.

389
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:02,366
Finally...

390
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:08,349
even with everything, all this, another problem in the system was that there wasn't really

391
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:09,029
an endgame.

392
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:14,511
So you were fighting these wars over and over again, but to what end?

393
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:19,473
In this system you could never figure out who's actually the best clan in the world.

394
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:26,916
And some people started tracking the winstreaks, but it didn't really satisfy anyone because

395
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:30,158
the top winstreak clans would actually never meet in the game.

396
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,887
So we decided to think, what do we do about this?

397
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,708
From our side, what we felt that we needed was,

398
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,789
we needed village strength to matter.

399
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:44,130
So to get people moving from nine to 10 to 11 to 12,

400
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,191
we needed a village strength to matter

401
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:47,391
for these competitive players

402
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:49,212
who really cared about winning.

403
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:51,932
Currently, they didn't because whenever they upgraded,

404
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,533
they got equal opponents

405
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,233
or even screwed up their chances of winning.

406
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,894
So we needed to fix that.

407
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,874
Another thing we needed to fix is,

408
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,255
we needed real competition.

409
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,998
We need really people to be these ultra competitive people.

410
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,283
They needed to be able to show who's actually the best.

411
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:08,585
Again, when we thought about it,

412
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,207
we started from thinking,

413
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:12,009
should we rework the existing system?

414
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,953
And you could argue that you could do it.

415
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:19,621
But when we thought about it, it didn't seem really like a good idea.

416
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,966
Namely because we had a lot of people who had invested immense time to this,

417
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:26,350
and mastering the system and getting really good at it, and we felt that

418
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,694
if we would change the existing system, we would take

419
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:33,719
something crucial away from those players. And we didn't want to do that

420
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,380
disservice to them.

421
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:42,071
The breakthroughs happened when we realized that, hey, what if instead of fixing the existing system,

422
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:46,035
what if we add a competitive endgame layer on top of it?

423
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:49,358
That actually worked as an idea wonderfully well.

424
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:52,601
At the same time, we felt that we could boost the economy, so...

425
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:59,310
We still, we had solved a lot of problems, but the game was still a bit stingy in the

426
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,974
endgame at some points, and we felt that actually adding something new would actually give us

427
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,877
a good opportunity to give even more.

428
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:11,280
Then most importantly, if we added something new, we could make sure that it actually worked

429
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,285
in a way that would allow us to find out who's actually the best clan in the world.

430
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,927
And the feature that we did.

431
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,167
was called Clan War Leagues.

432
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:25,749
So Clan War Leagues is a totally new system of clan wars.

433
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:28,871
It uses the same basic structure,

434
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:31,032
but it's run totally differently.

435
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:34,994
So normal clan wars, you can sign up every two days.

436
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:36,895
Here, you can sign up once per month.

437
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:41,743
So at the beginning of the month, there's an opportunity to sign up for Clan War Leagues.

438
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:47,985
If you take that, you get matched with seven other clans for seven wars for one week.

439
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:54,488
And sort of what we did with the matchmaking is we fixed it by not having any matchmaking.

440
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:59,309
Clan War Leagues works in a league structure where you get seeded into the league structure

441
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,311
based on your strength, but after that it's free for all. All your opponents are just from the same,

442
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:05,792
randomly picked from the same league.

443
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:13,215
And then once you start, it's all about how good you are and how strong your villages are.

444
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:20,441
So if you do well against your opponents in your bracket, you get promoted.

445
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,202
If you do badly, you get demoted.

446
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:28,947
And again, it's a combination now of skill and strength that will take you higher.

447
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,409
So there's 18 leagues in total.

448
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,671
And if you make it to the very top.

449
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,284
So the top league is champion one.

450
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:41,286
If you make it there and you make it to the top of the leaderboard for champion

451
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:47,249
one, you can get invited to our offline qualifiers for Clash of Clans World

452
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:47,969
Championship.

453
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:52,111
The cool thing about this is that you don't actually need to care about esports

454
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:56,413
to make it here. You don't actually, it's okay not to even know about them.

455
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:57,973
All you need to do is play your game.

456
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:01,803
be excited, upgrade your village, be really good.

457
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:04,024
And if you do that, you have a chance of ending up

458
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:05,805
in the world championships.

459
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,026
Rewards get better as you go higher.

460
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,726
So there's always a reason to push higher.

461
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:13,427
The rewards that you get are mostly feeding into progress.

462
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:17,709
So you get magic items, you get resources,

463
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,730
and you get exclusive cosmetics

464
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,250
if you participate in Clan War Leagues.

465
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:25,381
When it came to the cadence of Clan War Leagues, we wanted to sort of set people on a nice

466
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:27,885
cycle, give them some structure into the game.

467
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:31,750
So Clan War Leagues is run at the beginning of every month.

468
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:38,173
and then you get nice rewards from it that help you upgrade your village and get stronger and then

469
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:43,974
you can be stronger for the next round of clan war leagues. So by this point we had worked for a

470
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:48,835
year, we had tackled several foundation level issues, we had fixed the exponential economy

471
00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:55,536
by speeding up progress and adding magic items, we had done Town Hall 12, added content for our

472
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:58,897
end game players and made them have stuff to do again.

473
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:05,588
And finally we had fixed the incentives for upgrading for townhall level 9 and 10 players

474
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:10,112
or removed the social barriers for it.

475
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:15,236
And then, so at this point we were looking at the fourth problem and we went like

476
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:17,577
hmm maybe we could actually do this now.

477
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:21,981
And this is where Gold Pass enters the scene.

478
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:26,104
Clash of Clans just got more challenging.

479
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:29,086
Introducing Season Challenges.

480
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:32,981
Test your mettle with daily and weekly tasks.

481
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:42,549
Battle your way through multiple challenges at the same time.

482
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:47,112
Earn challenge points to advance down the rewards road

483
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:50,235
and unlock up to 30 tiers of awesome prizes.

484
00:31:50,235 --> 00:31:53,998
Season Bank is the new resource storage

485
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:58,141
that lets you double your winnings with every raid.

486
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,192
Unlock gold pass each season to earn a bigger bank,

487
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:06,395
amazing boosts, and exclusive hero skins.

488
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,356
The road awaits you, chief.

489
00:32:07,356 --> 00:32:10,859
When we started thinking about

490
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,820
how to fix the conversion problem,

491
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,024
we didn't actually start with gold pass in mind,

492
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:18,526
or battle pass.

493
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,367
What we started with was,

494
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:25,032
we had several needs that we needed to tackle.

495
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:31,587
First one was we needed something that would be low price point because we have a lot of

496
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:39,309
players in countries with less income overall and the current offering that we had was sort

497
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,631
of pricing them outside and they couldn't actually feasibly get anything in the game.

498
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,512
The value just wasn't high enough.

499
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:51,153
So we felt that we really need something that is low priced enough and high value enough

500
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,774
to get them excited about it.

501
00:32:53,506 --> 00:33:00,331
Then we wanted whatever we did, we wanted it to feel fresh so that when you looked at it you went like

502
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:05,595
oh that's cool that's something new I haven't seen that before maybe I could get excited about this.

503
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:13,361
And finally we wanted something that wasn't a skip ahead. We wanted something that

504
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:16,783
lets you as a player work for your progression.

505
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:20,323
And instead of just getting to it by spending money,

506
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:23,504
we wanted you to spend some money and then have a nice experience.

507
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:26,826
And putting all these things, all these four things together,

508
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,226
actually came together.

509
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:30,587
Why wouldn't we do a battle pass?

510
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:31,227
And we did.

511
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:32,828
And we called it Gold Pass.

512
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:36,029
Starting out with the Gold Pass,

513
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:39,010
once we decided, okay, let's go for a battle pass,

514
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,311
we had a high-level goal, of course,

515
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,672
same thing that I've mentioned before,

516
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,013
we wanted to fix conversion, we wanted to increase it.

517
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:51,681
But at the same time, since battle passes are actually great for improving retention as well,

518
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:55,330
we included that in and decided to treat that as a secondary goal.

519
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:03,365
When we delved into the design, we broke things down into a lot of sub-goals that we wanted to tackle, based on the needs of the game.

520
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:07,747
First off, we wanted, like I said before, we wanted this to be incredible value for money.

521
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,488
We wanted this to be a total no-brainer.

522
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:20,555
And we did it by making it have over 25 times the dollar value of progression content and other stuff.

523
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,866
The price point was set to 499,

524
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:28,029
which satisfied our low price point requirements.

525
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,291
Then it's just a question of loading up enough value

526
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,632
to make it really attractive.

527
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:32,954
Cool thing about battle pass is that

528
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:36,357
you can actually load a lot of value in a battle pass

529
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:38,399
and still have your economy protected

530
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,762
because it's just a monthly thing.

531
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:43,464
No one can buy it multiple times.

532
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:44,905
So your economy is safe.

533
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:46,346
The next thing was,

534
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:49,499
We wanted to have exclusive cosmetics.

535
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:52,680
This feeds to do things, it feeds into the fresh appeal.

536
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,941
So this was something new that we didn't have.

537
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:01,002
Then it feeds into satisfying max out players

538
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:03,843
who don't actually need the progression content,

539
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:05,483
but exclusive cosmetics is something

540
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:07,724
that they still could get behind if they're inclined.

541
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:11,145
The exclusive cosmetics that we did were hero skins.

542
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:11,225
So.

543
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:14,273
for the first time ever, we added hero skins into the game.

544
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:18,677
Finally, we wanted you to get something for your clan mates

545
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:20,979
when you actually made this purchase.

546
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:25,442
Our solution to that was that we gave you one gem donations.

547
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,105
So in Clash of Clans, you can donate troops

548
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,446
to your clan mates.

549
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:31,388
It usually is pretty tedious.

550
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:34,130
You need to train the troops and then you give them away.

551
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,372
With one gem donation, you can actually donate them

552
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:39,415
with gems on the very cheap, just one gem per troop.

553
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,924
It turned out that this is actually one of the biggest things that people love about Gold Pass.

554
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:51,190
Going further on design goals, we thought, okay, who is this for and who does this need to cater to?

555
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,232
First off, we wanted this to be accessible to all the players.

556
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:58,216
We did this in a classic Battle Pass fashion, so you have two tracks.

557
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:03,920
You have the free track and then you have the gold track that you get access to if you pay.

558
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,763
You gain progress on both simultaneously.

559
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:13,231
So if you're just playing along, you can play for free, you don't need to care about it, you make some progress.

560
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:18,216
And then maybe at some point you'll be interested in buying the gold pass, if you make it really far.

561
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:22,741
But everyone gets access, everyone gets to participate in this feature for free.

562
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:24,643
That was a really important goal for us.

563
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,444
Then we wanted...

564
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,779
the gold pass to appeal to maxed out players.

565
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:32,300
So as you know, we have a lot of players

566
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,661
who are very excited about the game.

567
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:35,861
They consume our content very quickly.

568
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:40,744
They push to the max, they upgrade everything.

569
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:45,405
We wanted this to cater for those guys as well.

570
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:48,247
To do that, we had the hero skins in the mix,

571
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,748
and then we had one-time donations,

572
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:53,269
and finally we had a training boost

573
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,949
that lets you train your troops faster.

574
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:55,490
Then.

575
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:58,577
We also wanted this to appeal to latecomers.

576
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:01,799
Some battle paths work in a way where if you come late,

577
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,881
you have no chance of finishing it.

578
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:04,622
We didn't want that.

579
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,663
We wanted everyone to have a chance to finish it.

580
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:08,905
Even if you come late, if you're leading a busy life,

581
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,728
you might not have that much time to spend in the game.

582
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:15,430
You might actually realize that the season is ongoing

583
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,831
at the end of the month.

584
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:19,933
We wanted to give you a chance to come in very late,

585
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,195
last minute, and then have a fair chance

586
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,536
of completing the whole thing.

587
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:24,797
To do this.

588
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,614
We made sure that there's enough points to go around.

589
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,375
So the weekly challenges actually have almost double

590
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,715
the number of points that you need to max out

591
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:34,996
the whole thing.

592
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:37,997
And not only that,

593
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:40,577
there's a lot of synergies between the tasks.

594
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:41,878
So if you come in late,

595
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:44,379
you'll have a lot of tasks accumulated up

596
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:47,920
that actually work in a synergistic way.

597
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,640
So if you play,

598
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,401
you'll actually make progress in a lot of them

599
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,721
at the same time,

600
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:55,142
which makes progress really quick if you're coming late.

601
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:55,482
Lastly.

602
00:37:56,682 --> 00:38:01,863
we considered how do we want players to actually interact and play with this feature,

603
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,684
and how do we want to actually operate it ourselves as a team.

604
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:08,365
First, we wanted to reward you for being active.

605
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:12,566
We wanted you to get value from coming back on a regular cadence,

606
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:17,287
and to do that, we have daily challenges and weekly challenges.

607
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:21,007
Daily challenges refresh every day, so it's good if you come in every day,

608
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:25,748
that lets you make a nice chunk of progress during the course of the month.

609
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:32,230
And then weekly challenges, unlock on a weekly cadence, they have a lot of points in them and

610
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,631
if you are very active it means that you can't finish the whole thing in the first week,

611
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:41,713
you actually need to come back in subsequent weeks to reach, be able to reach the top.

612
00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:46,275
We wanted to make sure that everyone, everyone gets to the end. So no matter if you're a super

613
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:51,456
hardcore player, a casual player, Sunday player, forgetful player, I don't know,

614
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:54,237
whatever kind of player, we wanted you to get to the end.

615
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,232
because we want you to enjoy the game,

616
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:59,454
we want you to also be tempted by the gold pass.

617
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:01,716
So if you're active,

618
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,399
you should be able to max out each season with relative ease.

619
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,502
And the most important thing that feeds into this

620
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,203
is that there's plenty of points to go around.

621
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:10,924
Like I said before,

622
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:12,645
there's nearly double the amount of points

623
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:15,187
that you have available that you need to max out.

624
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,089
Then we wanted to make sure

625
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,571
that this does not actually become a burden to you.

626
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,733
So it shouldn't increase your play time.

627
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:27,062
To do that, we made sure that the tasks are something that you can just complete very casually.

628
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:31,555
You don't even need to pay attention that much to what's in there.

629
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:35,958
You should just make progress automatically as you play the game in your style.

630
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,378
And then lastly,

631
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:41,901
we wanted to make sure that this thing would be operationally sustainable for us

632
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:45,883
as a team. We don't have that many developers on the team. Like I said before,

633
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,305
content is something that we're hard pressed to produce.

634
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,827
So we want to make this something that we can run every month with relative ease.

635
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:57,399
and still have plenty of time to develop content for other sides of the game.

636
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:01,964
And to do this, we focus the unique offering each month

637
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:05,368
on a single new hero skin that we're committed to deliver

638
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:09,092
and then offer nice progression rewards for the rest of the value.

639
00:40:09,092 --> 00:40:12,736
Then finally, we had a couple of other things that we wanted to get done.

640
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:16,200
that we didn't, and these are still a work in progress.

641
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,961
Might show up at some point, might not.

642
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:21,183
We wanted you to get benefits from being a loyal customer.

643
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:25,246
For example, if you have bought the gold pass three times,

644
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:27,107
we wanted to give you a small perk for that.

645
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:30,790
And then we wanted to give you even more benefits

646
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,611
towards your clan.

647
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,652
And we had some nice ideas.

648
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:37,114
Maybe we'll work on them at some point, maybe we won't.

649
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,596
But we would love to.

650
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:39,836
Let's see if we have the time.

651
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:47,916
And so, gold pass sliding into place, we had our final thing and that made everything blow up.

652
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:53,321
So, let's talk a little bit about the results.

653
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:58,065
Starting off with the exponential economy and making progression more fun again.

654
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,248
This is a distribution of our...

655
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:08,941
players by town hall. The dark blue bar is town hall levels 11 and up, light blue is

656
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:15,345
town hall levels 9 and 10 and then the lightest blue is town hall levels 1 to 8. Early days

657
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:22,750
when we started on this journey or in 2018 in June we had when we released town hall 12.

658
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:26,187
we had 12% of players on Town Hall 11.

659
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:28,610
So pretty exclusive club,

660
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,213
not a lot of people percentage-wise there,

661
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:34,818
and it's an obvious sign that it's actually pretty hard to get there.

662
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:39,083
And then by the end of our journey in December 2019,

663
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,105
when we released Town Hall 13,

664
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:42,467
the picture was very different.

665
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:47,008
We had 35% of our players on Town Hall level 11 and up,

666
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,629
and overall the distribution was pretty even.

667
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:52,050
So we were in a much better state

668
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:56,591
in terms of having players progressing at an even speed

669
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:58,132
across different levels.

670
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,452
As a small caveat,

671
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:05,434
our monthly active users have been fairly stable

672
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:06,534
throughout this period of time.

673
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:10,175
So this really just represents the changing composition

674
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:12,616
in our player base and where people are at the game.

675
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:20,864
Next, just to talk a little bit about the importance of content and releases like Town Hall 12 and Town Hall 13.

676
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:31,268
This is some evidence from the Town Hall 13 launch at the end of last year, looking at 30 days before and 30 days after the release.

677
00:42:31,268 --> 00:42:38,011
The first learning from this is that players are really excited for fresh content in Clash of Clans.

678
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:40,292
And we saw

679
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,881
the population on Town Hall 12 and up grow by 17%

680
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,824
after the release of Town Hall 13.

681
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:52,487
So what this essentially means is that we saw people

682
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:56,650
from Town Hall 11 actually upgrading to Town Hall 12

683
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,471
just because we released new content.

684
00:42:58,471 --> 00:43:02,294
So much that it caused the total population to grow 17%,

685
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:03,395
which is really cool.

686
00:43:03,904 --> 00:43:08,789
Another thing is that it's pretty obvious that whenever we release content,

687
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:12,452
people get excited also to spend some money.

688
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:16,376
And we saw the unique payers increased by 10% when we released Town Hall 13.

689
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:24,983
And finally, we saw our revenue react very positively to new content, namely because

690
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:30,248
it had been already 1.5 years since the release of Town Hall 12, and we expected a lot of

691
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:32,471
people had already reached the end state.

692
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:39,438
But in any case, we saw a revenue increase of 75% when we released Town Hall 13.

693
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:43,686
Let's talk a little bit about the impact of the gold pass.

694
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:48,570
And of course, like I showed you the news articles about revenue in the beginning,

695
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,513
but that's not from our perspective, that's not the coolest thing.

696
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:55,196
The coolest thing is that we actually have way more payers than before.

697
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:58,459
So much actually that there's four times as many as before.

698
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:03,183
And what's even cooler is that 70% of our gold pass buyers

699
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,824
actually come back every month.

700
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:13,715
So on average if you bought the gold pass one month there's a 70% chance that you'll return and buy again in the next month

701
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:20,660
Finally, perhaps most importantly, let's see what happened to the conversion problem that we had

702
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,765
And this slide shows you the monthly unique pairs in the game and you can see the light blue

703
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,167
bars reach up all the way to 2018, March 2018

704
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:36,691
And then from there on start the darker blue bars at the start of the release of the gold pass.

705
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,773
And as you can see, there's a lot more monthly unique payers.

706
00:44:40,773 --> 00:44:45,355
And what's even cooler is the gold pass actually impacted our economy in a way that

707
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:48,476
we have more payers and everyone's paying less.

708
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:52,654
We succeeded in broadening our player base,

709
00:44:52,654 --> 00:44:54,335
making the game more healthy,

710
00:44:54,335 --> 00:44:57,256
giving a price point that more people are comfortable paying.

711
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:58,957
So to end this presentation,

712
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,017
I'm gonna go through some lessons

713
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:03,618
we picked up along the way.

714
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,059
And before I get to that,

715
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:09,721
couple of caveats that I think are good to mention,

716
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,782
because we do things in a special way.

717
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:16,263
First is that Clash is an eight-year-old free-to-play game.

718
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:22,567
It's a pretty venerable age for a game, pretty venerable age for a free to play game.

719
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:27,309
And of course, that affects how we approach things, how we see things.

720
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:34,032
And the takeaways presented here can be a bit specific to those and operating older live games in general.

721
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:38,834
We have fairly small teams, and this is a thing that.

722
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,991
Small means different things in different companies.

723
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:48,613
For us, small means that the Clash of Clans team is 20 developers, sorry, 20 people with

724
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:51,734
12 developers and 8 people working in support roles.

725
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:58,157
Of course, this means that it affects and molds our thinking on how we approach things,

726
00:45:58,157 --> 00:45:59,937
how we work around things.

727
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:05,381
how we plan things in a big way. We don't have small teams for the sake of having small teams.

728
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:09,525
Of course it would be nice to have big teams and produce a lot of content, but we actually believe

729
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:16,190
as a company that small teams let us deliver the best product and it lets people have maximum

730
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,755
ownership over what they do and that together just brings us to the best results. And the

731
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:27,279
ownership thing is actually super important overall in this whole thing and that's my third point.

732
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:29,361
The game teams at Supercell...

733
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:37,182
have full ownership over their games. There's nothing that can't be decided in the game team,

734
00:46:37,182 --> 00:46:41,605
no one comes to second guess your decisions, it's all you all the way.

735
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:46,115
I don't think the journey that we had in the past two years would have been possible in

736
00:46:46,115 --> 00:46:51,260
any other kind of a structure, since it's hard to imagine someone having patience towards

737
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:56,964
a game team that says, well, we'll just work on these other things for two years and then

738
00:46:56,964 --> 00:46:58,285
we'll look at the revenue problem.

739
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:04,330
I think we could do it because we are just responsible to ourselves and we really believed

740
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,134
that this is the best thing to do, but in a different structure, it might be hard or

741
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:08,674
even impossible.

742
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:14,010
The first takeaway I have is, you really need to understand your game.

743
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,653
Each game is a unique little snowflake.

744
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:22,197
Each one has its own problems and its own solutions.

745
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:29,344
And if you go full circle from the bold claim, I think Battle Pass or Gold Pass wouldn't

746
00:47:29,344 --> 00:47:31,766
have been a success two years ago.

747
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,607
Because if we didn't understand...

748
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,341
the fundamental problems that we had in the game,

749
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:40,423
we would have done Gold Pass and have it land

750
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:43,344
in a ground that just simply isn't fertile

751
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:45,645
and or a game that's not ready for it.

752
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:47,505
If we didn't have the magic items,

753
00:47:47,505 --> 00:47:50,267
we wouldn't have rewards for the Gold Pass.

754
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,948
If we didn't have content for the maxed out players,

755
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:57,169
Gold Pass wouldn't be interesting to them.

756
00:47:57,169 --> 00:48:01,631
If we didn't fix the, remove the barriers to upgrading

757
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:02,871
for Town Hall 9s and 10s,

758
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,837
they wouldn't care about the progression rewards in the gold pass.

759
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:11,759
So I truly believe that the gold pass wouldn't have been a success if we had

760
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:12,539
done it two years ago.

761
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:18,902
Our process for understanding the game is, starts with feedback.

762
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:23,604
And we think that you should take all the feedback you can get.

763
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:25,045
Be a sponge for feedback.

764
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:28,827
And the trick is that you listen to everything,

765
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:31,848
but you don't need to believe everything or you don't need to react to

766
00:48:31,848 --> 00:48:32,228
everything.

767
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:36,461
but listening to everything allows you to sort of form,

768
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:40,865
formulate a picture of the world of

769
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:44,748
how is this, how is the reality really looking?

770
00:48:44,748 --> 00:48:46,349
What does it look like?

771
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:48,291
Where are the real problems?

772
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,332
People say different things,

773
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:52,174
but when you listen to everything,

774
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,695
then a picture starts forming.

775
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:55,236
And then once you have that picture,

776
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:59,139
then you can choose what to believe yourself

777
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,661
and which problems to start tackling.

778
00:49:02,464 --> 00:49:03,665
Figure out your foundations.

779
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:05,867
Our foundation is pretty simple in the end.

780
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:09,329
It wasn't a simple process to discover it,

781
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:10,410
but in the end, it's pretty simple.

782
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,411
The heart of the game,

783
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:16,034
the ultimate foundation of the game is the village.

784
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:20,157
Clash is really a game about building your village.

785
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,019
It's, you might kind of, from the outside,

786
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,101
think that it's a combat game, it's a tower defense game.

787
00:49:26,101 --> 00:49:29,443
It's about attacks, it's about looting.

788
00:49:29,443 --> 00:49:30,824
It is, but it's really,

789
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:37,462
Deep down it's about the journey of upgrading your village, making that grow, investing in

790
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:43,248
that over time. It's the one thing that people start with, it's the one thing that people stick

791
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:50,795
with the game for. Sort of we had this process where we were thinking about, okay so should we

792
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:54,859
come up with a different thing for endgame players? Should we invent a new thing?

793
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:02,078
and try to kind of find the silver bullet that solves all our problems and adds this

794
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:07,283
new exciting thing that endgame players will play over and over again.

795
00:50:09,313 --> 00:50:11,776
it didn't really, wasn't a good idea in the end.

796
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:17,824
So my advice would be, don't be like us, be like you, be smarter, don't search for silver

797
00:50:17,824 --> 00:50:24,051
bullets, just double down on what makes your game special and what is valuable in your

798
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:29,097
game and then find the right solutions to that.

799
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:36,415
Battle Pass itself, it can be a solution for your game as well, but it might not also be.

800
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:43,198
It really depends on what your game needs. So first figure out that, and then tailor the solutions

801
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:50,901
to those needs. Second takeaway is be generous. Be generous with the players, give them a fun

802
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:57,103
experience, make them have a fun time. In Clash, make them have progress, make them get to the last

803
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:57,503
levels.

804
00:50:58,602 --> 00:50:59,883
make their life enjoyable.

805
00:50:59,883 --> 00:51:04,244
And what we found in the process of the journey

806
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:05,304
is that when we were generous,

807
00:51:05,304 --> 00:51:09,766
we got more back from the players ourselves.

808
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,567
We believe that fun time and having a good time,

809
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:18,949
enjoyable experiences, they also make you more excited.

810
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:21,649
They make you more willing to spend on stuff.

811
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:24,330
I think some developers would argue that

812
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:30,258
hey if your economy is too loose then people won't have to pay anything for anything and

813
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:37,141
they will get everything for free and it's not great. And that's not wrong, it's true, but then

814
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:43,164
it's also true that if your economy is too stingy you will also get people who play the game forever

815
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:50,908
but never spend any money. That's not great either because they'll reach the end of content

816
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,709
without actually spending anything. And there again...

817
00:51:55,295 --> 00:52:01,218
it makes sense from our perspective to search for the sweet spot and give people those great

818
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:09,143
deals that let them spend a little bit and enjoy your content and then both sides win.

819
00:52:09,143 --> 00:52:15,447
Battle passes as such can be a great tool to find a sweet spot because like I said earlier

820
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:23,371
you can make it a great deal, immense value, but it's only once per month so economy is still

821
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:23,832
protected.

822
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:30,146
So, my last point of the talk, last takeaway.

823
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,147
It's always worth it to focus on the long term.

824
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:38,448
And when we were working on the goal past last year,

825
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:41,369
our goal wasn't really to make the papers.

826
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:45,711
Our goal was to fix a problem

827
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:49,152
and provide a fun, delightful experience to our players.

828
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:55,074
And that sort of needs to be the way you think about things, we think.

829
00:52:55,074 --> 00:53:02,296
So you always have your eyes on the horizon, you work on problems that matter, you keep chipping

830
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:07,217
away, making the game better, making your players happier, making sure that your team is working

831
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:14,579
well and everyone's happy working on the game. You need to of course know your fundamentals,

832
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,360
you need to have a plan, you need to challenge yourselves.

833
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:21,905
And sometimes the features that you have planned out don't work.

834
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:23,266
That's okay. Be patient.

835
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:27,048
You need longevity to actually make it this long.

836
00:53:27,048 --> 00:53:32,331
And eight years might sound like a long time for a game to run.

837
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:35,854
For us, we sort of feel that it can be just the beginning.

838
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:39,576
And rest assured, we have some very cool ideas

839
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:42,278
already lined up for the rest of the year.

840
00:53:42,278 --> 00:53:44,139
So look forward to those.

841
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:44,459
Thank you.
