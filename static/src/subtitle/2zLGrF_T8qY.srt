1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,661
Hi everyone, I'm really excited to be here today.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,902
Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:11,583
My name's Evan Jacover.

4
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,683
I'm the CTO of Jackbox Games.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:17,545
And today we'll be talking about the Jackbox Party Pack,

6
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,926
the collection of five games we've made every year

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,207
for the last seven going on eight years.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,308
And I'm really excited to talk to you about it.

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,848
So here we go.

10
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:36,620
So I'll definitely get into the Jackbox Party Pack franchise but first I think it's good to

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,903
start with a little history so if you'll indulge me we'll go back to the 90s and

12
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:47,184
if you won't indulge me you can fast forward I guess because it's a video.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,143
So Jackbox Games used to be called Jellyvision, and Jellyvision started out with a hit trivia

14
00:00:54,183 --> 00:01:00,306
game called You Don't Know Jack, which was released in 1995. As a side note, I started out

15
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:06,569
at Jellyvision as an intern after getting this game for Hanukkah and writing a fancy fanboy letter

16
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:12,712
to the company, and then, you know, I guess the rest is history. Been there 20-some years.

17
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:20,274
So You Don't Know Jack was known as a trivia game where high culture and pop culture collided.

18
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:26,856
So it had questions like this one. Which of the following household tasks can Superman not perform?

19
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:32,857
And the answer is erase a floppy disk with his magnetic force.

20
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:38,079
And as you can see this content becomes somewhat dated over time.

21
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,340
Not a lot of floppy disks floating around these days.

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:02:02,133
So after You Don't Know Jack, Jellyvision released You Don't Know Jack Sports, followed by You Don't Know Jack Vol. 2, You Don't Know Jack Movies, You Don't Know Jack TV, You Don't Know Jack Vol. 3, You Don't Know Jack Vol. 4, The Ride, You Don't Know Jack Headrush, You Don't Know Jack Offline, Louder, Faster, Funnier, You Don't Know Jack Fifth Dementia.

23
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:09,318
You don't know Jack Mach 2. You don't know Jack Abatz, which is the third German edition.

24
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,884
You don't know Jack Volume 6, The Lost Gold, which went off the rails a little bit, I guess,

25
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:20,426
if I'm being honest. A lot of you don't know Jacks.

26
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,990
And it's not like we didn't try to make some other games. Some even made it to market.

27
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:31,876
Who Wants to be a Millionaire, the PC CD-ROM game, Jellyvision made that one too.

28
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:35,680
But it was a struggle to break away from being the you-don't-know Jack company.

29
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:42,647
And then some new consoles came out, and the CD-ROM market kind of evaporated.

30
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:50,991
and sounds like the beginning of a behind the music story where we all descend into drugs and bankruptcy

31
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,212
and all of that, but it wasn't as dramatic as that.

32
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:59,974
Jellyvision did go dormant in 2002 and then around 2008 it was revived as Jellyvision Games.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,358
And after some experimentation and research,

34
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,400
Jellyvision Games released its first game, which was

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,421
You Don't Know Jack, 2011.

36
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,714
Well, we couldn't quite escape it.

37
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,979
We tried branching out into mobile and social games,

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,762
but we struggled to make the freemium model work.

39
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:31,648
And, you know, not as many people played Lieswater or met Octoputz,

40
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:35,812
the Wordputz mascot up there, as we would have liked.

41
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:41,375
The thing is, so-called social games aren't actually all that social.

42
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:47,258
You play them alone in the bathroom or on the couch, not at a party with friends.

43
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,339
And that was kind of our thing.

44
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,361
We wanted games where you play at a party with friends and there's laughter and you

45
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:56,763
yuck it up and stuff.

46
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,464
And the whole freemium model was difficult for us.

47
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:07,619
But then a new device came along and we thought, OK, maybe this will help us break back into people's living rooms.

48
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,922
And that was the Ouya.

49
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:18,871
For those of you who don't remember, the Ouya was a Android console that was a big hit on Kickstarter.

50
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:24,615
made several million dollars on there. And we thought, oh, this might be a good opportunity

51
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:31,178
for us to get a new game out, you know, back into people's living rooms where people could

52
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:39,023
play on their couches with their friends. And so we released You Don't Know Jack on the OUYA.

53
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:44,846
So we were kind of scrambling at this point. Money was tight.

54
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:53,770
you know, we had this game, but we had an issue, like how many people are going to buy

55
00:04:54,351 --> 00:05:02,419
four $50 controllers for a $99 console? You know, so we weren't convinced that many people would

56
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,723
be playing You Don't Know Jack with their friends if they didn't each have their own controller.

57
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:10,467
So we thought, well, if only there's some way, like some device.

58
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:15,050
that everyone had in their pockets already that they could use to interact with our games.

59
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,813
And that led us to make a mobile controller app that we called JackPad.

60
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:28,739
Jackpad was problematic for several reasons. For one, you had to install an app. And that's an

61
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:33,160
immediate roadblock for many users. Very frustrating. Also, everyone needed to be on

62
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,182
the same Wi-Fi network, which is also a pain in the butt. And then there's always that person

63
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:42,843
with a weird phone. At the time, there was Windows phones. We're not going to make a

64
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:48,345
Windows phone app. And so it was somewhat limiting in that way, too.

65
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:51,066
Well,

66
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:58,228
Much to our chagrin, OUYA didn't pan out as we had hoped and so we tried to regroup and figure it

67
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:03,752
out, figure out what we could do next. We had spent all this time writing content for games

68
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:08,095
like Lie Swatter that didn't really take off so we thought well maybe we could use that for

69
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:14,340
something else. Lie Swatter is a simple trivia game where you get statements like blondes have

70
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,723
more fungus problems or hot pink is the most popular selling duct tape color.

71
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:25,752
and you need to decide if they're true or false. It's really that simple. And we thought, well,

72
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:30,895
what about movie theaters? Yeah, there's all that time before movies start and there's a giant

73
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:36,459
screen and people have their phones out anyway. Plus, movie theaters are this evergreen business

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,124
that will always be popular, right? This was in 2013 when Netflix still only had one original series.

75
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,222
So we built a version of Lieswater for the big screen and took it to a midnight

76
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:53,744
showing of Christmas Vacation at the Music Box Theater in Chicago.

77
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:58,527
And unlike Jackpad, we just had people go to a website,

78
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:02,910
Togetherplay.tv, and they'd go there,

79
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,332
sign in and interact with the game.

80
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,754
No apps to install, no controllers.

81
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,575
And guess what? You know, it worked.

82
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,556
People took out their phones and played along.

83
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:22,122
It was really cool. I'll leave this as an exercise for the viewer, but you can decide if this is a real Kanye West tweet.

84
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:27,865
As soon as I'm off this jet, we bought a zoo on Redbox.

85
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:32,628
So every player would see that statement. They'd have to say if it's true or false.

86
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,090
There was a leaderboard. Lots of fun.

87
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:47,901
Unfortunately, it turns out movie theaters like using that time before movies start to sell ads and make money instead of paying game developers to entertain people.

88
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:52,663
So this business never took off, but there was something compelling going on.

89
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,364
Look at all these people happily playing on their phones.

90
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:59,905
And so it felt like something we wanted to pursue even more.

91
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,180
What came next was a new game called Fibbage.

92
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:08,281
Fibbage is a bluffing game where you make up answers to

93
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:12,662
obscure questions and try to tell the truth from the fiction.

94
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:19,024
So for example, a Swedish man who works as a dishwasher receives disability

95
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,505
benefits due to his unusual addiction to blank.

96
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:27,686
All of the players type in an answer that they think could plausibly be correct.

97
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:32,669
We show all of the player submitted answers along with the correct answer,

98
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,431
which in this case is heavy metal music.

99
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,433
And then everyone tries to guess which one is the correct answer.

100
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,076
And Fibbage did well when it was released.

101
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:47,198
It felt like we were onto something with this phones as controllers concept

102
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,080
and party games, and we wanted to build on that.

103
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,983
So enter the Jackbox Party Pack.

104
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:59,460
We often don't want to admit that things are about money, but honestly, the first

105
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,666
Jackbox Party Pack was to some extent about money and staying in business.

106
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:08,553
We were selling fibbage for about seven dollars and wanted to find a way to get a

107
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,677
product at a higher price point into the market.

108
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:19,064
and a pack of five games for $25 seems like a pretty good value proposition. Five games, five

109
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:26,127
bucks each, not bad. We just needed five games and we kind of wanted to do this pretty quickly.

110
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:33,389
Fibbage came out in the summer and we were going to try to release the party pack by the holiday

111
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:39,252
season, by November. So we were in a rush and we had to figure out what we could do. Well,

112
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,222
We had Fibbage already, so that's one game. So we made a couple more questions, called it Fibbage XL.

113
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:53,324
We still had that OUYA version of You Don't Know Jack, and so we repackaged that and called it

114
00:09:53,344 --> 00:10:00,446
You Don't Know Jack 2015. So that's two games. Lie Swatter, we had all the content from the

115
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:06,788
mobile version, and you know we had done some work to make it work in a movie theater on a big screen.

116
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,149
So that's game number three.

117
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:12,972
Our editorial director Arnie Niekamp mentioned that

118
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:18,596
he thinks he figured out how to make the Lyswater host flow work

119
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,758
with only five or six new lines of audio recording.

120
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:24,800
That's how bare budget we were at this point.

121
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:32,236
Drawful is essentially fibbage with drawings and we didn't have a lot of time to make Drawful,

122
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:38,242
so we took advantage of the fibbage structure as much as we could, so much so that the sound

123
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:44,588
effects in Drawful 1 are mostly Andy Poland, our audio designer, using his voice to try to

124
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,952
make the exact same sound effects for each moment in fibbage.

125
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:53,848
And then there's WordSpud, which is kind of a long story.

126
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:58,652
But this is a game we had floating around

127
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:01,854
years and years ago.

128
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,517
We made it for the Jellyvision website in early 2000 and.

129
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,533
We thought that maybe that would be a thing.

130
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,575
Yeah, it was a four player game and

131
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,818
there's this opening song

132
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,920
that kind of explains how it works.

133
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,184
And I got a flash swift from 2005 working to put this in here.

134
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,567
So let's see how it goes.

135
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,300
When the world is passed to your name

136
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,321
Type a word or phrase

137
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:38,661
That will light your head

138
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,321
And then you hit return and the other players vote

139
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,822
And if they like what you say

140
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,122
Then you all feel so gay

141
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:47,063
And you'll just beat the world's spud

142
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:47,783
Hey!

143
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:49,803
World spud!

144
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,884
So that's Andy's son, uh...

145
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:02,364
Our sound designer, Andy Sun, who recorded that singing when he was about five and now he's in his 20s.

146
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:05,686
It's still a catchy tune though.

147
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:10,229
So yeah, WordSpud is a game where just a...

148
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:17,283
A word is passed to your name as he says and you have to type in anything that goes with it and

149
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:22,905
everyone votes and decides if it's acceptable or not. If it is, that new word that you typed in

150
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:29,087
is passed to someone else and it just continues on forever. It's a weird game if you even call

151
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:34,269
it a game. It's become a bit of a punchline at Jackbox Games but you know, hey, fifth game.

152
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,049
We need five games and there we are.

153
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,764
So we went on, you know, quite a journey here.

154
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:45,489
But each of these steps or missteps or dead ends

155
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:49,614
led us to making the party pack.

156
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,156
And and so.

157
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:59,308
it ended up all going someplace useful. You know, we realized we wanted to make party games. That

158
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:06,171
was what we liked doing. We were tired of making You Don't Know Jack, or maybe our audience was

159
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:12,314
tired of us making You Don't Know Jack, or maybe both. Freemium just wasn't for us. We

160
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:17,216
didn't have the skills or interest to find ways to monetize.

161
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,307
players. We just wanted to make a fun game and sell it, you know, and not have to worry about

162
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:28,492
everything else that goes into making freemium games.

163
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:34,444
Physical controllers are too expensive to expect a bunch of people to buy them for a casual game.

164
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:41,668
It's a pain in the butt to download apps. OUYA wasn't the answer. The movie theater market

165
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:49,833
wasn't interested. Consoles were starting to allow self-publishing by independent studios

166
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:52,655
at this time, which was an exciting idea for us.

167
00:13:53,676 --> 00:14:00,388
We needed to get to a higher price point and you add all of this up and you have the Jackbox Party Pack.

168
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:10,228
So making a pack of five games may have initially been about making our business sustainable,

169
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,672
but it also turned out to be one of the best things we could have done creatively.

170
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:22,360
As we learned with You Don't Know Jack, it's very easy to fall into the trap of just catering to your audience and making more of the same thing.

171
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:23,382
We.

172
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:29,286
had something that had caught on with Fibbage and we could have just gone down

173
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:36,132
this road of Fibbage Sports and Fibbage 2 and Fibbage The Lost Gold whatever that

174
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:40,075
would be and eventually that franchise probably would have just petered out.

175
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:46,529
Now the Jackbox Party Pack 2, which came out the next year, did include Fibbage 2,

176
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:52,576
but it also included four brand new games, including Quiplash,

177
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,758
which ended up becoming probably

178
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:59,062
our most popular franchise

179
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,345
in the Party Pack era.

180
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:08,583
And before Party Pack 2 came out, we actually did a Kickstarter for Quiplash and released it as a standalone game.

181
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:16,470
We had just seen Exploding Kittens make like $8 million on Kickstarter, and so we had moderately high hopes.

182
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,551
And it did... eh.

183
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:23,914
mediocre, I guess. We probably lost money on it, all things considered.

184
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:27,736
But one takeaway of this is that it's really hard to get people to buy into

185
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,078
an entirely new game idea.

186
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,099
And, you know, people ask us all the time,

187
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,581
why don't you just release all these games individually?

188
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:41,623
And, you know, one of the reasons is it's just a lot of it's hard.

189
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:46,485
The Party Pack concept helps a lot with that.

190
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:53,700
Jackbox Party Pack 3 included Quiplash 2, which by then was a big draw,

191
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,205
and we thought, okay, that will be an anchor title that will draw people to buy Party Pack 3.

192
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:07,553
But it also had four other games, and all four of them would go on to become really big hits for us.

193
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:13,333
Trivia Murder Party 2, for example, went on to become the anchor title in the Jackbox Party Pack 6.

194
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:21,321
So, you know, we came up with a new anchor franchise through this Party Pack model,

195
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:27,528
and Trivia Murder Party, both of the Trivia Murder Party games are among our most played games.

196
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,744
You know, another way to think about it is if you have to spend $6.99 on a game like TKO in order to play it, you need to be convinced that it's worth it.

197
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:48,009
And we have to find a way to market that to people and explain what TKO is, which is a little complicated.

198
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:59,835
For those who don't know, TKO is a game where you draw pictures and make slogans and then combine those on a T-shirt and then the T-shirts battle each other until there's one ultimate winning T-shirt.

199
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,535
And yeah, it's a weird game to say the least.

200
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,916
But if you've already bought the Jackbox Party Pack 3

201
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:13,357
for Quiplash 2, you'll at least give TKO a try,

202
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:14,637
you know, to see if you like it.

203
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:17,618
It's just there in the menu waiting to be played.

204
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,278
You know, you already have your friends over,

205
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,539
just let's see what TKO is like.

206
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,660
And TKO has become a very popular game for us as a result.

207
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:32,241
without the leeway to push boundaries, knowing there's still a lot of value in the pack,

208
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:37,426
we probably wouldn't have made these more niche-y games, some of which

209
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,833
became big hits and some which didn't. But games like Monster Seeking Monster, where

210
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:51,557
monsters ask each other out on dates. Or a game like Bomb Corp, where office workers

211
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:57,380
and a robot and a talking dog need to fix a photocopier so it doesn't blow up.

212
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:06,278
or push the button. A spaceship where a spaceship crew has to identify aliens by playing little

213
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:12,161
mini games or a game like Devils in the Details where a family of devils needs to work together

214
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:18,925
to make dinner. And you might think well these games I'm listing here aren't that popular.

215
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:29,473
um you know niche games of these party packs which might be true um but what we found is people's

216
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:36,016
favorite games are all over the place there isn't really a consistent thread of like this game is

217
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:41,258
the best game and if you look at just the party pack seven reviews we see all you know things

218
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:41,678
like this.

219
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:45,002
Talking Points is my absolute favorite game in the bunch.

220
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:47,665
I found that Blather Round was probably my favorite.

221
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,348
Devils in the Details might have been the most fun game of the pack.

222
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,792
Champed Up is without a doubt the best game in Party Pack 7.

223
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,776
Quiplash 3 leads the pack of new party games.

224
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,079
So, you know, it's hard to say.

225
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:05,206
you know, what's what. Every game was declared the best and the worst by different reviewers.

226
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:11,874
And so, you know, you get a pack of games and it has two or three games that you love and,

227
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:19,042
you know, two or three that you don't. It's still a good value and everyone is

228
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,665
getting different games that they love and different games that they don't.

229
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:30,795
So without this game model, I don't think we ever would have built up such a vast portfolio of games

230
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:38,700
or like the creative engine to keep generating new ideas. And that's been such a boon to our

231
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,704
company that we've come a long way since this. Also, I just want to throw it out there. You

232
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,365
don't know Jack is great and I love it.

233
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:54,928
We brought it back in the Jackbox Party Pack 5 as You Don't Know Jack Full Stream,

234
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,692
and it's probably my favorite version of the game. It's just nice when you don't have all

235
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:06,958
your eggs in one basket for one game like that. One of the most difficult design challenges of

236
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,060
You Don't Know Jack Full Stream was reinventing question types.

237
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:16,440
like the Jack Attack or the Diss or Dat to be played with eight players. In previous Jack

238
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,661
Attacks, the first player to pick the matching answer correctly got the points for that question

239
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:27,202
and everyone else was locked out and didn't even get to answer or didn't even had no opportunity

240
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:32,804
to get it right. And in this new version, it keeps really the spirit of that alive,

241
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,684
but everyone can answer, everyone can get.

242
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:41,428
get the right answer and it still has that tension which I think was a really

243
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:47,732
impressive amount of impressive coup by the design team.

244
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:55,196
Also you don't know Jack was meant to be the tentpole game in Party Pack 5.

245
00:20:57,441 --> 00:21:03,164
But we actually found that some new games like Madverse City and Patently Stupid were played more

246
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:09,467
and that's a good thing. I think, you know, we're always happy to have

247
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:16,390
new franchises take up the mantle and keep things new.

248
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:24,915
All right, now I'd like to go a little bit into our process for developing new games and getting

249
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:25,795
them into production.

250
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:33,868
And for starters, let's take a look at our timetable. We release games, a pack of games

251
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:39,231
every year, which really condenses the amount of time we have to work on these games.

252
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,074
In the fall, that's when we release our latest game, usually in October,

253
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:45,635
our pack of games, I should say.

254
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:55,745
We develop marketing assets, we do a post-mortem, we go on convention conference tours and promote the games,

255
00:21:56,306 --> 00:22:00,530
and we also begin forming some small teams and playtesting new ideas.

256
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:05,188
In the winter, that's when we're really focused on playtesting,

257
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:09,391
ideating playtesting some more, identifying an anchor

258
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,353
title for the pack of games.

259
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,655
Did I mention playtesting?

260
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:14,435
We're still doing that.

261
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:17,077
And we start the greenlight process.

262
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,041
In the spring, we lock in games for the pack.

263
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:29,616
hopefully, and we get into pre-production and production, and then summer we're in full-on

264
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:35,157
production and development, sweating a lot, get into submission by the end of the summer.

265
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:43,459
So it's a year, but really, you know, when we're in production it's maybe six months

266
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:51,600
of production time for each game, depending how quickly we come up with ideas for the games.

267
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:58,987
A big part of our company culture is that anyone at Jackbox Games can pitch games.

268
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:05,111
We've had games pitched by writers, artists, producers, engineers, QA, you name it.

269
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:12,776
Good ideas can come from everywhere and anywhere. So if there are games,

270
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:18,720
game designing rats in our office with a game idea, and I'll be honest, there might be.

271
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,282
It's an old loft building. Yeah, let's hear them.

272
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:30,047
So it took us a few years to come up with a process that made sense.

273
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,929
So we've kind of been honing it since then.

274
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,534
But here are the basics to our Greenlight process, which is what we call the

275
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:39,637
process to get games into production.

276
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,721
We have a rotating Greenlight committee.

277
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,562
It used to be the same four people.

278
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:49,393
always on the committee that would hear pitches for games.

279
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:53,837
And last year was the first year we started rotating different people onto that,

280
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,340
which is great because we're getting some different perspectives.

281
00:23:57,121 --> 00:24:00,825
And we'll probably get some different types of games greenlit,

282
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:07,571
have some different thoughts and ideas into what makes a good Jackbox Party Pack game.

283
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:14,776
Before pitching a game it's expected that whoever is going to do the pitch has run several internal

284
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:22,222
play test sessions. We want to get other people at the company to see the games, play them. We also

285
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:28,666
send out a survey to the whole company asking what everyone's thoughts are on a game and that

286
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:32,609
gets incorporated into the Greenlight Committee's assessment.

287
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:37,514
Games don't need to be digital to be pitched, and I'll go into this more in a little bit,

288
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:45,923
but we need to be able to play something. So it could be a bunch of index cards or post-its or

289
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:52,130
you know drawing on a piece of paper. We do that sort of thing all the time and we just want to

290
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,071
try to get a sense of...

291
00:24:53,789 --> 00:25:00,995
of the game and at this point we're pretty good at seeing the course from a bunch of post-its to

292
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:08,442
a fully produced Jackbox Party Pack game. Pitch results for all the games are posted

293
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:12,245
for the whole company. We try to make this process as transparent as possible.

294
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,924
And I think that's something we've gotten better at every year.

295
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:21,765
So all of the explanations for why a game is going into production or not

296
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:26,907
is shared and the whole company can see all that stuff.

297
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:34,139
A lot of people ask what makes a good Jackbox games, even internally, you know, people who

298
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,862
are pitching games want to know like, well, what should I be doing to, you know, get my

299
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,445
game, you know, give it the best chance to get picked.

300
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:44,788
And there's not really a specific recipe.

301
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,051
And we kind of go out of our way to say like,

302
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:56,113
there's no criteria, but we did put some criteria together to help guide people.

303
00:25:56,853 --> 00:26:01,615
And it's very possible that a game could meet none of these or all of these or some combination

304
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:09,437
and still be greenlit. So we love games that appeal to a wide audience.

305
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:12,278
The Jackbox Party Packs are bought.

306
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:17,716
by all ages, all different types of people. We love hearing stories of people playing

307
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:22,760
with their grandparents over Thanksgiving. So, you know, we want...

308
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:26,137
to cater to as many people as possible.

309
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:31,422
This is very vague, but fits the brand of Jackbox Games

310
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:32,983
and the Jackbox Party Pack.

311
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:36,847
Kind of let people interpret that as they will.

312
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:40,630
You know, we're probably not going to make a gritty, serious,

313
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,311
you know, war game.

314
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:45,754
Who knows, I guess.

315
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,912
has a lot of excitement and passion within the studio

316
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,073
and will be fun to work on.

317
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:54,695
We're big believers that if you like what you're making,

318
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,356
you'll make a better product.

319
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:59,078
So, you know, there might be a game

320
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,259
that seems like it would be a good fit,

321
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:02,940
but if no one's really excited about it,

322
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,741
we're probably not gonna make it.

323
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:14,490
is funny and makes people laugh. Our CEO notoriously has an office right next to the

324
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,012
conference room and if he hears a lot of boisterous laughter coming out of a play test that will

325
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:27,875
definitely make him curious about what game that was. Funny games and laughter

326
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,377
says that people are having fun and that's been our bread and butter.

327
00:27:33,337 --> 00:27:33,817
for a while.

328
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:36,658
Encourages social interaction, gets people talking.

329
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,020
Even if a game works on your phone as a controller,

330
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,081
if you're spending the whole time just looking at your phone

331
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,062
and not interacting with anyone in the room,

332
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:46,523
that's less ideal.

333
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:50,005
Has a low barrier to entry, easy to understand,

334
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:51,225
pick up and play.

335
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:54,527
I think that's pretty self-explanatory.

336
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:58,429
We don't want our games to have a 20-page rule book

337
00:27:58,449 --> 00:28:01,270
or explanatory video.

338
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:02,091
We want you to.

339
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:08,164
you know, maybe stumble through one play session, but after you've played the game once, you should

340
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:14,606
get it. Does something new within the Party Pack format? We're always looking for ways to

341
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:22,368
try something different. It was really exciting for Madverse City to push some boundaries and

342
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:27,509
do text-to-speech, for example, drawing, whatever a phone can do, taking pictures.

343
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,510
We're always looking for ways to push the medium further.

344
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,351
It doesn't work better as a card game or board game or mobile game.

345
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,072
We want a game that really fits our format

346
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:44,433
with having a big screen, a shared screen, and then a small

347
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:49,355
screen in your hand. It isn't too similar to another game we have made or are

348
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:52,175
making, especially a game in this pack. We

349
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:55,036
don't want to have a pack of five drawing games or five

350
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:59,338
trivia games. We like to have a broad range of

351
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:00,158
different game types.

352
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:03,948
And finally, engages the audience in a new and or meaningful way.

353
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:12,014
So when people pitch a game, there's a couple of different pitch results.

354
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:16,057
You could have a green light, which means the game is good to go on to the next stage.

355
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:19,920
And at that point, we'll staff a team on it and it will go into pre-production,

356
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,325
evaluate and assess production risks, identify the game core and define a creative brief.

357
00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:33,378
that's all part of the pre-production process. Some games, some pitches have a yellow light,

358
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:38,180
which means it's a neat idea, but we need to revisit some assumptions. Sometimes

359
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,883
the game mechanics aren't quite there. Sometimes we're worried about certain risks,

360
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:50,285
and we want to make sure we can resolve those risks in the time frame before we put a game

361
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:54,627
into production. And usually at that point, we'll assign some additional people to

362
00:29:56,272 --> 00:30:01,856
to the pitch team and they'll be expected to work on it for a while and then re-pitch the game.

363
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:07,140
And then there's Red Light, which isn't like, ugh, what a bad game. It's more like,

364
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:14,545
we're probably not gonna do this game right now, so let's put it away for now and we'll revisit

365
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:21,811
again maybe next year if there's still interest. And a lot of time there is interest and a lot of

366
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,712
these Red Lights do get revisited.

367
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:30,808
There are about five or six games pitched for every game that makes it into production,

368
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:37,775
and often those games that don't make it into production are revisited and refined year

369
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:38,335
over year.

370
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:41,698
I do hope someday we get to make poop cake.

371
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,181
One can dream.

372
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:51,997
Trivia Murder Party is a good example of a game that took a few years to get a green light

373
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:57,981
and how it benefited from having a bunch of other games pitched as well that, you know,

374
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:03,224
didn't make it into production. Trivia Murder Party, for those of you who don't know, is the

375
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:08,967
classic you've been kidnapped by a serial killer who asks you trivia questions to determine who

376
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:15,831
lives and dies trivia game. You know, what a trope. I mean, it kind of is, I guess.

377
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:25,459
So everyone who gets the trivia questions wrong goes to the killing floor and has to play a

378
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,962
minigame to determine if they live or die. So here's an example of a trivia question.

379
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:35,266
And that's kind of what took a long while to figure out. Like the trivia is fun,

380
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,469
the minigames are fun, but being dead or a ghost, you turn into a ghost,

381
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:46,254
and out of the game is not fun. Here's an example of a minigame.

382
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:51,574
you know, different people put poison into different cups and you have to guess which

383
00:31:51,614 --> 00:31:56,497
cup doesn't have poison. If you drink poison, you die and turn into a ghost. If you don't,

384
00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:03,620
you get to continue on and stay alive. And the game continues until there's only one person alive.

385
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,461
And then you go on to the final round.

386
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:10,478
So originally the idea was that you just want to be the last one to survive,

387
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,922
but then it's no fun being out of the game and feeling like, well, I can't win.

388
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:21,627
Then there was an idea where the last survivor faced off against the ghost with the highest score

389
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:31,074
at the end of the game, but that still left a lot of players uninvolved if only one ghost was able to

390
00:32:31,795 --> 00:32:33,976
win the game or compete to win the game.

391
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,371
So this is from a game designer on the game, Mark Turowicz. He said,

392
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:41,831
making everyone feel dead but still involved was the missing ingredient.

393
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:47,433
I think the final round content came from a playtest for a different pitch called 66%

394
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:55,215
and we combined that with this dumb horse racing prototype. So what he's saying here is the final

395
00:32:55,255 --> 00:33:00,076
round for the game basically took aspects from two other games that were pitched that we also

396
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:00,536
didn't make.

397
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:04,942
and some aspects of the of Trivia Murder Party that already existed.

398
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:13,052
If you want to know what the dumb horse racing game is, if you've ever been at a carnival and seen this game, you get the idea.

399
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,354
Although I guess this is camel racing.

400
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:19,616
I don't know where this picture came from.

401
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:20,957
Oh, Wikipedia.

402
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:30,383
Anyway, so we built a prototype for a game where you answer trivia questions and your horse moves forward based on how well you do on the trivia questions.

403
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:32,884
And we never made that game.

404
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,554
So the final round ended up looking like this, and taking elements from all those sources.

405
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:45,980
So the last surviving player, the one at the top, gets a head start, and everyone else is a ghost,

406
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,546
and based on your score, some of the ghosts get more of a head start as well.

407
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,787
and you need to identify which items fit in a category correctly to move forward.

408
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:05,251
So in this case, which of these three choices are African nations? Zimbabwe, Guam, Somalia.

409
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:12,455
And it ended up being a really like fun, exciting final round. If a ghost overtakes

410
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:19,740
the survivor, they steal the body and they become a corporal character again.

411
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:27,126
there in first place and then the first player to exit escapes and wins the game and it really

412
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:35,328
fits the theme really well. I think this final round ultimately is one of the main reasons this

413
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:36,808
game works so well.

414
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:51,324
I want to kind of finish up by just talking about where ideas come from and how they coalesce into a game at Jackbox Games.

415
00:34:52,204 --> 00:35:00,269
So, as I mentioned with our timetable, once we wrap up a party pack, we immediately jump into coming up with ideas for the next pack.

416
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:09,972
Some games spring fully formed from the head of Zeus, or in the case of Joke Boat,

417
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:17,999
they spring fully formed from writer and director Brooke Bright. This game, she conceived

418
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:26,948
like of this game almost in its final form right down to the name and the cruise theme.

419
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:35,996
Some games take months to name but Joke Boat was immediately and forever Joke Boat.

420
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:39,620
Here's part of the pitch doc. All aboard toot toot!

421
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,144
You and your friends are passengers on a cruise ship where you're also the entertainment.

422
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,588
put up your best or worst jokes as players try to get the approval of their peers.

423
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:52,130
And if you play joke boat, that's pretty much what the game is.

424
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:58,492
Other games take longer, and Madverse City is a good example of that.

425
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,414
Madverse City started out as an experiment to see

426
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,935
if there was anything we could do with text to speech

427
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:09,557
and also technically if we could do text to speech in a game.

428
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:15,210
So I'm going to take you on a little journey here through playtests from 2017.

429
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:22,993
So the first one, this game was called Telefun back then. Telefun Tests were in September 27,

430
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:23,093
19, or 2017.

431
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:30,617
So players listened to an obscure VO voiceover file

432
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:33,619
and then wrote down what they thought was being said.

433
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:37,381
So there was an audio file that was distorted

434
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:38,682
so you could barely hear it.

435
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:42,524
And you had to take a guess at what it was.

436
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,187
The results, guessing the correct answer,

437
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,168
which no one ever did, not a good sign,

438
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:51,810
or hearing it revealed wasn't the fun.

439
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,511
The fun was hearing the guesses.

440
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:58,794
So about a week later, Richard did another test.

441
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,697
Brian Chard, one of our audio designers,

442
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:05,520
was the one who started this whole process.

443
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,162
Telephone test number two.

444
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,725
Similar to fibbage this time, where one player's response

445
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:14,708
to a prompt is distorted and others guess what it said,

446
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,450
all the responses are read via text-to-speech.

447
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,973
It was fun to hear the computer say what people wrote.

448
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:25,484
Biggest laughs were the word chode and a few comments about Ryan and Mark.

449
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:34,269
So we're learning that text-to-speech can be funny here, especially when it says what people wrote.

450
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:42,593
Later that week, each player was given a list of two to five parts of speech to provide,

451
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:47,656
adjective, etc. Those words fill in the blanks of the first line of four poems.

452
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:49,637
So now it's poetry.

453
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:54,649
The results of this test, figuring out a way to gamify it would help.

454
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,132
I like the idea of it being competitive instead of collaborative.

455
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:01,234
I'm interested in trying some sort of rap battle.

456
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:09,079
Now, about a week and a half later, couplets, now the game is called.

457
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,140
Players write parts of an entire couplet.

458
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,803
It's played back using a singing version of text-to-speech

459
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,924
with musical accompaniment.

460
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:23,048
The singing robot was hard slash impossible to understand.

461
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:26,511
Let's try this with the entire first line filled in

462
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:27,612
except for the last word.

463
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,534
Now if you've played Madverse City,

464
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,395
you know that that's how it ends up working.

465
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:38,735
Now we're finally calling it Rap Battle Beat Poetry, so we're getting closer.

466
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,857
Tested a Beat Poetry version and a Rap Battle version.

467
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,860
They'll both produce laughs. The Rap Battle felt more like a game.

468
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:52,946
And finally, Halloween, looks like. I told them up front that the Mad Libs

469
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:57,330
words would need to be rhymed, too, so they should take care not to set

470
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,031
themselves up for a tough writing task.

471
00:39:01,203 --> 00:39:07,085
And the results this time, we're starting to get into kind of the more nitty gritty wonky game mechanic

472
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:16,427
honing in now of the game design. Scoring should maybe be a combo of voting by spectators mid-wrap,

473
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:23,629
but also by voting post-wrap. And that's pretty close to what the game ended up looking like

474
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:27,029
in Madverse City. You have two

475
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:35,546
two couplets. You're given the first line except for the last word of it, and then you write the

476
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:41,987
second line of each one. Players can vote during the reading of the rap, which is text-to-speech,

477
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:49,269
and then they also vote at the end on who did better. So it gives you a good sense of

478
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:55,350
how our games take form over the course of several play tests and tweaks.

479
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,760
Push the Button also took several years to find its footing.

480
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:03,722
We wanted to do a Mafia werewolf style game for a long time.

481
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:10,026
For over three years, we've probably produced over ten prototypes and pitches and variations.

482
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:16,389
And just looking through our docs, there are designs for all different variations on this, so we could go through some of those.

483
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,371
Warren Arnold, who's a game designer at Jackbox Games.

484
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:28,161
was particularly interested in this game. He started it off. And originally there was a pitch

485
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:33,425
called Push the Button. This is another example of the name of the game, making it all the way

486
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:39,650
through to the end. The first pitch was all a drawing game. And then there was Push the Button

487
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,694
with Guns, where a leader sends players on missions to fix a ship. And if people searching

488
00:40:44,714 --> 00:40:47,136
a ship find bullets, the leader can shoot a crew member.

489
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:52,922
uh push the button oxygen version where you're on a ship running out of oxygen and you need to

490
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:58,648
complete a gauntlet of mini games before you suffocate push the button experts edition each

491
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:04,155
player has a hidden expertise and needs to convince others that they are the expert saboteurs lie

492
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:09,201
about their expertise and this goes on push the button word edition push the button escape pods

493
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:12,716
And finally, we're back to just calling it push the button again.

494
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:17,460
There's a rotating captain who can pick from a set of activities to challenge the others

495
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:25,246
and deduce who the aliens are. So some things that helped were letting a captain choose a task

496
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:29,869
and also choosing who will complete the task. So not everyone does every task

497
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,733
and there's some strategy in the choice of who's going to complete the task.

498
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:38,658
If you've played Push the Button, you know that a lot of these choices that you see here didn't

499
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:45,450
make it into the game. You can't airlock a player or lose three minutes, you know,

500
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,175
for no reason, or skip a captain.

501
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,772
There's obviously a lot of hidden identity games out there.

502
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:58,356
If you'll remember, one of the criteria that we look for is ideas that wouldn't work better

503
00:41:58,396 --> 00:41:59,457
as a tabletop game.

504
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:05,343
And that's one of the things that made Push the Button compelling was that there was this

505
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,686
constantly ticking clock, this timer, and it puts pressure on players.

506
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:13,150
And that's something that would be really hard to do elegantly in a tabletop game.

507
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:21,139
In pre-pandemic times, almost all of our games start out as paper and pencil tests.

508
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,403
It's common in November to just see scraps of paper and post-its with weird stuff written

509
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:31,248
and drawn on them strewn about conference rooms. This is an early prototype of Champed Up here,

510
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:36,492
Mr. Pinch and Harold Handy. This is another game that never got made.

511
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,936
Not really sure what's going on with that baby's arms.

512
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,343
Here's another paper prototype of a game.

513
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:46,203
Spiders.

514
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:47,624
Yeah.

515
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:48,524
OK, one more.

516
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:50,305
I just like showing these because they're funny.

517
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:55,767
Bag of lint, head and torso, old fishing net.

518
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,348
This year, however, we had to rely

519
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:00,028
on a bunch of different tools.

520
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:01,549
For example.

521
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:10,154
complicated spreadsheets and Google Sheets was a tool we used to test games remotely

522
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:17,937
over video conference since we were all working from home. So this spreadsheet here is a test of

523
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:23,359
what would ultimately become Thriplash, the final round for Quiplash 3.

524
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:29,076
We also use Tabletop Simulator.

525
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:34,177
Roll20 is a tool that's used to run tabletop role-playing games

526
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:36,718
like D&D. So here's a playtest we did using that.

527
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:39,318
You can make what you will of this.

528
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,620
Here we are using Jamboard, which is

529
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,960
Google's whiteboarding tool.

530
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,421
This is a test of a game that will actually

531
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,662
be in Party Pack 8 that we haven't announced yet.

532
00:43:51,802 --> 00:43:54,382
So feel free to study it and try to figure out

533
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:55,363
what's going on here.

534
00:43:56,267 --> 00:44:00,409
with Mr. Fingers and Randy Blandy.

535
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,391
Here's another test of the same game.

536
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:08,472
In this game, weirdly, it uses a mechanic

537
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:11,614
that was first used in Poop Cake.

538
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,835
Remember Poop Cake from before?

539
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:17,236
Arnie Niekamp, who pitched Poop Cake,

540
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:19,857
actually demoed the paper and pencil version

541
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:22,038
on a charity Twitch stream because...

542
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:29,447
We figured, you know, normally we don't show games like that that we haven't released in case we want to release them later.

543
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,269
But we figured it's not like we're ever going to make poop cake.

544
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:38,651
Right. And little did we know, a core mechanic of poop cake would end up in a game in Party Pack 8.

545
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:44,133
I can't believe how many times I just said poop cake.

546
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:52,347
Anyway, after the paper and pencil testing or Jamboard or Google Sheets or whatever,

547
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:59,452
we often make a digital prototype. And this is a digital prototype of that same mystery game

548
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,735
I've been showing. More spiders in this version.

549
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:10,420
And here's another example of a digital version of a game. This is JobJob.

550
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,065
which we announced will be in the Jackbox Party Pack 8.

551
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,166
And this is what it looked like maybe a month ago.

552
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,528
And the team is hard at work making it look

553
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:28,052
not like this anymore. So we're really excited to get more games

554
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:32,674
out in the world. We love this process. It's been very fun for us.

555
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:37,156
And this is what we're working on now. We have five games in production for

556
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:38,376
the Jackbox Party Pack 8.

557
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:44,012
and I know the whole team at Jackbox Games can't wait for everyone to play them.

558
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:53,018
So thank you so much and I'm Evan Jakover from Jackbox Games. I hope this recorded

559
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:58,482
and I hope you have a great Game Developers Conference. Thank you again.
