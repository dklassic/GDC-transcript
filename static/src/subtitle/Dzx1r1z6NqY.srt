1
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:09,176
My name is Ruel Pascual, I am the art director at Knight School Studio.

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:15,058
After the party is not out yet, so you guys will have first look at a lot of the art in the game.

3
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:15,819
Are you guys excited?

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,119
Yes!

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,460
Alright, let's do this.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,700
Cool.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,441
Alright, it's good to be back in the Bay.

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,183
I actually went to school here at the Academy of Art in 1997.

9
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:29,404
I studied illustration, computer animation,

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,885
and I've been creating art ever since I was a kid in the Philippines.

11
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:38,862
Here's some of my personal work. I love working in traditional medium.

12
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:43,963
A lot of my old paintings are inspired by my wife and kids.

13
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:50,985
My art has been featured at galleries in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Diego Comic-Con.

14
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:55,246
I taught myself sculpting and learned how to make molds and resin castings.

15
00:00:55,246 --> 00:01:03,088
It's always great to be able to work on something tactile and take a break from the computer.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,213
And of course I also like working in digital.

17
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,875
I try to post as much personal work as I can.

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,277
These are a few of the sketches

19
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,119
I sometimes post on Instagram.

20
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,222
And I also like modeling, rigging, and animating

21
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:24,744
characters and creating test scenes in Unity.

22
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,837
So I've been fortunate enough to work for some innovative companies throughout my career.

23
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,398
I started in 2002 here in the Bay Area.

24
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:33,858
So here are some of the games and projects I've worked on.

25
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:36,299
In 2014, Sean Krenkel and Adam Hines started Night School Studio with their first game,

26
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:36,679
Oxenfree.

27
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,519
They're actually right there.

28
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:37,699
Say hi.

29
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:37,999
That's nice.

30
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:38,339
Thank you.

31
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:02,586
So, I was able to create all the rigs for the characters in Oxenfree, as well as serving

32
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:05,408
as an animation consultant.

33
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:13,012
In 2016, Sean hired me full-time to work on Mr. Robot mobile texting narrative game, where

34
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,213
I designed the UI and UX.

35
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:18,675
Today I'm going to talk about the art of After Party.

36
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,277
As art director, I focus on visual identity.

37
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:25,379
color, lighting, rigging, animation direction, and branding.

38
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,982
With a small studio, you have to wear many hats.

39
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,964
It was a big challenge for our team,

40
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:37,007
so we had some failures before ultimately finding success.

41
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:40,069
Here's our logo designed by our graphic designer,

42
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:40,630
Diana Kwok.

43
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,532
We decided to create our own version

44
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,414
of a chromatic aberration effect in this one.

45
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:51,536
Our first challenge was team size.

46
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,998
Oxenfree was made of a core of six people.

47
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:57,060
With After Party, we doubled the size of the team.

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,282
In production now, we have almost tripled it.

49
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:03,324
This was our bike bar pub crawl in Venice Beach last year.

50
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,266
You know, bar research.

51
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,788
At Knight School, we are really proud

52
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,189
of the studio culture and chemistry

53
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,850
and story games we all love to make.

54
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,471
So let's talk about story.

55
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:20,766
So the story of Afterparty, two besties since kindergarten,

56
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:24,748
Milo and Lola, mysteriously die after graduating college.

57
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:29,269
They both go to hell, but they find a loophole

58
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,570
that if you outdrink Satan,

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,570
you can grant your life back on Earth.

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,272
So the tone of the game.

61
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:40,413
We wanted a fun, humorous, excellent adventure

62
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:43,774
like Bill and Ted, a crazy, busy,

63
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,514
crowded nightlife like Shibuya, Japan.

64
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:49,634
and a story with a lot of heart like Beetlejuice.

65
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:52,676
So we came up with these three little words,

66
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:55,117
comedic, alive, and heart.

67
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:59,740
Comedic in story, dialogue, and animation.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,002
Alive, a world where a ton of demons and humans coexist.

69
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,643
Heart, a story about a friendship

70
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:07,904
that lasts through the afterlife.

71
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:12,126
The three little words are an emotional experience

72
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,647
that the player should feel when they're playing this game.

73
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,332
They're basically our three pillars.

74
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:25,173
So our amazing writers, Adam Hines and Hannah Filipski,

75
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,294
would create the bones for a story,

76
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:28,874
and art and design plushes it out.

77
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:32,955
So what's our vision for this sophomore

78
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,695
walk and talk branching narrative game?

79
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:40,677
The vision for After Party was to create

80
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:43,097
a distinct handcrafted art style

81
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:46,418
with a similar gameplay like Oxenfree.

82
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,441
Story is important to us.

83
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:52,763
The player is able to drive the direction of the story

84
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,605
so the narrative the player chooses

85
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,686
becomes one of the core mechanics of the game.

86
00:04:56,686 --> 00:05:00,549
So what's our version of hell?

87
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:03,711
Afterparty straddles a fine line between dark content

88
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,493
but still being fun in a vibrant world.

89
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,536
We didn't want to be too grotesque or too cliche.

90
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:14,600
We were very careful in balancing tone, art, and design.

91
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,991
So our goals for this one are much more ambitious this time around.

92
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:25,596
How many of you have played Oxenfree?

93
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:28,098
Awesome.

94
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,400
So for you that haven't, Oxenfree is a single player game

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,263
that's equal parts coming of age tale and a supernatural thriller.

96
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:38,526
The gameplay is a walk and talk branching narrative

97
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:42,109
where the player can influence the story in a meaningful way.

98
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,591
Our goals for After Party.

99
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,847
We wanted to create a full 3D game,

100
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,749
two playable characters with a ton of NPCs,

101
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,691
environments with complexity in design and story.

102
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:58,554
So we had a few inspirations.

103
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:03,656
We looked at a lot of Simon Weiner's photographs,

104
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,958
the way he captures light and shadow in his photos,

105
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,799
which gives you a mysterious eerie feel.

106
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:16,250
We managed our art to have saturated lights hitting buildings at all times.

107
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:25,556
Interior lights and neon signs became some of the main light sources for the game.

108
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:29,139
We were also inspired by the art of Neil Camber Ross.

109
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,882
His design sensibility, use of color combinations, shape languages,

110
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:36,423
and how he composes his characters in his paintings.

111
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:44,073
We kind of like the haphazard rickety architecture we created for Hotel T.

112
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:48,638
How shadows were designed inside the overall shape of the structure.

113
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:54,364
Jamie Hewlett's gorillas was also a big inspiration for the character designs.

114
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,727
Fashion, edginess and grit.

115
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,748
The rendering and lighting for our character

116
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:02,929
was inspired by the scene in the movie called Belly.

117
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:06,431
You guys remember it's directed by Hype Williams,

118
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,752
where crowds are bathed and lit by multiple colored lights.

119
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,993
You can see this beginning in the movie,

120
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:15,395
it's a slow-mo shot, so as they walk into the bar,

121
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,016
there might be a trailer for it.

122
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,577
So speaking of trailers,

123
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,818
let's look at the after-party trailer,

124
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,159
if you haven't already seen it.

125
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,740
So each department had a hand in making this trailer.

126
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,121
It's a small studio.

127
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,995
You kind of have to.

128
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,296
So all of it was captured in game footage.

129
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:37,978
Milo, how long have we been friends?

130
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,058
Our entire lives.

131
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:44,200
Our whole entire lives.

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,601
And so I want you to understand that I'm not blaming you

133
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,722
for getting us killed and sent to hell.

134
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,523
Two, what do you want?

135
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:54,323
Two dead orphans.

136
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:02,053
And I'm not even saying how drinking Satan to get back home is the worst idea you've ever had.

137
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:05,922
Okay, well, Lola, what are you saying?

138
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:42,390
I'm just saying you should pace yourself.

139
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,530
Uh, Lola?

140
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,213
Can you get alcohol please and inhale?

141
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:56,558
Alright, let's talk about visual targets.

142
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:02,480
We started off with illustrations created by amazing artists Claire Chan and Beverly

143
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,461
Chan.

144
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,301
No, they're not related.

145
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:08,164
What's a crazy night out in hell look like?

146
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:14,187
Debauchery, rollicking fun, tomfoolery, those are some of our demons in the game.

147
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:21,092
We wanted to lean into bright colors and dark shadows by using volumetric spotlights to

148
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:21,832
center the action.

149
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:26,864
we created a drinking mini game similar to the drinking game

150
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:28,365
in Indiana Jones.

151
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,286
As you know, Pastore.

152
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:34,990
Our protagonist had to practice drinking with other demons

153
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,391
in order to beat the prince of partying.

154
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,713
So for this illustration,

155
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:41,515
with drinking at your disposal,

156
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,337
we wanted to show how they might act

157
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,378
when they start to get a little drunk.

158
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,600
We brainstormed with our marketing manager,

159
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,822
Kylie Moses, from a brand perspective

160
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,662
on how moments

161
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:54,569
we can show our fans the tone and art style of the game.

162
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:56,050
We're an indie company.

163
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,570
We don't have a huge marketing budget,

164
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,131
so we try to share as much production art

165
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,552
as we can with our fans and social media

166
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:04,794
to keep them excited and in the loop.

167
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:08,896
Neon signage helped fill the gaps of darkness

168
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:11,898
and extend color choices we have in this world.

169
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:14,139
Quiet moments are outside,

170
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,800
and the party is inside the bars

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,121
where most of the story moments and quests happen.

172
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:23,695
Our sound designers, Scientific and Eduardo Ortiz-Frau,

173
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:25,075
helped party atmosphere

174
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,716
with a run of the jewels style music tracks.

175
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:30,397
We also have an incredible cast of voice actors

176
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,158
on After Party.

177
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,578
Khoi Dao as Milo,

178
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,239
Ginita Gavankar as Lola.

179
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,840
Drinking is a mechanic in the game.

180
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,780
We have demon bartenders

181
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,082
that can serve you a variety of drinks

182
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,703
which you can use to call your dialogue choices.

183
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:46,244
It's kind of like cosplaying with drinks.

184
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:51,019
Here are a few example drinks you have in the game.

185
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,783
So when you take a drink, a third dialogue bubble pops up

186
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,526
and opens a new branch in the story.

187
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:02,089
We call the dialogue option Liquid Courage.

188
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,191
So one of our biggest challenges was art.

189
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:06,953
Luckily we have a talented art team at Night School Studio.

190
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:12,938
So Oxenfree lends itself to a muted color palette

191
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,439
with a soft painterly style.

192
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:18,166
For After Party, a vibrant color palette and neon signs

193
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,467
were a big jumping off point

194
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:22,890
for the look and feel of the game.

195
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,975
Since players will spend most of their time in bars,

196
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:30,976
we wanted exterior and interior spaces

197
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,918
to have a modern city feel,

198
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,500
yet showcase a primitive historic hell vibe.

199
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,764
Here's some exploration of shape language

200
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,545
and building designs,

201
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,126
and how each level might be composed.

202
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:47,310
Our hell composes of different islands on the river Styx.

203
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,691
The game is side-scrolling, similar to Oxenfree,

204
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:52,872
but using a perspective camera.

205
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:58,554
We use lava mountains as our backdrop to populate the world

206
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:03,035
along with molten waters where you can take a hell ferry

207
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:06,656
to each location.

208
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,077
You also meet a cab driver named Sam Hill

209
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,438
where she can take you from bar to bar.

210
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:16,363
So even in hell, you shouldn't drink and drive.

211
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:19,524
Samantha Hill is kind of the character

212
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:20,985
in the Die Hard movie, Argyle.

213
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:24,586
So she's kind of like your tour guide slash

214
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:25,866
parental figure in the game.

215
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:30,568
This is the concept art for the first level of the game.

216
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,369
We chose the color red to acclimate the player to the world.

217
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,471
We wanted hell to have a familiar initial vibe

218
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:38,652
so the player can cross the visual threshold.

219
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,452
We did lava waterfalls, college town kind of atmosphere

220
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:47,113
with long lines like at the DMV.

221
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:47,553
You know, hell.

222
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:52,775
This one's inspired by a college town of USC.

223
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:57,237
We built a bunch of sports bars, dorms, a great hall,

224
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,598
libraries, park, and the scales of justice

225
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,119
in the background.

226
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,160
This is also where Milo and Lola

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,400
discover they are in hell,

228
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,002
so we wanted the player and the characters

229
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,402
to be on the same page in the story.

230
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:14,172
This bar is called Feisties, it's your typical sports bar

231
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,453
where you can play drinking games, beer pong,

232
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,774
and watch demons play sports on television.

233
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:24,917
This concept was inspired by the boroughs of New York City.

234
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:28,258
Demons over time created their own urban landscape

235
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,580
that has been haphazardly put together

236
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,720
and stacked over the years.

237
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,663
So after the player settles into our version of hell,

238
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:42,558
We started to break away from the stereotypes we all know.

239
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:45,819
We started to introduce color variations

240
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,300
within each island or zone to match the tone

241
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,480
and fun colorful nightlife of the game.

242
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,962
This level was inspired by the busy nightlife of Shibuya, Japan.

243
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,903
In After Party, we have many games woven into the story

244
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:04,103
and each have a purpose to advance the player.

245
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:07,124
You can just hear Disco Inferno playing in the background.

246
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,955
In a bar called Skull, you can have a dance-off minigame DDR style

247
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,637
with a demon to gain your suspect for a possible quest payoff.

248
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:22,760
This club was inspired by the BDSM club in LA called Bar Sinister.

249
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,481
Sean, you've been there, right?

250
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:25,842
Allegedly.

251
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:28,763
All right.

252
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:34,167
This level, Little Brentelli, was inspired by the architecture

253
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,289
of Washington, DC, where courts and hell monuments reside.

254
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:44,809
This is the oldest location in hell to the left is where Satan fell from heaven

255
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:50,133
There's a big hole now and it became a national tourist attraction and a great selfie spot

256
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:58,981
The gates of hell are also in the background this is where all the poor souls walk to get tortured

257
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,702
Below that is a club called sealed not

258
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:06,168
So the design was inspired by catacombs in Paris.

259
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:10,411
Our interior spaces also have a familiar but mysterious look.

260
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,914
And the sealed knot is our version of a speakeasy

261
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,235
where only demons are allowed inside.

262
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:20,659
Our lead designer, Jill Gatling, designed all the levels

263
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,820
along with art and story themes to which we

264
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,963
had a fair amount of variation and nostalgia

265
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,604
to complement the tone and story.

266
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,541
With months of concepting, the next challenge

267
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,203
was our vertical slice.

268
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:41,346
So this zone is called First In Izard,

269
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,387
where you can find your first typical dive bar.

270
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:47,670
We started to call out assets we would need

271
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,631
to build in 3D.

272
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:52,412
This bar at a schoolyard strangler on the far right

273
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,173
where you can take your first drink in hell.

274
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:57,615
Our camera is a lot closer to the characters in this game.

275
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,868
So we wanted more depth in the middle ground,

276
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,409
foreground and background.

277
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,352
So we want to create that parallaxing in this game.

278
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,814
The construction and design for the bar

279
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:12,536
in Schoolyard Strangler was inspired

280
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,338
by an old church in New York City

281
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,779
that was later converted to a club

282
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,962
in the 90s called the Limelight.

283
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,764
My wife Samantha has been there when she was a teenager,

284
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,726
I think during the hip hop nights or something.

285
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:28,628
So now I think it's a CrossFit gym, which is kind of sad.

286
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,726
We were gonna go with modular design

287
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,968
and only create bars that we interact with.

288
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,170
The plan was to create basic looking buildings

289
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,475
to fill the structures and gaps between the background.

290
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:45,138
We started to build a prop library

291
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,860
we can distribute and reuse in the entire game.

292
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,164
So we started to model street lamps, street signs,

293
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:56,248
gates, Satan monuments, rocks, and tombstones.

294
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,427
We also start to think about the texture quality

295
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:05,448
we wanted to put inside each model.

296
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:07,868
We modeled 3D trees, trash cans, dumpsters,

297
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,509
piles of human skull.

298
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:12,329
Also a library of torture devices

299
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:18,971
that hints at the activities during demon work hours.

300
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,152
Eric Romano, one of our 3D artists, created this prototype.

301
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:29,130
We first started with no textures and tried to experiment with volumetric lights and emission.

302
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:37,996
He then modeled and textured a sample bar. Here we decided to figure out the poly count

303
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:43,819
of each model and texture detail. Then I started to assemble the scale of the world

304
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,282
and figure out how dynamic lighting was going to work with effects and fog.

305
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,324
Working with the post-processing stack in Unity,

306
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:52,465
we wanted to see how much we can get away with

307
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,807
with minimal color grading.

308
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,509
You can kind of see Alex from Oxygen Tree hanging out.

309
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:03,253
She was kind of our test model for this scene.

310
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,514
So after modeling and texturing finished

311
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,675
for the buildings and props,

312
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,956
I started to assemble our vertical slice in Unity.

313
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:15,240
As we progress with the first level,

314
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,822
we start to find visual fidelity problems.

315
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:26,172
The Unity terrain and the models just looked like any other 3D game.

316
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,814
We weren't getting the handcrafted look we were going for

317
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:30,155
with basic lighting and texturing.

318
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:36,361
Plus, it nearly took months to model and texture the vertical slice.

319
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,122
This was just one exterior location,

320
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,604
and we still had a ton of interior spaces to build.

321
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:47,390
We were losing detail that our artist created in the concept art.

322
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,385
and it wasn't coming through at all in the 3D environments.

323
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:54,107
At this point, we weren't meeting

324
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,008
our original vision for the game.

325
00:18:56,008 --> 00:19:00,152
This is the concept art we started with,

326
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:05,756
so does it look like we'd have hit our original vision?

327
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,998
Nope.

328
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,719
Something in our process had to change.

329
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:13,282
Sean Crankle, our co-founder and studio director,

330
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:17,985
called an all-hands meeting to talk about our challenge.

331
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:18,606
We had to pivot.

332
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:25,031
In a small studio with limited resources and people,

333
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,812
we had to take a step back and look how we made Oxenfree.

334
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:32,054
Every game is different, and each will have its own problems.

335
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:35,896
It's just taking a long time to build each zone,

336
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:39,158
and the usual pipeline wasn't getting us there.

337
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:42,299
We weren't able to execute the vision we had hoped for.

338
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,102
So sometimes, failure pushes you to creatively solve problems.

339
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:54,007
So we asked ourselves, so what's been done before that worked?

340
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,548
Oxenfree lead artist Heather Gross

341
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,249
created this look and feel and was

342
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:00,091
translated in a game engine using sprites

343
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,853
with an orthographic camera.

344
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:05,596
By pointing out the reason for our failure,

345
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,978
only then is when we can start to learn to fix them.

346
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:13,722
For After Party, we wanted our concept art

347
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,064
to have a direct line into modeling.

348
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,506
We were kind of losing all of our artist's work

349
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:19,186
in the process.

350
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:24,077
So we had to bridge the gap between concept art

351
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:24,858
and to in-game art.

352
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,480
Basically make the game look like the artwork.

353
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,242
So people don't realize how hard that is to do.

354
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:33,084
Seeing it in concept art, standing it up

355
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,905
and building it, lay it out,

356
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:37,847
and how it's modeled, shaded, animated,

357
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,670
and how it looks in the scene through a camera.

358
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,370
That's a really difficult task.

359
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,051
But the devil's in the details.

360
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:45,673
We communicated to the entire team

361
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:49,076
that the vision of the game wasn't being fulfilled.

362
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,705
After an all-hands meeting, we worked together

363
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,687
and figured out a new pipeline.

364
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,688
We wanted the in-game environment art

365
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,389
to look like the concept art,

366
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,791
but with more depth and work with real-time lighting.

367
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,032
Here's how we did it with our new pipeline.

368
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:09,876
So we went back to the drawing board.

369
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,497
We set out to create a small exterior and interior space

370
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:13,598
to test out our new pipeline.

371
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:17,580
We found an immediate success with a new technique.

372
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,122
I can show you a result of these two a little later,

373
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:24,485
but the solution was how geometry was modeled,

374
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,528
how artists created the concept art in Photoshop,

375
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:31,451
and a new shader written by our lead developer engineer,

376
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:33,212
Brian Cannon, that bridged the gap

377
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,833
of concept art into in-game art.

378
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:41,178
Concept art had to be painted

379
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,761
on how we want to see it in the perspective camera.

380
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,937
This was our new vertical slice for Sinizard.

381
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:51,519
Our artists would hand the concept art to our modelers,

382
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,641
Eric Romano and Alex Chavez.

383
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:55,203
They would then rotoscope the concept art,

384
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:59,186
model the car's geometry precisely around each piece.

385
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:04,410
Then the geo gets UV'd and broken out into separate maps.

386
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,113
So there's still a fair amount of 3D in the game.

387
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,575
The terrain, the doors, the lamps,

388
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,438
and anything the characters had to interact with were 3D.

389
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:17,930
The rest were simple cards that were pushed and pulled

390
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,411
to cheat the perspective camera.

391
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:24,533
Here's how the scene is broken down

392
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,853
to show you the 3D geometry.

393
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:29,155
We used the Polybrush Texture plugin for the terrain,

394
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,595
which gave us three texture channels.

395
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:35,177
A custom shader was designed to seamlessly blend the art

396
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:38,078
with the lighting and modeling.

397
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:39,398
We called it the bartender shader.

398
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,889
So we tried just using the Unity light mapping,

399
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,853
but it didn't achieve the nuances of the concept art.

400
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:50,974
Since our 3D geometry budget was so limited,

401
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:54,157
the solution was to add a texture input

402
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:58,821
to the standard shader that acted as a custom light map.

403
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,243
So the custom light map just included

404
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,125
stylized highlights layer

405
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,707
that is basically a special emission layer

406
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:07,708
that multiplies the light value by the albedo.

407
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:13,947
The textures would then be passed back to our artist,

408
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,268
Claire in Beverly, to create the albedo light map

409
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:21,149
and emissive layers in Photoshop.

410
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,390
Light maps were used to add color and rim lights

411
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,110
to the gray middle value of the albedo.

412
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,871
They had to be separate from the albedo

413
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,732
so our artist can have more flexibility

414
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:36,293
when balancing the textures with the real-time lighting.

415
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:39,234
Here's how the artist layered their files in Photoshop.

416
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:45,158
All the lightmap layers are set to multiply.

417
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,939
Emissive maps are painted in for parts that emit lights

418
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,219
so when the lighting is baked,

419
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,440
in turn affecting our characters and the environment.

420
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,381
Along with normal maps, metal and rough textures

421
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,862
to provide added depth as well as specularity.

422
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:02,363
With this new pipeline, we empowered our artists

423
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:06,225
to have more contributions and flexibility in production.

424
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,393
Our modelers then would receive the painted textures

425
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:13,674
and start to assemble the scene in unity.

426
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:16,996
I would then start to light the scene

427
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,818
and closely reference the concept designs

428
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:21,139
we originally started with.

429
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:27,083
This is our original concept art.

430
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,345
Did we hit our original vision?

431
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,255
Yes, we found success.

432
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:39,596
These are just the 3D assets in the game engine.

433
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,297
A bit of Unity fog and utilizing

434
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,578
the post-processing stack in Unity.

435
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:47,579
Our new pipeline helped us achieve the new vision.

436
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:52,341
So here's a comparison of the old 3D pipeline

437
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,722
and the now scalable successful 3D pipeline.

438
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,412
So bringing back those two exterior space after we pivoted,

439
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,515
we extended the model now and it's a full level

440
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:12,398
in the game called Odd Spartacans.

441
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,399
So I had to speed up the image here

442
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,861
so you guys can see the entire level of the game.

443
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:25,848
Here's the first interior space we built,

444
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:28,490
concept art above and the game running below.

445
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,412
With the new technique in Pipeline,

446
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,173
we now have learnings to leverage

447
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:34,654
any concept art style we want.

448
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:38,696
Now that we successfully have the environment art style

449
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:40,937
in Pipeline working in game,

450
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:42,017
how do we design characters

451
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:43,658
and scale the world of After Party?

452
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:47,820
How do we make environment art look alive?

453
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:56,384
How do we approach character modeling,

454
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,305
texturing, rigging, and animation

455
00:25:58,305 --> 00:25:59,286
with a ton of characters?

456
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:04,520
We wanted a variety of shapes and sizes for all of our main characters and NPCs.

457
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:11,885
Adam Hines wanted Satan to be twice his size and be the most prominent and interesting

458
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:14,247
silhouette in the game.

459
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:17,629
All of our characters had to be 3D and they were all modeled in Maya and ZBrush.

460
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,187
So starting with our protagonist.

461
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:25,009
So here's Milo's initial character designs.

462
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,170
I went through a few changes.

463
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,432
We started off with cardigans, trench coats,

464
00:26:29,432 --> 00:26:32,294
sporty jackets, Air Jordans, and jeans.

465
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:35,576
Our characters' colors had to complement each other

466
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:39,138
since they're gonna be together all the time.

467
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:42,620
With Milo, we chose a simple, clean design

468
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,403
with a yellow cardigan, jeans, and purple hair

469
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:47,663
that echoed his personality.

470
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,653
So Milo's backstory, he's an only child,

471
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,614
intelligent and skated through college with ease.

472
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,935
His fear of rejection stopped him from making new friends.

473
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,996
So the choices we made for his designs

474
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,037
were indicative of his personality.

475
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:08,138
So you have purple hair, like I'm cool.

476
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,341
Open collared shirt, I'm kind of up for anything.

477
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:13,804
Button cardigan, I'm reserved, open,

478
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,886
kind of sloppy, but don't care.

479
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:19,150
Jeans and combers, meaning I'm ready for an adventure.

480
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,973
So here's the 3D model to the left,

481
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,374
and concept art on the right.

482
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,950
So here's Milo's designs, texture sheet, and poly count,

483
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,291
and using the standard Unity shader.

484
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:41,616
I think we got down to around 8,000 triangles for his model.

485
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:48,942
So Lolo went through a few versions as well.

486
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:52,885
Classic leather jacket, jean jacket, ripped jeans.

487
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,847
For her hair, we really embraced the iconic,

488
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:57,749
thick, kinky hair that subtly bounces.

489
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:59,230
She definitely had to be a badass.

490
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,990
but edgy and fashionable at the same time.

491
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,031
So I went with a classic 1990s overalls,

492
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:12,612
old school and trendy, ripped stockings and Doc Martens,

493
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,353
meaning I've been in a few fights

494
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:15,333
and totally kicked some ass.

495
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:20,917
So Lolo's backstory, she's the youngest of four sisters.

496
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:24,219
Her sisters are kind of uppity and materialistic,

497
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:27,181
so she's just happy to be done with college

498
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,904
and wants to really make a difference in the world.

499
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:33,266
So we have our concept art on the left

500
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:35,767
and the model on the right.

501
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:40,171
So here's her designs, model, textures, and hair cards.

502
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:42,252
Our modelers really did a great job

503
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,694
in just translating our characters into 3D.

504
00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:50,287
I think Lola's model is around 10,000 triangles.

505
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:55,668
So the character's clothings and textures

506
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:59,269
create a vision of the character's experiences

507
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,031
and the lives and roles they have in the game.

508
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:05,331
Yellow was a unifying color they both carry

509
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:07,312
that can read from a distance.

510
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,553
Since we were designing two playable characters,

511
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:13,554
their outfits and colors had to read clearly.

512
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:18,350
in After Party, in order to get out of hell,

513
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,811
their friendship had to be put to the test.

514
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:25,454
For Satan, so we wanted his design

515
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:26,214
to be iconic and familiar.

516
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:32,177
You know, he's been running hell for over a million years,

517
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:33,918
and so Adam had this idea of layering

518
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:37,620
fashionable clothes over time to kind of beef himself up.

519
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,521
His personality is a cross between Kanye West,

520
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:49,519
and Dr. Frankenfurter from Rocky Horror Picture Show.

521
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,821
So Satan's backstory, he's the first kid in heaven

522
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,221
that was put into detention.

523
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:01,082
So in hell, he runs the party 24 hours a day,

524
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:03,243
every day for centuries.

525
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:04,523
His design was so crazy,

526
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:07,044
so we were wondering how we were gonna model him

527
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:08,465
and kind of stay in a decent poly count.

528
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,288
So from concept art, it was gonna be a challenge,

529
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:15,549
but we did it.

530
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,570
Eric Romano, Claire Chen, and I tag teamed

531
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,292
in how to build him correctly.

532
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:24,115
Satan's model, I think, clocks in at around 13,000 triangles.

533
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,657
So the next problem to solve was how to do the rig,

534
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,739
how to animate all these characters.

535
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:33,141
So how do we bring all these characters

536
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,062
to life in After Party?

537
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,170
They had to have cool outfits, strong design shape,

538
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,831
posture and animation that caters to their personality type.

539
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:52,633
So for rigging, we use Anzuvin's setup machine for games,

540
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:57,375
the super cool, easy rigging tool that bakes animations

541
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,216
and exports FBX files.

542
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:04,098
So in Maya, we also use a plugin called Studio Library

543
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:06,799
where you can save, transfer animations and poses.

544
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:12,225
We were also able to use blend shapes

545
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:15,007
for human faces and demon masks.

546
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,848
We were able to transfer all the blend shape items

547
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:20,870
across each mask type.

548
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,314
Their personalities, Lola is protective,

549
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:30,495
snarky, and independent.

550
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:33,337
Milo is friendly, nervous, and a square.

551
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:40,119
The animation had to communicate emotions and personality clearly

552
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,961
for the acting to read from a distance.

553
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:47,845
They had to be comedic, alive, and have a lot of heart.

554
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:52,749
So Satan was a huge, complicated character

555
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:54,330
with layers of clothing and props.

556
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,813
It was just a big challenge for his rig to work properly.

557
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:01,974
So I started to experiment with cloth component in Unity.

558
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:05,116
I kind of just started off with a simple banner flag,

559
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:07,778
kind of figure out how it works in Unity.

560
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:10,720
So now we added cloth dynamics and digital,

561
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,962
just rigid bodies to help our characters feel alive

562
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:16,724
and to get that free overlap

563
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:21,787
and follow through in the animation.

564
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:25,749
So I had to group all and combine all the right pieces

565
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:27,610
to reduce the amount of draw calls we have.

566
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,295
So we have his feathers were cloth,

567
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:35,478
his necklace and the skulls around his neck

568
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:37,960
are all rigid bodies.

569
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,004
We also added colliders so the colliders would push

570
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:45,727
and prevent penetration of the cloth around it.

571
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:48,830
The materials and shaders was another obstacle

572
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,471
to cross with our characters.

573
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:53,394
So how do we render them similar to our concept art

574
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:55,316
so they feel part of the game environment?

575
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:03,271
Their textures had to come through in the models

576
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:07,114
as well as seamlessly fit into the new environment,

577
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:08,435
modeling and lighting.

578
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:10,937
They look great with just an ambient occlusion

579
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:13,579
GI style rendering with a simple background

580
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:16,341
with standard Unity shader,

581
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:17,922
but it just was not working at all

582
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:23,166
or seeing them clearly with our busy environment scenes.

583
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:27,249
So our lead engineer, Bryant,

584
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:29,291
had to create a custom toon shader

585
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,392
for the characters as well.

586
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:32,698
we called it Bar Toon Shader.

587
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:35,119
It consisted of three layers.

588
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,422
So we wanted the lights to have a bright, saturated colors,

589
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:41,725
but that washes out all the bright, varied colors

590
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:45,447
we put into the characters' textures.

591
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:47,729
We needed a custom shader to keep all the local colors

592
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,791
consistent through each lighting situation.

593
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:55,055
So the Bar Toon Shader, it has base lighting,

594
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,917
which calculates the global illumination input

595
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:58,958
from the light probes.

596
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:03,474
A standard toon shader that desaturates the light source

597
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,476
so the local colors pop even though

598
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,938
the light source is saturated.

599
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:12,180
The harsh rim light picks up any colored lights

600
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,681
on the edges of the character.

601
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:20,785
So the top GIF uses the standard shader

602
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:23,407
and the bottom GIF uses the bar toon shader.

603
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:26,729
Now you can clearly see that our characters

604
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:29,090
as they cross that dumpster fire light source.

605
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:38,146
You can see the local color as well as seeing that rim wrap lighting around the edges.

606
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:43,655
Lighting, we also want it to look like the illustration, so how do we render volumetric

607
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:45,398
lighting with a ton of characters?

608
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:52,586
The engineers and designers were swamped,

609
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:55,388
so we picked up an HX volumetric lighting

610
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,529
from the Unity store.

611
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:02,112
But later on, our engineers rewrote the shaders

612
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,795
and lighting, and made a fake volumetric light

613
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:10,037
for each character, so it kind of saves us

614
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:14,740
on just any Unity caching.

615
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:18,449
We had one directional light that's a shadow caster,

616
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,750
the rest were point lights, they were just light probes

617
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,612
that were baked into the environment.

618
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:30,677
So I designed one of the characters named Sister Mary Wormhorn,

619
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:33,098
Milo and Lola's personal demon.

620
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,520
In hell, you just don't get tortured physically,

621
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,621
you also get tortured mentally by creatures

622
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:39,803
birthed from your subconscious fears.

623
00:35:41,387 --> 00:35:49,990
Blend shapes on the arms were also there to kind of create that nice noodly shape.

624
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,871
We also added a mission layer to the bar to shader to help with glowing mask

625
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:57,832
and other props like Christmas lights and lampshades.

626
00:35:57,832 --> 00:36:02,214
With animation, we wanted to push the timing, acting, and hilarity.

627
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:07,195
Here's one of our party demons, Asmodeus, doing the running man.

628
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,610
Now let's look at both environment and characters

629
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,312
working well together at our vertical slice first in IZARD.

630
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:22,493
The bartender shader and the bartoon shader in action.

631
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:38,680
With one of our three little words being alive,

632
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,421
how do we design all the NPC crowd characters?

633
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:52,006
We had the idea of demons wearing masks and glowing eyes to visually represent them and tie them to this world.

634
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:57,670
We also played with different proportions to vary their beltline or hip height.

635
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:03,635
We also gave them unifying skin color but grounded them by adding clothing.

636
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:08,599
In contrast, humans have dot eyes and have a variety of skin tones and outfits.

637
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:26,340
We created a variation of horns and mask types for demons.

638
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,941
We referenced a lot of different outfits

639
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:34,283
that span across different times and cultures.

640
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:35,964
We were able to scale out each rig type

641
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,725
by having a variation of hair props and texture swaps

642
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,706
as well as changing your body mass with blend shapes.

643
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:46,549
Later on, we started to give them cause of death props

644
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,770
for just interesting gags.

645
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,710
So another challenge was managing the crowd

646
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,131
in NPC characters.

647
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:56,812
How do we make our environments look alive?

648
00:37:56,812 --> 00:38:01,493
Aaron Cheney, one of our engineers,

649
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:02,953
created a dynamic crowd system.

650
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:12,008
So the dynamic crowd system leveraged control,

651
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:15,051
randomness to populate hell in an automated,

652
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:17,353
naturalistic way while staying out of the player's way.

653
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:21,796
With our dynamic crowd system,

654
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:24,518
we also wanted to avoid characters walking

655
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,040
and standing in front of the camera view.

656
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,823
It's comedic, but we needed more control

657
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,584
when staging these AI characters.

658
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,323
So basically we had to Marie Kondo some scenes.

659
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:41,064
We had a combination of dynamic crowds

660
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:42,645
and static characters that sparked joy.

661
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:47,187
I created some rule sets for our game designers to follow

662
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:50,309
and keep in mind when looking and hooking up scenes.

663
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,890
Now that all the assets are made,

664
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,073
it was critical to have the animations acting in staging

665
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:58,013
to have a convincing performance.

666
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,554
For eye tracing,

667
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,787
We wanted the crowds to react to our player characters.

668
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,409
If our characters toast or cheers,

669
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:12,970
demons and humans in certain proximity

670
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,471
will also start to cheers with you.

671
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:17,012
So similar to Oxenfree,

672
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:19,854
we never try to take player control away,

673
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:26,137
like an in-game cutscene would do.

674
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:28,438
Crowd placement have a purpose and story

675
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:29,739
to really sell the world of Hell.

676
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,204
For example, the scene was posed

677
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,706
with barbecuing demons on the left,

678
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,928
and ultimately you would have NPCs standing in line

679
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:39,549
for hell tacos.

680
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:44,033
On the far right, you have a drunk demon throwing up,

681
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,636
and another picking a pick and tweeting it about

682
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:49,038
and posting it on Bicker.

683
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,240
Bicker is our version of Twitter in the game.

684
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,741
We also created a consistent camera guide

685
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,221
to manage height, distance of our camera

686
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:03,341
to our player characters.

687
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:08,443
The game of beer pong and PC characters

688
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:10,683
pay attention to the main characters

689
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:13,964
as well as to react to who's winning or losing.

690
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:17,425
In After Party, you can drink, trash talk,

691
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,365
and play beer pong all at the same time.

692
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:30,264
Here's where staging our player characters,

693
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:32,145
dynamic crowd system, static characters,

694
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:43,049
environment playing a role in making the scene work.

695
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,610
My job as art director is to keep track

696
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,210
of each thing that we build and design.

697
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,732
I really follow it through from the beginning

698
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:50,712
to the end of production.

699
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:03,691
So art style, by finding creative workflows

700
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:06,034
and bringing concept artists more into the production,

701
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:07,795
it really helped bridge the gap

702
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,176
in concept art and in-game art.

703
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,599
We were able to solve our art problem

704
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,181
by bringing all the engineers and designers together.

705
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,802
Technique, have super smart engineers and designers.

706
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,234
to have them on your side, that they understand

707
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:31,756
shader work, dynamic card systems, game design limitations

708
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,898
that helped us create the game successfully.

709
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:37,380
Bringing them into the fold and explaining

710
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,921
the technical problems helped bridge the gap

711
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:40,722
between concept art and game art.

712
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:46,125
Scope, create a game that fits your budget and timeline.

713
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:49,888
Always weigh the risk of adding too many features.

714
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:53,410
We were ambitious in making a bigger game than Oxenfree,

715
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,110
but we succeeded.

716
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:58,886
It took a while to get there, but we definitely

717
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:01,567
overscoped a tiny bit on this game.

718
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:05,428
Skill set and team size.

719
00:42:05,428 --> 00:42:09,029
Lean on your team's strengths to empower, challenge,

720
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,769
and nurture a positive working environment.

721
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,610
Artists learning from each other,

722
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,011
scale the team to the proper scope of the project.

723
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:18,631
With our concept artists working in production,

724
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:20,652
they were able to have more footprint in the game.

725
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:26,799
Keep it small and simple.

726
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:29,700
Make a simple game with a few mechanics.

727
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,942
Prototype them early and make sure

728
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,383
they hit all your design pillars.

729
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:38,384
I think starting with a small vertical slice

730
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:40,465
would have helped us spot troubled waters very early.

731
00:42:40,465 --> 00:42:43,806
Failure, don't be afraid to fail.

732
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,747
Failure is part of success.

733
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:48,228
We were honest and supported each other

734
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:49,269
in finding solutions.

735
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:52,090
So there were no egos at all in pointing fingers

736
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:52,990
in who made a mistake.

737
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:56,746
we banded together as a team to find a solution

738
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:58,568
in creating the new technique and pipeline.

739
00:42:58,568 --> 00:42:59,588
Collaborate and communicate.

740
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:05,633
Don't be afraid to raise a red flag when problems arise.

741
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:10,817
Be open to learn from each other as team members.

742
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:12,939
Together, find creative ways to solve that problem.

743
00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:16,001
You know, don't be married to anything that you create.

744
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,823
Be open to change and things being cut.

745
00:43:18,823 --> 00:43:20,524
Old monitors were just too precious

746
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,546
and we weren't able to use any of them.

747
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:27,580
Focus, with the three little words,

748
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,941
it helped us check ourselves when it came to

749
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:30,062
exchanges about tone, art, and design.

750
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,464
It kept us on the right track.

751
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:34,107
Do you guys remember the three little words?

752
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:39,252
We were able to succeed in creating a world

753
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:40,853
that feels comedic.

754
00:43:57,976 --> 00:44:00,798
I know Brian Cannon, our legionnaire, is probably freaking out right now because of all the

755
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:03,220
draw calls in the game, but the game has to look alive, even though dead in hell.

756
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,821
A story of friendship that lasts through time.

757
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:07,983
Seriously though, at Knight School, we try to create sincere stories.

758
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,692
and create characters everyone resonates with.

759
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:29,412
So, sincerely yours, Ruel.

760
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:30,653
Thank you GDC.

761
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:30,913
Thank you.

762
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:31,433
Thank you.

763
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:31,633
Thank you.

764
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:31,914
Thank you.

765
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:32,574
Thank you.

766
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:33,414
Thank you.

767
00:44:33,414 --> 00:44:34,915
Thank you.

768
00:44:34,915 --> 00:44:35,216
Thank you.

769
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:35,476
Thank you.

770
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:45,702
Thank you.

771
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:46,202
Thank you.

772
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:47,163
Thank you.

773
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:50,044
So please follow us on Twitter at Night Schoolers,

774
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:51,965
Instagram, Night School Studio, Instagram at Ruzila.

775
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:55,007
So I guess we have Q&A sessions right now.

776
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:01,150
If you guys have any questions, you can, I guess,

777
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,670
step up to the mic.

778
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,750
Hi.

779
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:11,865
This was a really great talk, thank you.

780
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:15,606
I was just wondering, you talked a lot about the shader work

781
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:18,367
that goes into creating the lighting effects

782
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:22,028
and the textures for all the models.

783
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:24,169
What shader editor did you guys use?

784
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:28,850
Did you use like ShaderForge, or do your artists just

785
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,951
brute force the shader code?

786
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:38,243
I think Brian, our lead engineer, just kind of used standard Unity shader and kind of

787
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:45,168
hacked into it and started to write a custom script that enabled the extra texture input

788
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,150
in the standard shader.

789
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:47,270
Cool.

790
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,530
Thank you.

791
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:47,790
Great, thanks.

792
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,960
I guess I'll ask a question.

793
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,000
So this might be out of the scope of the talk today,

794
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,842
but I know in the Mr. Robot game as well as Oxenfree,

795
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:10,622
there were elements of ARGs that were leading up

796
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:11,903
for the marketing of the game,

797
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,003
and I was wondering if that expanded to any point

798
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,904
as far as this game goes.

799
00:46:15,904 --> 00:46:16,644
Oh, an ARG.

800
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:20,045
Yeah, the Oxenfree ARG was a very specific

801
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:23,447
and interesting, fun extension of the game.

802
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,607
I'm not sure, maybe.

803
00:46:26,172 --> 00:46:26,532
Thank you.

804
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:27,333
Perhaps, John.

805
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,093
Perhaps.

806
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:29,254
Probably.

807
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:30,315
Great question.

808
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:32,096
Anybody else?

809
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:32,936
Questions?

810
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:46,890
Cool, thank you so much.

811
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,836
There's gonna be a survey at the end of this.

812
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:51,959
You guys will probably get emails.

813
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,123
You can also catch me if you wanna ask a few more questions.

814
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:54,985
I'll be across the hall.

815
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:58,231
But thank you very much for showing up to my talk.

816
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:58,631
Thank you.
