1
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:08,197
Today we're talking about paid user acquisition.

2
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:10,761
It's a scrappy and practical guide.

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,321
I'm Mike.

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:13,324
I'm the CEO of Ride & Horse Games.

5
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,436
There is one person who works at Iron Horse Games, and it's me.

6
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:20,036
I'm a publisher of games on iOS and Android,

7
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:23,877
and we've generated 11 million installs across 19 titles

8
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:25,677
in the last year alone.

9
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:28,778
Most of that's on Google Play, and most of that

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,319
is being driven as a result of paid user acquisition

11
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:34,219
that we're doing across titles.

12
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,339
I predominantly publish idle games

13
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,520
for those who are curious about the genre.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,440
Below are some of the titles that I've

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,540
published in the last year.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,222
So what am I going to talk about?

17
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,783
Marketing, in short.

18
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,805
More broadly, I'm going to be talking

19
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:50,587
about marketing in three phases on Google Play.

20
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:51,848
So open beta, launch, and live.

21
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:54,811
Each of them have a different set of rules and strategies

22
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:55,631
that apply to them.

23
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:58,053
And I'm going to walk you through how I approach

24
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,575
each of those different phases.

25
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,297
Apple's a little bit more simplistic.

26
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:06,180
So I'm going to be talking about marketing in the live phase

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,701
on Apple.

28
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,282
And I'm going to give some tips and tricks and pointers

29
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,624
about effectively marketing with Facebook and Unity.

30
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:12,747
Below you can see two of the titles.

31
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:15,488
One has a tag for beta, and it's titled Open Beta.

32
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,228
And the other one doesn't, because that title's live.

33
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:22,070
So I'm focusing on Google Play primarily today.

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,612
And the reason why is pretty self-explanatory.

35
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:29,213
Google Play organic installs are significantly larger,

36
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:32,255
in my experience, than Apple's organic installs.

37
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:37,803
This means two things practically when you start thinking about it from a marketing perspective.

38
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:47,987
The first is, and the most positive is, your return on investment can be significantly higher from your user acquisition on Google Play relative to Apple.

39
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:54,409
The not-so-rosy scenario is that you have more of a safety net on Google Play than you do on Apple.

40
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:58,090
As organic installs that are generated from your marketing spend...

41
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:05,092
can help save your bacon if you find that your marketing campaigns aren't net neutral

42
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,693
or ROI positive.

43
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:14,662
So a quick overview about Open Beta for Google Play.

44
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:18,286
So in the past, Open Beta used to be treated as a test market.

45
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,248
It's really, really important that you

46
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:21,289
don't continue to do this.

47
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:24,191
If you need to do bug testing, you

48
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,814
need to make sure in-app purchases or ads are working.

49
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,477
Do a larger closed beta on Google Play

50
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:31,419
and get users in to make sure that it's stable.

51
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,002
The reason why is that the users that you can generate in Open Beta are significant

52
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:40,624
in terms of both the volume but also the value that they drive.

53
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:46,708
So wasting those users on a game that either isn't stable or you're not quite sure about

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,209
monetization and retention.

55
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,516
or your ads aren't particularly working well,

56
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:52,998
is a huge missed opportunity.

57
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:56,701
Open beta is a really important period for Iron Horse games.

58
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,441
So don't waste it.

59
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,682
The second one is keywords.

60
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:02,766
Keywords are one of those things that everyone

61
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,827
talks about quite a bit.

62
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:07,470
And they're really important, particularly in open beta.

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,551
And it's a critical part of the strategy.

64
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:11,232
for Open Beta.

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,773
So that's strategy, and I'm going

66
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:14,893
to walk through each of these steps in turn.

67
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,274
It's the most complicated thing that we're

68
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:21,795
going to talk about today, but it has a lot of value to it.

69
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:24,976
So the first is choosing and optimizing the keywords

70
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,816
that you're going to use for your game.

71
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,336
So we'll walk through how you do that.

72
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,997
Then you're going to be marketing your game

73
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:32,757
to increase organic installs from those keywords.

74
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,198
Specifically, what you're doing is

75
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:36,718
you're marketing your game to increase rank

76
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:40,239
on keywords, which then generate more organic installs.

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,421
And then you're compiling all these results together

78
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:48,063
to make a pitch to Google Play for featuring in early access.

79
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:50,984
And for folks who don't know, in open beta

80
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:53,166
there is a feature that you can get,

81
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,627
and it's an early access collection.

82
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:58,368
So it's a list of games that the Google Play team

83
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,249
is deemed worthy of featuring.

84
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:03,071
So you get significantly increased exposure and installs

85
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:03,711
as a result of it.

86
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,772
But the important thing is you have

87
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:08,213
to make a case as to why they should feature the game

88
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:08,773
and support you.

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,205
So how many installs can you get from ASL?

90
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,289
On a title that had no early access feature,

91
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,551
7,000 out of my 13,000 installs

92
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,955
that came into the game organically in a month

93
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:22,576
came from search traffic.

94
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,520
On a title that did have an early access feature,

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,902
15,000 out of 31,000 organic installs

96
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:29,004
came into the game in a month.

97
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,332
What's important to note here is the volumes aren't, I mean,

98
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:37,356
they're nothing to write home about yet, but the quality is.

99
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:42,201
Search and ASO installs are the most valuable users

100
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:45,405
that I've acquired in my game in open beta.

101
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:47,507
So they are every bit as valuable as users

102
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:50,630
that I've acquired via user acquisition,

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,412
and they're significantly more valuable.

104
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:59,554
than organic users, particularly when you start looking at early access featuring, which

105
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,795
means you get a lot more traffic.

106
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:06,540
So talking about the steps of how to actually do this, the first one is choosing your keywords.

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,942
This one's pretty basic.

108
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:13,506
When you're trying to figure out which keywords to use, I typically use a combination of common

109
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,848
sense and then also look at what my competitors are doing.

110
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,246
So from a common sense perspective,

111
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,749
if you have a tower defense game,

112
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:22,133
there's a pretty good chance that you want

113
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,397
two of your keywords to be tower and defense,

114
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:25,038
tower defense combined.

115
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,661
I know it's a shocking revelation,

116
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:30,026
but those are some keywords that you should chase after.

117
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:35,795
Figuring out which keywords are good is a whole other matter entirely, and this requires

118
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,436
quite a bit of trial and error.

119
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:41,119
So you can use SensorTower, and I use SensorTower, and there are a number of tools out there

120
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,160
that are free.

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,543
SensorTower is free up to a certain point.

122
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:49,027
But essentially what they do is they give you an approximation of the amount of traffic

123
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:51,309
that you can get from a particular keyword.

124
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,111
And then it can also show you the difficulty.

125
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:58,035
So if it's a nine or above, it's going to be really challenging to get a, to rank in

126
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,276
that keyword.

127
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,319
Um, typically from a traffic perspective, you want to be five, six, seven.

128
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,780
It's usually a pretty good rate there.

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,125
You also want to be choosing three to five different keywords to focus on.

130
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,107
Um, the reason is a little depressing.

131
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:13,730
It's because most of your keywords aren't going to work.

132
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,713
The reality of it is each game's a little bit different,

133
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,294
and when somebody's searching tower defense,

134
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:25,035
they may not choose your game based solely on the icon

135
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,937
or some strange thing that you did with the title,

136
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,077
so you need to hedge your bets

137
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,938
and have a couple keywords that you're focusing on.

138
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,921
because most of them aren't going to work out.

139
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,662
So optimizing your keywords,

140
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,604
this one has required a lot of trial and error on my part,

141
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,485
and it's something that I'm pretty proud

142
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,727
to have figured out some small element of.

143
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:47,889
So keywords are composed of kind of a keyword bank.

144
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,432
So your bundle ID, description, short description,

145
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,073
title and subtitle all form a word bank, right?

146
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,275
And your keywords are pulled from that word bank.

147
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,140
And what you want to be focusing here on

148
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,122
is not the number of times you're mentioning a keyword,

149
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,904
but the density of that keyword relative to the overall number

150
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,805
of words in your description.

151
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:11,067
For instance, this is my game on Civil War below.

152
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:15,010
And the word card has a density of 3%.

153
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,212
It's like 3% of all words in that keyword bank.

154
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,934
is card.

155
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,315
And the reason for that is I really

156
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,576
want people searching card to find my game.

157
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,937
App Tweak is the tool I use for this.

158
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,678
This is a free tool.

159
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,978
They have a keyword density tool that's really great.

160
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:36,059
You can also see which keyword density

161
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,741
your competitors are using to figure things out.

162
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,942
So this step is split into two phases,

163
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:43,062
and I've done both.

164
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,963
So the first step, if you're fortunate enough

165
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,904
to be in this position, is how you do marketing

166
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:47,524
when you have money.

167
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:50,757
The second step, which is the reality for a lot of folks

168
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:52,218
who are starting out marketing, is

169
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,761
how you market when you don't have any money.

170
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,183
Both are pretty interesting for different reasons.

171
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,106
The first thing you want to do is get an attribution partner

172
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,127
in the game.

173
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,969
This is an SDK that tracks where your installs are coming from

174
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:04,810
and helps assign value.

175
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,394
These are all mostly the same these days.

176
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:12,017
Adjust, Coachava, AppsFlyer, they all more or less

177
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:12,517
offer.

178
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,039
The same types of services.

179
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,863
The key difference is the level of service

180
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,686
that you get from the partner

181
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,129
relative to the size of your business.

182
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,512
So for me, when I started, I was a very small business.

183
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,756
I'm used to being ignored when you're a small business.

184
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,458
I think folks can relate to that.

185
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,301
That never happened with AppsFlyer.

186
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,722
very basic questions, they would always answer it as if I were a million-dollar partner.

187
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,944
I'm paying them a huge amount of money.

188
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,505
So I can't endorse them strongly enough.

189
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,566
I think AppSolar is great.

190
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,927
I use Facebook and Unity to start my campaigns.

191
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,888
There are a couple reasons for this.

192
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:48,010
One, the traffic is high quality, and two, it's under your control.

193
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,252
You don't have to talk to anybody at Facebook or Unity to kick these campaigns off.

194
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,293
You can just do it yourself.

195
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:56,976
And with AppsFlyer, you don't have to put in the Unity or Facebook SDKs or any of that

196
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:57,757
stuff.

197
00:08:57,757 --> 00:09:01,220
You can just put AppsFlyer in and that takes care of the attribution piece for you.

198
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,244
Typically you're spending $50 to $100 a day, so you're not breaking the bank here to acquire

199
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,365
these users.

200
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,286
Targeting should really be focused.

201
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:13,790
One, you can only do targeting on Facebook at the start, and then two, it should really

202
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,293
be focused around the types of users that are in the genre of game that you're working

203
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:17,333
on.

204
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,923
I focus on tier one markets for my games,

205
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,264
depending on the audience you appeal to.

206
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,385
You may wanna change that up,

207
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:27,046
but for me that's US, UK, Germany, France,

208
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,787
Canada, and Australia.

209
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,810
So how do you market without any money?

210
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,291
There are two ways to do it.

211
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,713
In my experience, I've done them both.

212
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,755
The first one is you can get an integration bonus.

213
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,875
So this can be anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000

214
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,016
from an ad partner.

215
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,498
The way that this works, and it's complicated,

216
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:46,879
is you go to the ad partner and say,

217
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,820
I want to put your ads in the game.

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,681
And they're like, great, here's the SDK.

219
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,563
You say, not so fast, give me $20,000.

220
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:52,943
And they say, OK.

221
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:58,447
The reality of the situation is the conversation

222
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,088
is actually very close to that.

223
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:05,728
Ask for some advertising credits, and typically you can get anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000

224
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:10,792
in free advertising just for getting their SDK in the game and showing off your ads.

225
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,676
If you have any kind of background in games, they're usually jumping at the chance, and

226
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:18,039
they really care about getting new partners to integrate their ads.

227
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,260
So there's no harm in asking.

228
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,040
If they say no...

229
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,227
move on to the next partner and ask them.

230
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:24,569
The second way to do this, and again,

231
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:25,870
this is gonna be really complicated,

232
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,712
is getting a line of credit from marketing partners.

233
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,074
Again, the way that this one works,

234
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:33,177
is you say, hey, I want a line of credit.

235
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,859
And they say, okay.

236
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:38,042
And then you get a line of credit

237
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:38,702
for either 50 or $100,000.

238
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:40,904
The key with a line of credit

239
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,026
is you have to pay that money back.

240
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,348
So be careful, because anything you spend,

241
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:47,530
you're going to have to pay back for them.

242
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,234
I've had lines of credit extended through five marketing

243
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:55,998
partners with no background or credit checks

244
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:58,140
for a total of a few million dollars.

245
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,464
It's as simple as asking for it.

246
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,128
So from this step, once you have your marketing going

247
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,151
on Facebook and Unity, you can start monitoring your keywords.

248
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,733
So something really great happened

249
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,494
on the Google Play Developer Console last year

250
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,936
that I think a lot of people missed.

251
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,278
You can actually see how many search installs

252
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,781
you're getting out of your total organics.

253
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:22,104
So if you go to the Dev Console and User Acquisition

254
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,807
and look at Search, you can see the total number of installs.

255
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,649
Look at the red arrow, and you should be able to see it.

256
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,730
So the things that you're looking for here

257
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,551
are volume and quality.

258
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:34,773
So if your volume isn't looking like the volume

259
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:37,295
that I quoted in an earlier slide,

260
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,717
there are two things that are wrong.

261
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:43,179
So one is you need more user acquisition

262
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,740
to be able to chart in a particular keyword,

263
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,223
or that keyword is not resonating with your game.

264
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:51,104
So using the tower defense example,

265
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:53,745
if you have a game that's about tower defense,

266
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:56,227
but the icon looks like it's a casual match three,

267
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,250
There's going to be a lot of cognitive dissonance

268
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,892
for people searching, and they're probably

269
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:00,974
not going to download your game.

270
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,418
So you want that to be a holistic package

271
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:07,644
with the title, screenshots, and icon reinforcing what

272
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,087
the genre of the game is about.

273
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,481
If you're having quality issues, you need to change keywords.

274
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,062
Different keywords have different qualities.

275
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:19,203
So I've seen keywords with very low ARPUs

276
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,983
driving users in the game.

277
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,524
I've seen keywords with very high ARPUs

278
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,664
driving users in the game.

279
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,445
This is trial and error.

280
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,445
And really looking at what competitors are doing

281
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,566
for leg up here as well.

282
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:35,569
Troubleshooting is either changing keywords, increasing your marketing, or

283
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,331
mixing around the density to increase density on a particular keyword. I always

284
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:44,473
target the top 10 or 15 in terms of a keyword. It's attainable, it's easy, it

285
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,895
generates organic installs and those organic installs are really valuable.

286
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:53,657
So once you've got your keyword installs floating in,

287
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,438
and you have marketing going, you're

288
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,779
also going to apply for early access.

289
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,522
So this is kind of the culmination

290
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,643
of the open beta process.

291
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:04,125
Google's a business, and what they care about

292
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,007
is return on investment for their investment.

293
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:10,049
So when they're thinking about where they're going to put their features, what they're

294
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:14,991
really choosing is like, does Mike have the game with the highest RPU this week?

295
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:18,333
And is he supporting it as fully as these other partners are?

296
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,735
So they're making a differentiation between you and other partners in your competing.

297
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,196
So you need to make that case.

298
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,596
And the case really needs to be around.

299
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:30,698
the support that you're giving the game from a marketing

300
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:33,559
perspective, the growth that you've seen and driven

301
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,000
on your own, but also the potential.

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,760
So far, our pool is $0.50.

303
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,900
If we had another 50,000 installs,

304
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,961
that would be a great business for both of us.

305
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:41,661
So make that case.

306
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,822
Don't be shy about talking about the efforts

307
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,483
that you made to grow the game to that point.

308
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,943
Google will listen.

309
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,504
So moving on to the launch step.

310
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,264
This is probably the most important part

311
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,405
of the presentation today.

312
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,285
It's the one you should pay the closest attention to.

313
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,832
This window lasts 30 days.

314
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:02,195
And it begins the moment that you push from open beta

315
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:02,795
to production.

316
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:06,897
During this time, your organic to paid ratios

317
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,339
are going to be incredibly inflated,

318
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,380
the most inflated you've ever seen for the game

319
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,481
and will ever see for the game.

320
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:16,205
So this can be as high as four organic installs

321
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:17,287
for every paid install.

322
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,069
And this is without a feature.

323
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,331
So forget about features for the moment.

324
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:24,315
We're talking about if you buy one install,

325
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,077
you're generating three to four installs

326
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:27,499
organically in this first 30-day window.

327
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:31,965
So for me, this is one below where we spent lightly,

328
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,606
and it was a one to two ratio for the first 30 days.

329
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:38,528
So the launch strategy here is much simpler.

330
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,448
You wanna spend money in the first 30 days,

331
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:43,250
and you wanna spend as much as you possibly can

332
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,910
to generate as many organics as you can.

333
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,354
Apple is a little bit different.

334
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,495
So when you spend, you move up on charts,

335
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,315
and it increases visibility.

336
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:54,096
On Google, when you spend, it increases visibility

337
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,816
through the lists in the stores.

338
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:59,498
So all the lists that you're seeing here

339
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,159
are where you're going to see your games icon populated.

340
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,779
And it can generate a significant amount of installs.

341
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,480
How many installs?

342
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,841
So this is averaged across multiple titles.

343
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,661
Acquired 75,000 installs on average,

344
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,222
generated 175,000 installs organically.

345
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:19,383
without any feature from Google Play.

346
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,305
The cost of those 75,000 installs

347
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,167
is obviously variable depending on the strategy

348
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,888
that you're using.

349
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:27,369
But you can get that for as low as $25,000

350
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:30,411
if you're really scrappy with your install sources.

351
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:35,314
Step one, and this is the most important step,

352
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:38,076
is you need to learn from open beta.

353
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:40,357
If you're going to spend $25,000 or even $75,000

354
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,879
on paid user acquisition in the launch window,

355
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:44,932
you need to know what you're doing.

356
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,033
And the best way to learn is in open beta.

357
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,795
So figure out which marketing creative was best for you,

358
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:54,256
which channels and targeting had the highest ROI.

359
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,637
So this is really important, I think.

360
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:59,539
When you talk about open beta and think about testing,

361
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,160
there actually is one thing you wanna be testing,

362
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,100
and that's for marketing creative and strategy.

363
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,061
And you wanna be rock solid on that

364
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,842
before you move on to this phase.

365
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,703
You also wanna be decently capitalized,

366
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,264
so don't spend all that money that you make in open beta.

367
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:15,026
You also want to make sure that your keyword's in good shape

368
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:17,108
for launch because those can be significant contributors

369
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:17,889
of traffic as well.

370
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:20,671
Step two is choosing your marketing partners.

371
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:23,434
So for me, my two main partners are Unity and Facebook.

372
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,097
I also use Tapjoy and IronSource.

373
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:29,100
Unity and Facebook are self-service and great.

374
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,562
You need a little bit of help on setup

375
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,624
with Tapjoy and IronSource, but the quality is great.

376
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:37,066
So I'm going to go through Unity and Facebook in detail with some tips,

377
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,666
but first some facts.

378
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,667
On Unity, it's not going to exceed your budget or your bid.

379
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,587
So this is actually really great if you're doing scrappy marketing

380
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,808
because you'll wake up one day and instead of blowing the budget out

381
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,509
and having overspent doing user acquisition,

382
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,149
your traffic will just disappear, right?

383
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:55,110
So your bids won't go up.

384
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,592
they will just disappear entirely.

385
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,294
It only uses video creatives,

386
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:00,875
so it's important to get as many of those

387
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,916
generated as possible.

388
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,319
I typically have three to four different video ads

389
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,740
that I'm running on a per game basis,

390
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,343
and they don't have to be wildly different, right?

391
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,145
You don't need custom, different video ads.

392
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,227
You can do slight variations.

393
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,370
And you can get a line of credit from Unity.

394
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,472
They're really great to work with in that regard.

395
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:16,993
So some tips.

396
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:21,258
These are things that have cost a decent amount of money

397
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:21,879
for me to learn.

398
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,320
Hopefully they're helpful to you.

399
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,665
So blind bidding around your ARPU.

400
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,668
In the launch window, you have such an increased volume

401
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:32,291
of organic installs as a result of your marketing.

402
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:37,355
that you want to be driving as much paid acquisition as you can.

403
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,356
So blind bidding is a great way to do that.

404
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:42,678
So if you have a $0.50 ARPU from Unity users,

405
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:48,562
and you know that from Open Beta, you may be able to drive,

406
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:51,164
let's say, 10 installs at that $0.50 bid, right?

407
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:53,145
You may find that if you bid a little bit lower,

408
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,967
so blind bid down by $0.10, see what happens.

409
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,328
Maybe it's the same.

410
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:58,609
Maybe you get 50 installs for that.

411
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:03,711
What I've found is that if you increase that bid to 75 cents, 80 cents, 90 cents, you can

412
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:05,192
see multiples of installs.

413
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:12,234
So there are these kind of weird hidden trip lines on Unity around bids that can unleash

414
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:18,036
way, way larger volumes of traffic than what you would see if you just bid around your

415
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:18,197
RPO.

416
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,518
And you may make that calculation in your head to say, you know what?

417
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,423
It's better for me to lose 10 cents on a user during the launch window if I'm driving

418
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:31,966
three or four organic installs for every user.

419
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:34,028
Like you're comfortable with that trade-off.

420
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:38,252
But the only way to know is really to play around with that bid per geo, particularly

421
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:38,732
in the US.

422
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,496
Slight creative variations.

423
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,618
So one of the things that most people

424
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,840
who are doing paid user acquisition struggle with

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,061
is a rise in CPI.

426
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:50,424
I mean, this is natural.

427
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:53,287
People are getting exposed to your ads.

428
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:55,829
They're being less, they become less inclined

429
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,591
to download them if they pass on your ad creative

430
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:58,592
the first time through.

431
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,454
A great way to fight against this

432
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,415
isn't to increase your bid, it's to add new creative.

433
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,958
Even if that creative performs poorly

434
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,419
relative to your main.

435
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,486
video, adding new creative artificially triggers Unity's system to give you an impression

436
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:12,886
bump.

437
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,049
Because from Unity's perspective, what they're saying is...

438
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:16,985
Well, I'm going to give this ad a good shot.

439
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,325
They don't know if it's a bad ad or not yet.

440
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,666
They have to give you enough impressions to figure it out.

441
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,807
So put up new video.

442
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:25,167
You'll get an impression bump.

443
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,728
You'll keep your bids the same.

444
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:28,309
And you'll get traffic at the same bid

445
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,870
without having to increase your bids.

446
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,290
I do this a lot.

447
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,711
And I do it with slight variations of my video

448
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:36,451
creative.

449
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:42,279
If you do it too much, you're going to hear from your Unity rep and you really should

450
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,741
experiment with your videos, but this is a great way around constantly raising your bits.

451
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:53,824
Finally share your session and revenue information with Unity because later on they can come

452
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:59,507
up with some really interesting audience targeting for you that has higher ROI with more or less

453
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,787
the same CPI.

454
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,088
So their Day 7 ROA campaigns are great.

455
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,169
Folks aren't using those.

456
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,591
Unity's got some really advanced targeting stuff

457
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,452
that you should be checking out.

458
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:10,532
Step two, Facebook.

459
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,493
So they won't exceed your budget,

460
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,655
but boy, they'll exceed your bid.

461
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,717
So if anyone here has spent on Facebook,

462
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,858
you found out that if you go to bed on a Friday

463
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,659
and you're getting users for 10 cents,

464
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,099
you may wake up on a Saturday

465
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,280
if you're doing low-cost bidding

466
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,781
and those users now cost a dollar.

467
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,150
So you have to be very careful, especially with low-cost bidding and the amount of budget

468
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,661
that you're allocating for your campaign so that you don't find yourself quickly underwater.

469
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:36,557
They use display and video ads.

470
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,158
You can get a line of credit.

471
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:42,060
The Facebook team has actually been really great to work with

472
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,341
from a small developer standpoint,

473
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:46,162
even when I was spending significantly less

474
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,682
than I was spending now.

475
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:48,503
So some tips here.

476
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,944
Facebook's got a honeymoon period.

477
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:55,546
So when you have a new job, a new girlfriend or boyfriend,

478
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,928
everything is wonderful for the first couple of months.

479
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,109
Then you find out what it's really like.

480
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:01,970
Facebook's the same way.

481
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,872
So the first two months, you're going to see amazing CPIs.

482
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,773
And in your mind, you're going to say, man,

483
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,614
I'm going to be able to spend four days on Facebook

484
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:10,034
with $0.20 CPIs.

485
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,015
This is amazing.

486
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:12,135
That goes away.

487
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:15,737
So you have a limited period of time

488
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:17,318
where you're going to get those CPIs.

489
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:22,621
And once you have run out that clock, you can't go back.

490
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:28,762
So you want to make sure that you are spending carefully on Facebook, particularly in open

491
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:34,064
beta because you don't want to run out your honeymoon outside of the launch window.

492
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:38,465
Another tip, and this is one that I think people miss all the time, display ads are

493
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,465
just fine.

494
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,946
I mean, video ads are really popular, playable ads are really popular.

495
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:48,507
The bread and butter of my entire business, static display ads.

496
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:53,625
Most of my advertising on Facebook comes through static display ads. They work just fine.

497
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,888
CTRs are comparable with video ads, CPIs are even less.

498
00:21:56,888 --> 00:22:00,631
They are the workhorse of my marketing campaigns on Facebook.

499
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:08,298
And another weird one on Facebook is low-cost bidding. So low-cost bidding essentially, I've mentioned it a couple times,

500
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:11,981
but it's where you allow Facebook to determine what the CPI is going to be for your campaign.

501
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:14,363
So you allow their algorithm to figure it out for you.

502
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:18,579
This is great during the honeymoon period and after it, it is not great.

503
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,241
Your CPIs will escalate quickly.

504
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:24,488
So the strategy for dealing with this, start with a low-cost campaign.

505
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:26,791
As soon as your CPIs go up, you put a bid cap on it.

506
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,415
Once you put that bid cap on it, your impressions are going to tank.

507
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:33,604
The thing you then do is take that exact same campaign

508
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,305
with the exact same targeting creatives

509
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:37,885
and you start a new campaign

510
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:41,167
with the bid cap in place at the start.

511
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,567
You will see an impression bump

512
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:44,968
similar to what you saw in Unity

513
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:48,109
and you can do this over and over and over and over again.

514
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:52,107
So it's how you avoid these situations where you have

515
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:57,229
perennial massively large CPIs that are unavoidable.

516
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,491
You keep riding these impression bump waves.

517
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,932
As they peter out, and they will peter out because you

518
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:05,973
can't acquire at those CPIs, do another one, and

519
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,093
then do it again.

520
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:10,977
Over time, the ARPU from those campaigns are going to decay.

521
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,078
So sooner or later, you're going to need

522
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:14,699
to rotate your creative and your targeting,

523
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,381
but this has been an effective strategy for me.

524
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:21,344
So the wonderful days of launch are done.

525
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,106
Your ratios of one paid to three organic are over,

526
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:25,327
but it's still great.

527
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:29,470
For me, I usually see one to two organic installs

528
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,411
for every paid install on Google Play.

529
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:35,355
The thing I'm doing now is I'm using all the data from launch,

530
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,717
all the marketing to make the case for a feature.

531
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:40,140
I actually used to ask for a feature at launch,

532
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,744
which is a risk for myself and it's a risk for Google.

533
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:45,906
They don't know how the game is going to perform.

534
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:48,583
They know I've spent some amount of money on marketing

535
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,723
and had some success, but they really

536
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:52,144
have no idea what the game's true potential is.

537
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:55,025
If I'm doing the marketing in month one,

538
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,426
I'm already showing them, hey, I took the risk.

539
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:01,508
This is the opportunity for the business represented to you.

540
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,529
Like, you don't have to take any risk.

541
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:04,349
I already proved it to you.

542
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:05,910
And the game looks great.

543
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,091
So I'd really love your support with a new and updated feature.

544
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:11,332
This has been a strategy that I transitioned

545
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,213
to four or five months ago.

546
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:14,774
And it's been effective each time I tried.

547
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,835
It's also really worth trying out new marketing partners.

548
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,537
There's a lot of challenge to trying out and integrating

549
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:23,138
new marketing partners, but it's really worthwhile doing it,

550
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:25,639
especially on games that have been around for a while.

551
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:29,741
Recently started marketing with Iron Source on a few games

552
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,702
that I've been marketing actively

553
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,484
for the last seven or eight months.

554
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:36,425
And it's like the first day I've marketed.

555
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,025
The ARPUs are great.

556
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:40,066
CPIs are reasonable.

557
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,868
So the only way you do that is to try marketing partners.

558
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:43,028
I tried.

559
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:45,849
five other partners before I found one that works.

560
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,770
So there's going to be a lot of churn in that process.

561
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,751
But try a new one every month.

562
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:53,152
Apple's different, unfortunately, in a bad way.

563
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:56,594
So paid-to-organic ratios on Apple

564
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:59,956
are four to seven paid installs to one organic.

565
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,696
So not awesome.

566
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,018
I don't do any marketing on Apple

567
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:06,919
until I've done a tremendous amount of marketing on Google.

568
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,641
And the reason why is there is no safety net.

569
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,742
So if you lose money on your campaign, you lose money.

570
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,422
period.

571
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:19,483
So with Apple, I use all the targeting and the ARPU targets

572
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,044
that we're working on Google Play

573
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:22,304
and take those over to Apple.

574
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:23,324
It's been pretty effective.

575
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:25,925
The key difference between Apple and Google

576
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:26,945
is that chart positions matter.

577
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:30,646
So the higher you are in games, the more organic installs

578
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:31,986
you're going to see.

579
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,687
Unfortunately, in my experience, it's

580
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,367
not enough to compensate for the cost.

581
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,588
So two months ago, I tried an experiment.

582
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,408
We spent.

583
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:47,638
$4,000 a day to acquire 4,000 installs per day to get the top 300 in games,

584
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:52,364
and it yielded 100 to 200 additional organics per day.

585
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,264
So the current estimates to get to the top 100 in games

586
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,785
is that it's going to require, and this is in the US,

587
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:02,366
it requires 10,000 installs per day just

588
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,747
to get in the top 100 in games.

589
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:07,628
And I'm not sure what organics look like there,

590
00:26:07,628 --> 00:26:09,989
but I know what the cost associated with 10,000

591
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:13,210
paid users per day is quite high.

592
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,970
So you can infer from that what you will.

593
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:16,664
Wrap up.

594
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:19,686
So for me, the most important points to take home,

595
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,447
keywords matter, particularly in open beta,

596
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,448
especially when you don't really know

597
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,409
what the ARPU of your game is going to be.

598
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,170
Any free installs are really helpful.

599
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,631
Marketing during that launch window

600
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,052
has become a critical part of the backbone of my strategy.

601
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:34,913
In a lot of ways, it's replaced.

602
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:38,034
a huge amount of the traffic I used to rely on from Apple

603
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,355
and Google features.

604
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:42,296
And then just generally speaking,

605
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:44,496
Google Play organic installs are significantly higher

606
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,216
than Apple installs.

607
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:47,157
If you're in a unique position where

608
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:48,858
you have a game that has massive ARPUs

609
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,038
and you have an unlimited budget,

610
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,779
you may find that in the top three or five spots

611
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,660
on the games category, this isn't true.

612
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,520
Apple has just.

613
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,979
boundless and endless organic installs.

614
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:03,140
Unfortunately, I haven't done it,

615
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,341
so I can't say that that's the case.

616
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,462
And it is rarefied error to be there.

617
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:07,602
That's it.

618
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:11,803
I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have

619
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:12,663
about anything I said.

620
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:12,943
Thank you.

621
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:26,268
Thanks a lot.

622
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:28,028
Thanks.

623
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,923
But I can hear you just fine.

624
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:35,104
So here's the question.

625
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,684
First of all, great talk.

626
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:37,404
Thank you very much.

627
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:38,065
Thanks for coming.

628
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,605
Yeah, have you tested UAC or AdMobs?

629
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:40,606
I have, yeah.

630
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:43,247
What's your experience there?

631
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,687
Yeah, so the question was.

632
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:46,353
It's not on.

633
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:47,814
So I'll just, oh, there we go.

634
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:49,235
It's back on.

635
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:52,758
The question was, have I tested UAC?

636
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:53,578
UAC is great.

637
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:56,300
So the challenge with UAC is you have

638
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,002
to make a pretty meaty commitment from a spend

639
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,144
standpoint to figure out if it works.

640
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:03,506
And really, it takes about 30 days of spend

641
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,367
to figure out whether or not you're going to see ROI.

642
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:13,552
So, typically, for a UAC test, I'm bidding at $30 to $35 from an eCPM perspective.

643
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:17,694
It doesn't come in at that, but the CPI is high to start.

644
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:21,336
And then I'm spending about $1,000 a day, between $500 and $1,000 a day.

645
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:26,919
If you drop your bid too low on UAC, you stop getting video ad views.

646
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,622
And it's been my experience that video ad views are the thing that's actually driving

647
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:32,803
user acquisition behavior.

648
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:39,787
And then one other note on UAC your ARPUs really need to be in like the 30 to 40 dollar range

649
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:44,190
And your conversion rate needs to be 1 to 3 percent

650
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:53,316
For for UAC really to back out so you need to make sure depth of spend there is there because I haven't really seen CPIs

651
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,737
below like 275

652
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:55,177
Cool

653
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:11,766
You can yeah, just yell and I'll repeat your question

654
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:22,875
Sure. The question was, have I seen any shifts in the last year or two after Facebook acquired

655
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:28,216
Instagram? Yeah, I have. So you can't track this on Google Play, but you can track it

656
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:32,777
on Apple. So Apple splits Instagram traffic out separately from the rest of your Facebook

657
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:37,559
traffic, so you can actually see the return on investment for Instagram users. And in

658
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,759
my games, it was not good.

659
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:46,491
So I actually, while it increases the volume and impressions you can get from Facebook campaigns,

660
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:52,192
the overall quality was decreasing. So on 99% of my campaigns, I don't target

661
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:57,154
Instagram. And my Facebook rep yells at me all the time about it and says the traffic's great,

662
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,675
but I just haven't seen it in the Facebook interface.

663
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:05,796
You can't split it out on Google Play, but I'm kind of assuming that the quality is similar on Android and iOS.

664
00:30:05,796 --> 00:30:06,477
Yeah, no problem.

665
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,740
Great talk. Thank you.

666
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,222
I don't think the mic works.

667
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:13,783
Great talk. Thank you very much.

668
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,204
You were mentioning the

669
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,868
honeymoon period when running ads.

670
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:21,230
Is that honeymoon period reset

671
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,251
per campaign or per

672
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,693
game that you're advertising?

673
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:27,296
Or kind of, what is that honeymoon period

674
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:28,257
associated with?

675
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,001
Sure. The question was, I mentioned the honeymoon period on Facebook ads.

676
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,282
Does it reset per campaign, per account, per...

677
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:38,783
Is there anything that resets it, basically?

678
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:39,083
Right? So, it's...

679
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:45,064
There are two things that trigger it.

680
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:49,865
It's either one to two months with moderate spend,

681
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,665
$20,000 to $30,000 in spend per month.

682
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,766
You get about one to two months there.

683
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:57,027
If you front load all that, which I've done on a recent campaign...

684
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:59,548
that honeymoon period can be three weeks.

685
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:00,769
So it can be really fast.

686
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:04,531
So it's really driven by level of spend as much as time.

687
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:08,613
I think that you can reset it with different ad accounts.

688
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,335
So you might be able to game that system a little bit

689
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:12,515
on the Facebook side.

690
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,176
But I'd be careful with that, too,

691
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,117
because I'm almost certain it breaks

692
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:18,159
Facebook's Terms of Service.

693
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,299
Cool.

694
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,821
Thanks for a great talk.

695
00:31:22,804 --> 00:31:28,348
For our game, the average revenue per iOS user

696
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,470
is roughly double Android.

697
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,951
Have you seen similar things?

698
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,532
And what do you do about that?

699
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:37,435
Yeah, so the question was, are Poohs on iOS or 2x what

700
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:41,258
they are on Google Play?

701
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:44,941
So that's usually related to GeoMix.

702
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:46,602
Particularly on Google Play, you're

703
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,624
seeing a lot of Russian and Brazilian traffic.

704
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,757
organically and you can't control that, right?

705
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,899
So that traffic comes in whether you want it or not.

706
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:59,320
And it typically doesn't have super high ARPU relative

707
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,301
to what you're seeing in the US

708
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,862
and Western European countries.

709
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:05,163
If you break it out by Western geos,

710
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:06,364
it's actually much closer.

711
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:09,525
So when I look at US and Western Europe,

712
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,565
and then I look at US and Western Europe on iOS,

713
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,185
it's significantly higher.

714
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:16,846
It's still higher on iOS than it is on Google Play.

715
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:20,006
But the organics that I can generate with my marketing

716
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:21,887
spend kind of make up for the fact that it's

717
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:23,647
a little bit lower quality.

718
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,107
Hopefully that answers your question.

719
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:25,667
Awesome.

720
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,588
Yes, thank you very much.

721
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:27,628
Great.

722
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,488
I think our time is done.

723
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:30,828
Is that right?

724
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:34,749
I can't see you, but I assume you're saying stop talking.

725
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:34,889
OK.
