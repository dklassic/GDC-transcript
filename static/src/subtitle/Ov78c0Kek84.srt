00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:06,964
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,445
Thank you for coming to an hour long session

3
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:11,505
on the last day of GDC at 10 a.m.

4
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:12,726
I appreciate it.

5
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,527
I'm supposed to say, they told me to say a thing,

6
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:17,187
fuck what do I say?

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:17,467
Shit.

8
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:18,408
No.

9
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:22,469
We are off to a really good start guys.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,751
Don't use flash cause it scares me.

11
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,612
Turn off noise making things.

12
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:30,992
All right.

13
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:32,293
Hi.

14
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:38,999
I'm Leighton Gray, I'm the co-creator, co-writer, and art director, and I guess head daddy of

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,923
Dream Daddy, a dad dating simulator, the dating sim where you play as a hot dad, and your

16
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,205
goal is to meet and romance other hot dads.

17
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:51,730
And today, I'm here to talk to you about something that's really serious and very important,

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,214
and just really close to my heart in a sentimental way, and that's...

19
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:57,395
Oh boy.

20
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:07,584
Don't ruin my gag. No. And that's memes. Or more specifically, how to write and market

21
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:13,229
games for the internet without embarrassing yourself too much. Step one, don't do this.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,471
Let's talk about why.

23
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:20,944
Dream Daddy was a product of the internet and there was a lot of intentionality in how

24
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:25,486
we wrote, designed, and marketed it towards online communities like Tumblr, Twitter, and

25
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:25,946
YouTube.

26
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:29,808
And while we were working on the game, we were kind of making all of these creative

27
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:33,750
choices in a vacuum, unsure if these ideas we had seeded in the game to get people to

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,231
share it would actually work or not.

29
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,754
And when we announced the game and subsequently released it, we finally got to see what worked

30
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,255
and what didn't, and we were thankfully largely successful.

31
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:48,498
We landed ourselves at the top selling game on Steam globally on launch day,

32
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,860
and we were named the third most trending game on Tumblr for 2017,

33
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,762
and knocked Overwatch off the top spot for the first time in months,

34
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:56,703
which was exciting.

35
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,484
And I don't know about you guys,

36
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:01,706
but it was pretty much impossible to go on any social media

37
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:05,368
without seeing a ton of posts about how much people wanted to kiss these dads.

38
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,061
So in this talk, I'm going to break down

39
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,382
how we engineered the game from its inception

40
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:12,963
to be as shareable as possible,

41
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:15,305
and how you can apply these same principles

42
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,466
to your work as well.

43
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,548
And to understand what gets people to share,

44
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:23,391
let's begin by talking about what really, really doesn't.

45
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,733
You may have seen this internal Google document

46
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:29,155
that was leaked a while ago called It's Lit,

47
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,878
which covers what the cool teens think is dank and on fleek.

48
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,379
And if there's one thing I know about cool teens,

49
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,321
it's that the only thing they love more than the Beatles

50
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:44,804
and Coldplay is bowing down to our corporate overlords

51
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,465
by relying on brands to shape their world.

52
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:50,267
As the kids say, SMH.

53
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,230
And because companies follow clueless internal documents

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,671
like this one, they do stuff like this.

55
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:58,573
And this is a whole Twitter account

56
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,394
that just collects brands being horrifically out of touch.

57
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,172
a bunch of grown people sat at a table and were like,

58
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,054
this is our marketing strategy, we're doing great.

59
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:14,118
So obviously nobody likes it when a 35 year old PR dude

60
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,439
tells you that it's on fleek to buy a roast beef sandwich.

61
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,642
And another big issue here is that when brands

62
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,765
do stuff like this, it shows that they're hearing consumers

63
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,286
but they're not actually listening.

64
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,734
And with an ever increasing awareness of and skepticism

65
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,296
towards transparent marketing ploys and pandering,

66
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:32,817
it's more important than ever

67
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,378
to have a deep working understanding

68
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,100
of the community your game is for

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,941
so that you don't get endlessly dunked on

70
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:39,783
by an army of 15 year olds on Twitter.

71
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,126
And we talk about this in Dream Daddy for a little bit

72
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,289
when you ask your teenage daughter to explain memes to you.

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,150
There's Eggie.

74
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,371
So Amanda says, dad, it's complicated.

75
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,912
See, memes are inside jokes shared by a bunch of people

76
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,613
that get less funny the more people do it.

77
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,814
So the problem is that by the time a meme gets to you, dad,

78
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,234
all of us youths have already done the joke to death.

79
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:04,836
And what's worse than that is that movies and TV

80
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,177
and video games will try to jump in on a meme train,

81
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,757
but just based on how long it takes to make them,

82
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:12,138
the meme will be long dead by the time it comes out.

83
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,959
So it just dates it and isn't funny.

84
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,980
And then of course you say, oh shit, what up?

85
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Because we're hacks.

86
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:24,966
So if trying to incorporate memes into your work is the kiss of death, how do we effectively

87
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:29,347
write content that exists adjacent to internet culture without directly referencing it?

88
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:34,048
And how can we take concrete steps to encourage the organic spread of our work?

89
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:38,129
And to answer that question, I'm going to talk about every game developer's favorite

90
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,930
topic, art history.

91
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:41,890
Yay.

92
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,592
And if it's not obvious from literally everything about me.

93
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,967
So modernism was the first major art movement

94
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,428
of the early 20th century.

95
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,190
It came in on the heels of the Romantic movement,

96
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,192
which was all about aestheticizing intense emotion,

97
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,253
and it was extremely melodramatic and lofty.

98
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,516
So in response, modernism focused on defying

99
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,537
the traditional ideas of the 19th century,

100
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:09,079
and this also coincided with the Industrial Revolution.

101
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,301
This movement encouraged artists and writers

102
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,963
to try new things and explore unorthodox ideas

103
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,105
with enthusiasm and to question everything.

104
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:20,095
Artists like Picasso, Duchamp, Kandinsky,

105
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,396
and writers like James Joyce and Marcel Proust

106
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,358
are perfect examples of modernism.

107
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,720
They were all doing things nobody had seen before.

108
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,042
And as we approach the mid to late 20th century,

109
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,383
the reaction to modernism was postmodernism.

110
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:36,185
While modernism was more of an art movement

111
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:36,926
than anything else,

112
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,988
postmodernism was just as much a philosophical movement

113
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,989
intended to critique society and culture

114
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,970
as it was an art movement.

115
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:48,470
And as a whole, postmodernism can be defined by a heavy sense of cynicism and irony towards

116
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,010
everything.

117
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:54,734
There's a huge emphasis on nihilism, the idea that truth is a subjective construct,

118
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,035
and it made things like parody and pastiche popular.

119
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,698
And a big element of postmodernism was intertextuality and references to other media.

120
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:05,921
For instance, Scream is a really great example because it repeatedly references and subverts

121
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,781
horror movie tropes.

122
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:11,664
For postmodernism, just imagine a bunch of artists in black turtlenecks chain-smoking

123
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:13,125
and generally just being miserable.

124
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,046
But remember postmodernism because we will get back to it in a minute.

125
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,248
Because a lot has changed since the postmodern movement started.

126
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,150
And one of the biggest changes has been the advent of the Internet.

127
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,572
Postmodernism doesn't really give us the tools that we need to meaningfully navigate a relationship

128
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:33,414
with current content because the Internet has had such a huge impact on the way that

129
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,175
we create, consume, and share media.

130
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:40,417
And so much of an impact that we're currently experiencing a huge cultural shift from mass

131
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:41,638
media to social media.

132
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,584
We've gone from a top-down model of distribution

133
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,830
to a participatory culture where consumers are not just

134
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,194
consumers of static, unchanging content.

135
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,039
They're people who are reshaping and remixing

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,662
the context and meaning of media.

137
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,653
And the language that currently exists around content

138
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,294
that becomes successful on the internet

139
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:03,235
unnecessarily mystifies this entire process.

140
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,276
When we say something goes viral,

141
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,237
we're robbing both the content creator

142
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,818
and the audience of their agency.

143
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:11,879
Like we're passively infecting each other with content,

144
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,680
which is not how it works.

145
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:16,902
And consulting, marketing, and PR firms

146
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,663
will dangle this concept of going viral above your head

147
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:20,623
to get you to give them money

148
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,724
and to intentionally muddy the process

149
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:24,705
of what it takes to create a successful product.

150
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,328
And we can even track where this kind of thinking originated.

151
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,650
The term meme was introduced in 1976

152
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,192
in Richard Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene,

153
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,233
as the cultural corollary of the gene,

154
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,715
the idea being that a meme propagates itself

155
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,076
in a way similar to genes.

156
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:42,318
And I kid you not, he uses the phrase meme pool,

157
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:44,300
which is a pretty fun mental image.

158
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,383
And this sort of biological metaphor is a big reason

159
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:51,165
why we oversimplify this process down to virality.

160
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:55,308
And of course, memes have been around a long,

161
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,582
a long time before we had a name for them.

162
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:00,923
Humans figuring out how to start fire is a meme.

163
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,863
It did not necessarily look like this,

164
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:03,784
but it is still a meme.

165
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,265
And I'll have you know that I worked really, really hard

166
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:08,925
to get this as artifacted as possible.

167
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:11,646
Idioms are memes.

168
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:12,987
Metaphors are memes.

169
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,407
Tropes in media are memes.

170
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,647
A meme is just an idea,

171
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,168
an idea that can spread and mutate and be improved upon.

172
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,109
Even with classical paintings,

173
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,349
artistic movements are defined

174
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,690
by a certain collection of memes.

175
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,716
Like, guys, I hate to break it to you,

176
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,797
but even the great masters were just doing, like,

177
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,277
really exceptional Jesus fan art.

178
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:33,938
Like, all it's missing is the flower crown.

179
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,240
And in the 19th century, women's scrapbooking culture

180
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,361
revolved around cutting interesting tidbits

181
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,101
out of books and newspapers and collecting them

182
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,242
in a single place so they were easily shareable,

183
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,043
which is pretty much just old-timey Pinterest

184
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,763
down to the weird obsession with mason jars.

185
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:56,157
I mean, one could even say that it's uncanny.

186
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,703
You guys love blasphemy, but you won't stand for dad puns?

187
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:02,685
Okay.

188
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,008
You came to the dream daddy talk.

189
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,389
Did you really think I was not gonna?

190
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,611
All right.

191
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:12,061
My point is, the internet just accelerates behaviors

192
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,042
we were already doing, and we as members

193
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,644
of a network community choose to share content

194
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:17,584
that's meaningful to us.

195
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,966
So instead of placing the onus on this seemingly unknowable

196
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,929
magical phenomenon, virality, it's more productive for us

197
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,931
as game developers to analyze how we can imbue content

198
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:30,152
with the kind of meaning that will compel people to share.

199
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:33,775
And this idea to counter virality is called spreadability.

200
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,556
The intersection of qualities that optimize content

201
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,857
for sharing through social media.

202
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,803
This model recognizes that the driving force

203
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:43,225
behind what we share comes from a social place

204
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,727
and that our lives aren't defined by brands.

205
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:48,369
Rather, we use the media we consume

206
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,891
to facilitate conversations that we're already having,

207
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,813
just like humans have always done with all forms of art

208
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,593
from the beginning of time.

209
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,296
Which brings us back around to art movements.

210
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,638
How can we tap into this collective culture

211
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,519
and figure out what will make people share

212
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,301
when internet culture is so nebulous and ever-shifting?

213
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:06,282
I mean,

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,502
You ever go without checking Twitter for a couple of days and then you come back and

215
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:12,204
you're like, what the fuck is everybody talking about?

216
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,269
Like it's a daunting task and I can often feel like you're trying to hit a moving target.

217
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,614
But by understanding the art movement that we're currently on the cusp of, it can take

218
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:23,615
some of the guesswork out of it.

219
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:30,701
So on a sliding scale of sincerity and cynicism with modernism being very sincere and post-modernism

220
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,401
being very cynical.

221
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,419
What does that mean for the current state of art and philosophy?

222
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,221
How could we possibly describe this emerging culture of media born from the Internet?

223
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:39,182
I don't know.

224
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:40,562
That's the talk.

225
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:40,802
Bye.

226
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,144
I will tell you in a second.

227
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,407
It's metamodernism.

228
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,070
This is the part where I die on stage.

229
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,518
which in a nutshell is a movement defined

230
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,400
by ironic detachment with sincere engagement.

231
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,241
The Metamodernist Manifesto was written

232
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,322
by artist Luke Turner,

233
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:10,804
and the man, the meme, the legend himself, Shia LaBeouf.

234
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:15,466
Here's a basic rundown of the core tenets of metamodernism.

235
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:19,048
It acknowledges that prescribing exclusively

236
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:21,869
to either solely modern or postmodern ideas

237
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,510
limits our ability to tell robust, complex stories.

238
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,640
and that the best storytelling comes from oscillating between two poles,

239
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,841
primarily sincerity and cynicism, but also a highbrow and lowbrow,

240
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,722
optimism and doubt, relativism and truth, etc.

241
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,082
Like, it reflects real life.

242
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,443
Our lives are not just solely one thing or one thing.

243
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:40,883
Like, it's kind of a mixed bag.

244
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,544
And this is where the meta prefix comes from,

245
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:48,685
not in the sense that something is self-aware or self-referential in a meta way,

246
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:50,686
although it can be and often is.

247
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,746
It comes from the word metaxy, meaning an in-betweenness.

248
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:59,725
It also aims to collapse distances between disparate groups of people.

249
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:04,447
It acknowledges the layered identities we present both online and in real life.

250
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:10,910
And finally, it embodies a sense of radical optimism and self-love in the face of decades

251
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,071
of postmodernism's unbridled cynicism.

252
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,533
One of the most notable things about metamodernism is that the parameters are extremely loose.

253
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:24,909
Media doesn't have to ascribe to all these tenets to be considered metamodern, and this

254
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:29,894
idea is commonly referred to in metamodern texts as an affective feeling, since metamodern

255
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:34,458
media often borrows, mutates, and remixes elements from modernism and postmodernism.

256
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:41,203
I like to compare it to early 2000s fashion, but just with less of whatever that is.

257
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:47,411
You can combine and pay homage to many different tropes and feelings to create something totally

258
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:51,194
new that doesn't feel as tired as a lot of postmodern tropes do at this point.

259
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:57,700
To put all of this in perspective, let's look at some games that I would consider postmodern

260
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,801
versus a few I think are firmly metamodern.

261
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,646
Hello, this is Shia LaBeouf.

262
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,727
I'm actually gonna talk about Shia LaBeouf first.

263
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,167
That's what's happening now.

264
00:13:08,648 --> 00:13:10,528
So Shia LaBeouf has done a lot of really,

265
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:13,490
really interesting things with meta-modern media.

266
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,671
If you'll recall, a couple of years ago,

267
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,192
he did this performance art piece that was called

268
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,793
I Am Not, or, hashtag, I Am Not Sorry,

269
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:23,854
where he sat in a room with a bag over his head

270
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,395
that said, I Am Not Famous Anymore.

271
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,556
And if you recall the way that the media

272
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,937
kind of reported on this, it was very much like,

273
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh, look at those wild celebs, they're at it again.

274
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:37,315
And what actually happened is that people would go in,

275
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,578
you know, expecting it to be something silly like that,

276
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:40,880
and they would come in and they'd take the bag

277
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,203
off of Shia's head because it was a very...

278
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,643
high art kind of thing where he's just sitting in a room

279
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:48,384
and you could kind of do whatever you wanted with him.

280
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,146
So they take the bag off of his head and he'd be crying.

281
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,627
And then this person who is only ever known

282
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,448
about Shia LaBeouf as like this celebrity, this symbol,

283
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:59,330
suddenly has this like very real moment with him.

284
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,611
And a lot of people would start crying themselves

285
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:04,412
and they would like hold his hand and try to console him

286
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,874
and actually have like a much more meaningful experience.

287
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:11,916
And I highly recommend that anybody go check out Shia LaBeouf's other work.

288
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:15,338
He's done a lot of really interesting performance art pieces aside from getting arrested for

289
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,999
public intoxication in Savannah, Georgia, which is a...

290
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,141
For a place with open container lots, that's hard to do.

291
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,963
Anyway, now let's talk about games that are postmodern.

292
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,321
The Stanley Parable and Portal both deconstruct traditional ideas surrounding player agency

293
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:34,964
in a game like Sonic Dreams Collection, Lampoon's Sonic fan culture in the late 90s.

294
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:39,847
And all three of these games are pretty resoundingly cynical and feature varying degrees of subversion

295
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:40,987
in their respective genres.

296
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:42,709
Postmodernism.

297
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,993
Progressing past this era of postmodern work, we have games like Undertale and Doki Doki

298
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:49,653
Literature Club.

299
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,116
The distinction here is that both games are deconstructions of deconstructions.

300
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:00,362
Undertale is particularly notable in this sense because it plays with RPG tropes in

301
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,142
several different ways.

302
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:05,345
The fact that the player is constantly faced with choosing between pacifism and violence

303
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,368
and then has to live with the consequences is very metamodern because, again, it's that

304
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:12,410
oscillation between those poles without totally reconciling them.

305
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,192
And then you have characters who are aware of your previous actions and comment on them

306
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,734
and breaking the fourth wall by making direct appeals to the player.

307
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:21,495
So doki doki literature club.

308
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,526
Sorry to leave you guys hanging.

309
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:34,272
Is on one level a deconstruction and commentary on a lighthearted dating sim and all the trappings

310
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:34,813
of the genre.

311
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:39,317
Your childhood best friend, a blank slate male main character, takes place in a high

312
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:39,577
school.

313
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,981
Anime titty.

314
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:45,746
And then as the game starts to take a darker turn, it starts playing off of horror tropes

315
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:49,870
as well and then becomes extremely meta once Monica addresses the player directly.

316
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:56,357
The game manages to be simultaneously cutesy, sweet, and endearing, while also just absolutely

317
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:56,777
horrific.

318
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,420
It allows the player to hold both ideas at once.

319
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:04,096
And I believe that it's no coincidence that these two games have enjoyed a lot of success

320
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:05,576
and have garnered massive fandoms.

321
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:10,258
Because ultimately, metamodernism is the source of all Internet culture and it informs the

322
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:12,899
sensibilities of some of the most popular media right now.

323
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,882
Such as Rick and Morty, the music of Childish Gambino, Bojack Horseman, Bo Burnham's standup,

324
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:24,044
Black Mirror, and Homestuck, which I put in there because apparently it's 2012.

325
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:29,658
So let's break down what each of these core tenets

326
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,199
really mean and how we utilize these ideas

327
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,579
to make Dream Daddy a success.

328
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,660
So sincerity wrapped in cynicism

329
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,021
is the really, really big one

330
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,741
that if you remember one thing from this talk,

331
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:41,501
remember that.

332
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:43,942
The guiding idea of metamodernism

333
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,123
is pretty well embodied by this Jerry Saltz quote.

334
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,924
I know that the art I'm creating may seem silly or stupid,

335
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:51,244
that it might've been done before,

336
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,045
but that doesn't mean that this isn't serious.

337
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:57,330
And by wrapping a sincere story in this cynical exterior,

338
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,713
you're basically Trojan horsing meaning into your game.

339
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,036
I kind of like to think of it like salted caramel,

340
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,317
like you get the salty and the sweet

341
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,139
and they both bring out the best in each other

342
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,901
and now I'm really hungry.

343
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,084
But a perfect example of this in a game

344
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,986
that Dream Daddy would not exist without

345
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,329
is Hottiful Boyfriend, the Pigeon Dating Sim.

346
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,002
Yes, I know you like kissing birds, thank you.

347
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,183
And what clearly looks like a very silly game

348
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,063
where you play as a human girl dating birds

349
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,124
has been pretty widely regarded

350
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:28,784
as one of the best dating sims out there.

351
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:31,405
Players praise the surprisingly well-written story

352
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:32,245
and sprawling lore.

353
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,986
So this is a particularly effective technique

354
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:37,087
that also worked for us.

355
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,428
Setting the player's expectations low

356
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,168
with the promise of something silly or weird,

357
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,969
dating birds, kissing dads.

358
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,954
And then doing a bit of a bait and switch with a story that's actually meaningful.

359
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:50,594
Cuz let's face it,

360
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:53,816
it's really hard to just tell a serious story at face value on the Internet.

361
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,957
We have to steep it in a few layers of irony so it's palatable because

362
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:59,479
the Internet has ruined all of our brains and just turned us into

363
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,020
whatever fucked up sense of humor the Internet has done to us.

364
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,201
I really don't understand it.

365
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:09,487
But if Dream Daddy was instead just called like favorable fathers and was a straightforward

366
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:14,089
story about the experience of being a single dad, it would have been seen as a little overly

367
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:14,710
sentimental.

368
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,571
You know, you got to put daddy in the title.

369
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:18,032
Gets them in the door.

370
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:23,255
And because people unfortunately already tend to have low expectations of dating sims as

371
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:27,077
a genre, we were able to pleasantly surprise players with a story with hidden depth.

372
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:31,240
Because one second you're hanging out with the goth dad who loves shopping at Hot Topic

373
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,601
and writing his own smutty narrative fiction that he then gets.

374
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:36,165
leather bound, and then the next,

375
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,925
he's giving a monologue in a graveyard

376
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,026
about how death helps him appreciate his life more.

377
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,827
And even though the game is about dating dads,

378
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,868
it's also pretty heavily about the experience

379
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,568
of growing up in a single-parent household,

380
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:47,929
and that resonated with people.

381
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,970
Next, collapsing distances.

382
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,131
I'm gonna collapse the distance between me and this water.

383
00:18:58,293 --> 00:18:59,253
Hydration is important.

384
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,363
Because the internet is an incredible tool

385
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,285
for connecting us with people from all walks of life

386
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,327
from all over the world and then yelling at all those people

387
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,288
from different walks of life for having opinions,

388
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,450
metamodernism places a heavy emphasis

389
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,091
on exploring not only our differences,

390
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:17,492
but the things that we have in common.

391
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:20,614
This is where what I will lovingly call

392
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:23,415
hashtag relatable, hashtag content comes from.

393
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,677
Because at their core, internet memes

394
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,378
are just super condensed storytelling

395
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:28,859
to communicate a universal truth.

396
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:29,599
Like.

397
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,633
We all do the thing where you stand in the shower

398
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:32,894
and then you fill your mouth with water

399
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,616
and then you spit it out like you're a water fountain.

400
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,958
It's a feeling of like, me too, I do that.

401
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,380
And also most memes that get really popular

402
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,242
kind of boil down to the same format.

403
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,245
Like thing you should be doing,

404
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:48,807
thing you should not be doing,

405
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:50,528
thing you should be doing,

406
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,169
thing you should not be doing

407
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:53,050
but you're gonna do anyway.

408
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,110
Ha.

409
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,730
And, you know, this one.

410
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,010
And if you want to go like really Freudian with it,

411
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,071
what this is really expressing is this.

412
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,092
So what I'm saying is that memes are gonna enter

413
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:13,713
the literary canon as works of high art someday.

414
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,454
Anyway, further extrapolating that kind of meme-y thing

415
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,394
into a video game narrative is as simple

416
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,255
as writing truthfully and authentically.

417
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:23,635
I know that sounds kind of obvious,

418
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,316
but your best writing is going to come

419
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,576
from a place of vulnerability,

420
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,656
and that authenticity will always shine through.

421
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:33,766
Dream Daddy has been pretty widely praised for having a very genuine and heartfelt story.

422
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:38,207
And I think so many of the most touching moments in the game came from some deeply vulnerable

423
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,568
places for me and my co-writer Vernon.

424
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:45,489
And we touch on a lot of serious subjects like alcoholism, imposter syndrome, toxic

425
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,710
masculinity, etc.

426
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,071
Like by allowing yourself to be vulnerable with players that can connect with you more.

427
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:55,192
Like for example, whoa, guys, holy shit.

428
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,977
I'm up here, I'm doing a talk, we had technical difficulties,

429
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,138
I spent the last hour freaking out, I have not had breakfast,

430
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,320
I hate public speaking, it's really stressful,

431
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,081
I'm having a bad time.

432
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,322
Anyway, we're back.

433
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,124
Thanks, thank you.

434
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,386
But this is exactly what I'm talking about.

435
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,627
By choosing to be vulnerable,

436
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,768
you guys hopefully feel a little bit more connected to me

437
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:16,429
as a person.

438
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,211
And if you don't, then just act like you are.

439
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,311
I don't know, work with me.

440
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,473
I was vulnerable with you, don't take advantage of that.

441
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,948
Anyway, one of the things we did post-announcement

442
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,489
were these character introductions,

443
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,711
which were actually modeled around tag me memes

444
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,573
like this one.

445
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:34,395
And if you've never seen one of these before,

446
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,417
they're typically a bunch of simply drawn characters

447
00:21:37,457 --> 00:21:38,558
with these brief descriptions.

448
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:41,180
I always end up comparing them to horoscopes.

449
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,461
Like there's these sets of traits

450
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,402
that really could be applicable to anybody,

451
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,924
but the idea is that you tag the one that you're most like

452
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,205
and then you also tag your friends.

453
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:52,124
And so we did these, and following that,

454
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,805
people really related to these descriptions

455
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,106
of the characters, and even if they didn't exactly,

456
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:57,787
they tagged their friends who did,

457
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,849
which is another entry point for new players.

458
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,911
And so we decided to post a blank version

459
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:04,852
for people to put their own Dadsonas onto,

460
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,073
because people were sending us

461
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,615
so much fan art of them anyway.

462
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,136
I mean, like, look at those good boys.

463
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:14,118
And what actually ended up happening

464
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,320
is that people kind of turned it into a meme.

465
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,015
It was just this for a very long time.

466
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,736
We kind of had to like not check the notifications

467
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,578
because you guys are some memers.

468
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,759
So you can definitely draw inspiration from memes

469
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,820
without clumsily shoving them in places

470
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,781
where they don't belong.

471
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,562
And another example of this happened

472
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:42,644
when I got some of the early sketches of Joseph Sprite

473
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:44,524
from our wonderful character artist, Shannon Pei.

474
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,246
I had passed off my designs

475
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:48,927
and when she showed me this pose, I was like,

476
00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:51,605
That looks really familiar.

477
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,245
Why does that look so familiar?

478
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:57,287
And then I realized, oh, oh,

479
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,969
he looks like, you know, I had to do it to him guy.

480
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:02,910
I should get her to change that.

481
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,691
And then I thought, no, I should not,

482
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:10,194
because that creates an opportunity

483
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,114
for people to make that connection on their own,

484
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,516
to speculate whether it was on purpose or not,

485
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:15,936
or to just make jokes about it.

486
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:18,818
And sure enough, we got a ton of tweets like this.

487
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:22,037
I'm thrilled.

488
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,159
This is exactly what I wanted.

489
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,661
So, metamodernism also stresses the understanding

490
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,602
of other perspectives, which goes hand in hand

491
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,062
with inclusivity and diversity.

492
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:35,044
And when I was submitting my pitch for a talk,

493
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,385
I considered doing one about writing inclusivity,

494
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:39,846
and then I realized that that talk would be 60 seconds long

495
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:43,288
because all I have to say is, just fucking do it!

496
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:46,029
Write diverse characters,

497
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,370
represent diverse groups of people,

498
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,771
and if you're not sure how to write perspectives

499
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,831
that are different from your own,

500
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:52,018
Find someone who does and give them money.

501
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:52,959
It's that easy.

502
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:56,901
And if you've never written a song before

503
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,262
and you don't know how to read music

504
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,703
and you don't know how to play any instruments

505
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:01,204
and you don't know anything about music theory

506
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:03,506
and also you've never actually even listened to music before

507
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,887
are you going to set out to create the entire soundtrack

508
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,528
of your game recorded from scratch in your basement?

509
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,210
No, you're gonna hire someone who knows what they're doing.

510
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,111
It's the same thing.

511
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:16,715
And obviously neither Dream Daddy's co-creator Vernon Sharai are gay dads, so we were constantly

512
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:21,839
talking to a lot of gay men, trans men, actual fathers, and other members of the LGBT community

513
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:24,420
to get feedback, and the game is so much richer for it.

514
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:29,845
And I really do not want to hear that writing perspectives that are inclusive is some kind

515
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:33,988
of niche topic that won't make money, because if the success of Dream Daddy is any indication,

516
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,291
there is a huge demographic of people that is starved for content that represents them.

517
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,412
I know!

518
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,533
I'm a member of that demographic.

519
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,166
And these people deserve to feel included.

520
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:47,988
And further, not only is putting together a diverse cast

521
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,309
a wonderful step towards inclusivity,

522
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:50,349
it's just more realistic.

523
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:52,611
Diversity is just good storytelling.

524
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,873
And also I'm gonna advocate for doing your research.

525
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,795
I am a huge nerd and I love reading a lot of books

526
00:24:59,895 --> 00:25:01,456
and you should too if you're a writer.

527
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,238
So like do as much research as you can

528
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:06,059
and keep a running notebook of what you're learning.

529
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,620
Creating a vocabulary of knowledge

530
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,061
that you can draw upon as you're writing.

531
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,371
is gonna make your work so much better.

532
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,072
And when you get stuck on story,

533
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,213
you can always go back to those notes for inspiration.

534
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,715
And when we started writing Dream Daddy,

535
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,616
I checked out a bunch of books from the library

536
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:21,177
on pretty much.

537
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:24,287
anything even tangentially related to the story.

538
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:26,389
Being a dad, being a single dad,

539
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,750
the cultural ideas wrapped up in patriarchal societies,

540
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,072
being a gay dad, the history of the gay man in America,

541
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:33,013
et cetera, and we learned so much

542
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,654
that we otherwise never would have touched on.

543
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:38,156
Just read more, read more is my point.

544
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:40,537
Also, if you enjoyed Dream Daddy

545
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:41,598
or like my brother's husband,

546
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,219
please read Does This Baby Make Me Look Straight

547
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,500
by Dan Bukitinsky because it's fantastic

548
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,262
and really funny and it made me cry a lot.

549
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,355
And obviously we're going to talk about layered identities now.

550
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,476
The way we present ourselves varies based on who we're talking to.

551
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:02,177
The way you tell a story to your parents is probably very different from the way that

552
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,457
you tell a story to your friends.

553
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:08,318
And similarly, the way that you present yourself on Facebook is probably very, very different

554
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,699
from the way that you present yourself on your private vent Twitter.

555
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,039
Don't act like you do not have one.

556
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,320
I know about the anime shit posting.

557
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,600
It's okay.

558
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,480
We're all friends here.

559
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:21,484
And one of the cool things about metamodernism

560
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,865
is that it encourages us to really explore

561
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:26,486
how we express these different facets of our personalities

562
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:29,287
through not only social media, but video games as well.

563
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,068
I know I'm not the only person in this room

564
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:33,669
who spends an inordinate amount of time

565
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:34,649
on character creators.

566
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,750
There's a community of people who I think

567
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,811
really want more gaming experiences

568
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,112
that let them explore themselves

569
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,673
and games that can teach them something about who they are

570
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,054
or give them an opportunity to explore their sexuality

571
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:48,655
or gender identity when they might not be able to do so

572
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:49,195
in real life.

573
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:59,363
And there's no better testament to how underserved this community is than the popularity of Dragon Age and Mass Effect, among young women and queer people especially.

574
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:10,091
The fandoms for these games are vibrant and thriving, and most of the fan content revolves around exploring the relationships between the characters and creating work about the players Shepard, Warden, Inquisitor, Hawk, etc.

575
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:13,066
And while these games are of course amazing

576
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:13,646
in their own right,

577
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,667
I think that the robust character creators

578
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,527
combined with very well-written friendships

579
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:18,807
and romantic relationships

580
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:21,468
really encourage this type of extensive engagement

581
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:22,288
beyond playtime

582
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,489
because it creates a deeper emotional investment.

583
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:32,230
I'm so thirsty, literally and figuratively.

584
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:35,591
Trying to play off of this,

585
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:37,651
our goal with the writing player dad

586
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,172
and designing the character creator,

587
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,614
was to give people lots of options to customize their dad.

588
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:45,616
Making sure to include a wide variety of skin tones,

589
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,077
facial features, body types,

590
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:48,438
options to have a trans dad,

591
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,819
as well as more androgynous and feminine options

592
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,480
to choose from.

593
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,281
And I would include all the tweets from people

594
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,002
thanking us for having a character creator

595
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,123
that actually represents them,

596
00:27:57,523 --> 00:27:59,264
but I did not want to start weeping

597
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:01,586
in the middle of this talk and be unable to continue

598
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:03,787
if you went to Tyler's talk earlier this week.

599
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,608
You got to see us both cry.

600
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:06,308
It was great.

601
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,305
You also make some decisions in the first five minutes of the game in regards to the

602
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:16,527
gender of your dead spouse, as well as whether Amanda is your biological child or if she

603
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:17,087
was adopted.

604
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:21,488
And these choices had very little effect on the rest of the game aside from changing a

605
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:25,610
few variables, but they proved to be really meaningful to people in how it dictated their

606
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,230
characters' past and sexuality.

607
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:29,691
Oh, God, excuse me.

608
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,873
They give you the lapel mic and you can't even lean away.

609
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,653
It's like you're just going to hear all of it.

610
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:37,114
This is who I am.

611
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,401
What's wrong with, no!

612
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:48,822
And full credit again to Dream Daddy's brilliant director

613
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:50,823
Tyler Hutchison, who's sitting right over there.

614
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:51,903
At least I hope it's Tyler.

615
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:53,203
A bunch of people look the same

616
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,104
when the lights are really bright.

617
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,384
That's you, okay.

618
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:59,465
And you know, it was also his idea for the binder bods,

619
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:01,425
and he gave the amazing talk earlier this week

620
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:02,725
about how you as a straight white dude

621
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,906
can take small steps to make a world of difference

622
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,406
for players, which if you missed,

623
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:07,306
please check out on the vault.

624
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:07,927
It was wonderful.

625
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:13,211
Anyway, one of the major things that compels people to share things with others on the

626
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:17,532
internet is whether the content communicates something about the person or their relationships

627
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:18,053
with others.

628
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:22,795
So creating an opportunity for players to express themselves, especially through a character

629
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,756
creator is something that is pretty much guaranteed to be shareable.

630
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:30,498
I mean, do you guys remember when Miitomo came out and Twitter was just only Miitomo

631
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,419
for a long time?

632
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:35,000
Everyone just wants to show everybody else what they look like in cute cartoon form.

633
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,576
It's a universal thing.

634
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,157
It's what brings us all together.

635
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:39,938
We love cartoons.

636
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,302
And finally, we have radical optimism.

637
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:46,985
And I like to describe this recent shift

638
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,326
over the past couple of years

639
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,829
as the progression from the popularity of Me IRL memes.

640
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:55,683
which are about hating yourself and being depressed.

641
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:57,624
These are all fun.

642
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:58,805
These are relatable.

643
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,246
And we went from this to wholesome memes,

644
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,488
where you want to support your friends and pet dogs

645
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,268
and just be kind and positive.

646
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,110
And right now, I think people are really craving stuff

647
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,871
that's silly and fun and uplifting

648
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:14,833
because, boy, things are kind of dire in the world right now.

649
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,236
And as you can see from this highly scientific line graph,

650
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,558
depression memes continue to be popular,

651
00:30:20,938 --> 00:30:23,840
but wholesome memes are slowly rising up and taking over.

652
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,662
And this little spike right here that kicks it off is,

653
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:31,265
what do you know, 2016 election, yeah.

654
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:34,047
And if you take a look at the kind of content

655
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,528
that fan communities create,

656
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,950
which we can assume is what people really, really want

657
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,770
out of their stories.

658
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,169
Time and time again, for every fandom that I looked up on AO3,

659
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:47,671
what could possibly be more popular than angst, blowjobs, and anal sex?

660
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,993
This is a real thing that I wrote into my talk and I regret it a little bit now.

661
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:55,854
Anybody want to guess what it is?

662
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:00,996
It's fluff!

663
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:06,358
And for those who have never read fanfic, and first of all, yeah, okay, sure.

664
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:11,736
Fluff is just comedic, silly, sweet fanfic with little to no substance.

665
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:14,698
It's like the wholesome equivalent of a lemon or a porn without plot.

666
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:19,522
And at this point, I think we're all pretty burned out on cynicism in characters who don't

667
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:23,625
talk like real people do and stories that are just grim and gritty for the sake of being

668
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:24,266
grim and gritty.

669
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:29,169
And I'm not saying that your game should just be sweet and simple, but people seem to respond

670
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:33,813
really strongly to stories about characters who genuinely care about each other and may

671
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:34,653
want the best for each other.

672
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,603
And when we were writing the game, it was also really important to us that none of the

673
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:44,290
humor punched down, so to speak.

674
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,599
We tried really hard to keep everything positive

675
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:48,740
and again, inclusive,

676
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,782
because jokes that punch down hurt your players.

677
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:52,103
And with comedy,

678
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:54,745
your jokes are going to create in-groups and out-groups.

679
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:56,166
And by punching down,

680
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:58,048
you're tightening the radius of that in-group

681
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:00,770
smaller and smaller and potentially alienating players

682
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,511
that would otherwise really enjoy your game.

683
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,873
Plus going for the low hanging fruit

684
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:07,555
is just so done and creatively bankrupt at this point.

685
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:08,756
I mean, look at Ricky Gervais.

686
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:09,797
Can he chill?

687
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,018
Can he find some chill?

688
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:15,840
And by not punching down, you're actually going to force yourself to be even more creative

689
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,900
and your writing will be better.

690
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:22,382
This mentality also extended into the approach that we took for our social media accounts.

691
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:27,704
We always tried to come from a place of positivity and support, which ranges from how we responded

692
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:30,585
to fan art to how we responded to angry players reporting bugs.

693
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:35,647
It's sort of like when you go to Disney and you ask, they can't tell you the park closes

694
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:35,767
at 8.

695
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:37,688
They have to say the park is open until 8.

696
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:41,610
So we adopted the voice of a supportive, proud dad on Twitter,

697
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,451
and people responded really well to it.

698
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,912
And the coolest part that us being positive, in turn,

699
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:49,513
got the fans to be supportive and kind to each other as well.

700
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:51,834
So you really have the power to set the tone

701
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:54,216
of how people interact with both you and other players.

702
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,118
So now that I've gone over the core tenets of metamodernism,

703
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:02,779
which are, again, sincerity wrapped in cynicism,

704
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:05,655
collapsing distances, radical optimism,

705
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:06,656
and layered identities,

706
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:09,659
let's talk about how you can utilize these principles

707
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,380
to create a product that's very spreadable.

708
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,225
So the moment that we see a piece of content

709
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,447
on social media, before we're even consciously aware of it,

710
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:21,649
our brain is already making decisions

711
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:22,570
about its shareability.

712
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,053
A 2011 study by a group of psychologists at UCLA put a bunch of students through an fMRI

713
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:34,037
scan as they were exposed to different pitches for a variety of fake TV shows and instructed

714
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:37,601
to role-play as interns and to take note of the pitches that they would potentially want

715
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:38,561
to share with producers.

716
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,903
The psychologist determined that the moment a group of students role-playing as interns

717
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:48,126
were first exposed to an idea that they would ultimately decide to share with the producers,

718
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:52,288
this area in the brain called the temporal parietal junction would light up, and it's

719
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:58,292
the area between the temporal and parietal lobes oscillating between two areas of the

720
00:33:58,352 --> 00:33:59,553
brain metamodernism.

721
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:06,877
So the temporal parietal junction is actually a part of the outer layer of the brain called

722
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:07,998
the mentalization network.

723
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,861
Mentalizing is the process of understanding how other people think and feel,

724
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:16,323
and this entire network is engaged when we see something that we might potentially share with others.

725
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:19,964
And this is the same part of the brain that theoretically would have been engaged

726
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,525
when ancient humans dragged fresh kale back to their tribe.

727
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:26,806
We're deeply wired to want to share things of quality with those that we care about.

728
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:30,449
And even though the TPJ's connection with social media

729
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,730
is still being pretty extensively researched,

730
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,431
we can actually use this information to our advantage

731
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,892
by looking at the kinds of rapid fire questions

732
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:39,232
we're subconsciously thinking

733
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:41,433
when we see an interesting post on social media.

734
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:45,094
Namely, is this content worth engaging with?

735
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:46,635
Is it worth sharing?

736
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,536
What's the best platform to spread it through?

737
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,117
Might it be of interest to specific people?

738
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:53,418
Does it convey something about who I am

739
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,798
or my relationship with others?

740
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:57,299
And does it reflect the values of my community?

741
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,492
And some questions you'll want to ask yourself

742
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,973
in your design process to make sure that the answers

743
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,814
to all of those questions are a resounding yes.

744
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:14,596
You want to think about, is it portable, quotable, grabbable?

745
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:17,898
Is it available when and where audiences want it?

746
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:21,159
Is it easily reusable in a variety of ways?

747
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,720
Is it relevant to multiple audiences?

748
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,101
And if so, who?

749
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,562
Is it a part of a steady stream of material?

750
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,102
And because so much of the way people interact with games

751
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:35,003
now takes place outside of playtime and fan communities

752
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:36,004
and on social media,

753
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:38,925
encouraging this kind of engagement is essential

754
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:40,686
for ensuring that your game is spreadable.

755
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:42,507
And there are a couple of different things

756
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:43,908
that you can do to create a game

757
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:46,109
that leaves room for people to sink their teeth

758
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,369
into the work and run with it.

759
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,532
And with the way this participatory culture works,

760
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:54,093
you as a dev need to be okay with relinquishing

761
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,874
a certain amount of control over your IP.

762
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:57,744
Think about it like this.

763
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,665
You hand somebody a finished novel.

764
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,246
They'll read it and they'll have a good time, sure,

765
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,628
but what if you handed the same person a Mad Lib

766
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:06,689
and told them to fill it in?

767
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,951
And then you hand hundreds of other people the same Mad Lib

768
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,471
and they're all gonna have different ways

769
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,593
of filling in the blanks and then they're gonna fight

770
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,534
each other over how they filled in the blanks,

771
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,695
but they're gonna be so much more engaged

772
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,537
because they get to decide what this story means to them.

773
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,801
And some things that can create these little Mad Libs gaps

774
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:29,243
for players include tapping into shared fantasies,

775
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:33,045
humor, parody references and intertextuality,

776
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:37,607
unfinished content, mystery, timely controversy,

777
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:40,528
and the dreaded discourse, and rumors.

778
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:43,010
Going in depth into each of these

779
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,471
would be an entire talk in itself, but as one example,

780
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,313
I mean, we didn't end each of the dad's date paths

781
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,774
essentially at the beginning of a romantic relationship

782
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:52,494
just because we.

783
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,571
didn't have forever to write a sprawling epic of a dating sim.

784
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,932
It was partially that.

785
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:03,998
But by leaving the endings ambiguous and open-ended, it created an opportunity for players to decide

786
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:10,463
for themselves what happens next and has spurred a ton of fan art and imagines and fanfics

787
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:10,983
and memes.

788
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:15,327
And I know that it can be really difficult to relinquish some of that control.

789
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:19,138
But giving people room to remix, pay homage to,

790
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:20,599
and meme elements of your work

791
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,260
not only creates a community

792
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,562
where everyone feels more invested in a property

793
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:27,363
because they're able to help shape the context of the work,

794
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:30,025
but it also creates a network of entry points

795
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:31,646
for people to be exposed to your product.

796
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:37,057
Traditional marketing and PR avenues are still very important,

797
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:40,218
and we definitely did our fair share of spreading press releases.

798
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:45,380
But as you can see, grassroots rallying from fans casts a much wider net

799
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,680
that is not only going to reach a much wider audience,

800
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,681
but people are so much more likely to be interested in your game

801
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:53,362
when it's being endorsed by someone they know or respect,

802
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:56,322
rather than it just being hawked at them by an advertisement.

803
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:58,583
Because, let's face it...

804
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:03,351
Nobody wants to be marketed to, especially while they're playing a game or just trying

805
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:05,073
to read their friends' hot takes on Facebook.

806
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:10,479
And the same demographic that responds positively to the principles of metamodernism consists

807
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,424
of a bunch of young people who hate all of the trappings of late-stage capitalism, so

808
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:16,286
you kind of need to be tactful about it.

809
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,622
And marketing should not be your last step.

810
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:20,904
It should be your first.

811
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:22,886
It should be an ongoing conversation

812
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:24,247
throughout the development process.

813
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:26,149
Understand who your game is for,

814
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,630
what that community values,

815
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,952
and how your game can facilitate, subvert,

816
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:32,735
or reinforce the conversations people are already having.

817
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:35,017
Going back to this slide,

818
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:36,498
I want to talk about portability

819
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:37,900
because I think that's arguably

820
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,541
the most important point on this list.

821
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:43,305
A big part of getting an idea to travel on the internet

822
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,560
is by really optimizing its portability.

823
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:48,642
This often boils down to nailing your elevator pitch,

824
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,464
but not the stop at every floor

825
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:53,205
waiting for people to get on and off elevator pitch,

826
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,907
and honest to God, under 30 seconds elevator pitch.

827
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:57,048
What is your game about?

828
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,510
Dream Daddy co-creator Vernon

829
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,211
calls it compressible content theory.

830
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:04,513
The more easily and concisely you can explain an idea,

831
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:05,994
the further it will travel on the internet.

832
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,836
Dream Daddy, a dad dating simulator

833
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,617
is exactly what it says on the tin.

834
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,699
The dating sim where you play as a hot dad

835
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,019
and your goal is to meet and romance other hot dads

836
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:14,980
while raising your teenage daughter

837
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,980
who's about to leave for college.

838
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,101
Someday I will get it to the speed of like side effects

839
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,742
for medication and commercials, but today it's not that day.

840
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:24,083
And even the acronym for the game, DDADDS,

841
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,144
communicates what the game is about.

842
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,264
And I don't think I'm ever gonna be able

843
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,125
to do anything better than that acronym.

844
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,086
Like, I can't live up to that.

845
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,026
I've peaked.

846
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:39,282
Further, when I was designing the characters, there were a few guiding principles I tried

847
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:39,942
to keep in mind.

848
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:45,847
Because fan communities can create so many new entry points for new players, it was important

849
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:50,170
to me that the dads could be easily recognizable down to their simplest elements.

850
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,212
And even recognizable just based on color scheme.

851
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:55,633
It was also important to me that...

852
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:57,900
I know, I love it.

853
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,841
It was important to me that all of the characters

854
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,922
could be cheaply and easily cosplayable,

855
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:05,504
my hope being that you could walk into any thrift store

856
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,285
and walk out with most of the items

857
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,046
you would need to pull off a decent cosplay.

858
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:13,188
And not only is it just an indescribable joy and honor

859
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:15,470
to see so many people's takes on the characters,

860
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,172
these cosplays also bolster the spreadability of Dream Daddy

861
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:21,173
and can act as yet another entry point

862
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,954
into the game's world for the uninitiated.

863
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,608
And I feel like both of these things are kind of the visual corollary of compressible content

864
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:28,008
theory.

865
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:34,509
So the designs are still readable, whether it's cosplay, really cute chibis, dogs, or

866
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:35,030
ponies.

867
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,871
We also tried to create what we called screencapable moments.

868
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:44,692
Moments that we engineered so people would want to post a screencap to Twitter or Facebook

869
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:46,012
or tell their friends in a group chat.

870
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:48,272
And a lot of these ended up being absurd jokes.

871
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:50,453
Wholesome stuff.

872
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,393
Relatable content.

873
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,853
or thirst, and speaking of thirst.

874
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,122
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

875
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,605
But the end goal with all of these

876
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:09,588
was to have players share a screen grab,

877
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:11,230
and for that to get people to ask,

878
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:13,633
what is this, what is Dream Daddy?

879
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:16,525
And this even applied to our Steam page.

880
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:19,086
This Tumblr post by a random user,

881
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:21,027
not affiliated with us at all,

882
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,847
thank you, this person.

883
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:26,349
And it was just a screen cap of the Steam page.

884
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:28,010
It got 200,000 notes.

885
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,871
And this sort of thing works really well.

886
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:33,812
You just have to be very intentional about it.

887
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:38,618
Because what all of this boils down to is that when you create a piece of work that

888
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,261
aligns with metamodernism and spreadable theory, you're maximizing the shareability of your

889
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:47,223
game because it shows that you're not just hearing your community, you're actually listening.

890
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,840
So to round up, now that you understand the concepts

891
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,501
of metamodernism and spreadability,

892
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,382
I hope that you can start spotting elements

893
00:41:54,422 --> 00:41:56,403
of metamodernism in the media you consume

894
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:59,045
and start incorporating those principles into your work.

895
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,687
And remember that when you create content

896
00:42:01,707 --> 00:42:03,108
that exists adjacent to the internet

897
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:04,388
without directly referencing it,

898
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:07,190
that makes you the most on fleek bae of all.

899
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:08,231
Thank you.

900
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,212
Thank you.

901
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:09,452
Thank you.

902
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:09,652
Thank you.

903
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:09,852
Thank you.

904
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:10,052
Thank you.

905
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:10,252
Thank you.

906
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:10,452
Thank you.

907
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:10,653
Thank you.

908
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:11,113
Thank you.

909
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:11,713
Thank you.

910
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:11,913
Thank you.

911
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:23,854
And if you're interested in reading more about metamodernism, spreadability, or just checking

912
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:27,818
out some of the sources I mentioned in this talk, here's a link where I've, it's just

913
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,619
a ton of books, websites, interviews.

914
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:33,282
There's like a shorter version of this talk if you want to share it, it'd be great.

915
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:38,647
And you know, follow me on all the stuff or don't, because it's not great.

916
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:41,209
And also follow my dog on Instagram.

917
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:42,149
She's really cute.

918
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:45,314
And please fill out the speaker evals

919
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,335
that you will be receiving

920
00:42:46,395 --> 00:42:47,815
because I would love to come back here

921
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:50,917
and just fumble my way through yet another talk.

922
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:54,639
But we have, oh, I finished really early.

923
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:55,819
We have a lot of time.

924
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,580
People ask questions so I can feel less bad

925
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,621
about finishing so early.

926
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:00,041
There's mics.

927
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:01,682
Any questions?

928
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,695
Hufflepuff, what's up?

929
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:09,040
Yo, so I was wondering, so usually a lot of content

930
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,262
for like, you know, metamodernism stuff

931
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:14,946
is like more appealing towards like millennials basically.

932
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:17,389
I was wondering how do you work with trying to like

933
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,772
relate this to like other people of other generations,

934
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:20,252
I suppose?

935
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:22,795
That is a really interesting point.

936
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,957
I think Dream Daddy is a really.

937
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,308
extremely targeting millennials and Gen Z kind of game.

938
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:31,710
And that's not something that I've really thought about

939
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,631
because the approach that you would need to take

940
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:35,973
to appeal to potentially people who are older

941
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:38,074
would involve different social media

942
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:39,936
because I feel like there's been this mass migration

943
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:43,338
away from things like Facebook for people of a certain age

944
00:43:43,378 --> 00:43:45,400
because they're like, my grandma's on there.

945
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,041
I'm like, I don't want her to see my anime posts.

946
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,564
So that's a really good question that I.

947
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,651
Talk to me afterwards and maybe I'll say something more articulate.

948
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:56,931
Thank you.

949
00:43:57,131 --> 00:43:57,751
Thank you.

950
00:43:58,651 --> 00:43:59,271
Good scarf.

951
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:01,032
Anybody else?

952
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,173
Wow, we're just getting like non-stop looks here.

953
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:06,313
Is that a vaporwave skirt?

954
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,013
Yeah, it totally is.

955
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:09,933
It has like the doot-doot skeleton on it.

956
00:44:10,493 --> 00:44:12,254
It's like, seriously, we're talking memes here.

957
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,414
Where is that from?

958
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:14,614
We can talk after.

959
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:14,934
Okay.

960
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:15,814
All right.

961
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:16,634
I get it.

962
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,195
You don't want to share your fashion secrets.

963
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:18,955
It's fine.

964
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:19,275
What's up?

965
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,990
can any of this backfire?

966
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:25,792
Constantly and all the time.

967
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,595
Always, I think, you know,

968
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,557
knowing to not put memes in your stuff

969
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,699
can reduce the possibility of that backfiring

970
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,160
because if you look at social media for like,

971
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,723
any major brand, which is really what spurred this talk

972
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:44,204
of like, Denny's Twitter, Wendy's Twitter,

973
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:46,666
like they're kind of doing okay, but I feel like.

974
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:50,927
There's only so long that we could get away with doing this

975
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:52,627
before everyone kind of catches on

976
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:53,747
and it's like, oh, the jig is up.

977
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:56,388
I think the thing that you should focus on first

978
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:59,109
is make a good thing before you try

979
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,149
to make a spreadable thing.

980
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:03,289
And if it's good, I don't know, cream rises

981
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,030
and people will see that it is good.

982
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,850
Yay.

983
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:09,051
Oh, there's other people at that mic.

984
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:09,771
Hi, what's up?

985
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,951
Choose your first.

986
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:12,051
Oh, no problem.

987
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:12,892
Okay, so you have to fight.

988
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:16,592
Well, just to follow up on the Twitter thing, I'll go ahead.

989
00:45:17,654 --> 00:45:22,863
You mentioned you chose a voice for your Twitter and you made sure to present as a nice dad

990
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:23,684
and your audience responded.

991
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,035
Who was in charge of doing that?

992
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:28,437
Was the writer involved or did you guys just come over?

993
00:45:28,837 --> 00:45:29,557
Oh, here's a good one.

994
00:45:29,737 --> 00:45:30,657
This is what we would say.

995
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:34,179
It was Vernon and I and we were doing a really great job

996
00:45:34,419 --> 00:45:37,280
of doing good dad jokes because, I don't know,

997
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,781
I feel like it's really easy to just be like,

998
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,022
take care of yourselves.

999
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:41,962
I'm your dad.

1000
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,504
And then I guess we went out for cigarettes

1001
00:45:44,564 --> 00:45:46,444
and never came back because we don't really tweet

1002
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:47,545
on the account anymore.

1003
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:50,446
Thank you.

1004
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,307
Yeah, so that's all us.

1005
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:52,959
Okay, you know.

1006
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,179
Yes.

1007
00:45:54,279 --> 00:46:00,181
Speaking of the Internet and Twitter, as soon as I realized that this was not just about

1008
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:03,261
embarrassing yourself on the Internet, or not embarrassing yourself on the Internet.

1009
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:04,262
Oh, there was plenty of that.

1010
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:09,523
And realizing that it was about Dream Daddy, I immediately tweeted at Erica Ishii saying,

1011
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:14,104
in a talk about Dream Daddy and about how not to embarrass yourself on the interwebs,

1012
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:15,685
thinking about you, Erica Ishii.

1013
00:46:16,165 --> 00:46:21,447
She said, I know that first thing, and the key to the second thing is not to feel shame

1014
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:24,128
like a normal human being and just go for it.

1015
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:30,710
And for anybody who doesn't know, Erika Ishii is the voice of the daughter in Dream Daddy.

1016
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,611
Precious Amanda.

1017
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:36,993
Also, hey, yesterday was the two year anniversary of when we started working on Dads, and it

1018
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:38,293
was also Amanda's birthday.

1019
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:39,554
So happy birthday, Amanda.

1020
00:46:39,574 --> 00:46:40,354
Play her last name.

1021
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:41,134
Yay!

1022
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:42,935
Clap for the fictional character.

1023
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:45,824
Thank you, yes, Erica is wonderful.

1024
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:48,405
You were just gonna read a tweet?

1025
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:53,106
Well, no, just that, kind of, but yeah.

1026
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,947
Okay.

1027
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,347
No, I agree with that.

1028
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:00,848
This has probably been the most human talk

1029
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:02,669
I've been involved in.

1030
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:04,029
Thank you, I did it.

1031
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:05,710
You did it, yay, you did great.

1032
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:09,513
Yeah, I think the same thing is like also,

1033
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:13,017
if you are terminally online, like I am,

1034
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,040
you kind of just have to step away from it a bit

1035
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,982
and just not listen to the hot takes

1036
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:19,444
of like every 13-year-old who's like,

1037
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:21,005
you suck and you should die.

1038
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:24,209
Like, you just gotta step back and like go outside sometimes,

1039
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,670
which seems like a very reductive take,

1040
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,772
but sometimes it's what you gotta do.

1041
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:29,955
You.

1042
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:36,150
Okay, uh, I didn't understand 50% of the first few minutes of your talk where you were

1043
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,755
memeing at me and I genuinely laughed at your dad pun. Should I just sort of stay away from

1044
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:46,200
this, uh, trying to do what you've done here?

1045
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,947
Well, I don't think you have to.

1046
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:51,607
I think it's just the understanding of like,

1047
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:54,888
lost my train of thought.

1048
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,429
I don't know.

1049
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:59,510
I don't think you necessarily have to understand memes

1050
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,631
because the whole point isn't, you know,

1051
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:06,532
don't try to directly do memes.

1052
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:07,453
Why didn't I go longer?

1053
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,593
I don't have good answers to questions.

1054
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:09,053
I'm sorry.

1055
00:48:10,093 --> 00:48:10,474
I'm sorry.

1056
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:11,574
Thank you for your question.

1057
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:12,054
Oh God.

1058
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:12,854
Hi.

1059
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:12,974
Hello.

1060
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,755
Well, the point was don't use memes, right?

1061
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,887
The point was don't use memes, right?

1062
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:20,267
Yeah, that was it.

1063
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:21,628
That's what the talk was about.

1064
00:48:24,908 --> 00:48:25,308
Good talk.

1065
00:48:25,848 --> 00:48:26,328
Thanks!

1066
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:30,109
Do you have any examples of dads

1067
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:31,990
that didn't fit this criteria

1068
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,810
and were scrapped dads?

1069
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:35,930
Ghost dads?

1070
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:38,471
Hmmm...

1071
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:40,751
I don't know.

1072
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,611
I don't know.

1073
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:42,732
I think...

1074
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:45,892
I think I wanted to do like a surfer dad,

1075
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:46,994
like a real beach bum,

1076
00:48:47,034 --> 00:48:49,758
like just kind of hangs out in the beach house dad,

1077
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,703
but that there would have been like no conflict there

1078
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:53,624
because I just would have been like,

1079
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:54,626
hey man, let's go surf.

1080
00:48:55,976 --> 00:49:01,437
And I think there was actually like Brian originally was going to just be like the sweet cinnamon roll dad who was just nice

1081
00:49:02,118 --> 00:49:04,678
And then we started writing that we're like hmm

1082
00:49:05,558 --> 00:49:11,280
If someone's just a cinnamon roll there is no such thing as conflict in this game. It's just not a 130,000 word

1083
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,760
coffee shop AU so

1084
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,441
We ended up like I was like shoot

1085
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:20,642
I really wish that we had a rival dad because I just want like a dad another dad knew to duke it out and we're

1086
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:20,782
like

1087
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:22,639
I'll just scrap Brian's path,

1088
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:24,141
like let's make him the rival dad, sure.

1089
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:25,743
We have the assets, we're not changing it,

1090
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:26,644
we're just gonna rewrite it.

1091
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:29,627
So Brian was once a very sweet boy,

1092
00:49:29,668 --> 00:49:31,410
and now he's still a sweet boy,

1093
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,971
but beneath the rival exterior.

1094
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:34,273
Cool, thanks.

1095
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:35,114
Thank you.

1096
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,657
Okay, thank you.

1097
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:40,100
Hey there, brilliant talk.

1098
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,018
So actually, the gentleman over there

1099
00:49:42,138 --> 00:49:43,899
actually brings up a good point.

1100
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,001
So as we as creators age, one of the things

1101
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,342
that I'm I guess fearing is that we're getting

1102
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:52,883
further and further away from exactly,

1103
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,644
from the conversation itself that's happening

1104
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:55,345
around the internet.

1105
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:58,846
So like one of us might be using on fleek

1106
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:01,288
when we're like 40 still for some reason.

1107
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:06,971
So my question is like how exactly do you keep yourself

1108
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:08,792
in the conversation as you age?

1109
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:14,632
Um, higher younger people would be an answer to that one.

1110
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:16,794
But I know that it can be really difficult.

1111
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:20,038
And that's also just like following the right people on social media.

1112
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:23,261
Like if you're just following people your age, like you really kind of want like a

1113
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:26,704
scattershot from all age groups because

1114
00:50:27,855 --> 00:50:30,175
Yeah, but going back to the other point is just like,

1115
00:50:30,835 --> 00:50:31,995
make sure your thing is good,

1116
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:34,136
because if you do a thing and it's just like,

1117
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,476
oh, I own it, and I'm not implying

1118
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:36,376
that this is what you're gonna do,

1119
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,497
but if you're just like, I just won 100,000 retweets,

1120
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:41,497
like, it's not gonna go so hot.

1121
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:45,318
But yeah, just quality first, and then memes.

1122
00:50:45,618 --> 00:50:46,958
All right. But not, but not that.

1123
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,639
Quality first, but also not, perfect.

1124
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,239
Thank you, what he said.

1125
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:54,440
Hello.

1126
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:57,986
I mean, I just got to this one.

1127
00:50:58,006 --> 00:50:58,766
You could do those guys.

1128
00:50:59,266 --> 00:50:59,367
Oh.

1129
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:01,727
Hi, hello.

1130
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,708
I like hit, the lights are so bright.

1131
00:51:03,748 --> 00:51:05,349
You guys are just like indistinct blurs.

1132
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:06,769
So, hello blur.

1133
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,571
So with regards to writing and narrative design,

1134
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,671
I was curious about how,

1135
00:51:16,232 --> 00:51:18,713
when you have characters that you're writing

1136
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:21,274
and also you have visual representation.

1137
00:51:22,476 --> 00:51:27,279
And then with voice acting as well, delineating, like basically how specific you go with each given character.

1138
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,603
As far as, you know, because like as soon as you start voicing a character, then that actually kind of closes off

1139
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:36,445
what that character can be to a player.

1140
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:38,629
Is that making sense?

1141
00:51:38,669 --> 00:51:39,390
As far as like...

1142
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,470
No, that 100% makes sense.

1143
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:45,732
That's why we did not do fully voiced things, because we pretty much just have dad grunts.

1144
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:52,874
And even that I was a little nervous about doing, because I think so much of game culture

1145
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:56,635
right now happens as a result of Let's Plays, and half the fun of a Let's Play is seeing

1146
00:51:56,735 --> 00:52:00,116
what kind of voice the Let's Players choose to do for the characters.

1147
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,621
And so we just wanted to keep it really minimal

1148
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:05,882
while still having some fun cameos from people

1149
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:07,803
that hopefully players would enjoy hearing

1150
00:52:08,783 --> 00:52:10,224
make a lot of weird dad noises.

1151
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,526
Did you find that there was a wide disparity

1152
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,647
on how people voiced certain dads

1153
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:17,087
or was it fairly consistent?

1154
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:21,529
So you know how stressful it is when you write something

1155
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,630
and then you have to read it in front of a group of people?

1156
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,371
Imagine that, but then you look at the view count

1157
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:27,952
and it's like three million and then you're like.

1158
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:30,008
Okay, I can't do this.

1159
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:34,213
So I've watched maybe like one episode of one Let's Play,

1160
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:35,494
so I don't know.

1161
00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:38,277
Thank you.

1162
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:40,079
You were waiting.

1163
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:40,820
Okay, so.

1164
00:52:42,382 --> 00:52:46,824
I haven't played Dream Daddy, but I went to both your talks and they're both excellent,

1165
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:47,644
so now I have to play it.

1166
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,166
I wanted to ask about process.

1167
00:52:50,406 --> 00:52:52,286
I wanted to ask about research.

1168
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:58,429
What were the most difficult things to research and how did you take some of the things that

1169
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:02,651
you mentioned in your talk, like couching brain fart.

1170
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:03,471
Sincerity.

1171
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,252
Sincerity within cynicism or within silliness.

1172
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:08,253
How did that inform your research?

1173
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,320
cynical, like...

1174
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,342
Yeah, I think with writing a comedy game,

1175
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:18,042
the first thing that we figured out

1176
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,103
when we were making the big flow charts of like,

1177
00:53:20,484 --> 00:53:21,704
here's how the narrative works,

1178
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:23,165
and this happens and this happens,

1179
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:24,746
like, along with figuring out like,

1180
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:26,266
okay, here's the basic character arc,

1181
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,728
one of the first things we nailed down for each character

1182
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:31,929
was like, what is the emotional core of this story?

1183
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,191
And then just layering lots and lots of jokes on it

1184
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:37,952
and just making sure that like, it's a gradual...

1185
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:45,171
path down like if you date Robert who's the bad dad like I mean you guys just run around

1186
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:48,374
and like eat pizza in an alley and then he makes a joke about like this is where I come

1187
00:53:48,414 --> 00:53:53,799
to masturbate and like you whittle and all that stuff but then like his story gets kind

1188
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:59,564
of like dark and sad later so it's just more of like a gradual you got to wade into it

1189
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:01,846
I think but with the research.

1190
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:09,054
I think the research ties itself to the sincerity because you are finding what the truth in this story is.

1191
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:14,739
And it was really interesting reading the books. Like I read one book that was written by like a

1192
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:20,285
heterosexual father and then I read that does this baby make me look straight and like does this baby make me look straight?

1193
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:25,971
It's the sweetest like those are the most thoughtful parents and then reading this straight dad book. It's like

1194
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:30,857
I'm threatened by my son, even though he is eight years old,

1195
00:54:31,817 --> 00:54:36,120
and my wife's authority threatens my masculinity.

1196
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,561
It's like, God, dude, pull it the fuck together.

1197
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:43,064
So yeah, it's also just like picking and choosing

1198
00:54:43,144 --> 00:54:44,965
what works for you and what doesn't,

1199
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:47,167
because obviously we did not wanna have a dad

1200
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:49,728
who's like, I'm a big, strong man,

1201
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:52,890
and I don't need to have feelings talks with my children,

1202
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,071
because that threatens my identity.

1203
00:54:56,788 --> 00:54:56,969
Yeah.

1204
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:58,009
Thanks.

1205
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,010
Thank you.

1206
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:00,972
We got five minutes.

1207
00:55:00,992 --> 00:55:01,172
What's up?

1208
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:01,372
All right.

1209
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:06,456
Thank you first because I didn't realize I needed to see AO3 in a talk until now and

1210
00:55:06,476 --> 00:55:06,976
it was great.

1211
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:08,057
I got you.

1212
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:08,457
Yeah.

1213
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:14,462
And when you build a game for inclusivity and you build your Twitter for any, your outreach

1214
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:20,406
for inclusivity, how, what is your mentality when people still feel unincluded?

1215
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:23,488
Like how do you reach out to those people and what's your general approach there?

1216
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,011
there is no such thing as perfect representation,

1217
00:55:28,131 --> 00:55:30,093
but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't strive for it.

1218
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:34,298
You just kind of have to accept that some people are,

1219
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:37,001
it's just, I wish people could, on the internet,

1220
00:55:37,022 --> 00:55:39,464
could learn the phrase, this is not for me.

1221
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:42,108
And that's okay.

1222
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:49,195
And that can be a really difficult thing because you can really try your hardest and be taking as many steps as possible

1223
00:55:49,255 --> 00:55:51,737
at every single step of like, okay, is this inclusive? Is this inclusive?

1224
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:55,119
We have all these consultants and you can still fuck up real bad.

1225
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,801
And I think another important thing, especially in regards to social media,

1226
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:04,264
is never, ever market your game on the inclusivity.

1227
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:07,226
Don't do it. It is the bare minimum.

1228
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:09,307
Not a thing you should get cookies for.

1229
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:15,011
And also people will come down on you so hard

1230
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,033
because it's super transparent of like,

1231
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:20,576
well, we put fat people in this game,

1232
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:22,977
so give us a pat on the back.

1233
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,219
That's, sorry, sorry, no, that's not a dig.

1234
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:25,779
That's not a dig.

1235
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,400
It's a thing.

1236
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,501
No, no, no, I'm laughing because that's hysterical.

1237
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:29,943
Yeah, okay.

1238
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:32,565
But yeah, just because people,

1239
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:34,086
like the moment you say that you're inclusive,

1240
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:35,106
like people are gonna be like,

1241
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:37,228
well, how inclusive is it really?

1242
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:39,310
And then you will get call out posts.

1243
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:43,251
But yeah, just do it because it's the right thing to do

1244
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,953
and it's good storytelling, not, you know, whatever.

1245
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:46,333
Thank you.

1246
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:48,535
Your experience and sharing it was really valuable.

1247
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,235
Thank you.

1248
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:51,477
Yay. Hello.

1249
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:56,621
Hey, hi. So I came to the talk thinking that it was about how

1250
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:59,003
to put your game out there without being embarrassed,

1251
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:01,665
but I think what I understood was the opposite.

1252
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,146
It was like being embarrassed is the way.

1253
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:06,628
Yeah? All right.

1254
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:08,410
Yeah.

1255
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:15,909
My entire brand is just how fucking ready I am to get off of this stage.

1256
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:16,129
Who?

1257
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:20,193
Alright, so my question is if I understood it right.

1258
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,154
Seems like, yeah, thanks.

1259
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:22,075
Oh, yay.

1260
00:57:22,836 --> 00:57:24,678
Alright, okay, nobody, no, we're done.

1261
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:25,059
Thank you.

1262
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,540

1263
