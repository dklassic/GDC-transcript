00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:08,967
This presentation is being sponsored by the Writers Guild of America.

2
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:12,589
Our motto, if you have a plot, hire a professional.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,651
If you don't, make a game.

4
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:22,093
Before we begin, we're going to be showing clips from Psychic Detective

5
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:26,776
that depict characters in extreme psychic torment.

6
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:31,278
If you are experiencing likewise because of hangover this morning,

7
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,458
don't sit by the speakers.

8
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,855
And a note about showing clips from a game

9
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:39,956
or an interactive movie.

10
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:44,179
Looking at clips instead of playing them

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,661
is a little like looking at a court transcript of a Robin

12
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,661
Williams monologue.

13
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:50,803
You're going to get the gist of it,

14
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,484
and you're going to appreciate a lot of it,

15
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:54,705
but you're going to be painfully aware that something

16
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:55,626
is missing for you.

17
00:00:56,206 --> 00:01:01,409
And in this case, it's making decisions and making choices

18
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,091
and having the movie instantly react to you.

19
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:10,917
What I asked John to do was assemble what we refer to as the Psychic Detective Cliff Notes.

20
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:16,082
How many people have actually played Psychic Detective at least once from beginning to end?

21
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:22,808
Alright, for the many uninitiated, we're going to take you through a breakneck tour of what this is about,

22
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:29,614
and then talk a little bit about the pragmatic challenges of trying to create this kind of animal.

23
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:35,259
So, with no further ado, maybe a little further ado.

24
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,424
I was just gonna say that it's a title that we created with Electronic Arts.

25
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:45,590
It's published on the 3DO, PlayStation, and PC CD-ROM formats.

26
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,677
It's five hours worth of live action material which you are playing through 20 to 40 minutes at a time.

27
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:54,565
That's basically it.

28
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,225
Beautiful.

29
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:58,906
We refer to it as an interactive film that's 30 minutes long

30
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:00,146
and five hours wide.

31
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:00,947
But more to come.

32
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,727
Here's your basic high concept.

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,930
A little non-interactive intro, which

34
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,691
tells you something about the main character and the plot.

35
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:52,056
People think if you have psychic powers, the world is yours to control.

36
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:52,916
That's a load of crap.

37
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:58,797
If I could predict the future, there'd be a few less dead bodies.

38
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,388
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Pika Lounge.

39
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,110
My name is Eric Fox, better known as the Psychic Flash.

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,012
There I was, doing what I do best.

41
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,715
The old freak of nature routine.

42
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,597
Called myself the Psychic Flash.

43
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,618
Hey, the old folks loved it.

44
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:46,606
Me, I got fast, easy cash, and the occasional voodoo groupie.

45
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,928
Your grandfather gave this to you on his deathbed.

46
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,099
Very moving for you.

47
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:54,983
Very boring for us.

48
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:56,825
Alright ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,407
anyone else out there have another...

50
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:01,371
Her name was Lena Pozak.

51
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,093
She looked like an angel,

52
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,956
but she sent me to hell.

53
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,438
With one shove,

54
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,141
she sent my whole world spinning.

55
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:15,529
She showed me how to transmit my psychic self into the consciousness of others.

56
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,350
To see through their eyes.

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,091
Hear through their ears.

58
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,732
The real mind pirate stuff.

59
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:36,461
Naturally, it was a price.

60
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,782
That's my sister Monica.

61
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:39,122
Cute.

62
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,366
plastic dress

63
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:49,590
maybe you can find out for me

64
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,292
and him?

65
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,675
I don't know

66
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,417
my father had a money student

67
00:04:58,558 --> 00:04:59,879
he was hoping to come in first

68
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,100
so leave it

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,441
it doesn't waste much time

70
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:04,943
who's the toy boy?

71
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,305
where's Mr. Moulage?

72
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,767
meet him at the tea room at 10 o'clock

73
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:19,831
prompts appear that allow you to choose actions for the main character.

74
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,412
Those are going to appear in the upper right corner.

75
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:22,532
I overkill on the first date.

76
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:23,333
Come on.

77
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:26,114
Perhaps you are a man who enjoys...

78
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:27,655
We tell him to get lost.

79
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,416
You shouldn't sell stuff that isn't yours.

80
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:34,959
There are also objects that you can touch and receive retro-cognitive flashes.

81
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,681
The icons for those are going to appear on the bottom of the screen.

82
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:48,383
And when you touch one, you get a movie.

83
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:54,506
And these are clues and back story and information that you are going to have to in your head

84
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:55,346
assemble.

85
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:56,947
Nice logo.

86
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:58,028
Mini quick?

87
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,108
Maxi quick?

88
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:02,630
Mirage Quest is an institute for self esteem.

89
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,431
Maximum you, maximum me.

90
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:06,792
What about the screaming cat?

91
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,953
I have no idea what you're talking about.

92
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,436
The further along you go in the story, you will discover R. McGuffin in the plot, which

93
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:20,878
is called the Psychic Collector.

94
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:27,344
The Psychic Collector, when it is activated, as it's just about to be, will enhance your

95
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:30,087
powers and therefore double your interface.

96
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,506
All the characters are chasing after the four psychic collectors.

97
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,368
Three have been found, one is still missing.

98
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,334
Now you have the ability to jump into people's heads from a distance,

99
00:06:57,494 --> 00:07:00,456
or in this case, read the psyche of a character who's with you.

100
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:17,678
Stop it!

101
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,358
Stop it!

102
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,399
What was that?

103
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:19,940
You also up...

104
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,162
You were reading me!

105
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,724
Invading my psyche.

106
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:45,008
You also have the ability to throw thoughts at other characters and make them do things.

107
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,070
These icons appear at the bottom here.

108
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:53,695
I'd like you to have this.

109
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,737
Thanks.

110
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:57,858
No later, no payback. Let's move.

111
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:58,759
Yes, it's a comedy.

112
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,069
Those can be very, very strategic.

113
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,593
Now, those are the sort of things that, as a player,

114
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:07,316
these are the choices that you're making on the fly.

115
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,200
What happens if you want to sit back and just watch the movie?

116
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,941
We allow you to do that as well.

117
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:14,403
Late in the game, yes?

118
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:21,512
Oh, I was just going to say that it may be obvious or not obvious, but every time you take advantage of something,

119
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,874
you're changing what's going to happen next.

120
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:30,858
Obviously, when we touched the object, Sylvia reacted to the fact, and we knew something a little bit more about Sylvia,

121
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,460
the blonde woman with the MirageQuest pin.

122
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:43,706
When we told Chad to get lost, we were active, and the objects that appeared afterwards would only appear if we had told Chad to get lost.

123
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:50,575
If we do things throughout the entire movie, we're going to change what is and is not available to us as we play through.

124
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:55,101
That's the idea of creating a narrative that works like a nervous system.

125
00:08:55,362 --> 00:09:01,950
And you make one choice up here, and it's telling the entire story what you've done, and it's going to ripple all the way through.

126
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:10,617
Now, so what we want to demonstrate now is, late in the story, you come to Sylvia, you're

127
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:14,721
looking for notebook containing vital pieces of information.

128
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:18,244
If you sit back and do nothing, the scene might unfold like this.

129
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:26,330
You're in the wrong room.

130
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,593
Don't we ever get a scene together?

131
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:29,973
Hmm?

132
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:36,799
Know what Max is doing? I was just in his head, writing a little poem for the princess.

133
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,580
You're so far in the rebound, you haven't stopped bouncing.

134
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,060
Screw you!

135
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,541
One way of getting even, but I hit hard.

136
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,902
You can't compete with the trophy wife.

137
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:48,302
She's nothing!

138
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,023
Nothing? She's adorable.

139
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:51,923
What's any of you around for anyway?

140
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:54,824
Pest control.

141
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,382
I want this one back when he's properly cooked.

142
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,688
Let's look at it again, and in this case, John is going to activate the collector.

143
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,312
You're in the wrong room.

144
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,826
God is throwing submissions.

145
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,929
Oh, swear me with the blood from a kosher killing.

146
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,171
Oh, weird industrial fluids.

147
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:47,515
Oh, make me do unspeakable things with these little things.

148
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,696
Oh, super glue-up parrots in my body,

149
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:51,658
they'll be scratching and scratching,

150
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,820
bleeding through your paws.

151
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,284
Oh, oh, and I'm wearing a clown costume.

152
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,105
Oh!

153
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:02,606
Rick, you're gone.

154
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,030
I'm Lance!

155
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,852
Who ordered the gun?

156
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:21,197
I think we did.

157
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:25,040
Would you like me to fire it, and maybe clean it for you?

158
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,162
Just give it to me, you know, I could ram it, and load it.

159
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,774
Give me the god damn gun, Lance.

160
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:37,577
I want you to have it just like you pictured, okay?

161
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,783
The fact that Psychic Detective doesn't stop, uh, is really crucial.

162
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:55,103
to understanding a lot about the structure, a lot about the challenges that we had to tackle,

163
00:11:55,803 --> 00:12:00,630
and what makes it different from other products that call themselves interactive movies.

164
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,781
The most popular entertainments out there that are interactive movies tend to work a certain way.

165
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:12,384
You get a bit of film, and then you have to solve a puzzle, and then you get some more movie,

166
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,706
and then you have to solve a puzzle, a little more movie,

167
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:19,528
a puzzle that could last 60 minutes before you get more film.

168
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:26,038
Those are very entertaining experiences, but what they lose is a sense of film time.

169
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:31,504
I mean, what we respond to in movies, what we think is great, is the relentless pace.

170
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:37,490
The fact is, films and even TV shows, they don't pause, with the possible exception of

171
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,853
Winky Dink, you know, which was the grandfather of all interactive movies.

172
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,276
We'll do a seminar on Winky Dink later.

173
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:43,876
We will.

174
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:48,281
But what happens is, if the movie is hurtling by, then

175
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,403
you've got to make your choices on the fly.

176
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:53,647
If you're wondering what's going to happen next, even as

177
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,810
it's happening next, and trying to decide, well, what's

178
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,291
the proper decision to do here?

179
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,855
You know, we think that becomes an interesting experience.

180
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:08,620
And it comes from the fact that we decided to tie all of the different prompts to the dramatic action.

181
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,505
Right. It also means that what we're doing is we are treating the film as the puzzle itself.

182
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:20,128
Because you are sitting there and deciding, whose head should I jump into, what object

183
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:24,309
should I touch, what thought should I throw, when should I use the collector, and by doing

184
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,890
that you're editing the movie on the fly.

185
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,571
Which is, to people from Hollywood, a very sacrilegious phrase to say.

186
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,093
It is honestly what goes on here.

187
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:38,975
It seemed like a good idea because if you set up a set of characters,

188
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:43,778
those characters are operating according to traits which you have communicated to the audience.

189
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:47,400
Those traits, for us, were themselves a set of rules.

190
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,282
That certain characters are going to do certain things,

191
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:54,845
and if we push the characters into different emotional arenas,

192
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,806
they're going to react in character.

193
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:59,666
according to the rules that we've set out for them.

194
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:05,068
And if we think about that challenge as being the beginning of the game,

195
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:09,629
then the puzzle aspect is threaded throughout the entire experience,

196
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:13,269
because we're asking you not to figure out whodunit,

197
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:16,190
but to figure out why everybody done it.

198
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,950
Why everybody's doing things.

199
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,651
John likes to call it a whodunit instead of a whydunit,

200
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,651
and I like that very much because...

201
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,855
An interactive story is horizontal by nature.

202
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,177
It's got to be wide.

203
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:30,339
There's got to be a lot of parallel possibilities

204
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,640
existing side by side.

205
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,064
There's got to be a lot of back story and a lot of subplots

206
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,706
that you can wander at will.

207
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:42,152
A whodunit is going to basically build to one plot point answer.

208
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,333
And once you know it,

209
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:50,056
end of story. A wide done it can be about the fact that A did this to B, later on C

210
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:55,738
did this to A, now A, B, and C are going to meet over here, unless of course D finds out

211
00:14:55,798 --> 00:15:00,680
about it. That becomes a much wider map of story and there are a lot more possibilities

212
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,242
that you've got to uncover and connect. I mean films we think lend themselves to this

213
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:06,563
sort of

214
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:11,153
method because they're so fragmented to begin with.

215
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:14,537
It is a puzzle. A film is a puzzle that's been assembled for you.

216
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:18,401
You know, it begins at the writing stage where you're putting your scenes on index cards

217
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:20,364
and trying to decide what's the proper order.

218
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:25,309
You're breaking it down into the pieces that you're going to shoot most efficiently for production.

219
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,271
And then the editor and the director are sitting together,

220
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,592
and they're stitching together the most meaningful whole.

221
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:34,433
Now, what if you made a Rubik's cube of a film,

222
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:36,774
where there was more than one meaningful whole,

223
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,795
and where each different sequence and different order

224
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,976
that you might put together was going

225
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,577
to give you a different kind of experience?

226
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,598
That's what we're dealing with here.

227
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:51,571
One of the ways that you do that is to play with time and sequencing.

228
00:15:53,172 --> 00:16:01,158
You set certain actions in stone, within the story, and you allow the player to come to

229
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,880
them at their own pace, in their own order.

230
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,105
Yeah, they're essentially dramatic modules that have different entrances and exits and

231
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:13,767
can be altered depending on previous action.

232
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:20,589
And if those dramatic modules are attached to a certain number of set-in-stone tent poles,

233
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,970
people can play through experiences in different time order,

234
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,090
with different emotional states and different sets of knowledge,

235
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,271
both in the player's mind and the character's minds,

236
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,312
when they approach those different modules.

237
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:37,872
So here are a few givens, and we'll show you how they play out.

238
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:41,853
The fourth collector is hidden over here.

239
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:47,937
There is a blackmail scheme, very dangerous, going on over here.

240
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:53,821
The old lady is waiting for us in the mansion here, and Sylvia is going to show up and try

241
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:54,342
and kill her.

242
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,826
And down the hall in the mansion is a hidden room, which you may or may not have found

243
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:00,326
out about.

244
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:06,390
At a certain part in our movie, our hero Eric Fox is going to return to the mansion to see

245
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,011
the old lady.

246
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,394
And the fact is, this can happen a number of different ways, depending upon what order

247
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:12,074
you've taken things.

248
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,268
He can show up and he can know absolutely nothing.

249
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:18,229
She says it has to be you all along.

250
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:21,470
I trust you behave yourself.

251
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:39,312
Drowning in the water, trying to swim and swim, but ripping your own throat with sharp

252
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:40,092
hooves.

253
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,574
I love that old world folklore.

254
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:43,214
Quiet!

255
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:49,818
You joke and fumble when you must face the killer himself.

256
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,800
Only two options appear because we know nothing.

257
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,662
Lexi, the best of the Black Diamond.

258
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,052
It's your next miracle.

259
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:08,294
Now, Amy, we went to the blackmail scheme, and we got psychically fried.

260
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:15,677
We're showing up a moron.

261
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,317
But we're able to save the old lady.

262
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:18,038
Lena, no!

263
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:18,218
Stop!

264
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,438
No!

265
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,779
Silence!

266
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,860
Can't you see? It's her.

267
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,031
He's a burnt marshmallow.

268
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,253
Think how you can train him.

269
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:32,753
Oh, you fool!

270
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:36,996
I love your blouse.

271
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:38,817
I'll tell you what.

272
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,479
You find the fourth collector, huh?

273
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,002
And then you let the village idiot make a special delivery.

274
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:48,164
And then maybe I'll give you back Little Sister.

275
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,645
Find it, boy!

276
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:54,348
I've always wanted a pet.

277
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,921
**laughter**

278
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:03,667
Very well.

279
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:05,569
Come back to us.

280
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:12,175
He only has three!

281
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:16,879
Otherwise you are gone forever!

282
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:24,189
The other hand you might have gotten the fourth collector and shown up in time to save Madame T

283
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,650
Which means you can use the fourth collector

284
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,391
Just for me Eric

285
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,311
Make a twist

286
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:34,151
Get another one

287
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,071
You can go weirder, cowboy.

288
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:57,831
Much weirder.

289
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:01,092
Are you with me?

290
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:05,373
Oh, you're the best.

291
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:10,194
Oh, I'm sick and lazy.

292
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,115
On the other hand...

293
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,935
Perhaps you got the collector, but too late.

294
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:19,056
You arrived later in time.

295
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:21,837
Go!

296
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,032
You cannot hide, you must fight him!

297
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,913
I'm not ready.

298
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:35,355
Only fear, find the scar, do not choose me!

299
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:45,378
If you were ten years older, and I was thirty years...

300
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,458
Let me try.

301
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:56,563
Another possibility is that you had found out about the hidden room.

302
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,126
So you go there first.

303
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,441
And there's lots of stuff to see in the hidden room.

304
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:36,044
More clues and backstory that will help you piece the whole mystery together.

305
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:41,649
But if you stay too long, there are obviously jeopardies involved in that.

306
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,392
But in this case, we left in time.

307
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:46,433
Yes, we left in time.

308
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,819
Tell Max he settles for three.

309
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,319
Tell him yourself.

310
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,279
You can't hide.

311
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,580
He can't make the black diamond.

312
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,061
Max gets what he needs.

313
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:15,663
He's already got the little girls.

314
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:17,944
I'll get you both.

315
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:20,384
Or you know where to find us.

316
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,826
Oh, and Max sends you lots of kisses.

317
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:32,300
And look at her try to talk to Mokey lately.

318
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:45,075
And of course another example is you could find the hidden room, you could go in, you could touch objects to your heart's delight, but what that means is you're going to probably show up and the old lady will be dead.

319
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:04,115
Now what this does is it gives you a sense that your choices really matter as

320
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:09,583
you're playing the film. From a production standpoint it allows us

321
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:16,048
to deal with a lot of possibilities in an efficient and budgetable manner.

322
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,309
I mean, was all of that...

323
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,612
It means we were locked in Madame T's bedroom for two full days.

324
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:27,656
In terms of the development of the movie, we've got six chapters.

325
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:32,900
The moment we just showed you is towards the end of the fifth chapter.

326
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:38,184
But the way the moments, the way the dramatic modules are played mean that...

327
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,187
You can arrive too late to save Madame T.

328
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,449
You can arrive early and she can still be in jeopardy.

329
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,774
We've tried to make something that has the flotation of these dramatic modules in time

330
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:55,998
and also something in which the variables are shifted

331
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:59,601
because of what you've done previously through the movie.

332
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,804
So we tried to track and estimate what you would know at that point

333
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:04,965
and what the hero would know.

334
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,806
From a production standpoint...

335
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:13,469
We did a very smart thing early on, and it's something we had done with Jim at Electronic Arts,

336
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:17,912
which is that we played the game on paper with a lot of different people,

337
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:25,795
not only to get their reaction to the tone, the kind of interaction, and the scale of what we were trying to attempt,

338
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:31,878
but it was a useful thing because we had a 500-page script which Michael wrote,

339
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:36,220
and for most productions, that seems impossible.

340
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:43,791
The limits of physical video production are that you need the cast and crew on site to be able to turn out

341
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:51,922
usually maybe five or six pages of dialogue a day if you're moving at a real clip in terms of making a motion picture.

342
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:59,084
With 500 pages, we had about 20 days to shoot, in fact exactly 20 days in which to shoot all the material,

343
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:04,066
which meant that we were covering a great deal more than five or six pages a day.

344
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:10,908
And in order to be able to do this and not go crazy, we did some things in production that made a lot of sense.

345
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:15,309
We lit a lot of the environments we were working in theatrically.

346
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,731
so that we could shoot more than one or two angles at a time.

347
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:25,293
In fact, in some instances, we could shoot an entire 360-degree number of setups,

348
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:30,315
looking at different actors from different angles because of our switch of POV,

349
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:31,855
or building the scene.

350
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:38,340
in traditional filmic style with wide shots, masters, and close-ups, twos, and singles.

351
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,263
The other thing that we did when we played the game beforehand

352
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:47,967
was we educated the cast and crew to understand why something that might seem abrupt...

353
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:53,735
and completely discontinuous, even though we were shooting out of continuity order,

354
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:59,602
would make a certain amount of game sense because of what we were intending.

355
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:05,690
So, after a while, even though the actors were porting around a shrunken copy of a 500-page script,

356
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:14,436
They were well-versed enough in knowing the threads of the drama to be able to know exactly why they were doing things.

357
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:18,598
For example, Sylvia's reactions to being pulled off Madame T.

358
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:23,781
There's seven, eight, nine different ways that she's stopped from killing the old lady.

359
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:30,893
She had to know each time what was going on in the plot so that she could react to it because

360
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:34,620
something that's subtle in her performance is what she does and doesn't know.

361
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:37,986
What the bad guy Max Mirage has been keeping from her.

362
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,664
and what's in the foreground. It's one of the things that you as Eric Fox can use to elucidate

363
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:50,410
stuff. You can use her jealousy of Monica to your advantage, but the performer has to be able to

364
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,354
communicate that to you in a subtle sort of way so you know what her state of mind is.

365
00:26:55,874 --> 00:27:00,737
Which also means that we're setting you up for the throwing of thoughts at various characters

366
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:06,161
because if you throw aggression, submission, or affection at particular characters, you're

367
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:09,923
going to get different reactions depending on who they are at that moment.

368
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:13,685
We might get something we like from the bouncer by throwing affection.

369
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:18,148
If we ever try throwing affection at Sylvia in certain circumstances, she's really going

370
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,289
to take it the wrong way.

371
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,231
So from a production standpoint, we did a number of kind of interesting things.

372
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:29,093
In fact, we found that the actors after a while were a little bit more on the ball about

373
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:33,614
exactly where we were coming from and where we were going because we were concentrating

374
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:36,716
too much on the actual details of production.

375
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:41,618
So there was a great advantage to playing the game in advance with everybody.

376
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:46,563
Come back around now to the idea of the film as a puzzle.

377
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:50,467
We were looking at how you can play the movie in different

378
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,689
orders and how that's meaningful.

379
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,094
The other idea is that we're trying to get our audience to

380
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:58,936
connect the dots visually.

381
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:04,804
Our supposition is, any one of you sat on an airplane and watched the movie without headphones,

382
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:06,667
you'd know what happened in the story.

383
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:10,693
You could tell us the story without necessarily having listened to it,

384
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,217
or even paid extremely close attention to it.

385
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:25,463
When John talks about it being a why done it, we've taken a great deal of the backstory and of the subplot and literally chopped it up and scattered it around the movie.

386
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:36,788
We've sort of turned the film or the story into a landscape and we want the player to wander through and find different moments and slowly start to connect them.

387
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,329
What the hell is the screaming cat about?

388
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,490
You will eventually learn that if you happen to come back.

389
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,632
to the right place for it.

390
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:49,699
Doing things like having psychic memories, being able to read the history of people,

391
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:54,205
and having psychic flashes allows us to create these sort of sequences.

392
00:28:54,225 --> 00:29:00,373
We're going to now take a look at reading the psyche of the arch-villain Max Mirage.

393
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,964
Everybody played that part perfectly.

394
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,006
This is how you do it.

395
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:31,907
All of those fragments, they mean something.

396
00:29:31,927 --> 00:29:34,187
Yeah, along with being abstract.

397
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,088
Yes.

398
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,128
There are lots of moments throughout the piece

399
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:40,369
in which we are very, very explicit about what things mean.

400
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:46,535
So in a way what we wanted was we wanted the thoughts and ideas to percolate in everybody's head

401
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:54,723
through multiple viewings, and then when the apparentness of what things mean occurs to people

402
00:29:54,783 --> 00:30:02,070
and they get to the right place at the right time, there is an explicit explanation of what they may have thought was going on.

403
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:08,644
In the process of putting together a story that works this way,

404
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:14,085
you are inevitably going to want to shuttle the player to certain areas.

405
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,746
You can call these areas funnels or bottlenecks,

406
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:21,787
but they are a pain in the ass,

407
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:26,628
because you know that they're going to see them a number of times,

408
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,608
or they're going to pass through this area a number of times.

409
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:35,025
although we figured out a way around this recently.

410
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:39,187
In the end, the true answer, I think,

411
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,027
is to have the player and the computer

412
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,689
construct those sequences almost on a shot-by-shot basis,

413
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:46,430
doing montages on the fly.

414
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,811
In Psyche Detective, we tried a couple of solutions.

415
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:53,253
We didn't necessarily cover all of our bases,

416
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:55,554
but a number of times we used.

417
00:30:56,294 --> 00:31:01,298
Two methods. The first is to create a short scene that is really like the hub of a wheel.

418
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,060
It has a lot of different options coming out of it.

419
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,982
So even though you're going to hit it a number of times, you can go different places with it.

420
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:11,745
Right, and one of the things I think that you may have noticed about psychic is that

421
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:17,089
when you decide to take action, when you decide to either jump into somebody else's head,

422
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,090
touch an object, or respond to an action prompt,

423
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:23,173
you are cutting off the moment that you're in the middle of,

424
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:24,915
and you're jumping to another moment.

425
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:26,456
So we connect?

426
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,137
And this is a prime example of that.

427
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:29,178
You can touch your keychain.

428
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:30,719
Coach Monica, just a little more.

429
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,541
I do not trust this Mirage Quest.

430
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:35,022
You're going?

431
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:35,502
Stop her.

432
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:36,723
I have to.

433
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:37,444
Don't ask why.

434
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:38,485
You're just like your bracelet.

435
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,666
Just hate me if you must.

436
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,029
You can beg her for help.

437
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,431
You can follow her.

438
00:31:48,612 --> 00:31:50,353
Or what John has chosen to do...

439
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,434
Go home, you idiot.

440
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:52,755
...is that you can jump in her head.

441
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,116
How come I never thought about going home?

442
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,190
You think I don't know.

443
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,014
I can't feel you.

444
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:07,539
Sliding around in the back of my head.

445
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:16,595
We spent a lot of time talking about the combination of reward and frustration.

446
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:21,279
What can we reward people with as they play through Psychic Detective?

447
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:27,583
And what level of frustration are people going to feel because they don't understand what's going on?

448
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:28,964
And we decided...

449
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,827
explicitly to throw people into the soup in the very beginning in the exact

450
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:38,750
position of our main character which is you've been led into a film noir world

451
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,793
you've been lied to and you've got to figure things out because your ass is on

452
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:45,174
the line we are anticipating that

453
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:49,499
People are going to bring their personalities to playing Psyche Detective.

454
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,044
Some people are going to simply sit back and let the movie play,

455
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:56,648
and the movie will talk to them and tell them a great deal of story.

456
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:00,733
Some people are going to jump in and touch everything that comes up first.

457
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,697
It's the first thing they're going to do, they're going to just grab anything that comes up.

458
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:06,459
There are rewards and frustrations for that.

459
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:09,421
We're going to mete out equal amounts of,

460
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:10,402
that was a good move,

461
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:12,543
and maybe that wasn't exactly the brightest thing.

462
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:15,906
So that people will adjust their rhythm

463
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:17,987
to the rhythms that we've put in front of them.

464
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,568
The rhythms of the characters,

465
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,250
the rhythms of the videos of the scenes,

466
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,671
and the rhythms of the available choices

467
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,453
that come up depending on what they've done.

468
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:32,137
Another way then to deal with funnel points is, of course, to have different variations of the scene.

469
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:38,561
In this particular case in time, where the little weasel named Mokey is picking you up after you come out of jail,

470
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,602
you may know different things.

471
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:44,824
The movie is going to track that, and the appropriate scenes are going to play.

472
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:46,025
I just want to use the damn thing.

473
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,347
You want a collector? We can get one on Brook Street.

474
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,228
Sure, sure. A genuine Rolex.

475
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:53,289
The fourth collector is in a pawn shop.

476
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,843
We know this. We're positive.

477
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:59,968
Oh, baby! Do you realize what we could do with two collectors?

478
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,030
Pick a country. Be an emperor.

479
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,253
We got Lexi by the balls.

480
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:04,973
Excuse me?

481
00:34:04,993 --> 00:34:06,796
Ah, don't play dumb.

482
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,938
You think the Max Mirage comes out of nowhere?

483
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:12,242
New face, new rack. Same old slime dog.

484
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:13,764
Lexi Golitsyn.

485
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:29,534
Ah ha! That's my pills!

486
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:32,757
Maybe I just want to use the damn thing.

487
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,138
Kid, this is white hot.

488
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,099
We snag a collector.

489
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,501
We're big league, psychic mercenaries.

490
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:39,842
You with the brain, me with the rolodex.

491
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,463
That collector belongs to Lena.

492
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:44,146
The hell it does. I shelled out cash four years ago.

493
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:45,046
So you say.

494
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:46,828
Don't you get it?

495
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:49,089
Lexi never died.

496
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,572
A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.

497
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,193
Max Mirage?

498
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,114
No, Wayne Newton.

499
00:34:55,754 --> 00:34:57,656
Come on dude, get with the beat!

500
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:03,179
So if you've actually gone with Moki to this drop,

501
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,021
it means that you did a handful of things earlier in the movie.

502
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:09,143
And we realize that at this point,

503
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:11,904
the vital piece of information you need to know

504
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:15,166
is that Max Mirage, our present day bad guy,

505
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:21,290
is actually a rather evil ex-Soviet spy named Lexi Golitsyn in disguise.

506
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:28,944
The best metaphor that I know for an interactive story or playing an interactive story is ironically

507
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,509
a feature film and that's Groundhog Day.

508
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:36,693
where the player is really Bill Murray. You are in a

509
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:41,656
universe that is full of rules with actions that are fixed in time.

510
00:35:42,236 --> 00:35:44,498
You've got to decide how you're going to behave,

511
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:51,902
how you are going to deal with everything, and what you're ultimately trying to do is be in the right place at the right time and

512
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:58,386
be the best possible version of yourself to be able to advance and to break the cycle.

513
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:01,996
One of the things an interactive movie has to do

514
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,139
is let you know how you did.

515
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:06,722
Throughout the film.

516
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:11,232
we try and talk back to you and have characters let you know

517
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:15,254
not only how you're behaving, but what you've accomplished and what you might know.

518
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:18,375
But what all of this is ultimately building to

519
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:22,256
is something that is referred to throughout the movie, which is Black Diamond.

520
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:28,439
And Black Diamond is both a physical board game, but more importantly, a mind game,

521
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,519
a psychic battle that is going to take place.

522
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:35,528
It's unavoidable. It is sort of our high noon showdown.

523
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:39,311
And yet there are so many different ways that you can head into it.

524
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:44,174
Depending upon not only what you know, but who you've helped,

525
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:47,816
who may still be alive, who may be stronger,

526
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,278
because you've found secrets that could heal them.

527
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,800
All of those things are taken into account.

528
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,581
Does Jim want to say anything about...

529
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,863
I need to see it.

530
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:58,863
Okay, we'll take a look at it first.

531
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,238
You have your ugly thoughts.

532
00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:08,179
That's the bad guy.

533
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:09,840
Your little demons.

534
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:13,482
I have mine.

535
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:19,206
And he's turning on all four collectors.

536
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,193
Which ones are stronger?

537
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,396
And he's sending us into a psychic battleground space, which is...

538
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:40,856
So, in the very beginning, you've got eight possible icons out of a total of 32.

539
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:44,917
They reflect how you've played through the movie and what we think you know.

540
00:37:45,718 --> 00:37:49,139
You pick the first four, and Max will pick the other four.

541
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,160
You're trying to pick the four that you think are the strongest for you, that you understand.

542
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,401
Max gets the others.

543
00:37:57,898 --> 00:37:59,218
I never move first.

544
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,859
It would be bad manners.

545
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,839
And then basically you're battling him.

546
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,300
You're playing what you think is a strong piece for you

547
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,001
against what you think is a weak piece for him.

548
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,121
Maximum max.

549
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:10,021
Maximum obedience.

550
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,442
Maximum fighting.

551
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:13,642
Silence!

552
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:18,304
A lot of characters like Lena and Madame T'Kunoff,

553
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,744
the old lady and our heroine,

554
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:22,485
did you really think you could be her knight in shining armor?

555
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:23,525
I wanted to help.

556
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:28,360
Too bad. You just damned her to hell.

557
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,983
Characters can be in different states by the time we get here.

558
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:35,848
In fact, at this point, Madame T is a very strong icon, and Lena was a very weak one.

559
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:40,993
Be careful, boys. She'll suck you dry. She needs you to keep herself strong.

560
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:44,156
The only thing she needs is your ass on a platter.

561
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:55,800
Hmm, that one was particularly tasty.

562
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,182
The damn thing is red!

563
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,944
Well, take note...

564
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:05,429
for some other lifetime.

565
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:10,874
Yes, in fact, back to the triumph.

566
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,856
Is that the best you can do?

567
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,678
Sacrifice yourself?

568
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:17,660
So we get one of 14 possible conclusions to the movie,

569
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,962
depending on how we play it.

570
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,850
I'm so full of blood.

571
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,150
Of the balls.

572
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,431
It's over, Mark!

573
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:39,772
If only I could die.

574
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:42,293
I win! I win!

575
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:45,014
Kiki, I win!

576
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:46,334
Kiki!

577
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:47,294
Kiki!

578
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:48,395
Kiki...

579
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:51,636
We've suffered pretty severe brain damage, as you can see.

580
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:58,498
And at the very end, the game will tell you which of the 14 conclusions you triggered.

581
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,654
and it will give you a little hint for your next play through

582
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:06,559
which is based on something you didn't see the first time.

583
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:06,979
Right.

584
00:40:10,504 --> 00:40:16,551
We've been talking a lot about the puzzle and the movie being the same beast.

585
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:26,396
I thought it would be appropriate now to hear from Mr. Simmons, who in many ways was safeguarding

586
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:31,818
the agenda of the game itself and dealing with two people who had never made a game

587
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:35,719
before and were prepared to run wild.

588
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,381
I guess just to sort of finish up on the Black Diamond game part of it and what Michael had

589
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,502
said about needing to find a way for...

590
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:48,517
the game to talk back to the player.

591
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:54,040
You know, the conversational model that we talk about in interactive design a lot, you know,

592
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:58,504
the player thinks of something, says it into the game through the interface,

593
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:02,366
the computer analyzes that input, thinks about it,

594
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,309
formulates a response, and now something's different when we think about it.

595
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:13,575
During the course of an interactive drama, there's less of that than we're accustomed to

596
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:19,079
in a gaming experience where the conversational loop is really tight.

597
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,606
Other than the kinds of things like we do something and in the next scene we mention it to Moki

598
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:31,049
and Moki goes, oh, you know, what you don't know is, and then he gives us some stuff back.

599
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,552
So that the feedback loop is slower at that point.

600
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:36,334
But in order to...

601
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:42,530
to think of, if you want to think of I'm winning the game, I'm accomplishing some particular goal,

602
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:51,334
then what you're able to do in this very, very simple little board game of these eight icons

603
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:57,836
have values relative to each other and they may come and go depending on, if your brain's been

604
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:04,219
fried, the value of the pieces you're playing with are lessened because you just don't have the

605
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:04,599
powers.

606
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:12,834
So the feedback loop in terms of win-loss, if that's the way the player wants to come

607
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,819
you know, think about the experience for themselves, and some people think about it that way and

608
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:23,966
some people don't, is very long. It's 30 minutes long.

609
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,462
because the piece is only 20 to 40 minutes long,

610
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:32,324
people will sit down and in one sitting,

611
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:36,066
go through that loop two or three times

612
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:40,308
to see how they're doing and grow a lot from doing it.

613
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:41,729
One of the things that we...

614
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:47,967
had no idea if it was going to work or not, which is why we played it on paper so many times.

615
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:55,371
Michael playing the role of Mr. Memory and standing in front of somebody and just playing the game for

616
00:42:55,431 --> 00:43:00,634
them all day long. I mean, we'd bring people in, lock them in this room, and they'd play the thing

617
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:04,196
for, you know, eight times. I'm having bad flashbacks. Yeah.

618
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,871
what I had to sit in there and referee because he would have this tendency to

619
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:16,954
want to help people out a little bit and so the way he would play the game is he

620
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,716
would describe the scene and all those little icons that are on the screens we

621
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:24,858
had three by five cards of and he would slide them forward and they were

622
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:30,101
available and Madame T walks out of the room and her icon disappears and

623
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:34,864
somebody would be oh no you can't have it and but he would want to go okay you can

624
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,384
have it back

625
00:43:38,842 --> 00:43:44,504
So we play all the way through and we would get to the end and we'd pull out this board

626
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:49,006
and put it on the table and have all these little icons spread around and Michael would

627
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:55,249
figure out which icons had to go on and then some of them sort of, depending on how the

628
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:59,450
story goes, all eight may be dictated by the playthrough you've done.

629
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:03,592
Perhaps four are dictated and the four we go grab kind of at random.

630
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:08,690
bring one of the women in, let's bring a minor character in, you know, we haven't

631
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,014
used the skull in a time or two, let's bring that in. And we'd throw that on

632
00:44:13,054 --> 00:44:17,998
there. And we didn't tell anybody anything about what they were supposed

633
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:21,921
to do, other than, you know, you can you can pick this piece up and move it. And

634
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:25,004
they try to go, you know, all the way around the board, say, no you can't move

635
00:44:25,044 --> 00:44:29,248
it that far. Oh, okay. And so we do it and then we would...

636
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:34,650
take the two pieces and do the little kids game of like, and this one stays.

637
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,731
And then he would describe the movie that would play as a result of it.

638
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:43,434
I mean, the first time we did it, people were just totally baffled.

639
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,955
And they just thought, this is, you know, this makes no sense whatsoever.

640
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,417
And we go, yeah, okay, let's make a note of that.

641
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,117
Makes no sense whatsoever.

642
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,158
And then they'd play it a second time.

643
00:44:53,178 --> 00:44:57,200
And they would see a correlation.

644
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,491
between what they had done before and what had happened the second time,

645
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:05,692
they would notice that, oh, these are different icons that came up this time

646
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:07,053
than came up the time before.

647
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,434
Oh, they noticed that. Okay, that's a good thing.

648
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:14,396
And after about the third time,

649
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:21,058
they would begin to formulate some firmly held opinions about what's going on here

650
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,519
and here's what I'm going to do the next time

651
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,400
and I'm going to go after this and I'm going to get that and I know.

652
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,480
And they were dead wrong.

653
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:28,923
But...

654
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:37,400
They had formulated an opinion, they had made a commitment, they were engaged.

655
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,102
And after about the fifth time, they had some firm opinions and some of them were right.

656
00:45:43,722 --> 00:45:47,283
And they could see that they were right in that feedback mechanism.

657
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:54,024
If I've got the cigarette and such and such has happened and I see that skull and I do that,

658
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:56,685
I know every single time that that's what's going to happen.

659
00:45:57,065 --> 00:45:58,225
So they start formulating.

660
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:06,267
a set of patterns which sometimes results in I've got to see a certain movie repeatedly,

661
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:07,668
but more often doesn't.

662
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:14,569
And they vectored toward improvement and getting things to happen the way they wanted them

663
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:20,831
to with very, very, with no instruction manual hints and help.

664
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:24,312
They put that together and that's when we realized, okay, it's going to work.

665
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:31,855
And that this feedback mechanism that we've structured at the end does allow them to put

666
00:46:31,995 --> 00:46:37,937
the whole story together and know what's going on and why, and to feel like they have some

667
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:40,378
power over controlling it.

668
00:46:40,538 --> 00:46:45,359
And having control in an interactive experience over what's going on instead of just feeling

669
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:52,102
at the mercy of arbitrary design decisions is a real challenge, and so we felt like we

670
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,662
did a pretty good job with that.

671
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:05,406
In many ways, our hope is that we find an audience for Psychic Detective that has a series of reactions to the material.

672
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:10,388
The first is the impulse to win, or to play it as well as possible.

673
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:15,171
The second is to know the whole world of the story.

674
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:19,734
find it and put it together and make for themselves a coherent narrative.

675
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:24,178
And the third is hopefully to find all the cool stuff.

676
00:47:24,198 --> 00:47:31,124
I mean, John has stocked this project with brilliant and twisted and funny little movies.

677
00:47:32,305 --> 00:47:35,748
If you get engaged, if you find a character that you really like,

678
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:37,609
hopefully you'll seek it all out.

679
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,411
In many ways...

680
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:45,856
As we got involved with Psyche Detective, I was reminded of an experience that I had when I was in high school

681
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:50,980
when I bought a comedy album by the Monty Python Group called Matching Tie and Handkerchief.

682
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,424
That had on one side a double set of grooves.

683
00:47:56,024 --> 00:48:00,107
And I played that side eight times and I got the same comedy routines.

684
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:06,492
And the ninth time, the needle dropped in the second set of grooves, and there was 15 minutes I had never heard before.

685
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:11,917
And that was a moment where technology and comedy conspired to blow my little mind.

686
00:48:11,937 --> 00:48:16,101
And it was a great experience. And it was a great sensation.

687
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:21,045
And my feeling is that CD-ROMs of this nature hold that potential.

688
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:28,111
That we can be making interactive stories, animated pieces, full motion video pieces,

689
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:32,334
where you pop it in, you don't know where you're going to begin.

690
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:37,739
You don't know where you're going to go, and you certainly don't know how it's going to end

691
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:43,603
We you know we started with looking at the puzzle aspect of putting all these pieces together

692
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:46,546
We with Jim's brilliant

693
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:54,112
Help and his original impulse about jumping into the minds of other people to be somewhere where your body shouldn't

694
00:48:55,173 --> 00:49:00,717
We realized that we could take hurdles it interface hurdles away from people

695
00:49:01,237 --> 00:49:05,838
and we could give them impulsive but instinctually correct material

696
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:08,079
with which they can drive the movie,

697
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,220
with which they can navigate through a realm of character-driven story possibilities.

698
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,401
It occurs to us now that we can up the ante on that quite considerably

699
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:24,863
by going deeper into the story, the world that the characters live in, and the characters,

700
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:27,883
because everybody connects with those elements

701
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,764
and everybody knows the language that we're speaking.

702
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:35,345
It's it's necessary to take the pieces and chop them up even smaller

703
00:49:35,826 --> 00:49:39,647
And it is very necessary for the movie to know how many times you've played it

704
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:43,728
Listen before we wrap up. We'd be happy to take some questions

705
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:45,348
Yeah back there

706
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:54,971
The average user

707
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,489
800, 900 hours? No, no, no, no.

708
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,432
It's a really difficult question to answer.

709
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:09,455
If you want to see all 14 endings, you know, 20 or 30 hours.

710
00:50:10,036 --> 00:50:14,458
If we're talking average intelligence, we might stretch that out a little bit more,

711
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:18,120
but the average gamer is a pretty smart customer.

712
00:50:20,341 --> 00:50:22,183
10 to 20 is reasonable.

713
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:23,623
Back there?

714
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:34,120
confirmation results were made on paper before you wrote the code.

715
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:36,963
What did you change in your evaluation based on feedback?

716
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:44,218
One of the things that we tried to do was open up the funnels of the bottlenecks.

717
00:50:44,298 --> 00:50:48,479
We realized that, hey, you know, we keep coming to the scene, and we're going to come to it

718
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,619
every time, and people are going to get pretty damn sick of it.

719
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:53,520
Let's try and open some of these up.

720
00:50:53,660 --> 00:51:01,421
We also built a prototype of the first chapter with still images and voiceover, and just

721
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,261
voice only between different characters.

722
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:10,006
And it was more of, there was a lot more internal musing on the part of the main character,

723
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:16,190
which we realized we didn't need because the user, the player was going to be doing that

724
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,211
and was going to be filling in a lot of the blanks.

725
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:23,675
So actually we realized we could take out a great deal that we thought we were going

726
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:27,958
to have to give to people and that they could create their own jumps and leaps between things,

727
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:30,820
that they were the glue between the different puzzle pieces.

728
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:44,461
We also realized that there were some important clues that opened up having some abilities in the final Black Diamond game that we needed to make a little easier to find and some that we needed to obscure a little more.

729
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:52,239
We, the whole thing took a little over two years.

730
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:57,823
I think because we were in very undefined territory.

731
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:05,427
Three months of brainstorming and six months of writing and twenty days of production and then a year of editing and coding I think.

732
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:10,435
Yeah, we were working with a proprietary authoring environment that Electronic Arts created,

733
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:17,667
and the overlap of post-production and authoring was not quite as neatly dovetailed as we would

734
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:18,147
have liked.

735
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,289
Good job.

736
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:19,590
Obviously…

737
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:26,491
my job. Well obviously there's no way to rough cut an interactive movie so we

738
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:32,993
have all the pieces made and then oddly enough I ended up authoring it but that

739
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:37,694
ended up being pretty cool because I could if I reached an authoring problem

740
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:42,416
movie wise I could quit the authoring environment go back into Adobe Premiere

741
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,657
recut the movie and bring it back into the authoring environment.

742
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:51,559
And that proved to be actually a fairly interesting way of being able to manipulate these elements.

743
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:52,939
Way up there in the back row.

744
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:04,024
Yes, you said, I think you addressed this partially, but you talked about finding a way around some of the funnels so that you didn't need to find them necessary.

745
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:11,633
I don't know if I meant that they were not necessary.

746
00:53:12,373 --> 00:53:17,217
It was necessary so that the script did not explode into chaos or thousands of pages.

747
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:21,840
It was necessary at times to shuttle the main character and the player to certain areas.

748
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,683
The point is you can do that with one scene that will always be the same.

749
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:32,107
You can do that with an array of scenes and depending upon what that player has done,

750
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,368
different ones will play.

751
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:37,932
Or go for a really short scene with a lot of choices right up the bat.

752
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:45,481
But in more recent works that we have been developing, we've just looked at the overall

753
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:48,584
structure in a completely different frame of mind.

754
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,508
and looked at how to not only create the dramatic modules,

755
00:53:53,348 --> 00:53:56,771
but how the different levels of interaction move them around

756
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:01,014
and actually change them, as Michael said before, on the fly.

757
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:03,756
And that's one of the things that we're investigating.

758
00:54:03,776 --> 00:54:05,438
Thank you.

759
00:54:05,478 --> 00:54:06,899
Are we stuck with the mystery genre?

760
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:11,718
I hope not, no. Comedy, thriller, horror, anything you want.

761
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,301
Thriller, horror still has history.

762
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:17,324
Comedy. We want to make comedy.

763
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:23,290
We think that actually interactive comedy is perfect because you change the setup, you change the joke.

764
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:32,092
I think that there is a presupposition right now that because you wanted to have one foot

765
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:39,702
at least planted in the game world, that there's got to be a quest involved or some goal.

766
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:46,348
And I think that often that will shuttle you towards some aspect of mystery.

767
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:52,273
To my mind, one of the main things to break is supernatural powers.

768
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:59,259
I think it's very, very easy to traverse this territory and have your choices be about powers.

769
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:00,620
I think it's a lot of fun.

770
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,305
But I think one of the great goals is to go beyond that and create an environment

771
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,227
where nobody's really questioning,

772
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,169
why am I making choices?

773
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:10,691
Why am I tweaking the narrative?

774
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:11,752
Why am I playing God?

775
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:13,413
They're just going ahead and they're doing it.

776
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:16,477
Right, because the drama demands those choices.

777
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:21,844
Actually, a mystery seems to hold a lot of promise for an interactive thing.

778
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,245
I'm trying to figure something out.

779
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:30,470
But one of the pitfalls of mystery is that in linear media,

780
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:35,313
we accept things that we don't understand in a mystery.

781
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:39,316
We enjoy the feeling out of touch and out of control

782
00:55:39,376 --> 00:55:40,617
because it's meant to be.

783
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:46,441
an eerie feeling that we know will come to a resolution and will be fixed by the time

784
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:54,265
it is over, an interactive experience needs to have you a little bit more in touch with

785
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:56,207
I am on top of what is going on.

786
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:01,510
I mean you are vacillating all over the place, but it is kind of a delicate balance and if

787
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,592
people feel too out of touch, they are very unsatisfied with the experience.

788
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:11,030
Within, turning 20 days into 40 days,

789
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,035
what production things would you have done

790
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,459
differently in practice tonight?

791
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,760
I wouldn't have turned 20 days into 40 days.

792
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,201
That costs a lot of money.

793
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:21,141
He wouldn't let us.

794
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:23,582
We were warned very early on.

795
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:25,682
Production things.

796
00:56:27,003 --> 00:56:28,863
It's interesting because we've been thinking

797
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:30,184
a lot recently about animation

798
00:56:30,204 --> 00:56:34,485
and about different kinds of graphic environments

799
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:35,785
for this kind of piece,

800
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:41,047
or for this sort of storytelling advance.

801
00:56:41,848 --> 00:56:46,031
And the advantage of live action for certain things is kind of interesting because there's a,

802
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:49,033
and I think we communicate it pretty well as you play through it,

803
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:54,057
there's a certain level of physicality that I think people want.

804
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:58,780
And episodic television, when you get into a TV series that you really love,

805
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:03,204
there are certain central issues that are always constant and things that change.

806
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,906
I would go further into that.

807
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:09,949
where you're taking characters, you know, into very weird situations.

808
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:12,651
We've got a comedy idea in mind in which

809
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:20,116
we're anticipating taking a host of characters into a number of very far out situations.

810
00:57:20,716 --> 00:57:23,438
And that's production, you know, that's real production value.

811
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,119
We're out of here?

812
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:26,100
We got booted. Thank you very much for coming.
