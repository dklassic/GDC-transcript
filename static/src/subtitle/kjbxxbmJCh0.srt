1
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,914
So thanks everyone for attending this session on art direction for AAA UI.

2
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:12,396
My name's Umar Yunus.

3
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:14,678
I'm the lead graphic designer at Dice LA.

4
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:20,282
Just a quick show of hands, who here is a graphic designer or a UI artist?

5
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:23,665
Okay, quite a few of you.

6
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:25,507
Art directors?

7
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:28,189
Damn.

8
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:30,751
Designers?

9
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:33,493
Coders?

10
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:35,275
Oh, nice.

11
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:48,789
producers. Anything else I missed out? Nice. So, okay, let's get started. Just a couple

12
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,111
of friendly reminders. Please silence your really old phones so they don't make noise.

13
00:00:55,832 --> 00:01:04,256
And also a reminder to fill out your surveys after this presentation is done. So, Ahlan

14
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:11,241
which loosely translates to welcome, welcomeen, bienvenido,

15
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:12,861
yokoso.

16
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,282
Hopefully I pronounced those correctly.

17
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,443
So we're going to be talking about more of this later.

18
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,684
But just a quick note, you can see how in different

19
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:25,045
languages, the same word has different length.

20
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:27,866
And when we talk about localizations, this is going

21
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:28,766
to become more important.

22
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,928
So today's session, we've got a lot to cover.

23
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:44,360
Hopefully this is going to be like a reference manual for you guys, so you can basically refer back to it when it gets uploaded to GDC Vault.

24
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:52,825
But I also want this talk to be interactive, so we're going to be asking for a couple of sections where we get the audience to participate.

25
00:01:54,426 --> 00:02:00,630
We're not going to be focusing on mobile or app development. This is mainly for AAA, so it's the big screen format.

26
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,991
Mainly console and PCs.

27
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:07,918
But before we jump in, I'm just going to give you a brief intro about me.

28
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,239
So I was born and raised in London.

29
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,459
It's just there on the map.

30
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,180
And I'm the youngest of four brothers.

31
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,640
My dad made our first computer with his own hands.

32
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:23,422
I don't know why it was called, but back in the day, you basically had to solder chips

33
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,182
on the motherboard.

34
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:33,044
But I do remember the C64, the Amiga, playing games on them was like my childhood, and using

35
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:33,564
Deluxe Paint 2.

36
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,504
which kind of got me interested in game art.

37
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,807
A couple of years back, I moved over 5,500 miles

38
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,568
to Los Angeles, and I've been working

39
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:46,430
in the games industry over here since then.

40
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,293
Here's a pic of me when I first started in the industry.

41
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,815
I was young, I was passionate, bearded,

42
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,498
and this is me with Kojima when I was working

43
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,419
at Kojima Productions.

44
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,583
You develop pretty fast in the industry.

45
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,384
So I've been working in the industry for 10 years,

46
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:06,605
over 10 years.

47
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:09,906
These are some of the games that I've worked on

48
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:10,806
in some of the studios.

49
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,888
The latest game I've been working on is Battlefield 1.

50
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:19,290
I worked on Metal Gear Solid V at Kajima Productions,

51
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,091
and before that I was working at Crytek in the UK,

52
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,152
working on the Crysis franchise.

53
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,794
So just to give you a bit of a flavor of what I do,

54
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,955
I put together a small show reel.

55
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,461
Let's have a look at that.

56
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:08,338
So what do you think?

57
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,179
Thanks.

58
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,882
So let's move on to some terms now.

59
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,823
Let's get into what this talk is about.

60
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:22,346
So a lot of people think that UI and UX are the same thing,

61
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,867
but they're not exactly the same thing.

62
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,490
When it comes to UX, this is a big thing.

63
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,571
It's actually from the point of where

64
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,533
the user buys your game at the store all the way

65
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:35,633
through to when they play the game.

66
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,298
So it's like the end-to-end interaction.

67
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,801
But UI kind of still is part of that UX, the user experience.

68
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:47,922
UI is more or less the in-game stuff.

69
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:50,503
So it's the UI, the menus, which you probably know.

70
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,603
That's why you're here for this talk.

71
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:54,965
But the UI is also the visual identity for the game.

72
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,466
And it conveys the style and tone in every detail.

73
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,428
So the information that the UI does is actually

74
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,750
is presenting information to the player,

75
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,172
whether it's visual, sound, touch, vibration.

76
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,794
And all of this essentially boils down to player feedback.

77
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,336
So any event or any message in the game

78
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,017
that you need to communicate to the player

79
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,378
is what UI kind of does.

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,441
And generally, when people think about UI,

81
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,722
they think of it as the HUD, the heads-up display,

82
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:25,063
which is when you're actually playing the game,

83
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:26,284
the core gameplay.

84
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,985
But I like to split it up into two things.

85
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,767
So, you know, we have the front end and the menus.

86
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,003
and then you also have the HUD and the gameplay.

87
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,184
And this kind of has a different approach.

88
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:41,006
So each one of these, the HUD is more like context-based,

89
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,587
where you're talking about messaging.

90
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:47,308
The things need to be instant and recognizable to the player.

91
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,409
And the front end is all about the navigation.

92
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,350
It's more about information architecture

93
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,810
and how your game is structured.

94
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,532
So people probably know that design isn't linear.

95
00:06:58,193 --> 00:06:58,993
It's like a mess.

96
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,454
And you'd go back and forth between everything

97
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:01,794
that you do.

98
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:07,338
You know, you iterate, you refine, and sometimes you just scrap ideas completely.

99
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:14,300
But we're trying to make this a lot easier by looking at art direction and also cognitive

100
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,002
design and we want to help streamline that process if we can and basically go for form

101
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:24,303
and function to kind of guide us along the route.

102
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:27,845
But why is this important?

103
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:43,602
You know when we're looking at games we want our players to see you I in context and we also want it to be transparent so you don't want to always show you I'd like you know hey here's you I you know it's in your face so you want you I to be subtle.

104
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:54,608
It's kind of like utility versus a state so you also wanted to look nice but you also want to make sure that it's not always front and center you don't people playing your you are you want people to play the game and you are is there to support these actions.

105
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:55,628
So.

106
00:07:56,682 --> 00:08:00,024
Without UI art direction, you end up with something like this.

107
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,466
You know, everything is on screen.

108
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,787
Everything's calling for attention.

109
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,689
There's no consistent style.

110
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,351
There's like 500 fonts just in this one screenshot.

111
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:15,014
So you want to make sure that there's no like, hey,

112
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,015
your health is low.

113
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:19,478
Throwing on next-gen effects doesn't help it either.

114
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:22,400
So you need to be subtle, make sure

115
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,400
that everything works together.

116
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:29,967
So just reset your brain by just looking at this dot in the center and just ignore what came before

117
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:36,129
So we need to get our bearings we need to look and see where we want to go

118
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,331
How do we attempt to create a UI that's visually appealing and usable?

119
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:45,513
But we also want to keep in mind the brand identity and the style and we want it to be unique

120
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:51,115
So we're going to be thinking big here. This is like the broad strokes. This is like the planning phase

121
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:55,805
So essentially with games, we want to design for the five senses.

122
00:08:56,545 --> 00:09:00,427
And the more senses you kind of design for, the more...

123
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,288
Oops, just went out there.

124
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:07,051
So there's an excellent TED talk by Jinseop Lee,

125
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,332
where he talks about designing for the five senses.

126
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:13,914
It's not games related, but it's still extremely interesting to see.

127
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,396
The last two, taste and smell,

128
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,918
they're not really mainstream at the moment,

129
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,518
so we're not going to concentrate on those.

130
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:22,639
Games.

131
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:27,027
do focus on touch and the interaction, the sound and the sight.

132
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,930
So, you know, the interaction is key to what makes games, games.

133
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,912
So, we're going to take a brief look at the platforms,

134
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:40,535
understand the input methods and translating that to our senses.

135
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:42,957
So, touch it, boom.

136
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,719
We know for console, you have like a controller,

137
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,041
it's got face buttons, so that's the way that we're interacting with our games.

138
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,443
And you'll understand how...

139
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,968
You know the inputs actually affect game or the UI.

140
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,209
You need to have real estate for buttons and prompts

141
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:58,889
and that kind of thing.

142
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,729
So that's why it's important to understand

143
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,390
what the controller can do and how

144
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,970
you want to represent that information on screen.

145
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,471
Same for PC and keyboard.

146
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,731
The PC Master Race.

147
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,972
So you know the mouse has similarities to the touch screen,

148
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:15,553
also the analog controller.

149
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,813
But it's still unique and you want

150
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,314
to try and cater for this as well.

151
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:20,494
You're trying to think of like.

152
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:26,056
You know everyone you want to try and make your game as inclusive as possible.

153
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:46,365
Sound is 50% of the experience. You know you can go and watch your favorite movies and just turn the volume to zero. It doesn't have quite the same impact so sound is actually a huge part of UI, but that's not my area of expertise, so I'm not going to talk about that. We're going to be focused on the vision, the visual story and what makes a good visual or image.

154
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:49,907
So we need to understand.

155
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:56,918
a couple of key areas of theory and how we can relate this to our design and how we can

156
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,220
make our images more appealing.

157
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:08,188
So this is an image of Blade Runner 2049 and that movie won awards for its cinematography

158
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:13,092
and there's a reason why this image is actually really nice and pleasing to the eye.

159
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:18,857
You know, composition, the style, the mood, the tone, the color, the grading.

160
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:22,029
You have a central focus, you have these parallax,

161
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,450
sorry, the perspective lines kind of leading your eye.

162
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,594
You can actually look at the image

163
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,776
and your eye has a chance to relax and take in the imagery.

164
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,579
It also works in black and white,

165
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,781
which is a very important feature.

166
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:43,405
It's still readable, composition is.

167
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,908
So you want to make sure that all of these components

168
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:48,829
actually work in your UI as well.

169
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:52,378
You can take all of this theory and apply it to UI.

170
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:55,660
Similarly, if you look at this image,

171
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,481
it doesn't quite have the same impact.

172
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,944
Even though the tones, maybe the perspective is slightly off,

173
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,946
but there's quite a lot for your eye to look at.

174
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,967
And that's the basis of this.

175
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:09,670
You want it to basically be, you want your eye

176
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,991
to rest at a point.

177
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,772
You don't want to just overload the user.

178
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,455
It's vibrant, it's saturated, but there's way too much noise.

179
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:22,591
you know, you want, we want to understand how we perceive this information, how, how we perceive

180
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:29,977
visuals. So to do that, we need to understand how the eye works.

181
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:35,941
So light enters our eye and hits the retina. And at the back of our retina, we have a concentrated

182
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:42,466
pit of rods and cones, which kind of looks like this. And the signals are sent to the brain.

183
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:47,049
The rods, they basically have a certain color.

184
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:52,823
Sorry, the cones have a certain color and they're sensitive to light based on like red, green and blue.

185
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:59,745
And you can see in the center of the image, there's a lot of concentration of red and green and blue is towards the outer edge.

186
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:05,286
So our eyes are actually super sensitive to red and that's really important for UI.

187
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,267
So we want to use red to call it to attention.

188
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:14,609
So whether it's danger or whether you want to bring the user's attention to something, then let's use red for that.

189
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,766
the science kind of informs how we should design a UI.

190
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:22,669
So if we kind of simplify that diagram, you get this.

191
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,592
So the center focus point is where you have red and green

192
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:30,394
sensitivity, and towards the outer edge, you have blue and

193
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,515
yellow and luminance.

194
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,637
So when it comes to designing a UI, especially for the

195
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,838
heads-up display, this is actually quite important.

196
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,620
So the biology already tells us how we want to distribute

197
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,741
the color in our designs.

198
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,980
So we're going to put the crucial information in the center.

199
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,442
And then towards the periphery, we want the secondary information.

200
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:54,585
And keep in mind, for pod layouts, this is extremely important.

201
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,607
Let's look at perception and how our brains actually

202
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,308
understand what we're looking at.

203
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:04,731
So initially, our brains will always pick up shape.

204
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:12,716
So silhouettes, large, broad shape, really help make a faster imprint

205
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:13,236
on a memory.

206
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:19,476
The second thing is color, which is connected to emotion and maybe brand association.

207
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:21,538
And the third thing is the form.

208
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,862
It takes longer for our brains to process language and content, third.

209
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:31,325
So we need to understand that this is the sequence of how our brains kind of figure

210
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,546
out what we're looking at.

211
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:36,388
So this kind of theory should help us design better.

212
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,313
Speaking of theory, Gestalt theory is actually...

213
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:48,549
extremely important when it comes to UI design and in design in general there's a set of

214
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:53,633
rules that we can follow to understand, to make sense of like what we want to design.

215
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:59,817
So these principles are based on like cognitive research and how we perceive the world through

216
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:00,298
our senses.

217
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:07,563
So closure, we have the circle but it's not actually a circle, it's just a dotted line

218
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:11,706
but our brains kind of perceive that as a circle because it makes

219
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,176
It likes to close gaps.

220
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,578
Proximity, these things are close together, so our brains

221
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:20,519
are picking up that this is kind of a group, maybe.

222
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,181
Continuity, you can see the line, even though it's broken

223
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:27,742
by this horizontal line, it still feels like it flows all

224
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,222
the way around.

225
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:32,923
Similarities have the gray colored circles and squares.

226
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,844
They kind of feel like they're a group.

227
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,865
And then you have the invert, the hollow versions.

228
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:41,906
Figure ground, there's even though this image is 2D,

229
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,247
it kind of feels 3D, but you don't get a sense

230
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,728
of what's in the foreground, what's in the background.

231
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:47,989
That's what figure ground is all about.

232
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,610
Enclosure, basically taking proximity

233
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,131
and just having this great box behind it,

234
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,313
you're kind of grouping those elements together using that.

235
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,193
And then there's symmetry.

236
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,495
So let's look at a game example

237
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,496
and see how this theory actually functions.

238
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,961
So this is a screenshot from Battlefield 1, the spectator mode.

239
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:20,008
And you can see that the space in between is kind of forming a closed gap by the cinematic

240
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,208
bars at the top and bottom.

241
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,033
Proximity of these elements next to each other form like the squad lists and the icons in

242
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,695
the center for the score mode.

243
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:32,957
Then we have continuity.

244
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:33,978
So this line, even though

245
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,737
It's kind of broken. It feels like a continuous line going all the way across.

246
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,020
Similarly, in terms of the highlighted box with the inverted text,

247
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,462
so you have a white background with black text instead of a black background with white text.

248
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:52,064
Figure ground, all of these elements kind of occupy the same space.

249
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:58,567
There's no like zed sorting, but we know that we need to give a certain location for these

250
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:01,128
so that people can understand where this information is layered.

251
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:07,116
Enclosure, we're basically using boxes and kind of keeping things grouped together.

252
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:14,219
And then we have the symmetry, basically reflecting the squad lists on the left and right.

253
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,761
There's also some usability principles which we need to look at.

254
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:25,483
So whenever you're designing any kind of screen, you don't want to have more than seven items

255
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:29,965
that are unique on one screen because it will just get overloading for the user.

256
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,172
You don't want your menus to be more than three levels deep.

257
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,456
Affordances are things like buttons, sliders, checkboxes.

258
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:42,259
You want those to look and function like how people expect.

259
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,843
Focus area, you always want to have a focus area in your UI

260
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,884
so that people know what they're actually looking at.

261
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,806
If you just had the screen and nothing was highlighted,

262
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:53,787
people get confused.

263
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,188
It's like, am I supposed to do something here?

264
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,108
Did it go wrong?

265
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,370
So you always want to have a highlight or some kind

266
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,591
of button to show a focus area.

267
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:01,884
You want to make your state changes clear,

268
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,945
so when you click on something, it

269
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,125
looks different from when it's unhighlighted or unclicked.

270
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,466
You also want to have a page flow, so that your information

271
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,687
has a hierarchy going from top left to bottom right.

272
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,108
And you always want to provide helps and hints.

273
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:19,789
So let's look at this in an example here.

274
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,229
So this is from MGS with customization.

275
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,530
So you can see there's seven elements on screen here.

276
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,291
And we don't want to add any more,

277
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,811
because it'll just get confusing for the player.

278
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,762
The menus are like three levels deep, so you only have to click three times to get there.

279
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:35,805
Buttons look like buttons, they function.

280
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:41,490
You have a focus area here. This isn't a video, but this would be pulsing.

281
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,174
State changes are obvious, so what's selected, what isn't.

282
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:49,718
You have a nice page flow as well, so you can understand how that information is laid out.

283
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,221
We're also providing helps and hints.

284
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:59,751
So here's some cheat sheets for you guys to look at.

285
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,172
I'm just going to take a drink of water.

286
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:14,783
You can print this out, put it on your bathroom door, just

287
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:15,804
remind yourself of these things.

288
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:22,749
So essentially, we want to design for effective

289
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:23,190
perception.

290
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:28,263
But we also want to look at visual harmony and make sure that elements kind of work together.

291
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,344
We don't want things like fighting for attention, because that's where it gets confusing.

292
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,645
It's like, am I supposed to click this or am I supposed to look here?

293
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:40,727
So let's go into data gathering and research.

294
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:45,929
So this is kind of like doing your homework and doing your research.

295
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,692
You basically want to understand your game, your creative direction, the art direction, your target market.

296
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,198
You want to collaborate with all the disciplines,

297
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,859
make sure that you speak to art, code, design,

298
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,441
make sure that everyone's on board and aligned

299
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,022
when it comes to the vision of the game.

300
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,844
You always want to ask questions.

301
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:05,345
You know, what's best for the user?

302
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:08,607
You know, you're making a game, but you're also making it

303
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,228
as if you are the player.

304
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,389
So you want to always question, like, what are you doing?

305
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,590
Is this the best way to do it?

306
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:16,752
You also want to understand the visual orientation

307
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,252
of your game.

308
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:18,433
You know, what's the themes?

309
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:19,073
What's the tone?

310
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,090
What's the style going to be?

311
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,490
What era are we setting this in?

312
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,091
Because all of these things will play into your UI design.

313
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,412
And we also want to think about usability,

314
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,773
like we did with the theory, the guest out theory,

315
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,734
and the usability, and try and bring that into our design.

316
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:37,815
You also want to go treasure hunting and basically find

317
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:42,097
as many good references from movies, games, TV, mobile,

318
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:45,118
rubbish on the floor, anything.

319
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:51,948
Just get all of that reference and gather it together because the more reference that you have the better it will be informing your decisions

320
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,750
So yeah, just make a folder

321
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,411
Right-click new folder done

322
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:05,175
You want to be aware of design trends

323
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,656
Because there's a lot of

324
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:14,400
Designs that come and go and you don't want your designs to fall into that trap of being like oh that was so ps2 era

325
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:22,069
You want your designs to outlast the console generation or, you know, the hip new design for that year.

326
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,213
You always want to challenge the status quo, but you also want to keep the brand in mind and think of the bigger picture.

327
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:32,596
Even within franchises, you want to make sure that each game looks and feels unique.

328
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,759
So this is kind of like the crux, getting into the process.

329
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,542
This is like designing the core components of your visual identity for your game.

330
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,116
So we've got a lot of things to get through here,

331
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:50,118
but the grid is the first one we're going to start off with.

332
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,142
So grids can help you establish hierarchy, navigation, flow,

333
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:56,962
consistency.

334
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,524
It'll ease users' memory load.

335
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:01,785
It'll provide shortcuts so people

336
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:03,526
know where things are when they go back and forth

337
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:04,187
between pages.

338
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,029
And you can apply this to the front end and also the HUD.

339
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,510
The example here is a 20 by 13 grid,

340
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,091
but you can make any grid that you like.

341
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,992
Just make sure that you stick with it.

342
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,959
This is also a golden ratio grid,

343
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,521
so all of you guys have mobile phones,

344
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,842
and you can get those third grids.

345
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,584
And it kind of enhances your design.

346
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,765
So if you kind of place things at the intersections

347
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,787
of all of these lines, it'll give

348
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,188
for a nice, pleasing layout.

349
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,471
You also want to keep in mind aspect ratio.

350
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:38,513
So right now, we designed for 69 screens, which

351
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,435
is kind of like the standard across the board.

352
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:44,017
But then you also want to make sure that it works on 4.3.

353
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:44,157
So.

354
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,549
If people don't have the latest technology,

355
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:50,590
or they don't have screens that we're kind of used to,

356
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,211
you still need to make sure that they can play the game

357
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,431
without things overlapping.

358
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,772
You want it to reformat nicely.

359
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:00,053
You don't want things to get scaled in the wrong way.

360
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:03,014
But also on a cater for the future,

361
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:06,355
where things go a bit crazy, and people have multi-display

362
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:06,816
setups, or 2019.

363
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:09,717
So you want to keep these things in mind

364
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:11,017
as you're designing your UI.

365
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:13,018
And the grids would really help with that.

366
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:17,096
So when it comes to grids, you want

367
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:18,696
to keep everything within a safe frame.

368
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:20,617
So that's roughly 90% of your screen.

369
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,398
And that's things like text, icons,

370
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,419
things that are really important for your UI.

371
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,121
It doesn't matter if a flourish or some kind of bounding box

372
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:34,322
just kind of bleeds out.

373
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,083
But it's the most important information,

374
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,103
like text and icons.

375
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:42,285
You also don't need to fill up every single piece

376
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:43,885
of the screen with information.

377
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:48,667
So leave some negative space for the information to kind of breathe, let the content breathe.

378
00:23:50,789 --> 00:24:06,158
You also want to think about alignment. So, you know, you can see that the left hand side has is a bit janky, but even if you have everything left aligned, make sure that you know you have consistent spacing between things you want to anchor elements as much as possible.

379
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,141
Speaking of anchoring, so this is a screenshot from BF1.

380
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,420
We have, if you imagine that the screen is divided into these nine quadrants.

381
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:19,901
And those quadrants have an anchor point.

382
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:24,483
The anchor points basically are there to help you lay out your information.

383
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:28,245
Because when it comes to the UI, there's a lot of information that can easily overlap.

384
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:33,567
And you want to make sure that there's clear and concise area and location for things to kind of sit.

385
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:39,829
So at the top here in the middle, those elements are actually anchored to the top center.

386
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,231
This one's to the top right.

387
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,272
These two are anchored to the bottom left.

388
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:49,694
These are anchored center.

389
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:53,015
And these are lower right.

390
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,977
And this also ensures that when you reformat your screen for 4.3

391
00:24:58,057 --> 00:25:03,380
or 21.9, that this information will actually move out

392
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,841
and still be consistent throughout your designs.

393
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:09,422
Typography.

394
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:11,683
So I've got another video here for you guys to watch.

395
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,003
And.

396
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,542
explains why typography is so important.

397
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,743
Let's take a look.

398
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,468
Awesome.

399
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:25,810
So you can see why choosing the right font is important.

400
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,752
I don't want Ryan Gosling after me, so yeah.

401
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:31,374
So when it comes to choosing fonts,

402
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,315
we need to look at the bigger picture.

403
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:37,578
You know, the legibility, the readability, the branding,

404
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:38,538
the style, the tone.

405
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:46,517
We're going to talk about font variations later on, but we also want to look at trends and localization and pricing budgets.

406
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,038
So fonts can be expensive.

407
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:58,360
So this is Crisis, well, a mock-up of Crisis, and it looks really different because the font was actually something that we experimented with.

408
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:03,802
And we had to kind of go back to Agency FB, which is the font that we used.

409
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:05,842
It just didn't feel like Crisis.

410
00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:09,476
So I know these screenshots don't look exactly the same,

411
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,778
but the font is the biggest thing I want to look at here.

412
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,602
There's also the six foot rule.

413
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,725
Does anyone know what that is or what it could be?

414
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:23,747
Any guesses?

415
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:24,047
No?

416
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,049
OK, so it's basically.

417
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,171
Yeah, yeah, it's basically.

418
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,357
on average when a console player plays their games on their big screen TV,

419
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,379
they're going to be six feet away and the font needs to be legible from that distance.

420
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,381
Obviously that's down to font size as well, but you still need to

421
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:45,442
choose a font that's clear and concise.

422
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,224
So fonts are

423
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,666
there's a lot of information which goes into designing a font, but

424
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,507
the main thing that we're concerned with is the X height.

425
00:26:58,388 --> 00:27:00,428
And that's this area here.

426
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:10,218
It's actually the height of an X and also the counter, which is kind of like the opening within letters like O, P, B.

427
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:21,185
You can see in this example here that when we look at the B and the E, there's a difference between the Freestyle script and the Open Sans font.

428
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:28,250
And at smaller sizes, it gets harder to read, so you want to make sure that fonts with a bigger counter

429
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,489
are basically a lot easier to read at a distance.

430
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,850
You also want to look at extended character sets.

431
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,552
So don't just go on the internet and download a free font.

432
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,873
That's not going to work for AAA games.

433
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,814
So you need to make sure that your characters support

434
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:47,995
all the foreign characters.

435
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,476
They have the numeric ranges, the diacritical marks,

436
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,537
which are like the small accents on top of the letters.

437
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,518
And they also support the glyphs and special characters.

438
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:03,686
Generally you want to try and buy the entire font family because it will come in really handy later on for you.

439
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:09,969
You know there's so many different weights that you can choose from, condensed and extended versions.

440
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,512
And you know generally professional fonts have all of this.

441
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:19,975
When it comes to your body text you want to make sure that when you're using lighter fonts,

442
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:25,018
at larger sizes you want to use lighter fonts and at smaller sizes you want to use heavier fonts.

443
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:28,813
Just so that they work on your screen space.

444
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,414
You want to make sure that things don't get too thin, because then

445
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:37,255
they become really badly aliased. So you want to make sure that you use

446
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:41,416
a heavier font at a smaller size. These are font

447
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:46,797
variations, and you generally don't want to use more than two font variations.

448
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,498
Don't do the one at the bottom, please.

449
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:53,438
If you're just

450
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:53,978
completely...

451
00:28:55,072 --> 00:29:00,715
you know, like, noob to this and you don't know which fonts to choose, this is a good list to start with.

452
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:05,378
So these are professional fonts that you can get from, like, the major sites.

453
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:10,061
And they generally cover, like, all the extended character sets.

454
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:14,404
They have, like, all the font weights. So, you know, these are good ones to go with.

455
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,146
They're not perfect, but they're a good starting point.

456
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:24,191
Also, please don't stretch fonts.

457
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,368
Stretching fonts is like stretching your face.

458
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:29,789
You won't like it.

459
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:31,309
It looks weird.

460
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,110
If you do want to stretch it, just scale it proportionally.

461
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,970
Or use the condensed or the extended versions.

462
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,611
It's a lot more professional.

463
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,471
When it comes to text as well, you want to make sure that

464
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:48,132
your text sizes, you have enough characters to display

465
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:50,093
in the text without it going off screen.

466
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:52,593
So generally, you want to word wrap to like 60 to 120

467
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,393
characters per line.

468
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:00,013
It's easier to just left align and then you know that's easy for reading as well.

469
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:07,058
Localizations you also want to add like 20% more, sorry 40% more text.

470
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:14,324
Text size for overflow and you also want to be conscious of like right to left for my ink for Arabic and Hebrew.

471
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:22,190
So this is an example of BF1 operations in English and we have.

472
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,732
A crazy thing that just puts.

473
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:28,167
the largest strings it can find on one screen.

474
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:32,308
And that's a good way to test, does your game actually work

475
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,128
with localizations?

476
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,229
So we can see how big text boxes are going to get, how

477
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,170
big buttons are going to get.

478
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,130
And you can see the box on the right, we actually have to

479
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,931
shift that up because the buttons at the bottom were

480
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:45,192
just too long.

481
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:47,452
So I'm just going to flick between them,

482
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,173
just so you can see.

483
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,673
It's a big difference.

484
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:53,394
So you need to cater for those edge cases.

485
00:30:55,998 --> 00:30:57,018
Does anyone know what this is?

486
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:00,979
Yeah, sorry.

487
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,160
It's the longest string that you can get for a game attack,

488
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,201
so whoever has this game attack just don't use it.

489
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,261
It's just really bad, especially for UI designers,

490
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,421
because we have to cater for this.

491
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:19,062
But sometimes you have to add on things like the clan tag

492
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:22,123
and the rank, and you have to display this whole string.

493
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:27,222
in your UI. So you have to make sure that, you know, if you have a sentence with, like,

494
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:32,163
someone's name in the middle, you have to make sure that this can fit. So, you know,

495
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:37,124
this is kind of like the worst case scenario. And we always design for gamer tags this long.

496
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:43,265
There's also other variations of this with WM, WM, WM. But, yeah, whoever has those gamer

497
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:50,966
tags, just get out. Get out. So we're going to play a game. And it's called

498
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:51,627
What The Fun.

499
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:55,839
So you guys are going to try and guess what these fonts are.

500
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,099
Here's the first one.

501
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,781
Yeah, that's pretty easy.

502
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:01,481
Impact.

503
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:03,602
This one.

504
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:05,002
Yep.

505
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:06,063
Well done.

506
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:10,164
Oh, nice.

507
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:16,087
Anyone know this one?

508
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:19,268
No.

509
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:22,169
Any other guesses?

510
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:24,126
Sorry?

511
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:26,508
Microgrammar, yes.

512
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:27,329
Nice.

513
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,090
A lot of movies use this.

514
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,075
Comic Sans.

515
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:38,958
So now we're going to talk about shape language.

516
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,301
And this is kind of drilling into the details of what

517
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:44,142
your art is going to look like.

518
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,085
This is kind of like the elements

519
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:49,367
that create visual harmony and interest in your design.

520
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:51,248
So the fonts are one important thing,

521
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,349
but this is like the next.

522
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,094
next thing you need to look out for.

523
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:57,956
This is kind of like tying into the grander visual identity

524
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:58,436
of your game.

525
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,957
We're moving from low fidelity blockouts

526
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:03,699
to high fidelity assets here.

527
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:06,200
The shape language will inform your style guides as well.

528
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,342
And it'll support your cognitive aspects of your design.

529
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:14,325
So essentially, these are kind of like the building blocks.

530
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:17,786
We want to basically run with a shape language that's

531
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:18,367
consistent.

532
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:22,549
We also want to provide framing and backdrop for our UI.

533
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,055
It helps to establish like the look and feel.

534
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:28,696
These are kind of like the signature elements as well.

535
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:32,537
Things like patterns, brushes, lens flares, sorry.

536
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,478
We also want to look at shape consistency.

537
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,399
So if you have a stroke, you want to make sure

538
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,599
that those strokes are consistent.

539
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,340
You know, if you started with the top style

540
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,060
and then you ended up with the bottom style,

541
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,741
that's actually still going to look weird in a UI.

542
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,622
It won't look consistent.

543
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:54,265
similar thing with like angles and rounded corners.

544
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:57,106
You want to keep those things kind of consistent as well.

545
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,608
So we're going to take a look at some examples.

546
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:01,808
So this is from MGS.

547
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:05,310
When you customize, so you can see that the elements kind of

548
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,690
feel like they belong together.

549
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,272
There's no kind of like odd shapes.

550
00:34:09,692 --> 00:34:11,233
Everything's kind of nice and rectangular.

551
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:12,633
It kind of fits that military theme.

552
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:15,655
This is kind of like the.

553
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,350
A bunch of screen grabs from different areas of the game.

554
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,892
They still use the same kind of squared out shape language.

555
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:24,694
The color schemes are still there.

556
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,498
This is from Crisis 3, where we have the angle boxes.

557
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:36,921
And then we have some screenshots

558
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,542
from various locations.

559
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:41,183
You can see that the themes kind of still run

560
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:41,964
through the whole game.

561
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:44,765
So it doesn't matter what the screen is, it should still

562
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:46,607
feel like it's part of that same product.

563
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:50,883
And these are things that kind of tie into your shape language, you know, do you want

564
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:55,844
angular corners, do you want it to be like brushed, do you want it to be, you know, a

565
00:34:55,884 --> 00:35:00,325
lens flare, like just full out lens flares and go for it, but keep it consistent.

566
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,746
Next we're going to talk about iconography.

567
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:10,468
So there's a couple of things with icons, some kind of ground rules.

568
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:13,869
So you want to make sure that they work on the minimum screen size.

569
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,310
You want to keep them simple but varied.

570
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:22,490
You also want to try them with the squint test, which is kind of like just squinting your eyes and just seeing if you can make out the shapes.

571
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:29,154
That's what makes good icons, basically something that you can tell from afar, things that are easy to see and read.

572
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:34,718
And a 1 inch by 1 inch is kind of like the largest size that you could probably have an icon on screen.

573
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:41,702
You don't want to just have a massive icon and then, you know, that's everything. You want it to work on multiple sizes.

574
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,224
So to get...

575
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:48,113
good icon designs, you want to have a construction grid.

576
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,755
Kind of like the grids that we're using for the UI,

577
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,456
but we also want to do this for icons.

578
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:55,098
This will help ensure that things are consistent.

579
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,860
It'll make sure that you stick with this kind of grid format,

580
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,121
so as you design your elements,

581
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,443
you know, they'll feel nice and cohesive.

582
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,606
You also want to kind of create icon specs,

583
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:11,648
so that, you know, people that actually create icons for you

584
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,030
would understand that, you know, things like rounded...

585
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:17,864
the rounded corners, the smallest point size,

586
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:19,965
what gaps should look like.

587
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,066
All of those things are kind of detailed,

588
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,768
even down to the angles of what lines are gonna be at.

589
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,169
These things are really important

590
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:30,271
when keeping a consistent framework for your icon design.

591
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:34,533
There's also something called optical balance,

592
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,615
which in this example, the square, the triangle, and circle,

593
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,437
you can see that the triangle and the circle

594
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,638
kind of overextend slightly.

595
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:48,749
And this is actually really important for icon design because even though they're not

596
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:53,330
mathematically correct, this will actually make your icons feel a lot more consistent

597
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,270
in terms of size.

598
00:36:54,350 --> 00:37:01,973
So in this example, you've got like a nice square icon, a thin triangle, a circle, and

599
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:06,554
you can see that the outer lines, they don't actually extend all the way out.

600
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,301
You have like a gap when it comes to the squared icons,

601
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,442
and this is basically just down to optical balance

602
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:13,643
so that things feel consistent in size,

603
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:15,363
even though they're not mathematically correct.

604
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:18,044
And you need to do this throughout your UI design

605
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:20,645
so it'll keep things really nice and pleasing.

606
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,586
This is like designing for visual harmony.

607
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,087
There's also things like testing your icons

608
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:30,508
in different line weights, testing them,

609
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,789
whether they're filled or inverted,

610
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,830
because that can have an impact on how fast you

611
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,670
can read these icons.

612
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:35,870
So.

613
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:40,020
Even though they're really minor, it's like during gameplay,

614
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,463
if you have an icon that you can't really tell what it is, like instantly,

615
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:48,286
then you're going to have a problem with like maybe a player missing out on something major.

616
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:52,149
So you want to make sure you test like this in game,

617
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,952
make sure you're like trying out different variations and see what works and what doesn't work.

618
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,656
Icons can also be like ambiguous,

619
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,379
so sometimes they might need text to support what they mean.

620
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:09,175
So you probably, unless you play Battlefield a lot,

621
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:10,856
you probably don't know what these icons mean.

622
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,978
And there you go.

623
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,503
These are body action icons from MGS, MGO, sorry.

624
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:23,686
So some of them might be a bit ambiguous,

625
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:25,347
but when they have the descriptions next to them,

626
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:26,908
then you understand what they do.

627
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,792
The treatment also kind of folds into your visual identity.

628
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,013
You want to make sure that all of your icons

629
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,955
have like a consistent style.

630
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:41,315
Going through and this relates to your shape language and it also ties into your your broader

631
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:43,355
visual identity for your game

632
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:48,677
So this is kind of like boiling down your art direction into one single icon

633
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:54,119
This is how important icons are for your game, and they can also replace text so

634
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:57,360
With an icon you can basically save a lot more space

635
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,600
We've got a game another game

636
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,841
So it's called universal icon

637
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,662
So what do you think this icon means?

638
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:10,739
Capture point.

639
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:12,921
Anything else?

640
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:19,886
It can mean more than one thing.

641
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,589
So that's the thing with icons, they're a bit ambiguous.

642
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:24,449
This one?

643
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:34,496
There are connections terminals.

644
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:37,258
This one's pretty easy.

645
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:42,528
All of those things.

646
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:45,349
This one.

647
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:52,314
Appearance, settings, customization.

648
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:00,358
Yeah.

649
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,401
And that's the last one. So moving on to colors.

650
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,764
So color plays a lot on your emotions and the branding.

651
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:10,705
But.

652
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:15,503
I generally want to try and say don't rely on color.

653
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:20,705
Even though it's important to your brand, you'll see later on that colors can be perceived

654
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:21,325
in different ways.

655
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:25,787
But, you know, you still want to tie it into your direction, you still want to tie it into

656
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:28,948
the themes and tones of your game, you want it to show states.

657
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:35,110
So everyone kind of knows color theory, or if you don't, you can look it up, it's fairly

658
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,330
easy.

659
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:57,499
Each color kind of has a meaning in different cultures as well, so just be wary that you might not be wanting to use colors that might be offensive or maybe seen as like derogatory or something like that. So just look up your color schemes before you actually because your game is going to be AAA, so it's going to be worldwide and global. So yeah, just be wary of what colors mean in different cultures.

660
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:06,443
Generally, you want to try and limit your color palettes as well. You want to have like 5 colors and you want these to be varied and distinct, but you also want to make sure that.

661
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:09,134
you know, each one has a purpose.

662
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,597
You know, avoid like completely full saturated colors

663
00:41:12,677 --> 00:41:13,657
because that tends to bleed.

664
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,100
Just experiment and just make sure that, you know,

665
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,781
you use colors kind of sparingly.

666
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:21,903
So this is an example from Crysis again,

667
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:25,185
where we're using colors to kind of represent

668
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:28,628
the button states and it kind of matched the military theme.

669
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:30,549
You can see that the colors are actually quite subdued.

670
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,551
We're not relying on colors 100% here,

671
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:35,012
but even though it's.

672
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,616
It's basically enhancing the visuals.

673
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:43,260
Here's a good test for everyone.

674
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,981
The image on the right, just hold your finger up

675
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:47,942
and just cover over the line and just

676
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:50,564
see if something special happens.

677
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:59,048
So you can see that the environment actually

678
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,269
has a big impact on.

679
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:19,375
The shade of the color so you need to be wary of where you're being where you're using your colors. So when it comes to the HUD, it's going to be against all this kind of like environment are and going to make sure that you are still stands out. But then your colors can be perceived differently based on the environment. So you know what you originally designed for might not work well.

680
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:30,442
So ideally you might want to have a color luminance range for your UI that's not being used in the environment and that way you make sure that you are always readable.

681
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:32,902
Here's an example from Uncharted 4.

682
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:37,385
You can see the color breakdown on the right hand side.

683
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,146
So they're using color kind of pretty sparingly.

684
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:44,268
They use it for the teams and for certain events,

685
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:47,209
but then you have a nice limited color palette.

686
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,891
Here's a shot from Far Cry 4.

687
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:51,972
Similar kind of thing.

688
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,094
And a shot from Final Fantasy 15.

689
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:06,048
You can see here they've actually used red in the centre, which is actually really important when it comes to critical information.

690
00:43:06,548 --> 00:43:12,732
And at this point you need to press red, or press square, and it's showing a little bit of red glow around the outside.

691
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:17,215
Colour blindness is another reason why you don't want to rely on colour.

692
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:26,921
People have a lot of impairments, so 15% of the entire population of the world,

693
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,123
like the World Health Organization, say that.

694
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:34,346
people have disabilities when it comes to visual impairments,

695
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:38,388
sound, motor or cognitive impairments,

696
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:42,510
and this kind of affects 5-10% of our players, so we need to keep

697
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,572
them in mind when we're designing our colours, or choosing our colours. And these are different types of

698
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,094
colour blindness, green, red and blue.

699
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:54,597
And some games actually cater for that, so

700
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:58,459
a lot of AAA games do cater for colour blindness, but you just need to be wary that

701
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,280
you don't want to be giving like...

702
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:05,231
a preset color scheme that people actually don't find that good.

703
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:09,734
So maybe, you know, allow the users to customize the colors based on

704
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,537
the UI and what they feel comfortable with.

705
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:16,700
Next we're going to talk about UI representation.

706
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:22,705
So this kind of like is more focused on the HUD side of things.

707
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:27,228
So you have non-diegetic and diegetic, spatial and meta.

708
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:28,770
We're going to go through each one of these.

709
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:34,697
But diegetic in general is basically taken from movie and films where you have a character that kind of narrates over

710
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,239
what's happening in the story, so it's something that's actually part of the narrative.

711
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,401
And generally

712
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:49,444
non-diegetic UI is what you see in most games. It's kind of detached from the gameplay.

713
00:44:50,205 --> 00:44:54,107
The characters don't actually interact with the UI in any way. It's just like an overlay.

714
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:09,051
Diegetic UI on the other hand is something that's part of the gameplay and games like Division, Dead Space, they have the characters actually interacting with the UI itself and it's also something for players to take in as well.

715
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,272
I love Diegetic UI.

716
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:23,795
Spatial UI is things that aren't typically associated to like bars and health and text. These are more kind of effects and trails, character actions.

717
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,573
like in Last of Us and Uncharted 4, they have like the character outlines.

718
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,757
And then the meta ones are kind of like, they're not really

719
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:37,360
spatially telling you anything, it's just a screen effect

720
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,603
that kind of desaturates your UI or your gameplay

721
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:43,144
or it's kind of blood splatter.

722
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:49,129
I want to get a bit controversial here.

723
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,273
So there's some standard UI elements that a lot of games use

724
00:45:54,994 --> 00:45:55,094
and...

725
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:59,233
just because everyone's doing them doesn't mean that that's actually a good thing.

726
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:05,377
Example here is the damage indicator which you see a lot of games.

727
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:08,659
I like to call it the banana because it looks like one.

728
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:13,962
But I don't think this is actually a good UI element.

729
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:19,945
I think it's trying to convey a 3D event in a 2D asset.

730
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:23,527
And when I'm playing like first person shooters or...

731
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:27,349
third person action games, you know, this thing is 2D.

732
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,131
You can't tell if there's someone below or above you.

733
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:34,653
This thing will just tell you like direction based in 2D,

734
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:37,194
but it's not really telling you if they're above or below

735
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,274
or behind or in front.

736
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:41,355
So it's not really working in the 3D sense.

737
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:45,157
Come at me, bro.

738
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,259
I think a better way is to actually have something

739
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,579
which is a bit more diegetic.

740
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:54,066
It's something that's in the game world. It's 3D.

741
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:58,067
You can tell that there's attacks coming in or threats coming in from different directions.

742
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:03,168
So, you know, it's a lot more visually, you can understand spatially where things are.

743
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:08,290
If you're having a 2D element and it's trying to show you something in 3D, it just doesn't kind of work.

744
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:14,371
So I think trying to think of other ways to represent that information rather than just sticking with the standards that everyone's going with,

745
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:15,912
I think is a better way to go.

746
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:17,312
This example from MGS4.

747
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:23,814
2D artwork, so this kind of falls into its own category.

748
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,515
Even though it's still part of UI,

749
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:29,158
it's something which is, you know,

750
00:47:29,738 --> 00:47:32,540
it's like the artwork that goes with all of your UI,

751
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,721
like dog tags, medals, imagery.

752
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,163
These are things that we still need to think about as well

753
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:38,584
when it comes to our visual identity

754
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,405
and how we style these things,

755
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:42,146
how we want to present them to the player.

756
00:47:43,747 --> 00:47:45,769
Things like screenshots as well and loading images.

757
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,931
Engine knowledge, so understanding

758
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:53,043
our limits, so we want to understand the limits of your engine.

759
00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:56,705
You need to basically figure out what kind of tech you need,

760
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,307
you want to exploit the system, make sure it's performant,

761
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:03,389
you want to document these things and make sure you test them out regularly.

762
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,212
So one good thing about engines is that we can use shaders

763
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:10,133
to kind of do half the work for us.

764
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:14,416
So example here is where we have a base artwork which is kind of flat.

765
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:17,142
But then you add drop shadows, blur effect,

766
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:19,864
chromatic aberration, and it kind of looks a bit more dynamic.

767
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:23,266
It's a lot more pleasing to the eye compared to the one on the left.

768
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:27,549
Here's another example with some kind of distortion effects.

769
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:34,513
And in Crysis, we kind of did a similar thing where we had the UI have this kind of like scan line kind of glow effect.

770
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:38,476
So it looked like a projection. And this was kind of how we set it up.

771
00:48:38,576 --> 00:48:43,579
So we basically had our UI elements kind of mapped to polys.

772
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:46,307
And then we applied the shader effect to those polys.

773
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:48,909
And this is kind of like the layout.

774
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,874
You can also use the engine to kind of do more 3D things.

775
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:58,798
So things like scenes, composite your UI

776
00:48:58,878 --> 00:48:59,778
along with your environment.

777
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,462
And there's a lot of fun in experimenting with this.

778
00:49:04,522 --> 00:49:07,905
And it kind of connects the UI a bit bad to your gameplay.

779
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,486
So you want to try and think of ways

780
00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:10,687
that you can do that more often.

781
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,429
You don't just want the UI to kind of be

782
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,330
disconnected from the game.

783
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:18,008
Right, it's hammer time. So now it's time to like execute and things.

784
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:41,178
So generally, these are the my go to applications when it comes to marking up things. So Photoshop Illustrator after effects. I'm a big fan of Illustrator. It's just a lot easier when you're working with vectors to kind of scale up rasters kind of have their limitations. So you know roster graphics. You can't really scale them well, but when it comes to vector, it can kind of translate to polygons as well if you need to.

785
00:49:43,432 --> 00:49:48,537
I always start with an artboard and Illustrator is awesome because you can just have as many artboards as you like.

786
00:49:49,057 --> 00:49:52,900
And I generally just start with like a 1080p screen and just like go from there.

787
00:49:55,482 --> 00:50:01,327
So there's different types of mockups that you can create. Static mockups which are kind of like your base UI.

788
00:50:02,728 --> 00:50:06,331
You want to basically try and like figure out the core components of your UI.

789
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:09,714
So when it comes to buttons, drop downs, sliders, progress bars.

790
00:50:10,114 --> 00:50:12,096
This is where you want to try and experiment as much as you can.

791
00:50:12,964 --> 00:50:18,770
You know, figure out your tone, your theme, and just work with the art and just see what works and play around with Illustrator.

792
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,013
You have like, you know, infinite artboard space so you can just go crazy.

793
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:30,241
You also want to figure out what kind of button states you have. So things like highlighted, unhighlighted.

794
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:35,306
And this will really help, like, this is kind of like the core components of your visual identity.

795
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,148
Figuring out what you want to do with the UI.

796
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:39,565
Same thing for your icons.

797
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,146
You want to make sure that you're actually

798
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,668
getting through, getting across those states,

799
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:45,610
making sure that people understand what's going on,

800
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:48,953
keeping those consistent with your button selections.

801
00:50:50,854 --> 00:50:52,856
And then going back to our cheat sheets,

802
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,277
we basically want to keep this in mind

803
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,998
as well as we're designing our components.

804
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,082
We can start blocking out our UI,

805
00:51:00,202 --> 00:51:03,705
making sure that how we want to present this information,

806
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:04,445
this is kind of like.

807
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:10,416
The user journey, the flow, it kind of comes into UX, but it's also part of UI art as well.

808
00:51:10,496 --> 00:51:16,780
So you want to just lay things out, making sure that, you know, with your style you have clear focus areas,

809
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,702
you have like information kind of blocked out in different locations.

810
00:51:20,522 --> 00:51:22,764
And you can try out as many different styles as you like.

811
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,008
And the same for the HUD, you can basically block out the HUD,

812
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:33,490
making sure that you know where your focus area is and moving out to the periphery.

813
00:51:33,962 --> 00:51:35,943
So put your most important information in the center.

814
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:45,169
When I do my mockups, I always pick these key areas of the UI

815
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,590
to kind of approach first.

816
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:50,753
So title page, the front end main menu, the server, lobby,

817
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:53,235
customization, heads up, and the end of round.

818
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,877
And we're going to look at some examples now.

819
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,519
So these are title screens from different games.

820
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:04,078
So this is kind of like the really bare bones basic UI,

821
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:06,739
but you still want it to work when it's simplistic like this.

822
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,823
And you always want to try and simplify the UI as much

823
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:12,323
as possible.

824
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:14,805
There's the front end screenshots.

825
00:52:15,325 --> 00:52:19,708
You can see how each one has its own kind of layout, shape

826
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:21,949
language, fonts, color schemes.

827
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:25,912
Server and lobby screens kind of get a bit busy,

828
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:27,853
but you want to try and still keep that information

829
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:28,914
available to the user.

830
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:33,585
Customization gets a bit crazy as well,

831
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,066
but this is where you can introduce

832
00:52:35,126 --> 00:52:36,227
a lot more diejeck elements.

833
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:39,029
So maybe having the weapons loading up in the background,

834
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:39,890
having callouts.

835
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,873
You can really kind of tie the UI to the gameplay here.

836
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:46,495
Same for loadout selections.

837
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:50,999
And then a screenshot of the HUD.

838
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:55,322
And then an end round.

839
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,301
You always want to design for the worst case scenarios,

840
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:04,342
so make sure that you blast the UI with everything

841
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:04,962
that can go on.

842
00:53:06,163 --> 00:53:08,224
And that will help you figure out where you want to put things.

843
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:13,247
So this is like an early screenshot for the spectator

844
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:14,527
mode in Battlefield 1.

845
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,129
And it's just too much, what's going on.

846
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,191
Motion is another area that you can basically

847
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:25,433
use to really call attention to elements.

848
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:27,954
And just use animate welcome.

849
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:29,535
This kind of ties into your style as well.

850
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:32,236
So we can see in the examples in a minute

851
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:34,637
that the style of motion can actually

852
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:37,858
really have a big impact on what kind of UI you're conveying.

853
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,760
So this is kind of like really simple animation

854
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,080
with a white square, but it shows

855
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,541
that you can have a nice clean animation,

856
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:50,083
or you can have something that's more exaggerated.

857
00:53:53,004 --> 00:53:53,964
Take that, Pixar lamp.

858
00:53:57,908 --> 00:53:59,929
Or you can have something that's a bit more sci-fi and technical.

859
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:04,332
Let's have a look at all three of those together.

860
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:13,116
And then you also want to do the same thing for your icon states

861
00:54:13,436 --> 00:54:14,097
and button states.

862
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:16,178
Show how those things animate.

863
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:20,640
And here's a kind of a complicated example.

864
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,521
It's a good way to also show flow.

865
00:54:23,072 --> 00:54:29,838
Like if you're just sitting and talking about this, it wouldn't have the same impact as showing like an animated mock-up through like After Effects or Flash.

866
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:35,764
So it's kind of like, hey this goes here, that goes there, and it's like no, just show it in an animation, it's easier.

867
00:54:39,727 --> 00:54:43,450
And then here's a kind of a longer mock-up from MGS.

868
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:34,983
OK, that's enough.

869
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:38,024
The last thing is interactive mockups.

870
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:40,805
So this can be something which you can use in-engine,

871
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:43,446
or you can do it through using a couple applications,

872
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:48,168
like Adobe XD or Flash, Animate.

873
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:51,510
But essentially, you want to just keep

874
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,310
iterating on everything.

875
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,571
And even after you ship a game, you're still

876
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:56,392
going to be iterating on it.

877
00:55:57,092 --> 00:56:01,133
And this is my presentation list of this presentation

878
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:01,674
I was working on.

879
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:02,754
So I kept iterating on it.

880
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:06,299
And here's an example from Crisis 3,

881
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,960
where we're looking at the main multiplayer menu

882
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,061
and how it's kind of evolved over time.

883
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:21,946
This was the final version.

884
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,031
One last game.

885
00:56:32,131 --> 00:56:33,711
So this is kind of based on the minimal.

886
00:56:34,593 --> 00:56:37,555
posters that you find. Can you guess what game this is?

887
00:56:41,758 --> 00:56:42,238
Any ideas?

888
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,920
Breath of the Wild

889
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:49,643
This one?

890
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:57,028
This one

891
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,312
I kind of stripped out a lot of information because I wanted to show that

892
00:57:03,986 --> 00:57:05,946
You know, it's actually quite important.

893
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:08,507
You can have a screenshot and see that.

894
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:09,987
Oh yeah, that's that game.

895
00:57:10,987 --> 00:57:11,668
This is MGS.

896
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:16,749
This one's a bit obscure.

897
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,530
Yeah, nice.

898
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,570
This one's really tough.

899
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,151
If you can get this, I'll give you a bottle of water.

900
00:57:27,171 --> 00:57:27,251
Whoa.

901
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:28,291
Whoa.

902
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:28,691
Whoa.

903
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:28,911
Whoa.

904
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:29,151
Whoa.

905
00:57:32,812 --> 00:57:32,952
No.

906
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:34,691
Close.

907
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:37,432
It's half life 2.

908
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:41,654
So this is the last thing that we're

909
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:44,655
going to kind of look at, which is invisible forces, things

910
00:57:44,675 --> 00:57:45,876
that actually affect the UI.

911
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:48,577
And you need to keep these things in mind.

912
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:51,638
So again, localizations, which we talked about before.

913
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,880
So you need to have extra spacing in your text boxes

914
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,742
to make sure that things are catered for multiple languages.

915
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:02,463
Think of colors and meaning, their colors and their meaning.

916
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,532
Any kind of symbols that might be offensive.

917
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:08,513
And try and use icons as a substitute for text.

918
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,035
TRCs, which is Technical Requirements Checklist.

919
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,196
This is kind of based on each platform,

920
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:16,237
and you need to follow these kind of guidelines

921
00:58:16,277 --> 00:58:17,518
when it comes to console development.

922
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:20,179
But you also want to think about screen sizes,

923
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:21,279
your input controls,

924
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,001
think about the visually impaired loading times.

925
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:26,482
All of these things kind of fall under TRCs,

926
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:28,563
even their button hints.

927
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:32,245
Yeah, if only we could do that.

928
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:39,839
And then one last thing like UI can also be non UI.

929
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,960
So things like particle effects, the character animations,

930
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,241
audio cues, haptic feedback, all of these things

931
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:47,542
can actually tie into UI.

932
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:49,542
So it doesn't have to be a number or a text

933
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:50,543
or a bar on screen.

934
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:51,623
It can be something that's conveyed

935
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:52,803
through the characters themselves.

936
00:58:55,924 --> 00:59:00,226
And you don't wanna just make confusing layouts.

937
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:02,387
You wanna stick to your guidelines as much as you can.

938
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:06,124
You don't just want to copy and paste like from other games.

939
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:12,630
That's just really bad and you kind of lose, you lose out on having your own kind of visual identity for your game.

940
00:59:14,912 --> 00:59:16,654
So let's just summarize what we've gone through.

941
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:21,979
So number one, research. You want basically form and function.

942
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:25,142
So you want to go, you know, hand in hand, art and design.

943
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:28,485
Make sure that you have the broad strokes understood.

944
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:36,458
your pillars of your game, the creative direction, the tone, the themes, all of those things you want to make sure that you understand before you do any kind of work.

945
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:41,621
Visual identity, which is kind of like the core components of your UI,

946
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:48,684
you know, your typography, your shapes, your icons, these are kind of like the building blocks. You want to experiment with these as much as you can

947
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,045
and try and figure out something which is unique.

948
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,368
And you don't want to upset Ryan Gosling, remember, so choose a good font.

949
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,559
execution. So this is the

950
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,440
when you're thinking about composition, your heads up display, your front end

951
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,341
you want to try those different mockups, you want to try and create motion

952
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:13,142
interactive mockups so people understand the flow, the use, you know, the way

953
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:17,823
the game will play out. Try and like

954
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:21,063
experiment with that stuff early on, it'll make it a lot more easier before you

955
01:00:21,103 --> 01:00:22,404
actually start working on it in game.

956
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:26,884
And think about the invisible forces, so things like the constraints

957
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:32,143
the technical requirements checklist and localizations.

958
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:37,024
UI is like a ninja.

959
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:40,945
It's unnoticed to the player,

960
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:45,147
but when seen, executes beautifully.

961
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:48,728
Yeah, mic drop.

962
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:52,249
Thank you.
