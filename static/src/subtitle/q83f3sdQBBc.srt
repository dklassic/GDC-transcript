00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:06,524
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,766
Our talk is Lessons Learned from Job to Vacation,

3
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,207
Advanced Interactions for Room-Scale VR.

4
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:17,168
I'm Devin Reimer, CEO at Alchemy Labs.

5
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,350
And I'm Andrew Reich, CTO and Cable Wrangler at Alchemy Labs.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,131
And we are Alchemy Labs.

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,292
We make absurd and highly polished VR games.

8
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,473
We're an Austin, Texas-based developer.

9
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,614
And a few of our games, you may know, are Job Simulator.

10
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:35,880
Rake and Morty Virtual Ricality,

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,462
and the upcoming Vacation Simulator.

12
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,303
And here's a one minute clip from our trailer

13
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,245
to help kind of give you some context

14
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,306
for the rest of this talk.

15
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,811
Our carefully crafted, very identical,

16
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,233
vacation destinations are the ultimate

17
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,434
human leisure experience.

18
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:55,956
Come on, let's start relaxing.

19
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:59,407
Fan castles, sports, seashells!

20
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,768
Wondrous Vacation Beach has it all!

21
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:04,830
Snaps and shots of your evolutionary ancestors

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,451
and cool that overclocked neural processor.

23
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:11,473
Dry off and spin those seashells by the seashore!

24
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:16,395
Marvel at the rustic grandeur and unforgettable Vacation Forest.

25
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:21,077
Become ones and zeros with simulated nature as you get back to your digital roots.

26
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,339
Missing that spark in your surge protector?

27
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,620
There's plenty of fish in our stream!

28
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:31,993
Scale your way up Vacation Mountain for a transformative winter experience.

29
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:35,255
Rotating office temperature, chilling your thermal sensors.

30
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:39,817
Let it go and enjoy all this winter wonderland has to offer.

31
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:42,498
Don't hold yourself back anymore.

32
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:46,300
You'll enjoy all of these beautiful...

33
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,042
So, when it comes to interactions in VR...

34
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,688
Job simulator was kind of the thing

35
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:54,908
that kicked things off for us.

36
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:57,309
We had done some VR before that, but this

37
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,809
was kind of the first point that we ended up

38
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,330
building VR that you interacted with the world with your hands.

39
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,491
So we started work on this with a very early prototype of what

40
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,911
would end up being the Vive.

41
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,072
And one of the first things that we did

42
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:10,512
was we built this demo where there was four boxes,

43
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:13,193
and we put them on the floor, on your virtual floor,

44
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,194
and I found myself just sitting there, just stacking blocks.

45
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:18,274
And at that point, realized that this

46
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,075
was a very interesting and fundamentally fun.

47
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,113
way to interact with this world.

48
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:28,477
So that was kind of the kickoff point for what we wanted to build.

49
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:32,480
So we kind of used this direct interaction into the virtual world as our guide.

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,582
So we knew we wanted these deep world interactions,

51
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,744
we wanted to make games that were approachable by everybody,

52
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:41,166
and then the other thing was to make no one sick.

53
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,194
So in Job Simulator, we kind of established a few early ideas

54
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,716
and kind of basic design principles

55
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,697
that we use to this day.

56
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,119
So for example, taking advantage of your physical space

57
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,043
to physically move around, our physics-based approach

58
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,725
to interacting with objects, tomato presence,

59
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,326
which you see in this video right now,

60
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:05,249
solid object believability, floors,

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,991
which are very important but were

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,893
controversial at the time, and many, many more.

63
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:22,045
We've also done a number of talks about a lot of these basic concepts and you can see that go to our speaking page and see many of those talks but today we're going to get a little bit more in depth.

64
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:35,658
So what we're going to do is we want to dig into 4 specific case studies on things we didn't vacation simulator and more specifically each one of these case studies is going to cover a different set of topics that we've been heavily iterating on since the development of job simulator.

65
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,101
The first one we're going to talk about today is locomotion.

66
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,959
So in Job Simulator, how we locomoted around the world

67
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,960
was our own body moving in the physical real world space.

68
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:52,562
Every single job was designed to be exactly one play area size.

69
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:55,803
And we moved between different jobs or different spaces

70
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,005
by eating this exit burrito fading to black

71
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,825
and loading in an entire new scene.

72
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:07,331
We would use room resizing to properly size the world

73
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,291
to your play space.

74
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:11,433
And so we would remake the layout of each play space

75
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:12,713
for various room sizes.

76
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:15,094
And that included redoing the models,

77
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:16,555
writing custom code for it.

78
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,556
And it would also include per platform.

79
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,177
So PlayStation VR had its own play space.

80
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:22,518
And it worked great.

81
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:23,979
What we really wanted to accomplish there

82
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,260
was that our game was the same experience

83
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,420
no matter what you played it on.

84
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:31,666
So that brings us to the world of Vacation Simulator.

85
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,448
Vacations kind of have this expectation

86
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,169
that they're about exploring and doing

87
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,890
a variety of different activities.

88
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,251
So for example, having an entire beach

89
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,573
and you could only exist in one small zone

90
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,434
would feel very, very problematic.

91
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,036
So we knew we wanted to build a much bigger

92
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:49,557
world for our next game.

93
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,119
And so unlike Job Simulator, this one destination

94
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,761
per zone concept just wouldn't work.

95
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:55,741
We needed more space.

96
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,803
So we knew that we were going to have to move around.

97
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,110
So when it comes to VR locomotion,

98
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,851
we've been pretty outspoken on this topic.

99
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,313
And the main reason is VR motion sickness.

100
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,594
So regardless of what you read on the internet,

101
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,636
significant portion of the population

102
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:14,978
will never overcome simulator sickness

103
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,660
when it comes to vection from artificial locomotion.

104
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,282
Nausea not only reduces the audience of your game.

105
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,786
but can turn people completely off from VR.

106
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,306
There's still so many people that

107
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:28,868
have limited or no new experience into VR yet.

108
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,989
And so we want to make sure the first kind of taste

109
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,650
into that world, they understand that VR is for them.

110
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,270
So our number one rule at Alchemy

111
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,431
is don't make people sick.

112
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,893
So what kind of options does that leave us?

113
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,334
And so the first one is teleportation.

114
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:45,394
And in our opinion, teleportation

115
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,155
has got a bit of a bad rap in VR.

116
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:49,916
We think the main reason for this

117
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:50,737
is that.

118
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:56,367
Up till now, for the most part, simple teleportation methods have been used and also they've been

119
00:05:56,427 --> 00:06:00,450
slapped very commonly into existing content that wasn't designed for it in the first place.

120
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:05,334
And then to compound this, there's so many lessons we haven't yet learned in how to do

121
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:06,555
good teleportation.

122
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:11,561
Right now it feels very much like the early days of third-person cameras in games

123
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,545
and also early development of FPSs on consoles,

124
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,167
things that we take for granted today.

125
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:19,191
But at the time when they were starting to roll out,

126
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,776
some of them were kind of controversial and we weren't quite sure how they'd be solved.

127
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,920
So this was one of these challenges that we wanted to take on at Alchemy.

128
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,633
So when you start talking about teleportation,

129
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:29,854
one of the first things you're gonna look at

130
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,454
is granular teleportation.

131
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:32,635
And it's teleport anywhere.

132
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:36,157
You point a specific spot that you're going to teleport to

133
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,137
in a very precise location, appears,

134
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,339
and you release, and you go there.

135
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,999
It's very easy to drop in,

136
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,641
and many VR frameworks include this by default.

137
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,822
And it works with existing content.

138
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:51,044
But there's a lot of challenges with it.

139
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,365
Specifically, it's very difficult for new users

140
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,685
to select the correct spot.

141
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,532
And it's difficult to understand where your play space bounds

142
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,733
actually are in comparison to where

143
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:00,954
you are moving in the world.

144
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:04,315
So in this image here, you can see that the player is,

145
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:08,177
that mug is beyond the edge of their play space bounds.

146
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,198
But because of the way they've teleported,

147
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:13,680
they can't actually reach that without taking a step back

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,341
and teleporting again.

149
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,242
And that's very unintuitive to do that.

150
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:17,942
Super unintuitive.

151
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,103
Try to explain to a person the object you want to grab,

152
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,464
you actually have to walk in the opposite direction of it

153
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,545
to then get towards it.

154
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,380
And granular teleportation discourages physical movement.

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,740
Once you get the ability to teleport wherever you want,

156
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,580
you stop walking around your play space.

157
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,921
And then standing still is also more physically exhausting

158
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,982
than moving around in your space.

159
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:40,122
And then lastly, we have this concept

160
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:41,582
called teleportation fatigue.

161
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:44,143
And that is when you can see a spot you wanna go to,

162
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:47,083
but you have to do a number of kind of small jumps.

163
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,004
It gets very fatiguing to do that,

164
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,724
and granular teleportation in particular suffers from this.

165
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:57,439
So we're looking for a new way to move across larger distances.

166
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:01,041
And our games are about physical-based interaction,

167
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,602
which makes granular teleportation not a great fit.

168
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,783
So we started looking to see if there was a way

169
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:10,165
where we can merge the benefits of teleportation

170
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:12,546
with kind of our play area style design.

171
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,248
And we landed on zone-based teleportation.

172
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,089
So you look at a zone and hit a button.

173
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,670
And it's really intuitive for our players,

174
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,030
because.

175
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:27,316
They're now not thinking about exactly where they need to go, but more kind of what zone

176
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,417
do they need to go to.

177
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:31,979
It also encourages active movement within the zones.

178
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:37,403
Once you're, since you're only moving between spaces, you're still walking around and engaging

179
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:38,183
with those spaces.

180
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:44,187
And it allows us as developers to design discrete zones instead of trying to design an entire

181
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,288
world, which is great.

182
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,910
So this means Vacation Sim is.

183
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:52,165
Much larger than Job Simulator.

184
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:53,627
Much larger.

185
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,509
So this is just a small chunk of the beach.

186
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,550
And you can see a bunch of different zones.

187
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,972
So each one of those red boxes is kind of a zone

188
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,873
that we have that the players can teleport to,

189
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,915
as compared to the jobs, which were one single zone.

190
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:08,157
So in Job Simulator, we had five total zones.

191
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,559
And in this only the certain part of the beach

192
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,821
here that we're showing, there's seven.

193
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:19,462
So when it comes to zone-based teleportation,

194
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:23,386
there's a lot of wins versus granular teleportation.

195
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,328
So as Andrew mentioned, we find it a lot easier

196
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:28,630
to get people to understand and to use.

197
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,912
There's less teleportation fatigue

198
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,395
of spending a lot of time trying to get to the exact point

199
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:34,175
you're trying to go.

200
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,778
As developers, we also know that that area

201
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,281
is clear of obstruction in the physical world

202
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,042
because we know the bounds of where you are.

203
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,279
And so we know that if you're inside that area,

204
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,341
that every object and every device and every interaction,

205
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,463
the player can actually perform that.

206
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:53,806
And then also this concept of, if you can see an object,

207
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,387
you can reach and grab that object.

208
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,909
Because we have defined bounds of your world,

209
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,170
we can make sure those objects are always within reach.

210
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,682
That said, zone-based teleportation

211
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,862
has a lot of challenges that comes along with it.

212
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:08,563
A really big one is that you need

213
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,023
to design your game with zone-based teleportation

214
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:11,383
in mind.

215
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,644
This is not something you go back and retrofit something

216
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:13,824
with.

217
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,704
You have to think about it right from the start.

218
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:18,845
So to kind of go through a few of those challenges,

219
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,445
a big one is 180 tracking.

220
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:25,166
And so there is a lot of VR setups

221
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,967
that have a limitation of 180-degree tracking when

222
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:29,987
it comes to your controllers.

223
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,994
Most have 360 head tracking, but when it comes to hands,

224
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,556
you're kind of limited into this space.

225
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:38,139
So you have to think about how that's going to impact things.

226
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,202
Traditionally, with something like granular-based

227
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,745
teleportation, the method that's used to solve this

228
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,828
is manual rotations or snap turns.

229
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:51,241
The problem with this is that there constantly needs to be a thread running in the back of your mind as a player

230
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,683
of where is my real world forward

231
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,205
because that's the point, right?

232
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:58,528
I need to make sure that I'm continuously orienting myself versus

233
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:02,212
where I am in the virtual world versus where I am in the real world

234
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,595
and when you have to do that, you're automatically breaking presence

235
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,460
One of the first things we started thinking about

236
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,940
was, OK, let's say there's a zone to your left

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,701
that you want to go to, but some of the primary interactions

238
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,901
are to the back left, for example.

239
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,322
So one thing we thought about was, how about what we do is,

240
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:23,063
when you teleport, we go and rotate the world for you?

241
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:25,663
So it's like a snap turn, but we're in control of that.

242
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:28,084
And we thought this would be a great idea.

243
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,464
It was going to solve so many of our problems.

244
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,564
And we tried so, so hard to make this work.

245
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,605
It turned out, in every one of our tests

246
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,105
and every which way we tried this.

247
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,774
at the end of the day it was disorienting to the player because they weren't 100% sure

248
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:44,097
what direction they were going to be facing at the end of the teleport.

249
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,841
We also discovered that it's very important to be looking in the direction you're going

250
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:53,085
to teleport to try to complete that feeling of understanding where you're going to end

251
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:53,246
up.

252
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:57,790
If you're looking directly where you're going and then you end up just forward, that is

253
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,691
very, very understandable in the human brain.

254
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,575
So when it comes to interactions,

255
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:06,519
this means that they need to be in that forward direction.

256
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,502
So we end up laying out our environment

257
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,105
such that the front of those play spaces

258
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,087
are where you're going to have your primary methods

259
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,009
of interaction.

260
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,832
So like forward and to the left a bit and to the right a bit.

261
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,380
And so all those interactions need

262
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,821
to be within that tracking volume.

263
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,863
That said, let's say something like a 360 setup that

264
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,884
supports 360 controller tracking,

265
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,505
there's still benefits with this design,

266
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,085
because most of those are still tethered.

267
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,707
And one issue when you're doing a lot of teleportation

268
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,467
is getting twisted up in the cable

269
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:37,768
and having to do cable management.

270
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,670
But because of this approach, you end up not rotating

271
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,471
all the way around very often at all,

272
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,193
and so it actually has some benefits there.

273
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,715
And so as I kind of mentioned in us designing the world,

274
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:50,758
it is very, very difficult to design layouts for this,

275
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,260
but at the end of the day, the player doesn't have to think anything about it.

276
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,382
And one thing we talk about at Alchemy all the time

277
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,624
is like the best work we can do is the work that a player never notices.

278
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:02,727
Another challenge is...

279
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,601
where to teleport in terms of directions.

280
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,322
We found that moving in the cardinal directions is best.

281
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,083
So that's forward, back, left, and right.

282
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:13,004
We've also found that certain other angles feel better.

283
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:16,265
So the 45 degrees, your diagonals do.

284
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,546
But it's important to test your content.

285
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,707
It's going to feel different depending on the way

286
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,308
that your content is laid out.

287
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,509
And it's really important to have a clear path

288
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,230
that you're virtually walking that's

289
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,930
straight towards the destination.

290
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,671
Otherwise, the players get disoriented.

291
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:34,937
You're trying to make them feel as if they moved between two spots,

292
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:38,579
and taking a curved path makes that disorienting.

293
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,181
Another challenge we face is,

294
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:44,742
where is the edge of my current zone, right?

295
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,503
How do we logically break up these zones?

296
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:50,366
And in Job Simulator, we had these desks

297
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:54,968
and big physical objects that players naturally wouldn't cross.

298
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,550
But in Vacation Simulator, we need to teleport,

299
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,791
and teleporting through a physical object feels bad.

300
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,901
So we need to kind of have a clearer, more open area.

301
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:05,323
And the goal is the player should never question

302
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:08,104
why they can't just take a few steps to get to the next zone.

303
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,305
So it's like, I can see it.

304
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:11,466
I should be able to walk there.

305
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:14,588
You need to provide some context for why the teleport is needed.

306
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,590
We do this by communicating the play area.

307
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,011
We use lots of techniques to show this.

308
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,753
So a good example is like visual design in the beach.

309
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:26,454
We use towels on the ground, and we use different terrains.

310
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,135
So you might have like.

311
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,292
a rocky area that is the play zone with grass on the edges.

312
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:37,095
We use doors and gates to help show that you couldn't just naturally walk there, but when

313
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:42,458
you hit the button to teleport, the door opens and gets out of your way, so that's the action

314
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:43,338
that's being taken.

315
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:50,061
We use elevation changes, too, because you can't really walk elevation changes in VR

316
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,323
because most of us play in flat rooms.

317
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:59,378
So we use those elevation changes to help kind of exemplify like why this teleport is necessary.

318
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:04,607
And then when all else fails we put it in a full screen fade and it dims the screen when you get to the edge which is.

319
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:11,553
Really discouraging to players to be if they suddenly decide to walk between zones, if suddenly it fades out, it's like, okay, I know I've hit the edge.

320
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:16,636
And to kind of add on to that, one thing that we noticed is that systems that do have some sort of chaperone or guardian,

321
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:27,682
over time people start ignoring it, but a full screen fade, at least even a little bit, is a very clear indicator, regardless of what you're looking at, that, oh, I've kind of left my available play area.

322
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,925
So another challenge is communicating the movement

323
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:32,466
itself.

324
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,890
And so during the teleport, we fade in and we fade out.

325
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,713
But we want to communicate even more that you're

326
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:39,995
moving during that process.

327
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,037
And one thing that we do to do that

328
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,120
is sound effects during the teleport.

329
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,183
And so very specific sounds that end up grounding

330
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,385
the player in that world.

331
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:51,043
And so let's say, for example, you're

332
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,164
teleporting to a little bit of a rocky area.

333
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,544
We might play a rocky footstep sound

334
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:57,884
when that player gets to that destination.

335
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,965
Or play a wooden sound when I teleport out onto the dock.

336
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,045
A very important thing that was very difficult

337
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,746
at the beginning is we started going down

338
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,946
the path of footsteps, because footsteps

339
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,067
seem to be a very clear indicator that I'm moving.

340
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,807
And it worked, but the problem is

341
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,907
that footsteps take a long time to play out,

342
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,528
and your teleport lengths you want relatively short.

343
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,702
And so we ended up having a scenario one time

344
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,123
where we had like three footsteps.

345
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,865
But what happened is the teleport fade would come back in.

346
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:24,926
You'd be standing still.

347
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,687
And then you'd hear, dunk, dunk, of two footsteps.

348
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,948
And you're like, I didn't do that.

349
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:28,989
I'm standing still.

350
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,631
So we ended up having to play a lot of things

351
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,373
that sometimes sound a little bit like footsteps,

352
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:35,513
but sometimes aren't.

353
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,015
For example, on the dock, it might

354
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,596
be a creak of the wood on the dock

355
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:39,736
when you come to the destination.

356
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,398
You've got to think really hard about the sound

357
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,279
length of those effects.

358
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,535
Another thing that we learned is that we can play around

359
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,317
with the length of that teleport,

360
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,539
so how long you sit on black

361
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,181
and how many sound effects you play

362
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,923
to try to convey the distance of a teleport,

363
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:56,005
that something is a little bit longer for you to get to.

364
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,928
So here's a quick video kind of explaining

365
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,509
how all this stuff kind of plays together.

366
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:07,957
So you can see here, as you start teleporting,

367
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,058
the doors move out of the way.

368
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,124
teleport in the water, there's a splash sound.

369
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,026
And all these things kind of play together

370
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,407
to make you understand how you're

371
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:16,427
moving around in this world.

372
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,690
So the next case study we want to dive into

373
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,351
is character interaction.

374
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,554
So when it comes to characters and alchemy,

375
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,596
we always want to create memorable characters.

376
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,737
So right back when we started working

377
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,439
in mobile and the PC days, we started

378
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,101
building all these interesting characters

379
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,442
to populate our game.

380
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,854
We realized we really wanted this in VR,

381
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:40,916
but this was going to be pretty challenging.

382
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:43,839
And some of the big issues with that

383
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,921
is in traditional flat screen gaming,

384
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,183
that's a character in a world.

385
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,306
In VR, that's a character in your world.

386
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,088
So you need to make sure that you end up

387
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,589
doing all the right things there.

388
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,651
And the presence and believability

389
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:00,893
of those characters is very dependent on how

390
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,215
those characters react, their dialogue, their demeanor,

391
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:04,075
so on and so forth.

392
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:08,349
So when it came to deciding what we wanted to do with Job Simulator,

393
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:11,113
we knew that there were some things that were just outside of our reach, right?

394
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,858
We could not build a full humanoid character, right?

395
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,941
Because then we have problems like, okay, we have limbs,

396
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,523
and how are they going to reach and grab things?

397
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,684
How are they going to move around?

398
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,327
How are we going to do facial animations?

399
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:22,148
And all this stuff.

400
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,150
Because we didn't want to fall into the uncanny valley.

401
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,241
So we started talking about robots.

402
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,223
And so one thing that we ended up coming up with

403
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:30,745
was this box-style bot that we called them.

404
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,507
And they have animated faces where

405
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,389
we can use really interesting expressions.

406
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,991
But at the end of the day, what ended up working with them

407
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:39,734
is people started identifying them as characters.

408
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,876
But we kind of solved all the problems with that.

409
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:46,380
So vacation simulator is more complicated,

410
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,241
as we've been telling you many times.

411
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,016
And there's tons of teleport zones,

412
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,617
meaning there's lots of different locations

413
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:52,718
that the player could be in

414
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,719
throughout the course of playing the game.

415
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,581
And so a bunch of new issues cropped up

416
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,641
with characters because of this.

417
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,203
The world needs to feel alive,

418
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,485
and so how do we place these characters around the world

419
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,405
to make it feel complete

420
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:04,806
while not getting in the way of the players?

421
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,868
And we also wanted to expand further

422
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,150
on player interaction with these characters.

423
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:13,113
So let's talk about personal space.

424
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,255
To feel a connection with a character,

425
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:17,497
they're going to be near the player, right?

426
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:18,478
They're gonna be in the personal space,

427
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,699
but they can't be too close.

428
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,620
In fact, the ideal is kind of the yellow zone

429
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,103
on this graph, which is between, let's see,

430
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:26,484
a foot and a half and four feet,

431
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,106
or 45 centimeters and 1.2 meters.

432
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,989
And players need the ability to move around their space

433
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,551
as characters interact with them,

434
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,513
because in VR, player agency is really important,

435
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,315
so having characters kind of up close

436
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,736
that are following the players around

437
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,056
not so great, and violating that intimate space, that red zone,

438
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:47,577
feels very uncomfortable and aggressive

439
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:49,358
if it's not something the player is invited.

440
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,501
So, for character position, we found it's best to keep

441
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,403
the NPCs outside the immediate play space,

442
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,764
the area that the players can play in.

443
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:03,006
It's even better if you could put them at the very edge of the play space,

444
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:05,427
because that's an opt-in zone where players can choose

445
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:09,130
the distance at which they feel comfortable engaging with these characters.

446
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,420
We also added an avoidance system too,

447
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,562
on the chance that a player needs to lean over

448
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,864
or go towards a bot, or for some reason

449
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,425
they get in close proximity,

450
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:24,168
where the bot tries to get out of the way of the player

451
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,729
and tries not to make contact,

452
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:27,170
because that just feels so bad in VR.

453
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,692
Yeah, it's one thing, it's like these bots,

454
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:31,714
they look on the screen like, oh, okay, they're lovable,

455
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:34,456
but if you have this giant mini-fridge-style thing

456
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:37,158
flying at you, that feels very scary and very bad,

457
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:37,918
and so we have to make sure

458
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,640
that we never end up breaking that.

459
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,736
So now that we have these characters in place,

460
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:46,557
players are going to want to interact with them.

461
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,719
And in Job Simulator, this interaction

462
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,060
was really simplistic.

463
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,163
You could pass characters items at specified times

464
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,445
and specified items.

465
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,126
Characters were very heavily scripted,

466
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,908
so there was no real agency to initiate a conversation.

467
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,269
The characters just kind of came in,

468
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,851
talked at the player, said what they were going to say,

469
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:05,611
and then left.

470
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:10,538
So when it came to character interaction and vacation simulator,

471
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:13,519
we knew we wanted the ability to make it user-driven

472
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,121
to determine when I wanted the conversation.

473
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,602
So instead of the bots talking at you,

474
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:21,283
that you were saying, hey, I want to have a conversation.

475
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,204
In traditional games, the answer would be,

476
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:24,785
let's just map it to a button.

477
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,146
And something that we talk about all the time is like,

478
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,287
in VR, is resist the urge.

479
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,852
No, really, resist the urge to map things to buttons.

480
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,274
There's almost always a better way in VR.

481
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:37,435
We've never had an input scheme that

482
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,316
allows for so much creativity.

483
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,818
Don't just fall back on old paradigms

484
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:42,838
like mapping to buttons.

485
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,620
So our solution was waving.

486
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:49,242
Waving feels very natural, particularly in VR.

487
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:51,343
And it feels like the thing you should do

488
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,884
to get the attention of an NPC.

489
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,827
So in vacation simulator, you look at a bot, you wave at them,

490
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,608
and that initializes the conversation.

491
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,164
And so it gives a player any time to say,

492
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,005
hey, I want to have a conversation.

493
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:08,729
And on top of that, waving feels very fun and very friendly.

494
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,013
So much so that I've played enough vacation simulator

495
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,895
that sometimes when I pop into other VR games

496
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,737
and I see an NPC, I'm like, oh, hello.

497
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,379
And then like, oh, that doesn't work.

498
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,080
That's not like a universal thing.

499
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,003
I hope it becomes a universal thing because it feels so good.

500
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:28,625
So on the note of having characters kind of placed

501
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:30,767
in the environment in these zones,

502
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,209
we ended up encountering an interesting problem.

503
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,791
So in vacation simulator, when a bot was there,

504
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,832
generally they just kind of looked at you.

505
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:39,553
And it was great.

506
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:41,094
There's like one bot looking at you.

507
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:41,835
That feels great.

508
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,496
But we kind of set things up for the beach.

509
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:45,597
It has all those zones.

510
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,878
And every zone has a bot.

511
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:49,060
And then you teleport for the first time into the beach.

512
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,421
And then all the bots just like looked at you.

513
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:51,862
And you're like, yeah.

514
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:53,888
Oh no, what's going on?

515
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,669
This isn't very, very, very creepy.

516
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:58,610
And so we knew that we needed to do something.

517
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,571
And the answer was not do anything.

518
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:02,752
So first thing we did was like, let's turn that off.

519
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:05,213
And then you had the bots just all staring out into nothing.

520
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:08,855
Because it's very clear, even though these are just bots,

521
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:10,376
you know exactly where they're looking.

522
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:13,077
And you kind of guess that they should be doing something.

523
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:14,897
And so one thing that we ended up doing

524
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,018
was creating these idle animations

525
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,519
for the bots themselves.

526
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,922
So here in this video, this bot is bouncing around this coconut.

527
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:29,064
At a distance, this also helps us give character to those bots

528
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:30,185
before you even get close to them.

529
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:32,426
So you're like, oh, this is probably the bot that likes sports

530
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,808
and likes to kind of play around, which you totally get.

531
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:36,528
And then when you teleport into the zone,

532
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,030
then they kind of stop that animation and pay attention to you

533
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,051
just like you'd expect.

534
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,933
And so at the end of the day, what it does is it made our game

535
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:49,055
feel way more alive and our world way less static than it did before.

536
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,739
So the next thing we're gonna talk about is systems

537
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:57,160
and some systems we've built in our game.

538
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,341
And specifically we wanna look at temperature

539
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,702
because we think it's a good example

540
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,422
of kind of our systemic thinking.

541
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:08,705
So temperature as a concept is a common human experience.

542
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,565
Many of us are probably either too hot

543
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,906
or too cold in this room or somewhere in between.

544
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,507
And players have an expectation that things react

545
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,788
in a specific way when they encounter hot or cold.

546
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:22,748
In Job Simulator, we had items that required,

547
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,991
and spaces that required interaction with hot or cold,

548
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,132
like cooking in the kitchen,

549
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:28,893
hot dogs in the convenience store,

550
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:31,515
and players expected to be able to heat

551
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,497
or cool those certain items.

552
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,340
And we had certain devices that could provide heat,

553
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,062
like cups, the grill, toaster, microwave,

554
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,564
pot, hot dog roller, et cetera.

555
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,566
But again, it only worked on very specific items,

556
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,027
so it was fluids and some food.

557
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:50,622
So when it came to Vacation Simulator,

558
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,443
we wanted to rethink the way that we handled this system.

559
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,044
So we came up with this much more broad concept

560
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:57,064
of temperature zones.

561
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,645
And so to break that down, one example

562
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,325
is each one of these destinations

563
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:03,666
has its own kind of climate, its own temperature.

564
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:04,987
So for example, the beach is hot,

565
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,507
and it actually has a temperature associated with it.

566
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,008
The forest is more moderate.

567
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:10,148
The mountain is cold.

568
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:12,489
But the mountain is only cold when you're outside.

569
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,590
When you're inside the lodge, then it's room temperature.

570
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,910
And that's at a higher level.

571
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,571
And then we kind of drill down after that.

572
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:22,645
And so, for example, when we ended up building the mountain,

573
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:23,825
we ended up putting snowballs in.

574
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,247
That's great, but then players would take the snowballs

575
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,548
to the beach and expect them to react.

576
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,109
And so they needed to react.

577
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,249
And so here in the video, someone

578
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,531
took a snowball to the beach and it melted in their hands.

579
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,932
And so that kind of all has to play together.

580
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:38,693
But there's more.

581
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,919
So now when you start thinking about melting

582
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,861
and what kind of that yields, here's

583
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:47,704
an example of someone taking a snowball into the lodge

584
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:49,466
and melting it above a cup.

585
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,627
You expect that snowball to turn to water,

586
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:53,489
and then you expect water that's falling

587
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,551
to be able to land inside something like a cup.

588
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,354
But then if you set that cup on top of the fireplace,

589
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,495
well, then you kind of expect that water to heat.

590
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,417
But then when you've heated that water,

591
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,098
then you kind of expect it to boil.

592
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:08,021
And when it boils, then you kind of expect it to evaporate.

593
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:11,359
And so we kind of went through all these things,

594
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,179
and as you kind of like grab a new one,

595
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,260
then you're like, well, that sets an expectation

596
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,000
for the next thing.

597
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,200
And you kind of like walk through all these things.

598
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,281
And so in our game, temperature is used for all the things

599
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,641
like cooking and boiling and freezing and all that stuff.

600
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,001
The interesting thing is once you kind of set these systems

601
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:29,222
up, then you can use them for more and more

602
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:30,002
interesting things.

603
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,022
So let's talk about cooking.

604
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:34,703
And we have a number of areas in Vacation Simulator

605
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,123
that can be used for cooking, like the grill and the beach

606
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:37,883
like you see here.

607
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:43,536
And it works by using the temperature zones we talked about to systemically interact with the objects.

608
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:47,679
So in our cooking system, unlike job simulator, where it was rudimentary,

609
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:50,741
where there was just kind of temperature as a concept,

610
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,964
this is actually, we actually started programming a system that uses heat transfer.

611
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:59,947
So when an object is closer to the surface of the grill or on the surface of the grill,

612
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:04,350
it actually heats up faster than if it were above the grill.

613
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:08,519
And this is great for believability of our game.

614
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,680
And to go kind of deeper into that concept,

615
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,421
once we have cooking, we extend it further.

616
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,482
So any food item in the game should obviously be cookable,

617
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:19,303
because we cook food,

618
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:22,064
and it should have a corresponding state change.

619
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,565
And then we even let the object be burnable.

620
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:25,925
And all of that happens,

621
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:28,206
not because the object's interactive with the grill,

622
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:30,587
but it happened because the internal temperature

623
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,028
of the object provided by heat transfer

624
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:37,637
changed in a way that changed its state to one of the other states.

625
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:41,158
And we made all of that work, and it's great.

626
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:43,259
Yeah, and so, like, to kind of add on to that,

627
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,619
in Job Simulator, we cared a lot about surface temperature,

628
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,440
but that's not really what you expect in cooking.

629
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,460
What you expect is, like, the internals of this thing heats up,

630
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,021
and so it actually does absorption of heat.

631
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,561
And then on the opposite side, when you're, like, freezing, it does the opposite.

632
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,182
And so a lot of those things play together.

633
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,822
And then to, like, add on to this, we're talking about food here.

634
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:06,104
But every object in the game also has a temperature in itself so you can do things as silly as like

635
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:10,466
Oh, I'm gonna go put say a container of milk on the ground on a barbecue

636
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:13,727
And it'll heat up and then I'll pour it in a cup and then the couple we boiling milk

637
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:17,248
And there's even we can go even further

638
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:24,501
So we have the freezing items in multiple places where they can heat things up.

639
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:28,547
And as an example, we love pushing our systems to their far limits.

640
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,351
So one of our developers was like, I'm going to make matches.

641
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:36,818
And so you can, in fact, cook a hot dog in Vacation Simulator with a match.

642
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:41,006
It will cook very slowly because there's not a lot of heat transfer,

643
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:44,187
but you can hold the match up to the hot dog and it cooks.

644
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:49,348
And so an important thing is like this is one of the systems that we kind of dove deep into.

645
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:54,929
There's many more. This is kind of an interesting one to kind of see as you like step through the process

646
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:59,770
and you're like, okay, I added this, then what does the user expect you do next?

647
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,672
And kind of finding the bottom of that, the logical bottom of that is very important.

648
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:08,822
And so a great example kind of going further is sandwiches.

649
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,863
We're gonna talk about sandwiches now.

650
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:13,844
And, you know, what is a sandwich?

651
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:16,624
That's a huge debate if you've been on the internet.

652
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,045
So ignore that.

653
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:19,365
We're not gonna think about that right now.

654
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,126
What we're gonna think about instead is,

655
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,287
to job is to sandwich, right?

656
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,127
This was great.

657
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:27,008
So we, in Job Simulator, we split it into four jobs.

658
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,869
Each job lived in its own separate world.

659
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,349
And sandwiches were a big part of the gourmet chef job

660
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:33,430
at the time, which made sense.

661
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:35,724
But that didn't cross into any other worlds.

662
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,145
It just lived in gourmet chef.

663
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:41,108
And making a sandwich seems simple on the surface

664
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,970
because in your real life, it's simple to make a sandwich.

665
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,571
It doesn't take a lot of skill.

666
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:48,674
Sorry, sandwich artists.

667
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:51,916
And in VR, there's a significant technical challenge

668
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,318
to overcome to make this sandwich happen.

669
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,961
So when we started Job Simulator and started making the kitchen,

670
00:29:57,981 --> 00:29:59,701
we realized we wanted to make sandwiches.

671
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:03,263
But sandwiches are very, very difficult to try to convey

672
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:04,383
and to do in VR.

673
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,744
And so our solution at the time was something

674
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,225
we called the Sandwich Maker.

675
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:11,006
So the way that it worked is there's this platform

676
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,587
with a skewer, and you put food items on top of it.

677
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,607
The skewer gets taller, and you keep stacking.

678
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,328
And then at the end, to determine

679
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:18,489
that your sandwich is complete, there

680
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:19,789
was a little olive you put on top.

681
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:22,490
And then it became a unit of sandwich.

682
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,771
And then you could pick it up and you could place it on the plate and kind of send it away.

683
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:33,997
For Job Simulator, this was kind of a close enough approximation to Sandwich to make it work, but

684
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:36,699
it left a lot to be desired.

685
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,822
But the trade-off at the time was that it was technically possible for us to build

686
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:46,546
because we were a very small team and did not have a lot of time to focus just on Sandwiches.

687
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:50,749
And so to kind of explain a little bit further, this is a video of how that works.

688
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,657
Toss all your things on.

689
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:56,721
That little skewer gets a little bit higher every time.

690
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:01,150
Sandwich.

691
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,691
Sandwich.

692
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:03,374
Sandwich, it happened.

693
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,296
Unit of sandwich.

694
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:12,118
A big problem is that with this method, you couldn't eat the sandwich, which is like,

695
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,199
pretty fundamental, but it was one of the things that we decided we just needed to do.

696
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,401
A very early prototype was like, well, just make it a single bite.

697
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:24,022
But then someone would pick up giant sandwich and be like, I'm placing it on the thing,

698
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,463
and then all of a sudden it would vanish, and they're like, oh, I ate it.

699
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:28,903
I have to start again.

700
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,522
And so that ended up becoming very awkward.

701
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,265
And so it was like, okay, this is just not something we can solve.

702
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:35,807
We'll put it aside.

703
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,590
And then to kind of stack on top of this,

704
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,513
we started learning all the affordances that come with sandwiches.

705
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:44,156
Luckily for us in Job Simulator,

706
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:46,579
we only had to contend with the affordances in the kitchen

707
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:47,860
and not the entire game.

708
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,806
On this note, affordances.

709
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:54,947
It's one of the most talked about topics in our office.

710
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,148
We talk about affordances all the time.

711
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,909
And a big reason for that, as this image describes,

712
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,110
is we like to put a lot of interactions into our games.

713
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,931
But every interaction you put into the game

714
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,832
impacts its affordance and the affordance of everything else.

715
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,033
So in VR, we like to think about affordance in kind

716
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,194
of like three major parts.

717
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:18,875
So the first part is the player's real world

718
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:19,555
experience.

719
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:19,855
So.

720
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:23,046
If this object does X in the real world,

721
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,446
it should do X in VR.

722
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:28,607
And this is something that is quite a bit different

723
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:31,687
than traditional games because of the limitations of what

724
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:32,187
you're doing.

725
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,148
But in VR, because you're interacting

726
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,788
with the world in a very similar way,

727
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,669
you bring a lot of those experiences along for the ride.

728
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,629
The next thing is input.

729
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:43,449
And so the tracked input of your hands

730
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,890
makes people think about how they

731
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,290
would interact with the world with their hands.

732
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,610
And so.

733
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,725
everything ends up needing to be grabbable and touchable

734
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:55,349
and kind of solving all those problems in the affordance camp.

735
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,875
And so lastly here, it's the expectations of the game itself.

736
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:06,001
And so if I did X within the game already with one input,

737
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:10,077
that similar input should do X in other places in the game.

738
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,638
So the entire game actually plays together.

739
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,340
And it's very challenging to think about

740
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,421
how you could change one thing in one part of your game,

741
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,782
and it won't technically break your game,

742
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,863
but it might break people's thoughts

743
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,164
of what should happen in other parts of your game.

744
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:30,026
So let's do a one-sentence explanation of this,

745
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,987
and that is, the world should work

746
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,967
in a way that makes sense to the player

747
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,548
given their prior experience.

748
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:36,348
The input.

749
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:39,065
and the inferred rules of the virtual world.

750
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:41,567
And so some examples of that are,

751
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,970
if you see a ball, you can pick it up and throw it.

752
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,772
If there's a bottle of water, you can open the lid,

753
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:48,514
pour the water out, or drink it.

754
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:50,596
And if there's a drawer, you can open it.

755
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,978
So that's kind of giving you an example

756
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,359
of what affordances are.

757
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,382
So how do we afford a sandwich?

758
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,162
We want sandwich making to be intuitive

759
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:02,883
and an understandable task,

760
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:06,005
and players expect that the world reacts in similar ways.

761
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:09,467
So you can see this coffee is like,

762
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:11,448
the player expects that they hit the button,

763
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:12,508
it pours into the cup,

764
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,669
they can bring it up to their face and drink the coffee.

765
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,011
And they want these objects in the virtual world

766
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,712
to match that expectation.

767
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:29,013
So constructing a sandwich in vacation simulator, the world affords making sandwiches anywhere

768
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:35,438
unlike the machine that existed in a specific spot in a specific job in job simulator.

769
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:40,862
The player should be able to create something that also looks and feels like a sandwich.

770
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:44,264
And those two points alone create a ton of affordances.

771
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:52,370
A sandwich or sandwich-like object requires items that are stacked into a single unit.

772
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,033
And we need an in-universe, understandable and intuitive way to assemble that sandwich

773
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:01,996
because as we were saying before, we don't want to end up putting these sandwich makers

774
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:02,736
all over the world.

775
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:04,917
And that's just not the way it works in real life.

776
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,580
You should just be able to construct a sandwich.

777
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:14,803
So we said we weren't going to talk about this, but here we are.

778
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:16,524
Let's talk about what a sandwich is.

779
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:18,866
First, we place some starting item.

780
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,087
Samban, bread, etc.

781
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:27,481
Then, we place contents, contents of what you want in your sandwich, on top of that.

782
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,603
And then we place the last item on top.

783
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:33,145
It doesn't have to be bread, but you're going to have some item that you consider the last

784
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:33,525
item.

785
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:37,068
So, was that so hard?

786
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,589
Look, sandwich is defined.

787
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:40,730
Delivered on that promise.

788
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:47,194
And one other important note, hot dogs are not sandwiches, and we have the code to prove

789
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:47,334
it.

790
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,777
We will be taking no questions on those two slides.

791
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,543
So now we're setting off to do this very simple task of making a sandwich.

792
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:01,026
So the very first thing we've got to think about is attaching.

793
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:05,469
Because essentially what we're doing is we are trying to attach more than one thing

794
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:08,371
to something else that could be more than one thing.

795
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:12,114
Attaching by itself is actually a very complicated task.

796
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:16,137
And the tech necessary is absurdly complicated.

797
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:19,119
And now we needed to do the most absurdly complicated thing

798
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,841
of the most absurdly complicated thing.

799
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,251
So let's talk about how our attached system worked

800
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:26,112
in Job Simulator.

801
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:30,374
So here you can see, you bring the cartridge near the slot.

802
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,595
Yellow highlight appears.

803
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:32,195
You release.

804
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:33,215
It snaps in.

805
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:36,797
And it snaps in with a defined location and orientation

806
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:39,138
based on what has been set up.

807
00:36:39,674 --> 00:36:41,776
This allows for very simplistic interactions.

808
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,157
We did a few of these inside Job Simulator.

809
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:47,340
It was like a cork in a bottle, for example.

810
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,581
And this one, there's a few places that we used it.

811
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,303
It was not so great, but it kind of

812
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:55,285
proved out that this was an interesting method

813
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,247
of interacting with the world.

814
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,990
So we realized we needed to kind of extend detachables out.

815
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,591
There was a lot of use cases for this.

816
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:06,874
So even before we started leaning into the sandwich

817
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:07,955
problem by itself.

818
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:10,668
we started working on more complicated ways

819
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,509
of attaching things.

820
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,469
So here, for example, we're building a sandcastle.

821
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:17,310
This is complicated, but it's a little bit better

822
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,290
because essentially this is a fixed plane

823
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,131
that we're dealing with.

824
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:21,971
And we can kind of do the math on top of this.

825
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,832
But the one thing that we realized

826
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,912
is that every system that we build for attach

827
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:29,613
needed to support the concept of also holding

828
00:37:29,653 --> 00:37:31,533
the thing in your hand when you're also

829
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:32,653
trying to attach things.

830
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:37,535
And in VR this is quite complicated because you have very limited interaction.

831
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,719
You don't have fingers to go and manipulate things.

832
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,803
You're essentially doing a grab and a release.

833
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:43,045
So kind of, what do you mean?

834
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,641
So let's talk about stacks of attach.

835
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:51,824
So attachable items can be marked

836
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:53,626
as this stackable state.

837
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,008
And so one of the concessions we made

838
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,851
was let's think about some things

839
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:01,313
that we called sandwich starters, some things

840
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:03,655
that you would kind of expect to build on top of.

841
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:06,738
And so for example, here, there's a bottom bun.

842
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,340
It's like, OK, that's a thing you want to stack.

843
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:14,227
So when you end up bringing something that can be attached to a stack of sandwiches near it,

844
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:18,091
it'll see a highlight in the final destination, and then when you release it'll attach.

845
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:23,996
And then that item then parents itself underneath the now new sandwich object

846
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:25,438
that you can then manipulate.

847
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,701
And so here we're stacking through it, it's like, okay, now here's some cheese,

848
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,223
and then here's a splat that we'll talk about in a second.

849
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,560
And so this also, in this example,

850
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,660
is happening on the counter.

851
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,721
But we need to deal with the fact

852
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:38,001
that you could have this in your hand

853
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,302
and you're like tossing things in it

854
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:41,303
and then trading hands between that

855
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:43,384
and kind of what your intentions actually are.

856
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:46,925
So now that we have stacking, we kind of

857
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,846
have this concept of sandwiches.

858
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,947
Now we can actually assemble a sandwich itself.

859
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:56,109
So designing the stacking like this

860
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:58,149
ended up being pretty intuitive for the players.

861
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,210
They just wanted to put ingredients on the stack.

862
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:03,483
That said, there were some problems with that.

863
00:39:05,084 --> 00:39:09,288
So, in Job Simulator, every edible item in the kitchen

864
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:10,589
could be in a sandwich.

865
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,451
And the world afforded that kind of like incredibly goofy

866
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:15,053
and awkward level of interaction,

867
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,056
as you can see by this like raw steak, egg,

868
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,618
and whole slice of cheese sandwich.

869
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,262
And so the interaction paradigm was very, very basic there.

870
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:32,430
But in real life, sandwiches aren't created by just taking a giant hunk of cheese and slapping it on some bread.

871
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,632
You create it from slices of food.

872
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:39,096
So we created this slice-o-matic machine to address that affordance.

873
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:42,699
And it should take in edible items and output a slice of it.

874
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,123
And not just a slice of it, but a nice-looking usable slice.

875
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:52,708
So in this case, you see the avocado going in, and instead of just taking out a chunk of avocado,

876
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,850
it's actually taking out this nice three-piece.

877
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,789
three slices of avocado.

878
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,353
And once again, back to affordances,

879
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:04,175
once the player understands how the slice-o-matic works,

880
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:07,819
they assume every item in the game should be sliceable.

881
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:11,022
And this is the hell prison we built ourselves in,

882
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:14,245
that the artists every day come to us and they go,

883
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:15,706
oh no, another item?

884
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:17,688
Can it not be food?

885
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,990
And we're like, no, you have to make more slices.

886
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:36,158
And so you can see here we created slices for every edible item and you can see like the cucumber getting cut and kind of all these different items tomato and a bunch of other ones and the nice bespoke art we created for each and every one of them. Thank you, John.

887
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:44,264
Some items don't afford slicing, like ketchup, that would be super weird.

888
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:46,186
Who slices ketchup?

889
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:49,148
So players expect they react in a different way.

890
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:52,471
So for those edge cases, we had to address them individually because once you have the

891
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,093
system, again, it affords a certain thing and players expect that.

892
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,454
So we created the concept of this splat.

893
00:40:57,594 --> 00:41:02,578
When you pour a liquid on top of a stack, a splat appears.

894
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:06,962
If you try to grab that splat off, it turns back into fluid.

895
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,051
An earlier version allowed you to pick that up.

896
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,212
That felt very bad.

897
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,713
It felt very weird to just have a handful of ketchup.

898
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:16,015
So you pick it up, it vanishes.

899
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:19,496
So we also addressed the educational marshmallows,

900
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:21,737
where you could see there, in a s'more,

901
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:22,998
a marshmallow would flatten out.

902
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:26,520
So we kind of deformed the mesh to make it afford what

903
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,840
the player expected out of it.

904
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,881
And to add on to that, when we ended up

905
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,562
building the splat thing, it worked great.

906
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,983
And we're like, we solved it.

907
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:35,204
And one of the first things a player did was,

908
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:40,214
Instead of just building their burger and then pouring the ketchup on top or the barbecue sauce,

909
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:44,076
they would put the burger on the grill and then pour it directly onto the hamburger.

910
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:48,018
And we're like, well, that's obvious, but that's not a sandwich, that's a burger.

911
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,699
And so we ended up having to do things like going through the game,

912
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:54,401
like which objects afford splats when they're not sandwiches?

913
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:57,062
And so going to try to like deal with that,

914
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:59,423
and then also deal with the case of like put splats on that,

915
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,425
and now I want to put that on a sandwich and have that transfer correctly.

916
00:42:02,705 --> 00:42:03,745
And take the splat off.

917
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:03,945
Yeah.

918
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,401
So, we have stacking, we have slices,

919
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,464
we can build a sandwich, but we still haven't

920
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:12,845
solved the problem of eating it.

921
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:14,727
So let's talk about that.

922
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,409
Alright, yes, let's talk about eating.

923
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,272
So obviously sandwiches afford eating.

924
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,214
It's the most common use case for sandwiches.

925
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,357
Before in job simulators I mentioned,

926
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:27,398
you couldn't eat them.

927
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:30,540
So we needed to address this kind of in general.

928
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,242
So eating should be as simple as bringing something

929
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:35,803
to your mouth.

930
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:38,964
Food should react to this scenario.

931
00:42:39,004 --> 00:42:40,905
And that's what we did in Job Simulator.

932
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:44,506
There also should be some feedback for that.

933
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,627
So for example, you bring this close particle effects

934
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:48,727
shoot off.

935
00:42:48,927 --> 00:42:51,348
And you can do multiple bites as you're going through food.

936
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:54,833
So let's talk about how to eat.

937
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:57,955
And so in Java Simulator, we ended up

938
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:00,036
playing around with byte states.

939
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:01,896
Not everything had byte states.

940
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:02,857
Some things did not.

941
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,258
What we discovered, though, in practice

942
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:08,800
was that an object should have at least, that's edible,

943
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,301
should have at least one byte state.

944
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:13,021
So they should take two bytes to complete.

945
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,822
And part of this was because you need

946
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,083
to understand what's going on.

947
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:18,384
If I put something close my mouth and it disappears

948
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:20,565
and there's just a particle effect, it isn't always clear.

949
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:23,046
It's also much cooler to do things in two bytes.

950
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,912
So that meant that we had to go through the world

951
00:43:25,952 --> 00:43:28,674
and make sure every food item also had a bite state.

952
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:30,555
And so you can kind of see here,

953
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:33,237
this is some food and this is what it looks like

954
00:43:33,338 --> 00:43:34,338
when you bite it.

955
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,480
And those particles that end up

956
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,941
coming off your mouth location,

957
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:39,723
we also need to make sure we're coloring them

958
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:42,445
related to the color of the item of the food that you ate.

959
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:45,227
So we play the sound effect, this kind of crunch,

960
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:47,829
and then it kind of plays all together.

961
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:49,591
And this is for every food item

962
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:50,832
in Odo, we have a lot of them.

963
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:55,788
Uh, so here's a video of kind of our basic eating mechanism in the game.

964
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:01,794
You see the color particles coming out the red and the brownish.

965
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:06,499
Yeah, and coloring them sounds trivial, but then you start thinking about different ways

966
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,103
you can recolor things in the world and it becomes pretty tricky.

967
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,751
So edible items can come in many states.

968
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:18,853
Cooked, sliced, stacked, fluid splat, burned,

969
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:19,994
all sorts of things.

970
00:44:20,134 --> 00:44:23,896
And sandwiches can have all of these various states on them.

971
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:26,417
So all the systems are going to have to work together

972
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:27,238
to be believable.

973
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:31,480
And so if you thought stacks and bite states were bad,

974
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:32,541
check this out.

975
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:35,943
We have a whole tomato, a bitten tomato, a sliced tomato,

976
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:37,844
and then a sliced bite of that tomato,

977
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:39,225
all of which have custom art.

978
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:40,786
So sorry again, artists.

979
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:42,228
We did it.

980
00:44:42,668 --> 00:44:47,610
Oh, and by the way, they all have special textures for their burned and cooked states.

981
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:55,633
And now, but doing this was a huge win, because every item can now be bitten, every item can

982
00:44:55,673 --> 00:45:01,156
be cooked, and the world affords it, and it all works because we created this generic

983
00:45:01,236 --> 00:45:02,957
system to deal with these things.

984
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:06,995
So putting our whole sandwich together,

985
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:10,616
we can leverage all these systems to make sandwiches work

986
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:13,137
because we've built them all as these kind of generic systems.

987
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:17,519
And now, our eating a sandwich becomes an order of operations

988
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:17,939
problem.

989
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,720
So the player brings the sandwich to their face,

990
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,501
as you're supposed to do when you're eating.

991
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:26,242
It iterates through the stack of all items and bites them.

992
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:30,864
We then ensure the stack is still intact,

993
00:45:30,884 --> 00:45:33,165
has proper dimensions, is properly rotated.

994
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:34,866
Everything is done correct.

995
00:45:35,154 --> 00:45:49,042
and we spawned by particles and play a sound effect and if you look there you can see all these items on this picture are bitten as some of them are sliced items some of them are not sliced items and you know it just.

996
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:52,196
works to kind of like expand on some of this here.

997
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,398
We also do things like oh, there's like maybe a mushroom

998
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:57,440
in there that in the game is poisonous is going to make you

999
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,201
vomit. So when you're iterating through there, you're like,

1000
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:00,903
oh, yeah, that's one that's going to make you vomit when

1001
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,605
you eat this and other things like you can see in the stack.

1002
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,347
There's a watermelon slice. We actually had a conversation

1003
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,789
is a watermelon slice a slice.

1004
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,510
Yeah, can you slice it?

1005
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,411
Can you slice it?

1006
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,472
And then would that be a watermelon slice slice?

1007
00:46:14,532 --> 00:46:17,614
The end of the day was it's better for a watermelon slice

1008
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,476
to be a slice, which means that it should have two bite

1009
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:22,837
states to work, which means that the final bite state is just

1010
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:25,258
eating the entire thing, which actually is kind of awesome.

1011
00:46:25,598 --> 00:46:29,480
So let's take a look at kind of the whole sandwich

1012
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,921
system coming together.

1013
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:34,983
And here you can see us cooking a bunch of food items,

1014
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:37,865
including slices, pouring a splat.

1015
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:42,678
stacking it all together, our lovely avocado toast,

1016
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,019
and then crunching.

1017
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:51,900
So everything in the world needs to play together.

1018
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,201
We keep talking about the affordance of the world,

1019
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,181
but when you end up building all these systems,

1020
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:57,702
there's an interplay to them.

1021
00:46:58,222 --> 00:46:59,882
And so here in this image, you can kind of see

1022
00:47:00,122 --> 00:47:01,403
all those things that we talked about

1023
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,163
are kind of being spun together.

1024
00:47:05,984 --> 00:47:06,604
So we'll leave you on this.

1025
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:10,349
To make engaging VR, you must first build the universe,

1026
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,170
or at least part of it.

1027
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:14,991
Thank you.

1028
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:18,654
Thank you.

1029
00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:23,877
Thank you.

1030
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:24,077
Thank you.

1031
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:24,277
Thank you.

1032
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:24,557
Thank you.

1033
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:25,898
So we left some time for questions,

1034
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,939
if people want to come up to the microphones.

1035
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:34,263
Hello.

1036
00:47:34,323 --> 00:47:34,863
Hi.

1037
00:47:34,944 --> 00:47:35,504
Great talk.

1038
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:36,805
Wonderful information to share.

1039
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:40,093
Uh, I have one question about your zone system.

1040
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:44,357
So in the Rick and Morty game, you guys had this really clever mechanic of having Mr.

1041
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:48,721
Meeseeks come into play and allowing you to grab hard to read op.

1042
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:51,719
hard to reach objects that were right out of your play field.

1043
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,541
Clearly, that thematically doesn't

1044
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,002
work with vacation simulator.

1045
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:57,464
Do you have another way to resolve that sort of issue?

1046
00:47:57,884 --> 00:48:00,106
Another set of systems that, yes.

1047
00:48:00,186 --> 00:48:02,408
Yeah, so yeah, that's a very good observation.

1048
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:06,031
So yeah, Rick and Morty, we did kind of the very early stuff

1049
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,352
of doing some zone-based teleportation.

1050
00:48:08,412 --> 00:48:10,274
But in the garage, there was only three zones,

1051
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:12,175
so we didn't have to deal with a fraction

1052
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,697
amount of problems with vacation simulator.

1053
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:16,679
And the UCC and TOS, you know, like kind

1054
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,100
of grab things outside, that was kind of one

1055
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:20,513
our work arounds to kind of deal with that.

1056
00:48:20,654 --> 00:48:22,375
But yeah, it was very like themed to that.

1057
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:24,596
When we kind of set out to make Vacation Sim,

1058
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:26,517
we're like, that's clearly not tenable,

1059
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,739
and that's clearly not a system that's going to work well

1060
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:30,220
and be like super intuitive,

1061
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,041
particularly over lots of spaces.

1062
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,523
So what we ended up doing is we keep track

1063
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:36,144
of all the volumes in the game.

1064
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:38,465
So let's say I have a beach ball.

1065
00:48:38,945 --> 00:48:40,186
and I have a beach ball in this zone.

1066
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:43,448
It knows it's safely within that zone and is grabbable by you.

1067
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:45,409
So now let's say I go and toss that beach ball

1068
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:47,150
and it rolls outside your zone.

1069
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,551
We are like, OK, it's now in a state that

1070
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:52,032
is outside of your available grabbing space.

1071
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:53,973
So we don't want somebody trying to lunge for it

1072
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:55,574
and run into a real world wall.

1073
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:59,206
So then what we do is we determine, once it comes to rest,

1074
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:00,828
or close to rest, or times out,

1075
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:03,151
what's the closest zone for it to go to.

1076
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,613
So sometimes it'll like pop back,

1077
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:06,074
and we have all these little markers

1078
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:08,577
of where good safe spots are for them to be.

1079
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:11,040
But then that still means I can toss stuff into other zones,

1080
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,083
and even if it just like trips out of the edge of that zone,

1081
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:14,985
it's like, no, you actually meant to be in that zone.

1082
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:15,746
We'll put that in there.

1083
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:18,924
But to compound this problem is sometimes people are like,

1084
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,625
I don't want this object.

1085
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:21,385
Go away.

1086
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:23,407
And the last thing you want is that object to be like,

1087
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:24,668
come right back to you.

1088
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,650
So we also have this concept of lost, where it's like, OK,

1089
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,871
clearly you intentionally got rid of this.

1090
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,081
And we're like, just let it be.

1091
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,403
Except for the fact of what if you were like,

1092
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,184
oh I want to build a ketchup sandwich

1093
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:38,545
and I took my ketchup and I threw it out in the ocean.

1094
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:40,166
It's like, okay, there's certain things

1095
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,967
that we want to recall in those states.

1096
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:44,529
And that's just kind of the surface of that problem.

1097
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:46,490
It has been a very challenging problem.

1098
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,231
We worked through the entire project on it.

1099
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,732
I'm pretty happy with where we ended up.

1100
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:52,094
And there's object homes is another good example.

1101
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,815
Like if you're, you know the ketchup bottle,

1102
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:55,976
you expect it not to spawn in the safe spot,

1103
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,777
but to spawn back where it came from.

1104
00:49:58,057 --> 00:49:58,417
Yeah.

1105
00:49:58,818 --> 00:49:58,958
Yes.

1106
00:49:59,526 --> 00:50:00,066
Very complicated.

1107
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:04,670
On the subject of ketchup, can you stack splats?

1108
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,170
Yes.

1109
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,032
Can you stack splats at the same time?

1110
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:09,794
So the question is, can you stack splats?

1111
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,315
Yeah, can you stack splats?

1112
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:17,880
You cannot stack splats of the same topping, but you can grab two toppings and alternate

1113
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,861
stacking splats.

1114
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:23,765
We tried stacking splats of the same topping, but it's weird to understand in a stream of

1115
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:26,127
particles, which is kind of how our fluid system works.

1116
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:30,441
which one, like, that's not a very precise thing.

1117
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:33,803
So yeah, you can kind of like take ketchup and mustard

1118
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:35,264
and be like, ketchup, mustard, ketchup, mustard,

1119
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:37,005
ketchup, mustard, and make like a really huge,

1120
00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:40,847
disgusting sandwich filled with ketchup and mustard splats.

1121
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:41,587
And then you crunch.

1122
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,228
We found that from a foreign standpoint.

1123
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:43,969
Generally people are like,

1124
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:45,309
I want to put lots of different things,

1125
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,451
and so that's super intuitive and just works.

1126
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:48,491
That's awesome, thanks.

1127
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:55,407
Did you guys do any experimenting with more complex interactions like

1128
00:50:56,148 --> 00:51:00,274
Enforcing two-handed interactions with heavier objects or things like that?

1129
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:06,863
Yeah, so the question is did we experiment with any two-handed style more complicated interactions the answer is yes

1130
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:16,289
The answer is yes, and on April 9th, you should purchase Vacation Simulator.

1131
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:20,071
But no, yeah, we do actually have a few two-handed interactions.

1132
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:23,472
We also are trying to make sure we're accessible, so we're kind of like trying to think around

1133
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:23,793
those things.

1134
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:26,254
But yeah, we have done some experimentation.

1135
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:28,804
with that stuff.

1136
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:30,105
I don't think we're ready to, yeah.

1137
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:33,967
There's one really good example that very recently rolled out

1138
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,669
of the project was the ability to open books.

1139
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,811
So back to the topic of affordance.

1140
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:43,713
In Job Simulator, all of our books were just a box, right?

1141
00:51:43,753 --> 00:51:44,833
You couldn't open them at all.

1142
00:51:45,273 --> 00:51:48,194
And so we followed the same thing through in vacation simulator.

1143
00:51:48,214 --> 00:51:49,294
It was like, OK, this is that.

1144
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:53,236
But we discovered that as our world got more rich and more interactive,

1145
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:55,237
that more people were like, why?

1146
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:57,378
What am I doing wrong that I can't open this?

1147
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,558
And I was like, OK, now that the world affords this,

1148
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:01,019
we kind of got to readdress this.

1149
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:04,460
And we've been on and off working on books for three plus years.

1150
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:08,923
But we kind of think we finally cracked the riddle of how to open a book and it is a two-handed interaction

1151
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,664
I grab a book and open it up and stuff like that

1152
00:52:11,524 --> 00:52:12,585
And when we discovered it, we're like yay

1153
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:14,666
And then we talked to the artist is like wow

1154
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:17,648
I got twice the content to build now and it's like great

1155
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:24,071
But that's just one of those that's one of kind of many of the experimentations. We're doing in two-handed interactions books

1156
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:27,273
Don't sound complicated, but they're absurdly complicated. Yes

1157
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,455
In that same vein

1158
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:34,117
I'm curious how you guys decide where to draw the line like

1159
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:38,944
I usually don't grab stuff off a barbecue with my bare hand.

1160
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:41,465
So I noticed you guys didn't have spatulas.

1161
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:47,129
I'm kind of curious how do you decide internally?

1162
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:50,611
So the question is where do we decide to draw the line internally?

1163
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:53,632
And there's a multi-part answer to that.

1164
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:59,476
So one big thing is we can rely on humor a lot, but we can rely on the weird awkwardness

1165
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:02,117
of the world, which is why you can just grab things off the grill.

1166
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:07,693
our world doesn't require a spatula for its affordance

1167
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:10,335
because it's like, oh, this is this rough approximation.

1168
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,936
But the other thing too is we draw the line a lot of times

1169
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,037
at the holy shit, we aren't going to be able to code this

1170
00:53:16,118 --> 00:53:17,398
in this time or make this work.

1171
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:19,339
So let's just do a joke.

1172
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:21,220
And like in Rick and Morty, there's a great example

1173
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,821
where like there's a door, right?

1174
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:24,482
And it's got a doorknob.

1175
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,960
we couldn't get rid of that in that game.

1176
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,741
That's an iconic part of the world.

1177
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,142
As weird as that sounds, like this door is iconic.

1178
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:33,503
But it is, it's in this garage.

1179
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:35,905
And so we're like, okay, how do we deal with the doorknob?

1180
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:37,265
And there's another part of the world,

1181
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:39,167
there's another part of that universe

1182
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,707
that has this concept of real fake doors.

1183
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,469
So you go and you reach and you grab the doorknob.

1184
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:45,510
And the doorknob comes off and it says real fake doors

1185
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,532
and players laugh because you acknowledge

1186
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,392
that they did something.

1187
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:50,513
So sometimes just the mere act of saying

1188
00:53:51,374 --> 00:53:54,616
we see you as developers is enough for the players to go like

1189
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:55,922
Oh, that's great.

1190
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:57,803
It's doing nothing that's bad.

1191
00:53:58,023 --> 00:53:59,905
And then other times we don't know where to draw the line,

1192
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:01,226
and then we tumble down a rabbit hole.

1193
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:05,449
And we make water boil from a snowball.

1194
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,150
So yeah.

1195
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:08,972
Any other questions?

1196
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:14,657
Hi, you spent a lot of time talking about sandwiches,

1197
00:54:14,757 --> 00:54:17,559
and I was just curious if you think a hot dog is a sandwich.

1198
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:19,781
We did say, we have the code.

1199
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,870
We have the code. It is definitely definitely not a sandwich.

1200
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:26,854
It's not a sandwich. There's no there's no starting stacked item.

1201
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:28,576
Yeah, it's different.

1202
00:54:28,896 --> 00:54:31,239

1203
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,541

1204
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:36,805
All right with that.

1205
00:54:37,266 --> 00:54:37,786
Thank you very much.
