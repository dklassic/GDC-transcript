Greetings, fellow TDCers! I'm Ingvild and I run a small studio called Henchmen & Goon

00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:12,275
out of Norway, the land of fjords, mountains, and picturesque cottages riddled with traditionally

00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:13,396
rose-painted accessories.

00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:19,821
Last year we launched our latest title, Pode, which is a cute, family-friendly, slow-paced

00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:25,204
game all about exploring, solving puzzles, and experiencing the beauty of the world around

00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:25,365
you.

00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:30,542
I'll be giving a talk on how we approach the visual design for PODE, so if you're interested

00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:35,386

00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:39,950
the colourful, friendly, cosy world of PODE, I hope you'll join me in San Francisco.

00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:42,372
See you there!
