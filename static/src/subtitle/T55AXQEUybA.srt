00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:12,054
Hello everyone, my name is Yingqin Fang. This is my partner Liu Yongcheng.

2
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:19,720
Our topic is how to risk training game inflation monitoring and alerting of economical system.

3
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:29,969
The virtual world described in the movie Ready Player One is a dream of each game developer.

4
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:35,848
Once the developer allows the game currency and items to be traded within the game among

5
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:38,990
players, then there may be such a situation.

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,734
The players are complaining, why do I need to use more money to buy the required items?

7
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:52,477
Similar to the negative emotion inflation in the real economy, the price of the item

8
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:55,479
rises rapidly giving bad feelings to players.

9
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,462
The US government hopes that the annual price increase will be controlled at around 2%,

10
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:03,842
which is healthy.

11
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:09,984
The United States influences it through the Federal Reserve System's monetary policy.

12
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:11,885
So what about the game?

13
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,685
Yes, we also need to be alert.

14
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:20,927
We must know that the inflation of the game is also derived from the amount of money in

15
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:21,267
the game.

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,425
When the amount of money circulated is greater than the demand, it will push up the price.

17
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:35,571
NetEase, one of the most important game developers in China, has been working on the development

18
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:43,298
of very complex large MMORPG for 15 years and have accumulated a lot of experience in

19
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:47,842
monitoring, predicting, and regulating the game economy system.

20
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:56,314
Here we believe that this experience will be friendly to even sample game, even if not a memo RPG.

21
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:02,696
If you are thinking about making a game that lets players trade, today's talk will be very useful.

22
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,758
Next, we will first explain how the economy system works.

23
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:14,826
We will demonstrate some cases which appear in two popular Chinese games.

24
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:21,412
One is a mobile game Ghost and the other one is a computer game Justice Online.

25
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,195
We will explain it as clearly as possible.

26
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:35,244
In the MMORPG, we first made it clear that the players invested time and money and eventually gained the ability.

27
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:45,516
In this process, players naturally divide their labor, get money, produce items, and trade with each other.

28
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:48,939
All these things formed an economic system.

29
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:57,407
As we can see, the economic system often contains at least two currencies, gold and silver.

30
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:06,561
Gold is obtained through players' paying, and silver is obtained by spending time participating in specific dungeons.

31
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:14,888
Gold can be traded once and can no longer be traded. Silver is not limited.

32
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,414
Gold can buy some non-tradable items to raise ability directly, such as strengthening your weapons.

33
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:27,898
Silver can improve another part of ability, such as skill level.

34
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:32,764
There are also some tradable items such as equipment,

35
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:37,045
which are readily obtained through gameplay

36
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:38,485
and can also be traded.

37
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,766
Everyone is fair to get it.

38
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:45,467
This means that both rich and ordinary players

39
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,868
need gold, silver, and tradable items.

40
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,190
Therefore, the market in the game is formed.

41
00:03:54,536 --> 00:04:00,402
After understanding the above-all concepts, we can see that they are very similar to the real world.

42
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:10,232
Game are like the central bank's issuing currency, allowing the users to use their time to produce items and finally collecting money and items back.

43
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:18,120
This will allow us to better understand the economic system and inflation in the game.

44
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,093
They are all caused by the imbalance of people, money, and items in the game.

45
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:32,557
We summarize the five common causes of inflation in the game, including too much game currency

46
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:39,902
issue, or the production of key items is not enough, or the number of players is declining,

47
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:46,986
or some people try to multiply specific items, and sleeping money suddenly released.

48
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,316
We will explain these five causes one by one.

49
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,739
After the explanations, we will share the experience

50
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,362
we gained in the monitoring and intervening in inflection.

51
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:04,266
This is our first example, too much game currency is issue.

52
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:09,329
Then you may want to imagine that in real life,

53
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,771
can our government or the central bank

54
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,352
print unlimited banknotes?

55
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,659
If a large number of banknotes are issued,

56
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:19,641
and strain and the goods in the market are limited,

57
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,222
then price will generally rise.

58
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,065
If there is no means of collecting this money

59
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,007
at this time, price will continue to rise

60
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,428
and inflation will occur.

61
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,470
If the federal robust system

62
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,533
unconditionally activates the printing press,

63
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,895
the dollar will soon become Zimbabwean dollars.

64
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:54,649
Correspondingly, if there are too many current issues in the game, the game players will expect that the game virtual currency will depreciate quickly.

65
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:57,451
They will not hesitate to spend the money immediately.

66
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:07,518
Destroyed confidence and the rapid flow of money create multiple problems for you, so you need to balance the current distribution in a planned way.

67
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,750
This came to our second case.

68
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,013
The production of key items is not enough.

69
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:17,476
Some players don't have the energy

70
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,739
to spend a lot of money in a game.

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,904
They are willing to buy virtual gold coins from other players

72
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:30,009
and then exchange them for their dream equipment and items.

73
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:31,891
Others.

74
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:39,289
play the role as a farmer, exchange the fruit of their labor with those rich guys.

75
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:45,852
We found that the items that Gaijin farmers produce, which often are at a stable price

76
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:54,177
and with large demand, have a big impact on the price. Like oil in the United States or pork in

77
00:06:54,217 --> 00:07:00,660
China, if production is insufficient, consumption index will rise rapidly.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,362
As we said, there are many types of players.

79
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,923
Some are willing to spend more time,

80
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:08,884
some are willing to spend more money.

81
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:13,246
If the number of farmers who are willing to spend more time

82
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,287
purchasing items decline rapidly,

83
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:19,329
rich players will be unable to buy what they want

84
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:20,950
and the price will rise.

85
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,572
And those rich players quickly lost, price will fall.

86
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:30,303
As a result, you need to get to know your players better

87
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,983
and find out who is gone in the first place,

88
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,464
potentially preventing a disruption

89
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,465
in the balance of supply and demand.

90
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:43,966
This is a problem we want to illustrate in our first case,

91
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,067
which is that someone is trying to monopolize

92
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,548
a particular item.

93
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:53,529
There's a special group in the game, businessmen.

94
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:56,133
Different from the ordinary players,

95
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,934
some businessmen will try to purchase

96
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:03,015
a large number of items produced by them from others

97
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:07,256
to form a monoply and to manipulate

98
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:10,157
the price of the items.

99
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,738
Eventually, players will have to pay more.

100
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,000
Do not underestimate this group of businessmen.

101
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,923
In China, they are enterprise operation,

102
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:23,345
set up a company, had a large number of staff

103
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,026
specialized in playing game,

104
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,729
and even develop a trading program.

105
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,611
They will trade the game currency offline

106
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,033
and eventually convert it into real money.

107
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:37,376
You need to identify exactly who is a farmer,

108
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,817
who is a small businessman,

109
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,938
who is a company, and who is a robot.

110
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:45,096
so as not to hurt a good man.

111
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:48,579
I don't know if you have the experience

112
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,521
of tracking AFK players.

113
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,544
Usually, we mistakenly believe that after players left,

114
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:58,267
the currency he holds, which is called sleeping money,

115
00:08:58,727 --> 00:08:59,928
should not be considered.

116
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,132
But sometimes, a successful marketing campaign

117
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:07,454
will attract a large number of lost players to return.

118
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:13,507
their previously held currency will suddenly be released and the price will rise rapidly.

119
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:19,629
So even if a player left, you can't relax your monitoring of this type of currency.

120
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,531
So far, here are 5 of our typical cases.

121
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:31,693
After showing the 5 inflection cases in the game, how do we monitor or intervene in this

122
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:32,013
case?

123
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:35,074
Let my colleague Qin Fang share with everyone.

124
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,138
Hello everyone, my name is Ying Qin Fang.

125
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,979
It's my turn to introduce the following.

126
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,361
In this part, we will focus on the issue,

127
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,642
collection stack and the exchange rate of game currencies,

128
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:55,023
the prices of key items,

129
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,904
and the whole currency circulation process in the game.

130
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,165
To help you understand,

131
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,266
we will show the results of our work

132
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,027
with pictures and text,

133
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:08,668
hoping you can learn something from our talk.

134
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,936
The first is to monitor the game currencies.

135
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:16,417
Let's assume our game system is a central bank.

136
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,259
Then the game developers are the presidents of the bank.

137
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,561
We have to have the ability to quickly know

138
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,242
how much money is still in the market

139
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:29,904
and how much money we are issuing and collecting today.

140
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:34,046
In the NetEase game's economical monitoring system,

141
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,128
we first use this chart to monitor the general status.

142
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:45,571
In the center of the chart is the current total amount of each currency in the game market.

143
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:50,896
On the left side of the chart is the currency issued by the game bank.

144
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:56,441
They keep pushing the amount of money in the whole market to increase.

145
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:03,608
But on the right side of the chart, we eventually collect the game's currency in lots of ways.

146
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,029
For example,

147
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:09,328
Players can improve their ability by purchasing and using items.

148
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:14,152
At the bottom of the chart, we monitor the game's trading behavior,

149
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:18,595
and each type of trading is represented by a specific module.

150
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:23,099
Finally, just by looking at the colors or the numbers on the chart,

151
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:28,683
our team members can make a general judgment about whether the money quantity is stable.

152
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:37,165
If someday we find that the amount of money produced on a given day is much larger than the amount collected,

153
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,605
we need to be alert. Is there something wrong?

154
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:48,708
At this point, we need a second virtualization tool, which is called the details of money.

155
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:53,429
It shows where each kind of currency came from and where it went.

156
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:56,750
Here, I use silver in the game as an example.

157
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:05,362
The table on the left shows how the game releases silver, such as playing dungeons or opening a gift box.

158
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:15,547
As you can see, more than 10 billion silver has been released this day, among which, GameplayA accounts for the highest proportion.

159
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:25,311
The table on the right shows how the game collects silver, such as players spending silver to upgrade skills, shopping in the silver mall, and so on.

160
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:31,343
And then we saw that about 9 billion silver was collected throughout the day.

161
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:37,605
The other 5 billion of over-sued silver goes into the stock at the top of the chart.

162
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:45,447
We can judge how much time we have to fix these problems based on the stock of silver at the top of the chart.

163
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:50,909
If we accidentally make a mistake and issue excessive silver,

164
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,369
we will do two things.

165
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,930
One, fix the source of the excessive silver.

166
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:59,618
to increase the short-term collection channels to rebalance the stock.

167
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:08,362
Then we will keep looking at the chart and if we just started a new activity or sold a new item to

168
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:15,144
collect the actual part, we can see the effect of the currency collection right here until the stock

169
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:24,028
at the top of the chart returns to a stable level. After talking about the issue and collection of

170
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:24,688
currencies,

171
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:29,805
There is a concept I have to mention, which is exchange rate.

172
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:36,889
As we said before, for MMO games in China, gold is acquired through paying and silver

173
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:42,493
is acquired through game playing, both of which can conduct transactions in a limited

174
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:42,753
way.

175
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:50,938
In time, games like World of Warcraft, gold is similar to the WW tokens you get when you

176
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:51,698
make payments.

177
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:59,708
And silver is similar to the gold coins that you can get in the game, and they can also be traded with each other.

178
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,011
As we all know, the price of WW tokens goes up and down.

179
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,914
This currency conversion, we call it the exchange rate.

180
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:21,520
If the exchange rate rises fast, the silver that the farmers earn in the game quickly becomes worthless, and the farmers will feel the price rising.

181
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:30,824
Therefore, we need to continuously monitor the changing price fluctuation and trade of gold and silver.

182
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:39,265
As we can see in the video, we have designed a gold-silver exchange rate chart much like the stock market,

183
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:43,406
including price trade and trade value trade.

184
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:51,907
The price trade chart in the upper half represents the exchange rate of one gold to silver.

185
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:57,883
The chart resembles many crosses of different sizes.

186
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:00,904
Red means the exchange rate is going up,

187
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:03,965
and green means the exchange rate is going down.

188
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:09,066
By the way, the color is the same as the Chinese stock market,

189
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:13,487
which means it is the opposite of the American stock market.

190
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:17,408
You know we are a Chinese company, and red means luck in China.

191
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:23,779
The color represents the medial difference between today's and yesterday's transactions.

192
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,961
The taller the color, the larger the price difference between these two days.

193
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:34,904
The vertical line represents the distribution of transaction price of the day.

194
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:39,347
The top represents the highest transaction price of the day,

195
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:43,449
and the bottom represents the lowest transaction price of the day.

196
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,891
If the line is long, there may exist some abnormal trading.

197
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:57,111
The trade chart below shows the value of transactions between two currencies on the day in a manner of bar charts.

198
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:05,637
Normally, there should be no sustained or significant fluctuations in the exchange rate.

199
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:10,800
But like the chart we show here, exchange rates have risen sharply.

200
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,184
We must thoroughly investigate every trade and TV ads from our website.

201
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:24,127
expectations to see if there is any manipulation of currency prices.

202
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:28,168
Let's see someone sells in bulk or buys in bulk.

203
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,409
Let's see what he does with it.

204
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:39,892
If someone buys a lot of free-flowing money, like silver, there are several possibilities.

205
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:44,533
One, this guy propels offline transactions with others.

206
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,992
He planned to buy expensive equipment such as real weapons.

207
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:57,357
3. Xu Yi tried to purchase key items in large quantities, maybe for monopolizing.

208
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:07,924
Therefore, we are monitoring the prices of key items to prevent them from rising and make players feel inflation.

209
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:15,048
Our game consumption index is made up of a series of key items.

210
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:23,720
Here we can see that red represents the average price of the items, green represents the transaction

211
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,542
price fluctuation, and the numbers show the sales volume.

212
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:33,624
Click on the small chart to see the details of daily transactions.

213
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:40,887
Thank god for the five items on this chart, their selling price chains are pretty stable.

214
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,928
If they have huge fluctuations,

215
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:47,620
we will adjust the production of these items.

216
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:54,166
The above monitoring focuses on the currency itself.

217
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,808
What about the process of person-to-person transactions?

218
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,410
This is also very important,

219
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:02,652
and we found a good way to do it.

220
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,935
To record the whole transaction process,

221
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,597
we designed a visualization system

222
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,379
for the transaction process to focus on the

223
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:14,285
several trades between different players.

224
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:23,892
As you can see in the video, we use this network to present people's trend network.

225
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:29,697
This network has two elements, circles and lines.

226
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:35,561
A circle represents a player, and the larger the circle, the greater the player's trading

227
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:35,962
value.

228
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:40,405
The lines represent transactions between players.

229
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:48,756
The arrows on the lines represent the flow of silver and the colors of the lines represent the amount of silver.

230
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:55,562
These deals are linked together to form a vast network of players' transactions.

231
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:08,713
We can look at the size of the circles to find people who are trading in large amounts who are likely to be more important people in the economical system.

232
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,565
No matter how carefully players disguise their every transaction,

233
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:18,847
as long as the players are involved in transactions of a large amount,

234
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,908
the charts still can help us identify them.

235
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,270
When we want to see a player's trade,

236
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,071
we can click the circle to display his trade records.

237
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:35,414
From this graph, we can determine what the currency circulation of each other is like,

238
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,115
and more importantly,

239
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:42,317
whether there exist any suspicious currencies colliding last year.

240
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:47,020
Let me share with you a case from our real work.

241
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:52,063
We have found that there is a flower-like trading relationship in the game.

242
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:58,547
According to that, the circles represent the players and the lines represent the trade.

243
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:06,092
The flower chart clearly shows that there was a strange trading relationship in the game at that time.

244
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:13,113
That is, one player and dozens of other players had frequent two-way trading behavior,

245
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:18,078
and this pattern was kind of outside the overall trading market.

246
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:26,785
Don't you think that is so weird? I mean, why a player want to find a bunch of players,

247
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:34,311
giving the money away and getting it back? We use this client to identify some players.

248
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:40,819
take advantage of some loopholes with the game design and make profits.

249
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,521
Soon we investigated that and managed to fix it.

250
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:54,486
In a word, we have introduced the economical system and inflation of China's MMO,

251
00:20:54,946 --> 00:21:00,728
as well as some cases and virtualization tools of monitoring and

252
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:10,765
Our original intention is through this talk to help Western game developers know how top

253
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:20,450
game developers in China design monetary economical systems, how to monitor key data and create

254
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,673
visualizations, and how to conduct array warnings and intervention.

255
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:29,815
Any developer who wants to process control

256
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:36,297
currency issues or considers to add player training into games, we believe this talk

257
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:45,106
will be very valuable. We have a lot of extraordinary experience in this area and we hope to have

258
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:49,810
the opportunity to share it with you. Thank you.
