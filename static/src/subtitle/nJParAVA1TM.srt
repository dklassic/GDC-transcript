00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:13,997
Hello everyone, my name is Michał Drozdowski and I'm a creative director at Elevenbit Studios.

2
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:18,118
And I'm Przemek Marszał, an art director at Elevenbit.

3
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:25,460
Yes, and we are together kind of responsible for the game development at Elevenbit Studios.

4
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:34,489
So we want to talk today about the lesson from Frostpunk and This War of Mine and ask ourselves a general question of why to make games.

5
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,831
And who is 11bit Studios?

6
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,796
We are a company from Poland that started about 10 years ago.

7
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:51,061
We started four person with Grzegorz Michalski, Bartek Brzostek, Przemek and me as partners.

8
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,623
Currently we are about 100 people.

9
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:02,064
Our two recent projects are Frostpunk and This War of Mine, and those are the games

10
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:02,927
that we will talk about.

11
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:10,486
So, we like to think that what we are doing is called meaningful games.

12
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:16,230
And with such a word, it's always a question, what do we mean by that?

13
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:17,691
What are meaningful games?

14
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:24,696
And I think there are a lot of ways to see what can be meaningful from different approach.

15
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:30,480
And we also in the studio have some different ideas about what we call meaningful games.

16
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,222
But let us first sum up.

17
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:37,003
And one thing that is important for us

18
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:42,404
is that we all are very emotional about games and about playing games.

19
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:47,405
And those emotions, especially those emotions that breed thoughts

20
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,046
is something that we want to have in our game,

21
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:54,486
which means that we would like to have emotions that are not shallow,

22
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:59,347
but that came up from mostly decisions and subjects that we touch.

23
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:01,068
And we also think that...

24
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:13,686
It would be great if games could communicate some values, some greater values, in the process of making them and through the message they send to the community.

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:24,119
We really look for fresh experiences and not only fresh ideas, but also things that could probably

26
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,866
expand the game language about, like for example making empathy games like this one of mine,

27
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,128
which is kind of...

28
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,352
not a mechanic, but something that is really important in the game.

29
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:41,194
And we tried to make those games with a kind of close-to-life message,

30
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:45,917
something which is insightful and something which is well-precised.

31
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,138
We could kind of put it in one sentence.

32
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,399
And if we look at the games that we made,

33
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,221
for this War of Mine we had like two messages.

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,802
It was at war, not everyone is a soldier,

35
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,684
and that war always happens at somebody's doorstep.

36
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:06,530
which actually means that we want to make a game about civilians.

37
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:13,340
With Frostpunk, that was society survival and the last city must survive, which also

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,768
kind of was meaning that we will make a game about society and the cost it pays for survival.

39
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,638
Okay, we will switch now for a few minutes.

40
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:32,160
So, why we made those games that Michal told you about?

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
We will start with This War of Mine.

42
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:39,222
Because, to be honest, this presentation forced on us

43
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,802
to question ourselves why we made these games.

44
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,243
So, why This War of Mine?

45
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:54,488
You know, when I recall from the beginning of my early career,

46
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:58,551
let's say it's career, or early days in game development,

47
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,895
it's probably for you the same. I just love to make games,

48
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:08,519
and we all love totally to make games, and we love it for the creativity,

49
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,403
and also to express ourselves, and to stand out.

50
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:20,566
But, and this love for games and also the innovation behind the games was behind,

51
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:27,152
also behind the vision why we created 11-bit studios. Because we wanted to express and we

52
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:31,956
wanted to innovate. At the time that we started working on this World of Mine,

53
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:40,578
We are after few games, we already finished I think Anomaly 2 or some other mobile games

54
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:47,364
and we, after Anomaly and Anomaly 2, we understood that we could deliver

55
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:55,469
something that is well packed, well thought out innovation.

56
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,090
It could do an innovative game.

57
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,772
And we started working on some other project.

58
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:01,713
It was called Shelter.

59
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,116
And after I think eight months of the development,

60
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,397
we are at the stage that.

61
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,569
okay, this is good gameplay, this is a good game,

62
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:14,030
but there is something lacking, you know?

63
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,591
And we just couldn't agree to this approach

64
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:24,072
that we will create mechanic gameplay-based game only.

65
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:30,954
And I think unconsciously set the bar higher for us

66
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:35,475
because we were looking for some other height for us.

67
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:40,417
And we just scrapped the project.

68
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:45,601
And we understood that we need emotions in our games.

69
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,723
We need to define an emotion in our games,

70
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,823
we find an emotions,

71
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,906
and find something that we would like to

72
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:54,768
and would love to talk about in those games.

73
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:06,983
And we scrapped the shelter and to be honest it was visually, it had almost the same camera,

74
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:11,286
it was also very cross-section, but it was a completely different game.

75
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:17,491
And we went back to the drawing boards and we asked all people in the team,

76
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,814
hey guys, let's think of this game, what we'd like to talk about.

77
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:32,825
And I think this is one of the moments in our development that we had luck, to be honest.

78
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:37,930
We had luck that we had such a wonderful team and that we are open-minded.

79
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:44,893
At this time, Greg, our CEO, once came to the company and he said,

80
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:53,595
guys, you know, I was reading this article about civilians in Sarajevo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

81
00:06:54,656 --> 00:07:03,298
and it was a really strong emotional piece. And he told us about it and he said, hey,

82
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,260
what do you think about it? And when he told it,

83
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:16,926
we immediately understood the huge importance of what we could do and what we could achieve

84
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:25,110
with this game. We understood that wow, before us there was a project that could change our lives

85
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,852
and it was, you know, instant revelation.

86
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,262
So we thought, okay, let's do this.

87
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,403
It's a huge and risky project.

88
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,664
To be honest, until the end of production,

89
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,685
until the day of the launch,

90
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,907
we didn't know how the people will react to this game.

91
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:46,269
It could be just, you know, cool, artistical piece,

92
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,211
and without any significance

93
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,793
to the game development as a whole.

94
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:54,254
But we went for it.

95
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:58,156
We knew the risk, but also we knew this importance.

96
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:03,078
And we had this message that Michał already told you,

97
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,819
that was easy to understand.

98
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,340
And overall, I think it had value.

99
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,801
It was huge value for us.

100
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:15,123
It was personal value, artistical value,

101
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,604
and emotional value.

102
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,225
And we saw this value for our next project.

103
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:25,148
So I think that was why we started working on this work of mine.

104
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,073
So, how we made it?

105
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,075
We'll just present you some ideas how we made it.

106
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:36,678
But I will start with some two basic concept that we follow

107
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,461
and the concept that we agree while we are doing games.

108
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,682
First of all, when you are doing something innovative,

109
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,563
when you are doing some new game,

110
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,005
in our case, meaningful game,

111
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:54,629
For us, it always touches completely new areas of game development.

112
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:59,772
So if you follow innovation, you must agree that it will be a constant R&D process.

113
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:10,338
From the start till the end, you will constantly, as I love to say, sail in unexplored oceans.

114
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:11,699
And you must agree to this.

115
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:17,871
And second concept that we also follow is,

116
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:23,133
we, you know, there are studios that make games,

117
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,496
okay, let's make the most beautiful game that we have,

118
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:32,438
or let's decide that gameplay is the most important part

119
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,319
of our game, or the art, or something different,

120
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,880
or the music.

121
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,001
For our studio, it's different.

122
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:44,746
Because we think for us, the mood, the experience is the key.

123
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:51,193
Mood as this bond between gameplay and art, and also music.

124
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,216
I haven't written it down here, but...

125
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,959
Everything must create a mood and experience.

126
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:01,262
And this is what we pursue when we create our first prototype.

127
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,985
We pursue from the early days of the development,

128
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:09,168
we pursue to find the mood in our games.

129
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:17,975
And what's funny is that when we have, let's say we are in the middle of the production,

130
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:26,879
we start to do our focus tests on the players, so our QA is inviting people to the studio

131
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,340
and we have those questions after the tests.

132
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:37,105
some, let's say, how would you like to value the graphics?

133
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,906
How would you like to value the mechanics?

134
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:41,369
And how would you like to value mood?

135
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,931
And tons of different questions.

136
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,433
For our games, when I recall,

137
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,254
it was for this, for mine and Frostpunk,

138
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:53,479
always the highest ranked question was the mood.

139
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,883
So I think we do it in the right direction.

140
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,624
Okay, so let's go and see a few things about the design that we did in this War of Mine.

141
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:19,547
And it's like Przemek said, when you start up on a subject like the war, you usually have some kind

142
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:25,670
of concept in your mind. You've seen some movie, you read some book, and it's good to kind of empty

143
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,373
your head and to make, you know, like the saying that you cannot fill a glass that is not empty,

144
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,553
you have to first empty the glass.

145
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:37,955
And we did research, and I think this is a very important part of the project.

146
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:43,518
The other thing that we'll talk about later will be the core kind of system of players' part and decision,

147
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:49,500
and I will show you also some kind of design consequences of some design choices that we made.

148
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:57,531
So it's pretty much obvious that you will better understand the reality of the game if you do some research.

149
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:04,253
But you will actually grab this mood that Przemek is talking about

150
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:11,636
and you will grab a lot of, really a lot of detail and nuances that you haven't been aware of before.

151
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:17,679
And I think that's very important, especially when I have new people coming to the project.

152
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:29,347
Usually they have some different approach to the game and they first have to kind of redo the research that we did, read some book, view some movie, to kind of get better understand what was the reality at this time.

153
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:33,491
And the other thing that you get...

154
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,886
is you get facts about the world.

155
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,567
And what's interesting is this,

156
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:42,930
that these facts actually define a lot of situation

157
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,190
that you will have in the game.

158
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,672
So if, for example, we have snipers

159
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,313
that operate during the daytime

160
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,054
and constant shelling that is also operating

161
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:51,915
during the daytime,

162
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,816
we know that civilians will be active at night

163
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:55,656
and during the night,

164
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,798
and it actually goes to the design

165
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:00,559
of having people staying during the day at home.

166
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,141
getting active at night out of their home. And another, if you have no tap water, you have no

167
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:14,382
electricity, then you have to get water and kind of, I don't know, create some, I mean, cook some

168
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:19,503
food without electricity. So it goes immediately to some kind of, okay, so I need some parts to

169
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:28,425
scavenge to kind of get like a water collector or maybe create a stove for burning wood and

170
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,706
burning books. So these facts...

171
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:37,767
are not only facts that kind of go into narrative, but they go pretty much into the design.

172
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:45,352
And another thing that we kind of observed when we were doing research is that basically this war

173
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:52,956
is not one constant narrative event that has a beginning and an end, but it's a situation that is

174
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,438
made up of stories.

175
00:13:56,318 --> 00:14:02,980
who affect certain people, like a story of a mother who lost a child, or a story of two

176
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,222
grandparents that they don't know what to do during the war time. So the research kind

177
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:15,684
of had impact on how we have structured the narrative in the game, so making it like a

178
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:21,685
puzzle built up, many, many, many stories put together in one picture of the war.

179
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:30,913
And if we go down and if we look at the core of the gameplay, we get to a situation where

180
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:34,657
we're talking about the player path and the decision that it's making.

181
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:40,945
And one thing we learned about the war is that it kind of affects very much

182
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,251
ourselves and change us and

183
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:50,934
the question is really how much of what we believe we are. Are we going to keep and

184
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,675
protect during this hard time?

185
00:14:54,236 --> 00:15:00,839
So for us it was really important that the player is free to choose his own path and that this path will kind of lead him

186
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,580
from kind of being a villain or being a hero,

187
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,662
doing something great or maybe something very bad.

188
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:15,084
So this was achieved of course through decision-making, but another important thing in this decision-making,

189
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,686
in this world of mine, was that he must face the consequences.

190
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:26,408
So he's able to do whatever he wants, but he must know what was the consequences of his act.

191
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:35,771
And either he can see it, or he can be informed, or he can be kind of informed by the people from the shelter.

192
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:40,740
Because we wanted not to judge the player by the decision,

193
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,601
but we wanted to create a moral world

194
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:47,104
that will kind of feedback him about what he's thinking

195
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:48,645
about his decision making.

196
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,926
And this was very important to get this look,

197
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:53,908
okay, choose your own path, make your own decision,

198
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,309
but kind of face the consequences

199
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,312
and see how the world react to your actions.

200
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:03,614
And most of these.

201
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:09,021
feedback was actually made through kind of questions like

202
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:11,462
Should we have been doing this?

203
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:16,845
or grandpa, why do other people why do people kill each other and

204
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:19,226
What we wanted to achieve we wanted

205
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:26,570
To achieve some kind of interaction with the player when we will ask him questions that he will have to answer himself

206
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:33,073
In his head and kind of think of what he's doing kind of think of where does those action leads him?

207
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:41,368
And for the last, I would like to show you how some initial guidelines affected some

208
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:46,210
design rules, because I think it's also interesting that usually when we try to define a subject,

209
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,372
we are writing a sequence of words or short sentences, and then those things translate

210
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:52,332
into game design.

211
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:57,754
And for example, when we defined that this will be a game about civilians, we were thinking,

212
00:16:57,854 --> 00:17:00,654
OK, it will be a game about people like us, normal people.

213
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,075
And what does that mean in terms of game design?

214
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,339
We actually had no level ups.

215
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,781
We played the game and it was really luring to kind of, you know, improve your skill in

216
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:16,202
some place, but we throw it away because this is not what's happening in real life.

217
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:23,824
And we also were very lured by having some kind of RPG-like inventory, so we had like

218
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:29,146
initially a few slots for the item that you can take from the Savage to your shelter.

219
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:34,850
and then you could have a helmet or you could have a kevlar vest or you could have some picklocks

220
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:39,634
and it was very tempting to make separate slots for these items

221
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:43,337
but we said no, we don't have separate slots like that

222
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:47,020
and if you're wearing a kevlar vest it's probably heavy enough

223
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,922
and you can't bring that much stuff from the scavenge.

224
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,811
Also the personality of the people.

225
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:53,751
They have skills.

226
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,652
Some skills are very useful, like someone is quick

227
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,593
or someone is quite strong,

228
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,534
but there are also useless skills, like I'm good at maths.

229
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:04,536
I mean, what does it give me if I'm good at design

230
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:05,316
and more happens?

231
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:06,317
Nothing.

232
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:15,163
We have of course personal belief and psychological traits of the character, so not everybody

233
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:15,844
is an angel.

234
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:21,169
There are people who are egoistic, there are people who are altruistic, and they all kind

235
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,652
of give you feedback depending on the individual nature.

236
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:30,137
We have people able to suffer trauma like the post-traumatic war syndrome.

237
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:36,298
in the game and for example another kind of design decision that was to be made

238
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:40,539
based on the fact that there are people like us is that it's very easy to be

239
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:44,800
killed in the game and it's very easy to kill and the combat is rather kind of

240
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,602
chaotic. Sometimes you don't know when the bullet hits you and this is also kind of

241
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:52,722
the reality what we are showing.

242
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,614
And the same goes for level design.

243
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,296
If you are at war and you enter somebody's house,

244
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:00,857
you're basically an intruder.

245
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:03,599
You're not somebody who came to do a quest,

246
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,880
so there are no quests in the game.

247
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,563
You won't have people standing at the door and saying,

248
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:09,864
oh, OK, great that you came.

249
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,124
There are soldiers in the back.

250
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,926
Please, you know, get rid of them.

251
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,067
And there is also no treasure sometimes.

252
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,989
There is a scene when we have a woman who

253
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,591
is bullied by the soldier, and we can help them.

254
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:20,791
But.

255
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:25,495
If we help them, she runs away, she doesn't give us a diamond for doing that.

256
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,558
So we also opted not to design walk-arounds in the game,

257
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:38,344
so you cannot kind of satisfy both sides or do things without suffering some kind of cost.

258
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:46,430
But we also chose, for example, not to have gore and violence as a way to build emotion,

259
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:47,771
because we thought that...

260
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:52,295
It's not the proper way to actually do that.

261
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:55,558
It's more important to kind of have the feeling of grief,

262
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:58,921
of the feeling of loss, of being helpless in a situation,

263
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:05,427
instead of having pictures of scenes of war that we sometimes see in the movie,

264
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,030
with really strong emotional impact.

265
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,313
But a bit shallow in the term of game design.

266
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:25,367
And finally, death is a valiant ending to this game. It's both the death of the people who are in your shelter as finishing the game by failing.

267
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:33,447
A lot of these things seem kind of contradictory to some design rules or things that we are

268
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,347
used to making games.

269
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:37,628
And the question is, why all of that?

270
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,208
Why we did that?

271
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:46,050
And the answer, in my opinion, is we did that because we wanted to allow the player to have

272
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:52,953
an experience of war as a civilian instead of giving them the opportunity to just win

273
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:53,313
the game.

274
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:59,028
Reading a good book with a moment of failure is also a great experience,

275
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,895
and we try to kind of mimic that in this work of mine.

276
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:18,537
So this experience, we also tried to create it via art of the game.

277
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:31,400
So again a mood that I told you, so this bound, so everything art had to do was to amplify everything.

278
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,760
We also wanted to have a distinctive character of the game.

279
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:40,249
have this message around the game and do it.

280
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,511
So find the ways to do it for the small team

281
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:45,113
that we were right back then.

282
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:52,399
So first of all, when we wanted to create a style

283
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,401
for the game, we wanted, you know,

284
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,623
that's what I told you just a second ago.

285
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:01,106
We wanted to amplify, we wanted to emphasize

286
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,908
this situation the game was about,

287
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:04,889
about the civilians.

288
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:18,704
So we selected the colors, selected the palette of the game and we amplified the hopelessness,

289
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:23,208
we amplified the serious situation you are then back there.

290
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:36,135
Also, we wanted to create this, let's say, I sometimes call it drone reality, this situation

291
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:41,438
when there is this look that is not...

292
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:45,083
Realistical and not drawn.

293
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:52,347
It is like we call it, like so we like to call it a novel.

294
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,909
A novel look, just like reading a book.

295
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:58,911
We were trying to push this approach of something to drawn,

296
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:02,954
redrawn and drawn like a stories in this game.

297
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:09,400
Also, we selected this view for the game to show the whole community.

298
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,344
We wanted the player to not focus on the specific one character in the game.

299
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:21,872
We wanted the player to see the whole community, the small community,

300
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:26,256
and think of them as a whole and not to focus on one single person.

301
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:33,319
So we had also inspiration for it, like what you see here is from Take On Me,

302
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,401
or you can saw it in Dire Straits music videos.

303
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:41,522
As you can see, it's also real and not real.

304
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:47,685
We were trying to find this middle point with our art style.

305
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:55,230
We also looked at how we can have this harsh look of the game, this contrasting harsh look of the game.

306
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,114
One of the inspirations was what was Banksy doing, what he is right now doing with all the colors,

307
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:11,000
so strong black and white and some small touch of color, some kind of mood creating approach that is, as I said, harsh.

308
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:25,170
Also, we had a huge amount of research and we also used a lot of graffiti to communicate with the player.

309
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:28,892
Because, you know, words are easy to understand.

310
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,606
So, the style was one thing, but the true approach was, I think, even most important for us.

311
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:44,571
Maybe it is not understandable by the player, but it was very important for us as a developer.

312
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:51,217
Only this way we could really feel that, yes, we did it the right way.

313
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:55,000
So, starting with the beginning.

314
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:07,904
You know, first of all we thought of, okay, so we have the game about the civilians, and as Michał said, it's, we can, war always happens at somebody's doorstep, so it can happen right now.

315
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:10,985
We could happen just right, we are here.

316
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:22,408
So, what we did, we scanned ourselves, our friends, the people we knew, and we just scanned it, dirty low-poly, we did dirty low-poly scan with Kinect.

317
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:27,809
And just as we were standing, we put ourselves into the game.

318
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,810
Of course, we just added some backpacks

319
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,931
to make it all feel real with the scavenging.

320
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,433
But we scanned ourselves just like we were standing there.

321
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:43,614
So it was true for us, OK, this is a game about civilians.

322
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:44,434
It can be about us.

323
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:49,737
We also photographed ourselves the way that we were standing.

324
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:50,077
We...

325
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,859
You know, we...

326
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:56,040
One day we were shooting,

327
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,401
when we were taking photos for the game,

328
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,922
we just asked people in the studio

329
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:02,903
and some other people,

330
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,224
hey, could you just stand behind this wall

331
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,085
and open your eyes and close your eyes?

332
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:11,769
And that was it. We did it instantly, without any make-up.

333
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,931
It was just as we were standing.

334
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:20,216
So there were no preparations, no, as I said, make-up, no direction.

335
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:24,720
We just, hey, stand, close your eyes, open your eyes, and that's it.

336
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:30,205
It was just like in natural, real world, just like now.

337
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:38,590
And as you can see, we've chosen different people.

338
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,351
The people we knew, our security guard at the office,

339
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,393
our accountant is also in the game, the designer.

340
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:49,974
Because at war, there are random people and random stories,

341
00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:52,475
random deaths, and random tragedies.

342
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:59,887
And at the end I think we delivered the message, the civilians at war.

343
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:07,130
And to be honest I'm really happy that we did this game, and I'm also happy to this

344
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,312
stage that I don't think I would change anything in this world of mine.

345
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:18,795
I'm not saying it's perfect, but this simplicity and this message is, I think, should be untouched

346
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:19,355
right now.

347
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,197
Okay, so let's move to Frostpunk.

348
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:23,337
So

349
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,593
Why did we make Frostpunk?

350
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:34,174
At the moment that we were working on this War of Mine,

351
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:37,655
we still haven't finished this War of Mine,

352
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,016
and our second team already started working on our next game.

353
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:48,237
And the history repeated itself, because we were doing something called Industrial,

354
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:49,817
Michał will tell you more about it.

355
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:55,900
At the end, the story is short, this game sucked.

356
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,642
But it sucked because we were tired.

357
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:02,703
After this War of Mine we were very mentally tired.

358
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:12,588
We didn't want to do this hard, mentally tired game about so strong emotions, about the stories,

359
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:13,588
about the strategy.

360
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:16,189
We didn't want to do a next game about it.

361
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:20,947
So we thought, hey, maybe we will do something gamers, some gamers game.

362
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,072
with a cool idea, cool gameplay.

363
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,254
But you know, at the end it just sucked.

364
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:27,555
And we...

365
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,918
I think it was a very important moment for Eleven Bit Studios, because this was

366
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,460
the moment that we realized,

367
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,182
hey, from now on

368
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:38,704
we will do meaningful games.

369
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:42,567
This was the moment that changed the company, changed Eleven Bit Studios.

370
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:43,948
We understood that,

371
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:46,510
hey, we can't do another game

372
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,573
without having this message inside.

373
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:50,393
Because...

374
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:59,296
It just isn't our DNA and we should, for any other new project, we should purse for this message

375
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:05,077
and purse for this meaningfulness, so have this goal of telling something to the players

376
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:08,718
and having this value. I was already talking to you.

377
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:14,739
So we found the game and we found the message. It was about society's survival.

378
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,400
And it was set in mood so perfectly, you will see it soon.

379
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:29,549
Of course, this game was also really well tailored for the studio as the studio was back then,

380
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:36,415
because we weren't also that huge. I think that the dev team was about 20 to 30 people back then,

381
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:43,222
and we knew that we should pick a project that will learn us a lot, that will scale us,

382
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,644
but also we will be able to deliver it.

383
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:51,532
The games also had some cool things about being very understandable.

384
00:29:52,193 --> 00:30:01,100
And the last thing is, I think it's also why we decided to make this game even bigger,

385
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,263
is that we really learned a lot on this World of Mine.

386
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:10,988
And our marketing was really getting so strong that we believed we will deliver the message.

387
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,416
putting much more money into the production and making this game even better.

388
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,082
We knew that, hey, we have the message, we have the great team,

389
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:27,328
the whole team was really, really great, and we have the great marketing,

390
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,310
so we will communicate everything to the player.

391
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:35,985
Okay, so how Frostpunk?

392
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:42,210
And again, after the kind of failure with Injustice 3,

393
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,774
we went back to the drawing board and we focused on the mood,

394
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:49,636
on what this game will be about.

395
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,772
And as Przemek said, it's a bond between gameplay and art for us.

396
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,495
You can have a screenshot of Frostpunk.

397
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:03,318
It's, for those of you who don't know, this is a kind of a sim game

398
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,862
in a survival environment of very frost and cold winter.

399
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,703
It's practically the last city on earth.

400
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:13,506
But the game is actually not only about surviving economically,

401
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:19,071
but mostly about how you will shape the society and how the society will survive.

402
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:22,618
So kind of getting a bit back.

403
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,852
To redefine the game, we had to scrap the first prototype.

404
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,212
This was a very good decision.

405
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:33,333
But what were we looking for and what did we actually find?

406
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:35,793
We were looking for strong emotion.

407
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,674
We couldn't find that in our previous prototype.

408
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:43,375
A very big sense of involvement in gameplay and a sense of purpose.

409
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:46,515
Something that would make us want to play this game more and more.

410
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,436
And we were looking for a meaningful subject to talk.

411
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:56,759
And we kind of had a brainstorm in the company, a lot of concept, but what we kind of defined is

412
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,802
we have an extreme winter, we have the last city, we have tough people and we have survival and

413
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:09,565
adaptation. And this is basically what answers the strong emotion and sense of involvement.

414
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:16,028
And on the other hand, we have the society, we have its adaptation again, we have the decision

415
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,229
that we will make with consequences.

416
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:26,171
the way we will shape it. But the very end question is, okay, so how much we will sacrifice

417
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:32,493
to survive with this society? And again, we have strong emotional and a meaningful subject.

418
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:38,154
So that was basically the kind of redesign of the game that we made at the first stage.

419
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:43,713
Okay, there were just some more few steps to find out.

420
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,895
The problem is we were a small studio

421
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:49,697
and we couldn't go for many prototype at the same time.

422
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:53,078
So we had to kind of map all the system in the game,

423
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,939
like the society, economy,

424
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,521
but also the decision-making process,

425
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,602
the temperature level, et cetera,

426
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:02,443
and start building WhiteBand 1.

427
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:06,766
And we go for some very first prototype of Frostpunk.

428
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,828
which was played on this kind of cards.

429
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,589
D1 is, for example, house one.

430
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:18,494
So, shaping the society is basically all Frostpunk is about.

431
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:19,895
And what does it mean, shaping?

432
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:22,196
Shaping means kind of changing,

433
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:26,619
giving it some different characteristic that it has initially.

434
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,463
And it's back to this key question of how much are we willing to survive,

435
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:36,006
or maybe if surviving at all costs is really worth it.

436
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:44,966
And there are a few things I will talk, it's just a bit of the whole design and the whole

437
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:50,134
mechanics that's in the game with regards to society, but I think these are the most

438
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:51,095
important concepts.

439
00:33:52,297 --> 00:34:00,485
Hence, let's look at the trees. The trees of adaptation, the tree of hope, the tree of faith, and the tree of order.

440
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:09,513
And what you can see over here is a tree of order. It's basically some kind like a skill tree or decision tree that you make.

441
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:12,256
You kind of sign off orders.

442
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:15,378
and that will become laws in your city.

443
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:20,221
And it's built around a kind of progression,

444
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:23,784
that the most basic law that you undertake,

445
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:27,867
they are pretty much in both systems very positive stuff.

446
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:31,950
If you go with order, you start giving protection,

447
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,031
you start making...

448
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:38,054
some kind of morning gathering to inform the people and get better organized.

449
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:41,076
If you start with faith you have chapels, you have

450
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:44,058
all kind of prayers and

451
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,361
these are good, this is the beginning of making the system and these are all

452
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:48,922
positive.

453
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:51,023
And then when you go a bit up

454
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:54,264
you're kind of in the middle of the tree.

455
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:59,168
You have things that doesn't look so bad.

456
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,650
Sometimes the name may be scary, like, I don't know,

457
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,330
fake guards.

458
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:07,693
But on the other hand, we have guards at the shopping mall.

459
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,634
They are not scary.

460
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,436
And you have things like prisons,

461
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:13,957
which are pretty much OK.

462
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,278
We all have prisons right now.

463
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,379
And this is kind of a middle ground.

464
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:24,273
The decision is not yet very bad in terms of influencing the society,

465
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:29,115
but it's kind of up to you how you will use it later in the game.

466
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:35,698
And when we go even further, we start getting things like propaganda certain,

467
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:41,000
like a pledge of loyalty or a forceful persuasion.

468
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,481
So this tree is kind of going the dark side.

469
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,892
from the light part to the dark part.

470
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,175
And it's up to you.

471
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:54,277
I mean, this is a bit counterintuitive

472
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:56,619
because in games usually when you have a skill tree,

473
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,521
at the very end, you receive a big prize.

474
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,723
It's not like that in Frostpunk.

475
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:06,266
At the end of the tree, you receive a very strong tool

476
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:07,907
to influence the society,

477
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:12,171
but it's actually something really, really nasty.

478
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:12,871
And...

479
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:20,957
We're coming to a statement that actually in Frostpunk, not signing a law that pushes the system further

480
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:30,064
is quite a valid decision to be made. It's quite valid to stop at the level that you feel comfortable with and try not to go further.

481
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:38,916
So it's not matters only what law you sign, but it also matters whether how you use them,

482
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:41,057
if you use them or if you abuse them.

483
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:46,880
And this is kind of a mechanic that we introduced that, for example, if you have guards, you

484
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,103
can start dispersing the crow each time the people protest.

485
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:55,405
But doing that means that your guards will feel kind of...

486
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:03,437
allowed to perform the peaceful operation on their own behalf.

487
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:09,724
So we kind of during the game measure how you are using the abilities.

488
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:17,534
the shaping of the society actually happened at the moment when

489
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:22,118
the law you have introduced, the concept that you have introduced in your society

490
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:25,061
starts to kind of live their own life

491
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:27,163
and it all begins by kind of

492
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:31,487
creating some kind of split in the society

493
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:34,630
so for example on the screen you have a woman who was assaulted

494
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:40,494
It's after the signing of a law, the Pledge of Loyalty, and it's a woman that has been

495
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:44,476
assaulted by her neighbor who accused her of informing on him.

496
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,418
But she hasn't signed the Pledge of Loyalty, so she is not guilty.

497
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:53,881
But the trick is that the society is already split into two different sides.

498
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,244
Those who like the kind of law and those who don't like.

499
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,186
And this goes further and further until...

500
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:10,249
people's, the society start to shape, to get a shape that you kind of might not accept or not be comfortable with.

501
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:22,614
And what I wanted to talk more also is that we try to, by addressing all this hard subject, we try to be conscious about the message and we try to kind of

502
00:38:24,129 --> 00:38:28,692
being very careful about how we're shaping the communication, what we are saying.

503
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,856
And there were months of polishing the message during the company. But there were also these

504
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:40,501
questions of hard subjects like, should we talk about cannibalism? This is something very nasty.

505
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:43,078
But on the other hand, it happens.

506
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:45,179
It happens, for example, during wartime,

507
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,840
during long siege of the city in winter

508
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:49,942
when soldiers start eating horses,

509
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:51,302
then they start eating rats.

510
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:52,643
And then maybe at some times,

511
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,884
somebody eats some other people.

512
00:38:56,972 --> 00:39:06,980
The question was not how not to talk, if not to talk, or sweep it under the carpet, but how to talk about them, how to make this similar to real life.

513
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,843
And for example, as it goes for cannibalism, it kind of made it...

514
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:17,250
a kind of event that happened in a situation where the people are really starving for a long time

515
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:23,076
and they really kind of forced to do so and this is a small event that you can actually close your

516
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:27,922
eyes and say okay I didn't see that or you can protest and say no that won't happen in my city.

517
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:32,884
And because Frostpunk is also a game that kind of touched all those subjects,

518
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:38,647
it's still a dystopian game of kind of a fictional reality,

519
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:43,450
but we felt compelled to kind of make an end quote and kind of sum it up.

520
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,072
And if the player kind of crossed the line, Kavdor,

521
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:53,417
gone too far with shaping the society

522
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:56,979
and paid a too high price for the survival,

523
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:58,620
we wanted to stress that out.

524
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,922
We wanted to say, hey guy, you crossed the line.

525
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:02,363
That's a bit too far.

526
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:05,945
But this is also a moment when we think that many people

527
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:07,967
may kind of ask themselves a question,

528
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:09,908
why, why do you say that?

529
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:11,709
Why, did I really?

530
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,511
And they start to kind of remember and find out

531
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,912
if they did or they did not.

532
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:24,198
So.

533
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:34,414
Again, we have this, the art, the art, art section in a game as it is so important here for us.

534
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:38,015
So, how we approach it?

535
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:50,538
We, first of all, we looked at our game, we thought about our game and we created a list of adjectives.

536
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:53,635
What is it for?

537
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:55,436
This is our...

538
00:40:56,297 --> 00:40:59,138
This was the situation we were thinking about this way.

539
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:04,422
Okay, so let's say this hypothetical situation.

540
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:09,800
what we would like our gamer to say

541
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,782
when he sees our screen of our game.

542
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:17,525
And we wanted to imagine, okay,

543
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:20,767
what we want him to see in our game

544
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:26,431
and then what we wanted for this player

545
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:27,772
to tell us about this game.

546
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:29,293
And those were the adjectives.

547
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,215
So what I'm seeing, I'm seeing cold.

548
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:33,096
I'm seeing city.

549
00:41:34,348 --> 00:41:37,930
I'm seeing serious game and so on and so on.

550
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,752
So we've listed the things that we wanted at the end

551
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:45,314
to have on the screen, on each screen of our game,

552
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,834
we wanted to see this.

553
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,875
Maybe not on each, but as a whole,

554
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:53,377
we wanted this player to see those keywords.

555
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:54,918
We call them adjectives.

556
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:59,805
We also had some kind of product guidelines and stuff like this.

557
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:07,953
So we had this bible of how we would like the player to receive the visuals of the game.

558
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:13,318
So the second thing is, OK, we wanted to understand what does the code mean.

559
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:18,663
For the whole time we were researching it and stuff like this.

560
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:27,431
During the production it wasn't made on purpose, but it just told us a lot about the situation.

561
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:30,794
So we understood what cold is about.

562
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,478
I personally like hiking, I like hiking in winter,

563
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:42,545
and during the production we've also been to the rather high mountain in Poland.

564
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,450
And there were really, really nasty temperatures then.

565
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,931
And the cold was so terrifying.

566
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:56,052
And it was such... it was the situation you...

567
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,713
You couldn't do much with it.

568
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:01,654
And it was so overwhelming around you.

569
00:43:01,674 --> 00:43:03,635
We had frostbites and stuff like this.

570
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:05,956
And when we then came to the studio, we said...

571
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:12,919
oh wow, we really again are doing a really serious game.

572
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,101
And this cold, you know, you can imagine what cold is.

573
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,983
So it's also a plus for a game to be easily imaginable.

574
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:25,365
So then we thought.

575
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:31,326
Okay, from the visual standpoint, how we would like this game to be, what is also important

576
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:37,251
for us, we wanted to have this distinctive look for our game, and wanted to have this

577
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:43,636
look for the whole time, and wanted this player to remember Frostpunk is this game, and wanted

578
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:50,162
to have the situation when he sees the screen, this player says, wow, this is Frostpunk.

579
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:57,503
So, as you saw, Michael already showed you the paper prototype.

580
00:43:58,444 --> 00:43:59,584
Then we've made concepts.

581
00:44:00,824 --> 00:44:03,705
Then it was our first playable prototype.

582
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,985
As you can see, it's very different from where the game ended.

583
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:12,566
But still, the whole as a key art element was there.

584
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:16,307
And in the center we had this generator.

585
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:19,448
That's how it finished.

586
00:44:19,688 --> 00:44:21,248
We have again, we have the hole,

587
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:22,849
we have the center of the generator,

588
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,810
we have this radial system and stuff like this.

589
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,011
So we have this key art and key look for the game.

590
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:31,972
We have this objectives.

591
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:35,733
We knew what we would like to feel at the end,

592
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,873
how what we'd like, what the player would like to feel

593
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:39,374
at the end when he sees the game.

594
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:43,875
And then we have this problem.

595
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:49,274
Okay, we aren't that huge and we won't be able to do everything with this game.

596
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:58,126
We won't be able to have this option to, for example, zoom the camera totally close and

597
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,489
see all the people walking around in Frostpunk.

598
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,051
So we had to decide.

599
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:02,612
We had to have...

600
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:06,715
create conscious decisions of how we'd like to split the game

601
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:08,756
and how we'd like to approach the game.

602
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:13,319
And on each of these approaches, on these three layers,

603
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,060
we wanted to have the purpose.

604
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,202
So first view was the city view of the game.

605
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:21,523
And as you can see, it was for the building,

606
00:45:21,743 --> 00:45:23,624
management, and world changes.

607
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,372
And how we realize it?

608
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:29,015
We wanted the player to see cold,

609
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:31,798
steampunk wanted to see city,

610
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:35,622
and wanted to have this, see our unique art system.

611
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:40,828
So as you can see, the camera is set in the certain point,

612
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:44,111
we never go back to, come too close

613
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:46,374
to the characters in the game.

614
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,398
We have the city, it's a city builder game.

615
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:53,084
You can manage this, you can operate on this.

616
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,906
You can see the city changing.

617
00:45:55,808 --> 00:45:57,190
You can see the architecture.

618
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:02,778
So this layer of the art was for the city.

619
00:46:04,048 --> 00:46:08,370
The second layer was for talking about the society and its problems.

620
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,853
And this is the layer that we decide, okay, this is the layer where we will show people, the real people,

621
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:16,834
but we will approach it...

622
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:22,976
this way so it won't be so heavy in production.

623
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:26,297
So we find out the style for it,

624
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,299
we realize we won't be able to do it in real time

625
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,441
and we focus on showing the emotions of the people,

626
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:41,003
on showing the situations the game has for you, ready for you.

627
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:46,681
And the third layer was a map layer.

628
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:49,903
And it was, we want to have this feeling

629
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,905
that this game is not just this small hole,

630
00:46:53,486 --> 00:46:55,447
but there is a whole world around it.

631
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:59,610
And there is this epic world you can also explore.

632
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,592
And it was for this, and this world was for you

633
00:47:03,672 --> 00:47:07,335
to have a bigger breath and to rest a bit,

634
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,756
go out and rest a bit.

635
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:18,642
And we found the look for it, the way we could emphasize the cold and also the scale.

636
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,786
So, I think we also delivered the message.

637
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:28,989
And I think this game, of course you can tell if we did it well,

638
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:37,315
but I think at the end we have the society survival game from the design and the gameplay standpoint,

639
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:39,216
and also from the art standpoint.

640
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:47,144
So, you already know why we made those games and how we made those games, but I would like

641
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:55,106
to tell you a bit more and just to give you some, let's say maybe influence on you and

642
00:47:55,246 --> 00:48:04,588
tell you some another idea behind my personal idea on how can you approach your own whys

643
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:05,828
and why to make games.

644
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,508
So, there are many whys.

645
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:12,169
You can approach the games from totally different perspectives.

646
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,690
You can make the games for your own joy.

647
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,532
You can make games to talk about real life, for fresh experiences.

648
00:48:20,572 --> 00:48:21,952
They're all whys.

649
00:48:23,052 --> 00:48:30,415
But I would like to only tell you about one why that I'm finding very, very close to me

650
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:30,935
right now.

651
00:48:31,435 --> 00:48:34,996
And it's an idea of responsible development.

652
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:37,468
So, where do I start?

653
00:48:38,328 --> 00:48:43,432
We, you all know that we are, we aren't IT, we are an entertainment.

654
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:49,776
So, if you are an entertainment, we have movies, we have books and we have games.

655
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:52,417
And all of this...

656
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,429
fight for one time.

657
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:59,511
Because this user won't be able to stretch the time.

658
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:02,912
So when he decides that he wants to have a love story,

659
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:06,453
this player will decide if he will pick the book

660
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:09,595
or if he will pick the video or movie

661
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:12,676
or he will ultimately pick the game.

662
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:22,045
And it's not only my observation, because you may have seen it, but like Nintendo of America said recently,

663
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:27,347
I compete for time, not against Xbox or PlayStation.

664
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:34,430
So, you know, the huge players understand, we aren't competing for something,

665
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,452
we are just competing for this time, and we need to have the value in what we give.

666
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,594
So, if you look at this this way...

667
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:52,853
Games, I think, would explore at the end all genres, all values, all experiences to feel

668
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:54,395
different users' times.

669
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:59,841
And if we look at these games, movies, and books...

670
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:03,609
you know, look at, okay, let's deliver our genres,

671
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:06,091
values, and experiences, we can go further.

672
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,032
And okay, so say, maybe in the future,

673
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,273
games might be new books.

674
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:14,335
So you could pick the genre, pick a love story,

675
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:20,078
pick a drama, pick a strategy, and read it, so play it.

676
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:26,102
And if we emphasize the value in this statement,

677
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:27,883
we can go even further.

678
00:50:29,097 --> 00:50:31,638
we can say that games might be new school readings.

679
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,179
And not only school readings for the students,

680
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,441
that's what's already happening,

681
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:42,282
but it could also be in elementary schools.

682
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:45,223
We have those Adventures of Hagen-Bellerfin,

683
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:50,245
Analects, Lord of the Rings, a lot of school readings.

684
00:50:50,845 --> 00:50:53,406
What if in the future, gone home,

685
00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:01,255
will be played on lessons and we will discuss about love and acceptance.

686
00:51:02,236 --> 00:51:09,022
One of the last of us will be at your elementary school and it will learn something.

687
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:11,784
I'm not saying it's right now.

688
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:16,288
What I wanted to say is I would like to ask you one thing.

689
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,452
You know, I'm father of three boys.

690
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:23,434
And at this stage I'm asking myself.

691
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,647
What my kids will learn from my games?

692
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:31,208
Will it be meaningful?

693
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:33,548
Will there be a part of the value?

694
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,430
Would I like my kids to play my own games?

695
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:40,817
This is a question for you.

696
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:44,860
Would you like your kids to play your games?

697
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,341
Will there be a value?

698
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:53,244
This is one of my personal whys, why I think about new games.

699
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:57,687
I would like my kids to play games I create.

700
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:00,829
But you know, this is my approach.

701
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,751
I think you should all think of why.

702
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:07,412
Where is the value in what you are creating

703
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,612
and why there is a value for you?

704
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:10,772
Is it for fun?

705
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:11,713
Great.

706
00:52:11,913 --> 00:52:13,433
Is it for your love for making games?

707
00:52:14,153 --> 00:52:14,893
That's awesome.

708
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:19,014
But at the end, think of the huge audience

709
00:52:19,214 --> 00:52:21,755
that's behind the games, the whole games,

710
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,395
the whole world is playing.

711
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:25,776
All people around the world is playing.

712
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:30,537
So there is a huge responsibility in games

713
00:52:30,577 --> 00:52:32,037
that you all are creating.

714
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:37,780
And make your own mark. Thank you very much.

715
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:03,083
Good.

716
00:53:04,024 --> 00:53:05,165
All right, thanks for the talk.

717
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:05,986
It was great.

718
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:12,072
How much do you guys consider replayability when you're making your games, considering

719
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:14,614
how you have placed your values and such?

720
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:20,484
OK, good question.

721
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:25,288
We do consider it, but we're not making a priority.

722
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:29,151
We think if we go, for example, with Frostpunk, then

723
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:32,313
the replayability lies basically in kind of

724
00:53:33,054 --> 00:53:34,255
different scenarios.

725
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:39,820
You have a different path of choice, like order of fate.

726
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:43,263
And we also supplied endless mode.

727
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:45,805
Cool, thanks.

728
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,534
Hello, thank you for the talk.

729
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:54,179
When you guys were talking about the researching part

730
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,021
to really get the mood of the game,

731
00:53:56,041 --> 00:54:02,308
I was wondering how many researches of the current war

732
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:04,351
do you have to do to really get the mood?

733
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:05,612
What was the threshold?

734
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:09,096
Yeah, sure. It was basically all the designers.

735
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:14,162
We kind of make a collection of books that we want to kind of read of

736
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:16,304
things in YouTube that we want to watch

737
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:18,407
of

738
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:23,212
interview that we want to kind of do and we were like splitting

739
00:54:24,213 --> 00:54:26,216
between all the designers in the team

740
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:32,780
and kind of getting back with notes and comparing them and trying to get the whole perspective,

741
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,382
trying to get out the essence of our findings together.

742
00:54:37,022 --> 00:54:40,184
So the designers got together and they all kind of agreed,

743
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,566
okay, this is the mood and everybody kind of agreed direction, or is it?

744
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:50,630
I think with this wall of mine, yes, it was exactly the case.

745
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:57,771
We achieved this mostly through discussing between ourselves.

746
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,911
But there were also situations when, for example...

747
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:07,032
I mean, the designers have definitely different personalities.

748
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:11,273
And we had some designers which were kind of very gentle

749
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:15,174
and they created some level that had a unique mood,

750
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,774
like the old cap level.

751
00:55:17,635 --> 00:55:19,555
So it was like a mix of people...

752
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:22,997
putting together the ideas.

753
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:23,777
Yeah.

754
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:24,658
Thank you.

755
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,560
Thank you.

756
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:27,880
Hello.

757
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:29,321
Whoa, that's loud.

758
00:55:31,263 --> 00:55:34,645
I'm sure like anybody else here who's played Frostpunk,

759
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:38,728
my first playthrough went very badly.

760
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:43,131
But the second playthrough went surprisingly well.

761
00:55:43,191 --> 00:55:43,792
At one point...

762
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:48,748
uh, my first, like, person died.

763
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:55,531
And I got a message for it, and it was actually that he had died of old age, and he was thanking

764
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:57,912
me for, like, making his life so good.

765
00:55:57,932 --> 00:56:03,354
And I was really surprised by that, because before then it was a somewhat depressing game.

766
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:08,476
But uh, I got that, to that moment, I didn't expect that to ever be in there.

767
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:12,958
So uh, what made you want to put, like, moments like that in there?

768
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,621
Good moments.

769
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:15,362
Yeah.

770
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:15,943
Yeah.

771
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:17,885
Yeah.

772
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:20,869
You know, we have hope in Frostpunk.

773
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:24,074
Maybe it can get big.

774
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:29,541
But we made those because mostly...

775
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:34,455
there are some positive things that happen even in a very hard situation.

776
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:38,158
And maybe replying from another perspective,

777
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:45,844
I was kind of seeing some kind of documents on the war

778
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:47,585
where there were people...

779
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,081
who experienced the war,

780
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:52,202
actually this was filmed during the war,

781
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:54,543
that was making joke of situation,

782
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:55,683
of very hard situation.

783
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:59,945
I think this kind of positive elements of kind of humor,

784
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,386
maybe if it's a dark humor,

785
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:06,647
these are things that keep us being alive and human,

786
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:08,688
even in the most hard times.

787
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,089
All right, thank you.

788
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:11,389
Thank you.

789
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:16,967
Hi, I'm a Chinese player.

790
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:19,949
I tried to, I think Maggie and I actually know this.

791
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:23,472
It's like, mostly from Chinese player community,

792
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:27,075
they like the game, but there is one part

793
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:29,197
they really don't like, it's the ending.

794
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:32,099
So some Chinese players play like very

795
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:34,881
dictatively and cruel maybe, but.

796
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:37,424
In the end, they make everyone survive.

797
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:41,428
And maybe you are judging them like, oh, is that worth it?

798
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:45,292
And actually, some of Chinese think it's worth it.

799
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:48,255
I mean, sometimes we have to organize people

800
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:50,037
to go through that kind of difficulty.

801
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:51,578
And then we can think about something else.

802
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:55,462
But they don't like how you judged them in the end.

803
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:56,763
So what do you think about this?

804
00:57:59,304 --> 00:58:04,209
We were not aware of that after we just released the game,

805
00:58:04,249 --> 00:58:07,272
that there is such kind of impression from Chinese people.

806
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:16,240
I think it's kind of our voice as designers of the game

807
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:20,724
and kind of a communication, kind of a message

808
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:24,168
that you as well might not agree with.

809
00:58:26,065 --> 00:58:28,686
So we didn't know the Chinese people won't accept that.

810
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:30,707
Sorry that you did.

811
00:58:30,787 --> 00:58:34,128
But for us, what actually it was important to state it.

812
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:36,109
That for us it's crossing the line.

813
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:39,291
Maybe that's a kind of cultural difference that we were not aware of.

814
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:45,553
Well, I mean, it's like we are survivors of a lot of bad things

815
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:47,874
and we got organized, so we overcome.

816
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:50,015
So that's how we were made.

817
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:52,577
And this kind of people is thinking differently.

818
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:55,218
Anyway, it's interesting.

819
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,359
Yeah, I think yes, I agree.

820
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:04,825
Hi, so my studio is currently working on a game that, like this War of Mine and Frostpunk,

821
00:59:04,865 --> 00:59:06,767
has to do with a lot of making difficult decisions.

822
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:10,249
We've actually been playing your games as reference for our design philosophy recently.

823
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:18,516
So, one thing that really struck us about the games is how well they make you care about

824
00:59:19,497 --> 00:59:22,499
playable characters and non-playable characters that you've just met so quickly.

825
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,161
Is there any sort of strategies you employed to make sure that would happen?

826
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:32,277
I'm sorry, can you please repeat the last part of your question?

827
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:37,864
Yeah, so like how did you make players care about other characters so quickly?

828
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:42,508
Well, I think we don't have a recipe,

829
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:46,532
like we don't have a kind of technological recipe to get there,

830
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:53,558
but I think the answer lies mostly in that we want to, in our games,

831
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,203
create a sense of immersion and a sense of mood

832
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:02,627
that will kind of make the player care about what's happening.

833
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:09,912
And the other stuff is that most of the consequences, as we are showing in the game,

834
01:00:10,612 --> 01:00:12,274
they try to base off empathy.

835
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:18,298
They try to show some kind of subtle influence that you have on other people's life.

836
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:20,480
And we kind of stick to that.

837
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:22,541
Thank you.
