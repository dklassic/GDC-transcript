1
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:09,098
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:19,702
Hi, I'm Kosuke Ibuki from Nintendo, producer of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and ARMS.

3
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:34,727
So, I'm sure you all know Mario Kart, right?

4
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:36,608
As for ARMS, like you just saw in the video,

5
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,991
it's a competitive fighting game using fighters with extendable arms.

6
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,373
We created ARMS based on our experience with Mario Kart.

7
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:48,176
The genre of the game is different from racing and fighting,

8
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:50,558
but Mario Kart and ARMS are like siblings.

9
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,861
We used our experience with Mario Kart as the basis for the development of ARMS.

10
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,443
Though they're different genres, racing and fighting,

11
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,605
Mario Kart and ARMS are something like siblings.

12
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:19,990
Today, I'd like to take a look back at the creation process for ARMS and touch on how it was influenced by Mario Kart and how we used that previous experience.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:30,237
And at the same time, I want to talk to you about Nintendo's game development culture that forms the backbone of both.

14
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:40,227
However, you may wonder if a Mario Kart developer can make a fighting game.

15
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:48,161
But Nintendo developers have had the experience of making a variety of games.

16
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:57,349
I myself have been involved in games like Zelda and Nintendogs,

17
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,670
not just Mario Kart.

18
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,094
I've been involved in a variety of genres,

19
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:04,815
so it's no wonder I make fighting games.

20
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,110
When you try a new genre, you will naturally use your past experience.

21
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,973
You may become unique because you know the other genre well.

22
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:23,275
Since I've worked on many different types of games,

23
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,137
it shouldn't be any stranger to try making a fighting game.

24
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:29,960
Naturally, when attempting a new genre, you have to rely on your past experience.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,622
And, if you have a strong background in a different genre than the new one you're attempting,

26
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:35,403
that can mean you'll be able to make something unique.

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:46,176
However, other companies other than Nintendo make legendary fighting games like Street Fighter.

28
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:51,039
I think that even if we imitate it, it will only be a deteriorated game.

29
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,980
So if we make a fighting game,

30
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,904
it will be limited to when we find something unique that is different from others.

31
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,675
That said, games like the Legendary Street Fighter

32
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:04,916
are something companies other than Nintendo specialize in.

33
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,196
Even if we tried to imitate them,

34
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:09,217
the game we'd end up making wouldn't be anything unique.

35
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,918
So if we decide to make a fighting game,

36
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:14,639
it's only because we found some interesting idea or element

37
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,819
that'll make it different from other games.

38
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,120
Unique is something Nintendo values the most.

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,820
Miyamoto-san,

40
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,756
If I'm asked what makes Nintendo different from others,

41
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,637
if I can't answer, I have no future.

42
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:30,179
Nintendo places importance on being unique above all else.

43
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,300
If Miyamoto-san asks me,

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,581
what makes this different, and I don't have an answer,

45
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,442
I'm finished.

46
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,043
Nintendo always makes new games.

47
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,144
Making games is not easy.

48
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,605
Sometimes you feel like you're walking in a big maze,

49
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,186
and you often bump into walls.

50
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:55,415
so you might want to look for other ways.

51
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:59,757
At Nintendo, we're always prototyping new games.

52
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:02,138
Making games isn't easy, is it?

53
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:06,520
Sometimes it feels like you're walking around in a giant maze.

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,741
You run into walls a lot.

55
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,502
Sometimes you need to find another path.

56
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:15,084
There are very few new IPs that come out in the world.

57
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:17,365
Mario Kart is already 25 years old,

58
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,946
so it's quite an adult game.

59
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,967
But for me, ARMS is still like a newborn baby.

60
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,093
So, we have to take good care of it.

61
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:29,676
So, let's get started.

62
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:40,003
One day, I was having a light chat with the game designer, Jikumaru.

63
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:54,994
Can we make a fighting game from the perspective of the back?

64
00:04:54,994 --> 00:05:01,058
I think this is a topic that has been repeated many times by developers around the world.

65
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,339
You may have talked about it once.

66
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:08,102
So, one day I was casually chatting with one of my game designers named Jikumaru-san,

67
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:09,123
and the topic came up,

68
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:12,264
can you make a fighting game with the camera behind the player?

69
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:16,807
It's probably a question that's come up among developers all over the world countless times.

70
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,888
Maybe you all have talked about it amongst yourselves as well.

71
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:23,898
That chat was how ARMS started.

72
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:25,438
That chat was how ARMS started.

73
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:30,820
Of course, I think we all understand why most fighting games use a side view.

74
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,163
Of course, I think we all understand why most fighting games use a side view.

75
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:42,345
It's because it's easier to understand the distance between you and your opponent.

76
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:47,767
You approach your opponent and punch in exchange for the risk of getting hit.

77
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:54,452
It's because it makes it easy to judge the distance from your opponent.

78
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:59,234
In exchange for the risk of being hit, you move in closer to hit them.

79
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,396
That's the most basic structure of a fighting game.

80
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:16,878
If you're using a behind-the-back perspective, it's hard to judge how far you are from your opponent.

81
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,861
Will my punch reach them? Will it come up short? It's hard to tell.

82
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:27,707
If the players are freely mobile on top of that, this lack of tactical precision will lead to a fight that just isn't worthwhile.

83
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:34,292
If the players are freely mobile on top of that, this lack of tactical precision will lead to a fight that just isn't worthwhile.

84
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,815
So let's veer off a little and talk about a game I know very well, Mario Kart.

85
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:49,221
Something appears in the distance, and you have to cut the steering wheel.

86
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,884
That's the basic structure of the game.

87
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:55,527
Even if you don't know the precise distance to the obstacle,

88
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,169
you can avoid it by using the time until you reach it.

89
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:01,587
Something appears in the distance, and you steer in relation to that.

90
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,828
That's the basic structure of the game.

91
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,770
Even if you don't know the distance between you and an obstacle,

92
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,414
as long as you steer around it in the time it takes you to reach it, you'll be fine.

93
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,203
So let's take a look at this again.

94
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,485
If, given enough time, attacks will always reach your opponent,

95
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:36,449
maybe we can structure a fighting game around the behind-the-back perspective.

96
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,932
That was the idea my game designer came up with.

97
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:47,476
The question of distance, whether your punch will reach the opponent or not,

98
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:50,378
instead becomes a question of whether your punch will hit or miss,

99
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,200
playing out over the entirety of the screen.

100
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:58,222
When you get an idea like this, you have to try prototyping it.

101
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:02,765
This is a video we made back at the prototype stage.

102
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:12,433
It still has some Japanese text in it, but let's take a look and I'll translate it.

103
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:27,389
So it's a competitive fighting game where you use these long reaching attacks

104
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,850
and you hold the controller using this thumbs up style grip.

105
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,172
You tilt the controllers forward and back to move forward and back,

106
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:36,114
left and right to move left and right,

107
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,495
L and R buttons to jump,

108
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:42,558
and then flick them to send out this stretching punch.

109
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:47,361
While the punch is extending, if you tilt the controllers that'll curve your punch.

110
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,663
Here you can see the hit point meters for you and your opponent.

111
00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:01,921
If one of those reaches zero, then the match is over.

112
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:11,371
You can switch out your weapons on either side just before the match starts.

113
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:56,800
We also made mini-games using that same ARMS gameplay. ♪

114
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,583
So you might have noticed there was a bowling prototype

115
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,664
that didn't make it into the final game.

116
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:06,426
All prototypes don't make it into the final game.

117
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,207
With Nintendo prototypes, we don't care about the visuals.

118
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:15,490
If the boxes and balls are moving, we can check the game design.

119
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,613
So at Nintendo, we don't care about visuals when we're prototyping.

120
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:23,535
Blocks and balls in motion are enough to check out a game design idea.

121
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:31,162
This prototype was like boxing, where you fight your opponent in the distance,

122
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:34,424
or like shooting, where you aim at your opponent in the distance.

123
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:37,586
It looked cheap, but it was a very tactical battle.

124
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:41,468
So this prototype had elements of boxing, trading blows with a close-up opponent,

125
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:46,792
but it also felt like a shooter, where you aimed at a distant opponent.

126
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,853
It might look cheap, but even at this stage, you could have a tactical battle.

127
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:55,077
Players can punch one of their opponents, and then punch the other at any time.

128
00:10:55,366 --> 00:11:01,549
The first punch was a straight punch, and the second was a curved punch.

129
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:06,692
A player could, after punching with one arm, unleash the other with opportune timing.

130
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,973
Maybe the first punch just goes straight as a decoy,

131
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:11,634
and then the second punch curves to where they're dodging.

132
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:17,678
We also thought that we could replace the elements that make up a fighting game

133
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,399
with elements that make it easier to understand and visualize.

134
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:27,008
On top of that, we took the basic elements of a fighting game

135
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:34,210
and tried to replace them with easy-to-understand visual elements.

136
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,010
For example, the defensive opening during an attack

137
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,292
can be expressed as the time when the arms are extending and contracting.

138
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,592
You can't guard while your arms are extended.

139
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,732
That's easy to understand, right?

140
00:11:51,209 --> 00:12:08,861
Also, attack variations like weak and strong punches could instead be expressed as arm variations with light and heavy weapons.

141
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:17,086
Different combinations of weapons on the left and right arms could also create different strategies.

142
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:26,443
This idea of finding replacements for familiar gameplay elements

143
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:34,349
is very important when you're trying to design a new game.

144
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,597
We had two basic principles.

145
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:50,060
Make sure that the trajectory of the extending arms

146
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,623
is easy to visually distinguish,

147
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,065
and keep the number of things players have to learn

148
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,345
to a minimum.

149
00:12:55,345 --> 00:13:00,330
With these in mind, development of ARMS began in earnest.

150
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,552
Also, this gameplay felt like a really good fit

151
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:07,916
with the then prototype stage, Joy-Con.

152
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,039
It felt unique, like it had a future.

153
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:17,990
In fighting games, there is no delay and the operation is very reliable.

154
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,871
It's been more than 10 years since the Wii Remote,

155
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:26,773
and the hardware has evolved, but we have also evolved in the software side.

156
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:31,594
Fighting games in general strive for controls that are as precise as possible.

157
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,755
Ten years have passed since the Wii Remote first came out,

158
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:35,416
and the hardware has certainly evolved,

159
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,457
but the software side, us in other words, has also evolved.

160
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:47,445
With our current technology, we can create a game that can be played by advanced players

161
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:51,046
with precise and motionless motion control.

162
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:52,967
It seemed to me that with our current technology,

163
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,648
more precise and accurate motion controls could be realized,

164
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:59,330
and we could make a game where advanced players could pursue highly technical play.

165
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,812
On the other hand, the Nintendo Switch is a game console that changes its appearance according to the player.

166
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:07,850
Like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,

167
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,891
ARMS aims to make games that you can play

168
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,433
with any style, whether it's buttons,

169
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,494
motion, backrest, or mobile phone.

170
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:19,116
On the other hand, the Nintendo Switch is a game system

171
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,977
that can adjust itself to many different types of players.

172
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,859
As with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, I wanted players to be able to play

173
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,160
how they want, to use button controls and motion controls,

174
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,561
play docked, or play handheld.

175
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:29,601
One thing to note about motion control,

176
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,550
and that you can play with just moving it around,

177
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,792
and that you can't beat advanced players with just that.

178
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,516
In other words, the game has a wide and deep opening.

179
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:48,000
This was a challenge that Mario Kart had been pursuing for a long time,

180
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,942
and ARMS also took on the challenge.

181
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,882
This is something I worry about with motion controls,

182
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:56,064
but we focused on making sure that the game could be played

183
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,645
with casual and precise motions,

184
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,086
but that also playing like that

185
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,548
wouldn't be enough to beat an advanced player.

186
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,669
In other words, the game's broadly accessible,

187
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,810
but it also has depth.

188
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,271
That's something we've been pursuing

189
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,552
all along with Mario Kart,

190
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,093
and ARMS has been a similar challenge.

191
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:09,933
We also aimed to make ARMS a game

192
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:14,857
where top players can play the same way

193
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:18,519
by using the same buttons and motions.

194
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:29,568
And with ARMS, we aim to have motion and button controls be equally viable in matches between top-level players.

195
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:35,210
Learning controls you're not familiar with is like practicing the piano.

196
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,091
It doesn't go well right away.

197
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:47,014
But once you get used to it, you find that you start reacting before you even think about what's happening.

198
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,915
And that feels really great.

199
00:15:51,325 --> 00:16:06,320
You might find it hard to believe, but in reality we've seen players using motion controls reach the top of the world rankings.

200
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,487
So ARMS is a game where you can aim for the top, even with motion controls.

201
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,702
Next up, let's talk about ARMS character designs.

202
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:26,363
You may be wondering why their arms are so long.

203
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:30,225
So next, let's talk a bit about ARMS character designs.

204
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:33,807
And I'm sure you're probably wondering, why did ARMS extend?

205
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,268
Well, let me explain.

206
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:39,310
Like Splatoon, we also considered a lot of characters that fit into this game.

207
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:56,345
Just like with Splatoon, we tried a lot of different characters to find ones that would fit this game.

208
00:16:56,345 --> 00:17:00,166
The designs you see here are just a few examples.

209
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:09,190
We looked at more than a hundred different designs, but we didn't have a clear way to pick the right one.

210
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:14,621
Yoshi licks his tongue, Link fights with hook shots,

211
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,682
and so on.

212
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:20,825
We even had ideas for existing characters,

213
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:24,467
like Yoshi fighting with his tongue,

214
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,968
or Link fighting with hook shots.

215
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:29,310
We also tested various body and head-body balances on the screen.

216
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:36,134
We tried out characters with lots of different silhouettes

217
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,416
and head-body balances on the screen.

218
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,724
But what I was trying at this time was a character that only had a long fist.

219
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:48,207
When I threw a punch, the action seemed to be small.

220
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:53,792
The small movement on the screen was also affected by the point of view from behind.

221
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:57,035
At this time, only their fists extended out,

222
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,538
and when they would throw a punch, the action just felt too small.

223
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,040
The behind-the-back perspective was part of it,

224
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,942
but the movement on screen was just too slight.

225
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:18,844
So, we decided to just go for it and have the entire arm extend out from the shoulder.

226
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:21,847
This was the breakthrough we needed.

227
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:46,819
Flicking the Joy-Con made it feel as though your own arm was actually extending out far away from you.

228
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:57,535
So normally you might just use normal human characters in a game like this,

229
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:02,236
but since having the characters' arms themselves extend fit the gameplay so well,

230
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:07,937
we decided to design the character and world entirely around that,

231
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:12,758
which I feel like is a very Nintendo-like way of doing things.

232
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:17,679
So in other words, the answer to the question,

233
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,180
why do arms fighters have extendable arms, is because Nintendo.

234
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,892
And then, a fighter with the ability to stretch his arms, Spring Man, was born.

235
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:34,573
His hair is a bun and he has a spring-like hair clip.

236
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,274
So that's how Spring Man, a fighter with this extending arm ability, was born.

237
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:42,335
And that's even his real hair, as springy as the spring itself.

238
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:42,535
Boing!

239
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:49,217
We decided to consider other fighters as well, as long as they can stretch.

240
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:55,539
Usually, they're compact and extend very well when they get punched.

241
00:19:56,472 --> 00:20:00,394
For the other characters, we set about exploring a motif of different extendable things.

242
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:03,815
Things that could stay compact, but then stretch and extend when punching.

243
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:11,897
The first thing that we thought of was a ribbon, and ribbons called to mind the glamour and grace of a pop star.

244
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:18,440
The first thing that we thought of was a ribbon, and ribbons called to mind the glamour and grace of a pop star.

245
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:28,358
And that became Ribbon Girl, a fighter who can perform multiple air jumps.

246
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:36,281
And we decided to get an actual singer to actually be our voice actress.

247
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,531
Next, the chain. I think the chain and ninja are a great match.

248
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,832
You may be familiar with the shuriken,

249
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:51,514
but there's also a ninja weapon called the chain-bending sword.

250
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:56,976
The next idea was chains, and to us, chains paired perfectly with a ninja.

251
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,597
I'm sure you're all familiar with shuriken, that weapon,

252
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:03,498
but there's also a chain-based ninja weapon called the chain-bending sword as well.

253
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:10,215
Ninjara. He became a popular fighter in the world.

254
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:15,037
And this became Ninjara, a character we've noticed is very popular with boys.

255
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:20,139
By the way, Jara is the Japanese word for the sound of a chain.

256
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:24,341
And by the way, Jara is the sound that chains make in Japanese.

257
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:28,663
Next, Houtai. When you think of Houtai, you think of Mila.

258
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,405
But if you just think of Mila, I don't think it's unique.

259
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:41,153
Next was Bandages, and Bandages led us to mummies, but a basic mummy wouldn't be unique.

260
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:44,675
So we made him a buffed-up, powerful mummy.

261
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:53,060
We called him Master Mummy, and in Nintendo's entire history,

262
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:59,823
this is probably one of the most muscled-up characters we've ever had.

263
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:12,171
Weight fighters can bear down on an opponent, which can really make you feel powerful.

264
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:13,512
This picture is made by the development team.

265
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:20,036
So you might be wondering what's this picture about.

266
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:26,061
This is a bowl of ramen that someone on the dev team made.

267
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,490
日本人は本当にラーメンが大好きで、ごく自然にラーメンをモチーフにしたファイターの案も出てきました。

268
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,713
We love ramen in Japan, so naturally ideas for a ramen-based fighter also came up.

269
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:33,493
ラーメン屋の看板娘で、カンフーの達人。ここまでは普通ですけど、左腕に彼女の特徴があります。

270
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:39,437
She's the daughter of ramen makers and a kung fu master. All of that's normal stuff, but her left arm is something special.

271
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:07,613
Min Min, and when she charges up an attack, her left arm grows in size.

272
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:19,281
She's the only fighter with asymmetrical arms, so we struggled with what weapons we should

273
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,202
give her.

274
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:30,102
You might think of snakes as jungle, but we wanted to create an extreme sports atmosphere.

275
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:33,323
And the result was Kid Cobra.

276
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:36,984
It has a quick body and a thick arm like a daija.

277
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:54,949
His quick movements and thick, snake-like arms make him stand out.

278
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:58,691
We also had staff with some more outlandish suggestions,

279
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:04,474
like a girl genius obsessed with extendable arms,

280
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:10,098
but since she doesn't have extendable arms of her own,

281
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:13,460
she builds a robot suit that does.

282
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,061
A mechanica.

283
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:30,002
Her envious attitude towards the extendable arms ability

284
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:35,367
was also something that led to more hints about how this world might actually work.

285
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,829
Here's a jelly-like artificial life form.

286
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:39,911
It's called a helix.

287
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,434
It not only extends the arms, but also the body.

288
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:45,556
It's called a helix.

289
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,779
It not only extends the arms, but also the body.

290
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:53,914
called Helix. Not only his arms, but his entire body can stretch and shrink.

291
00:24:53,914 --> 00:25:00,819
Some of our more passionate players say he's very cute.

292
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:20,269
One idea was an actress who fights not with her arms, but with her hair.

293
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,491
Her hair whips around violently,

294
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:29,256
but with her actual arms she poses with grace and aplomb.

295
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:33,380
And that graceful concept developed into...

296
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,740
Twin tail.

297
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,423
Twin tail. Her dazzling aura captivates her opponents.

298
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,121
This fighter has received a lot of feedback from fans around the world.

299
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,342
Based on the reactions from fans all over the world,

300
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:47,902
she's made a big impact on players.

301
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:52,003
The more we developed the robot as a support item,

302
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:54,224
the more unique it became.

303
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:56,064
It became a fighter that fights with a dog.

304
00:25:56,064 --> 00:26:00,545
This was a robot that we initially designed as a support item,

305
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:02,786
which gradually gained so much personality of its own,

306
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:06,027
it ended up being its own fighter, in combination with a robot dog.

307
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:14,527
This is Bite and Bark. Sometimes Bark the dog helps you, so you might be luckier than the other fighters.

308
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:23,790
As a result of pursuing the difference in the individuality of the fighters, we have a lot of colorful fighters.

309
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:38,367
By working hard to make sure that each fighter's unique characteristics stand out,

310
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,409
we ended up with a very colorful group of fighters.

311
00:26:54,952 --> 00:27:02,497
Rather than having the fighting be a literal fight, we decided to frame it as a competitive sport.

312
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:07,060
The world's similar to Earth, but it's a world where this extendable arms ability has become commonplace.

313
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:15,265
The Arms Grand Prix that the fighters participate in is a sports festival like the World Cup of Soccer or the Grand Slam of Tennis.

314
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:19,167
The sound policy has also been consolidated.

315
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:25,839
The ARMS Grand Prix that the fighters take part in is a huge sport event.

316
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,341
This world's equivalent of the World Cup or Tennis Grand Slams.

317
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,362
And this also solidified our direction for sound.

318
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:35,465
Using a camera from behind means that we can make the stage 3D.

319
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:41,628
We've been making the 3D stage on the Mario Kart for a long time.

320
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:51,286
Using a behind-the-back camera also let us focus on fleshing out the stages in three dimensions.

321
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:58,411
3D stages are something we've been building all along in Mario Kart.

322
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:06,175
But of course, stages as complicated as Mario Kart tracks would get in the way of a serious fight,

323
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:10,938
so we tried to limit ourselves to just one or two 3D accents per stage.

324
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:21,941
Spring Stadium is surrounded by trampolines, for example, and you can do a bounce on them to do a big jump.

325
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:24,823
Here in the Ribbon Ring, cubes will rise up from the floor.

326
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:30,287
You can get on top of them or hide behind them while fighting.

327
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:42,653
For the DNA Lab, making use of these six pillars will be the key to victory.

328
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:47,514
While the pillars are still standing, arms that curve, like the boomerang, will be useful.

329
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:19,748
This is the Sky Arena. The platform in the center is patterned around a sumo wrestling ring, or dohyo.

330
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:23,810
If you fall off of it, you'll end up pushed up against the ropes in an instant.

331
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:33,295
And here's the Sparring Ring. This kind of a sparse stage with nothing in it is naturally favored by serious gamers.

332
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:41,865
We put a lot of effort and thought into the characters' clothes and their home stages

333
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:48,907
to really get across the idea that this is a competitive sport in the ARMS world.

334
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:53,028
We put a lot of effort and thought into the characters' clothes and their home stages

335
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:56,469
to really get across the idea that this is a competitive sport in the ARMS world.

336
00:29:56,469 --> 00:30:01,790
We used the experience of creating a lot of custom-made logo and mark on Mario Kart 8.

337
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:03,816
When we were working on Mario Kart 8,

338
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:07,038
we made a lot of different fictitious logos and brand name marks,

339
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,679
and we used that experience here as well.

340
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,820
We also paid a lot of attention to detail in the fighters' athletic bodies.

341
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,262
That part is a little different from Mario Kart.

342
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:21,985
We also paid a lot of attention to detail in the fighters' athletic bodies.

343
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,386
That part is a little different from Mario Kart.

344
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:31,015
I think we were able to create a colorful, pop world

345
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:34,298
where the fighters are fighting with all their might.

346
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:37,841
They're colorful and poppy, but you can also feel how serious these characters are.

347
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:40,323
I feel like we've done a good job of expressing their world.

348
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:42,244
Let's take a break from game design.

349
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:43,805
Now let's take a little break from game design talk.

350
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:59,675
We've seen a lot of fan art featuring ARMS characters popping up.

351
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:02,636
As developers, this makes us really happy and also inspires us.

352
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:06,157
We've seen a lot of fan art featuring ARMS characters popping up.

353
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,898
As developers, this makes us really happy and also inspires us.

354
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:12,120
We're preparing a comic book that will help you enjoy the ARMS world even more.

355
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:28,658
On another side note, we're working on a comic that will help people understand and enjoy the ARMS world even more.

356
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:37,461
It will introduce a lot of things that we weren't able to talk about in the game,

357
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:44,023
like the fact that this Spring Man is actually the third Spring Man.

358
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:46,843
I hope you'll enjoy it.

359
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:52,535
Let's get back to Game Talk.

360
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,876
ARMS has been constantly updating.

361
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,117
We've been constantly checking to see how fun it is to play.

362
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:58,958
We've released a number of updates for ARMS since it came out,

363
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,679
and the entire time we've been working on the game,

364
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,461
we've constantly been checking to make sure it's the kind of fun, competitive game

365
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:10,142
people will want to play over and over.

366
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:15,164
We've been constantly checking to make sure it's the kind of fun, competitive game

367
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:17,445
people will want to play over and over.

368
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:28,985
I think a lot about the balance between technique and luck in competitive games.

369
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:31,105
As you know, Mario Kart is all about luck.

370
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:37,728
No matter how good your driving technique is,

371
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:44,251
you can get hit by a shell or slip on a banana and lose.

372
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,331
As you well know, in Mario Kart, the luck element of what item am I going to get is huge.

373
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:53,372
No matter how good your driving technique is,

374
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,813
sometimes you'll get hit by a shell or slip on a banana peel and end up losing.

375
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:01,234
But on the other hand, sometimes you get a mushroom and pull a victory out of the last second.

376
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:04,555
You don't know what's going to happen. It's like life.

377
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:11,017
But on the other hand, sometimes you get a mushroom and pull a victory out of the last second.

378
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:13,277
You don't know what's going to happen. It's like life.

379
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:22,052
On the other hand, we imagined that the arms would be like tennis.

380
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:27,137
We could predict whether the opponent would move to the left or to the right,

381
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,199
so luck was a factor.

382
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:31,902
For arms, we had a tennis-like balance in mind.

383
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:35,827
You throw your punches while trying to predict whether your opponent will move right or left,

384
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,408
so there's some amount of luck involved.

385
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,894
However, it is a game where players who are basically more skilled win.

386
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:51,421
In real tennis, there are few perfect games, but most of the time strong people win.

387
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:53,263
Arms is the same.

388
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:58,408
I think it's a game that has fair rules, is competitive, and is close to general sports.

389
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:02,997
That said, essentially the more skilled player is going to end up winning.

390
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:05,618
In tennis as well, you might not see a lot of perfect games,

391
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:08,199
but generally I think the stronger player wins.

392
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,519
ARMS is the same as that.

393
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,921
The rules are fair, there's a high level of competition,

394
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,341
so I think it's very close to a natural sport.

395
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:15,022
I'm like everyone else,

396
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:20,664
and I don't like games where one-pattern tactics are effective.

397
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:23,065
I've been adjusting the game balance

398
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:27,187
to create an environment where various characters and ARMS are used.

399
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,553
Much, I imagine, like you, I don't really like games

400
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:33,015
where only one type of strategy is effective.

401
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:35,176
We aim for an environment where lots of different characters

402
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:37,777
and arms would be used, and have adjusted the game balance

403
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,158
along the way accordingly.

404
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:42,479
Since the number of body pairs for arms and fighters

405
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,360
vary by a vast number,

406
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,860
the development process

407
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,842
included the AI- reinforcement data

408
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:49,322
as well as battle data

409
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:51,403
to help people relate to each other.

410
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:57,265
The possible combinations of fighters and arms amounts to a huge number.

411
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:04,649
So while we were in development, rather than relying on fight data solely from human opponents,

412
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:06,530
we referred to data from AI matches as well.

413
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:12,514
After release, we adjusted the data based on user play data.

414
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:15,716
This table shows the world's top 3% user win rate.

415
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,641
Post-release, we've been making adjustments based on play data from actual users.

416
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:24,543
This chart shows win percentages by character for the top 3% of players.

417
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:28,964
I don't know how to look at it, so let's focus on Master Mami.

418
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:34,727
Master Mami is not good at Ribbon Girl and Menmen,

419
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:39,108
but she has Ninja and Kid Cobra as her camo.

420
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:44,250
But if it's 5% win rate, it's within the scope of the game.

421
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,026
So it might be a little hard to read, so let's focus in on Master Mummy.

422
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:53,868
If you take a look, you can see that he fares poorly against Ribbon Girl and Min Min,

423
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,349
but he does well against Kid Cobra and Ninjara.

424
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,091
That said, I think a difference in win percentage of up to 5% or so is allowable.

425
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,473
We don't just look at the user's overall data,

426
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:08,014
but also the data for the top 3% and regional data,

427
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:15,378
and we cut and analyze the data from various perspectives to make adjustments.

428
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:19,297
When we're balancing, we don't just simply look at all the data at once.

429
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,938
We'll break it down and look at it from different perspectives,

430
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:25,479
like the top 3% of players or just from specific regions.

431
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,280
Of course, we don't just look at the data.

432
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,941
We also conduct online battles to check the environment.

433
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:37,523
We also refer to reports from the Sugode staff at Nintendo of America and Europe.

434
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:39,879
And we don't just look at data.

435
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:42,641
Our own development staff will participate in online matches

436
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:44,302
to check out how things are going.

437
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,484
And we'll also get reports from top players

438
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:49,626
on the Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe staff.

439
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,908
To show off our players' skills,

440
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:57,813
we held an event called Online Sparring in Japan.

441
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,835
We invited top players to the online lobby

442
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,916
and played a match.

443
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:06,697
So the players could display their talents,

444
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:09,759
in Japan we held an event called Online Open Sparring.

445
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:12,602
We invited high-ranked players to an online lobby

446
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:13,583
and broadcast their matches.

447
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:20,490
This was the first time Nintendo had held an online tournament like this.

448
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,755
The Mechanics won, and the Japanese players were surprised.

449
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:30,266
This was the first time Nintendo had held an online tournament like this.

450
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,327
Even though she was considered low tier at the time,

451
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:35,949
Mechanic ended up winning, which surprised a lot of Japanese players.

452
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:38,431
In Japan, we held the Arms Japan Grand Prix.

453
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:41,973
We had a preliminary tournament in four regions,

454
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:45,775
and the final tournament was held at the end.

455
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:51,559
Later, we held an official tournament called the Arms Japan Grand Prix.

456
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,560
We held four regional prelims, followed by a championship tournament.

457
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:59,738
We'll show you a little bit of the footage before the tournament.

458
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:04,801
You can see that there are kids, women, and other age groups participating.

459
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:09,404
Let's take a look at some video from right before that championship tournament.

460
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:11,605
You'll be able to see children, female gamers,

461
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,747
gamers of all generations who came to play.

462
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,768
And there's some Japanese text which I'll translate as well.

463
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:15,948
It's time.

464
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:36,698
to find out who the best arms player is.

465
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:40,460
The championship. ♪♪♪

466
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:43,473
Thank you.

467
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:49,996
The main characters in competitive games are always the players themselves.

468
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:58,081
I feel that we are growing ARMS together with the players, not just the development team.

469
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:02,763
I am grateful from the bottom of my heart.

470
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,951
It really feels to me that it's not just the dev team,

471
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,592
but everyone playing the game as well,

472
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:09,392
that are helping to build up ARMS together.

473
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:12,734
I'm sincerely grateful.

474
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,494
In January's EVO Japan,

475
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,095
all the best 8 fighters were different.

476
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,236
The game balance has improved.

477
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:21,877
At EVO Japan back in January,

478
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,258
everyone in the best 8 used different fighters.

479
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,838
So I'm feeling good about the game balance.

480
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:31,544
Many other players from outside Japan also came to the event.

481
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:36,807
We saw a different strategy from the Japanese players,

482
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:38,988
and every match was a surprise.

483
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:43,171
We announced this at Nintendo Direct the other day,

484
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:53,297
but we are also planning to hold an online tournament in the US at the end of this month.

485
00:40:54,612 --> 00:40:57,333
As you might have seen in the Nintendo Direct the other day,

486
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,614
we're also planning an online tournament in North America for the end of the month.

487
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:03,956
On the other hand, ARMS is not just a game for advanced players.

488
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:11,418
We've also prepared mini-games like basketball to knock your opponent into the ring.

489
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:15,340
But of course, ARMS isn't just a game for top-level players.

490
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,181
It also has mini-games like hoops,

491
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:19,902
where you try to knock your opponent through a basketball hoop, for example.

492
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:24,234
To allow players to enjoy the game for a long time,

493
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:28,878
we added a feature to collect badges and an event mode called Party Jack.

494
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:31,500
We also added a special secret fighter.

495
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,304
Features we added later, like collectible badges and the party crash events,

496
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:38,426
also give the game longevity for more casual play.

497
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:41,929
We also added in a mysterious challenger for players to battle against.

498
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:45,552
We aimed to further expand the game's potential

499
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:48,635
by using the data and voices of the players.

500
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:52,431
The main focus of the discussion was the fighters.

501
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:56,776
Based on user data and feedback from users themselves,

502
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:58,217
we've worked to broaden the game's appeal.

503
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:02,121
Naturally, a big part of that was adding new fighters.

504
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,764
We hope that not only the fighters' skills,

505
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:09,588
but the game itself will be played for a long time.

506
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:11,931
Going forward, hopefully it's not just the fighters' arms,

507
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:14,513
but the lifespan of the game itself that can extend as well.

508
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:18,816
Speaking Japanese

509
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:27,739
Games are a tool for creating communication and interactions between family and friends.

510
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:37,121
This is something that longtime Mario Kart developer Konno-san has said to me many times over the years,

511
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,542
and it's become my linchpin for making games.

512
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:45,110
But, when I think about it now,

513
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:48,592
I think it fits into all the Nintendo games made around me.

514
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:52,053
Of course, there are fighting games like Mario Kart and Splatoon,

515
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:58,157
but also things like Animal Crossing and Nintendogs are communication tools.

516
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:04,520
In the Legend of Zelda, everyone is actively communicating about the strategy, right?

517
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,983
I think that designing a game so that there is a lot of communication

518
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,444
is like Nintendo's DNA.

519
00:43:12,443 --> 00:43:17,827
And come to think of it, I feel like it's true of all the other Nintendo games being made around me as well.

520
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:21,170
It applies to competitive games like Mario Kart and Splatoon for sure,

521
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,413
but Animal Crossing and Nintendogs create opportunities to communicate as well.

522
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:29,556
Even with The Legend of Zelda, players often end up talking to each other about how to progress in the game.

523
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:34,940
Designing games that naturally give rise to lots of communication is something like the DNA of Nintendo games.

524
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,102
ARMS is one of those games.

525
00:43:37,102 --> 00:43:41,125
We aim to create games that create communication.

526
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:44,543
regardless of language, region, or age,

527
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:47,905
people from all over the world can play ARMS,

528
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:51,106
interact, and communicate with each other.

529
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,087
And ARMS is the same.

530
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:57,209
We wanted to make a game that would create opportunities

531
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:59,230
for communication and interaction.

532
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,011
Something where, regardless of language, country, or age,

533
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:04,372
you could compete against people all around the world,

534
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:06,413
watch their matches, and share stories with them.

535
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:08,814
And if it's been used like that, then we've succeeded.

536
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:15,405
I used my experience developing Mario Kart to make ARMS.

537
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:18,507
Even though the genres were different, it worked out.

538
00:44:18,507 --> 00:44:21,890
Good game design can be applied in lots of different ways.

539
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,592
I used my experience developing Mario Kart to make ARMS.

540
00:44:24,592 --> 00:44:27,774
Even though the genres were different, it worked out.

541
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:30,976
Good game design can be applied in lots of different ways.

542
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:36,380
I'm sure you'll be taking advantage of your experience and making new challenges.

543
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,563
I'm looking forward to the games you'll make.

544
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,431
I'm sure all of you are going to take your own past experiences

545
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,472
and apply them to new challenges going forward.

546
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:50,455
And I personally look forward to seeing the new games you make.

547
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,075
Thank you very much.
