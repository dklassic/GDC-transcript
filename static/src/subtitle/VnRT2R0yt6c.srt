1
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:08,068
All right, I'm going to get started.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,909
Just come in and sit down.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:14,193
We only have a short time for this talk, so we've got to try and cram in as much as we

4
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:14,513
can.

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:20,098
My name is Donald Mustard, and I'm the creative director at Chair Entertainment Group.

6
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,641
This is Jeremy Mustard, who's the technical director at Chair Entertainment Group, and

7
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:26,903
today we're going to be talking about designing Shadow Complex.

8
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:32,808
Just really quickly, Shadow Complex was released for the Xbox Live Arcade this past summer.

9
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:41,155
It was a very successful game by at least our standards of looking at things, and we're

10
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:47,340
going to talk a little bit today about just some of the different philosophies that we

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,744
kind of brought to our game design in trying to make a successful downloadable game.

12
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:59,658
and we're gonna hopefully what we can do is impart some at least a little bit of

13
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:06,262
Knowledge to help you guys making your games. We sure stumbled through a lot of stuff

14
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:12,385
And we well we began the process of learning things along the way

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,986
Now I'm gonna need your guys help

16
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:20,849
The best the best way that we're gonna actually learn something today is if you guys ask good questions

17
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,390
so I'm going to

18
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:29,547
rattle on for a few minutes here, but I need you guys to be thinking of what things actually matter to your games and what

19
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:34,689
you're doing and and please please ask us because I probably won't cover

20
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,471
Everything that's relevant to you, and that's really the whole point of you being here is to actually

21
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:41,532
Hopefully get something out of this

22
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,833
So let's get started

23
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:51,076
Embracing the limitations, I think that is the number one key thing that you need to do

24
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,830
when you are making a downloadable game?

25
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,472
What are some of those limitations?

26
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,833
For us, and this is what we kind of think,

27
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:02,435
probably the main limitations that you're probably hitting

28
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,876
if you are like us.

29
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:06,657
If you're a small team,

30
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:10,919
if you are making an original game,

31
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,521
and you're really kind of embarking out there on your own.

32
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,042
So these are what we found were our biggest limitations

33
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:21,304
were genre, budget, tech, team, and memory.

34
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:30,492
So, genre. Genre is one of your limitations because you aren't just competing against

35
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:36,436
other games that are released on the downloadable space or the downloadable consoles. You really

36
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:43,581
are competing against Gears of War, Mass Effect 2, Uncharted 2. That is your real competition.

37
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:48,885
And you need to find a way to differentiate yourself from those kind of games.

38
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,278
and that is an awesome opportunity.

39
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:54,999
It's an amazing opportunity, actually.

40
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,260
It's the coolest thing that's ever happened to our industry, I think,

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,142
that you have the opportunity to orthogonally go away

42
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,503
from what the mainstream games are doing

43
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,784
or what the big $60 retail games are doing.

44
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:11,905
You have the opportunity to, in the downloadable space,

45
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:15,127
create something completely unique and cool

46
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:18,368
that will be a fun, entertaining experience for your consumers.

47
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:26,041
Okay, budget. If you have a $10 million development budget for your live arcade game and a $20

48
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:33,287
million marketing budget, just leave now. We all hate you. That's great. I don't think

49
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:39,233
that that's reality. Reality is you don't really have much of a budget at all. You have

50
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:42,396
no marketing. You have no PR.

51
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,140
And so, you need to find ways to make that work for you.

52
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,261
You need to find ways to be unique enough

53
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,902
that the media will be intrinsically interested in what you're doing.

54
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:56,383
You need to find ways to differentiate yourself.

55
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:58,344
And again, lots of opportunity there

56
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:02,285
with so much noise of, you know, again, all these big games.

57
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:05,186
You have an opportunity to be unique and special

58
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,486
and push things that way.

59
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:29,069
Tech. Tech is something that we're going to talk about a little bit. We debated this for a while, but we ultimately came to the conclusion that every minute we would spend writing our own technology would be a minute someone else would spend who used licensed technology to be focusing on gameplay.

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:37,094
And so we, when we first started Shadow Complex, we were an independent studio kind of doing our own thing.

61
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:41,086
About halfway through developing Shadow Complex, we were acquired by Epic Games.

62
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:44,309
So that probably gives you some clue into what technology we decided to go with.

63
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,434
But that really was one of the best decisions that we ever made, because that allowed us

64
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:56,861
to focus completely on creating unique, cool gameplay instead of writing a renderer or

65
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,862
a physics engine.

66
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:00,064
The consumer does not care about that.

67
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,066
They care about what you're doing cool in your game.

68
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,442
And then memory. At least at the time when we started Shadow Complex, this was a pretty big issue.

69
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:15,984
When we first started Shadow Complex, we were under the impression that our game had to be under 150 megabytes total.

70
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:21,906
Our previous game, Undertow, was under 50 megabytes, and we learned a lot on making that game

71
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:27,348
of how to really, really, again, kind of embrace the limitations of how much memory you have.

72
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,912
and find ways to boil your game down to its core essence of fun.

73
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,633
And we're going to talk a lot about that.

74
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:35,513
Okay.

75
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,455
So, we came to the conclusion

76
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,936
that people don't want a cheap version of their favorite retail game.

77
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,317
What I mean by cheap is, you know,

78
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:48,219
imagine if we went and spent our limited resources making

79
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,881
a kind of a hacky, crappy version of Gears of War.

80
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,976
You know, why would you want to pay $15 for a crappy version of Gears of War when you

81
00:05:56,996 --> 00:06:00,138
can go buy the full retail version and have it be awesome?

82
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:04,461
This is something that people have spent so much time making, and that just doesn't seem

83
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,701
like a smart investment.

84
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:12,165
For us, we conclude that people want a unique game experience, and I think that that's just

85
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,887
a pretty obvious statement, but sometimes it's hard to forget that when you're thinking,

86
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:19,169
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we're just going to go, we're going to take, you know, the Unreal

87
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,010
Engine because we decided to use it, and we're going to make...

88
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:24,275
You know, we're going to make Gears and we're going to sell it for $15.

89
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,135
No, you're not.

90
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:25,855
You're not.

91
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:26,676
It's not going to happen.

92
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,397
You don't have the time and you don't have the resources to do it.

93
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:34,898
So find something that can be really unique about your game and deliver a unique, original

94
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,099
game experience.

95
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:42,581
I think that people are, I mean, there's always going to be room for old ports or remakes

96
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,241
of old games.

97
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:48,396
But that isn't really what's going to drive this market forward or our industry forward.

98
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,657
We need to be originating and pushing new things forward.

99
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:52,097
Okay.

100
00:06:52,717 --> 00:07:00,180
The other thing that we decided was that we had to find what a small game could do that a big retail game wouldn't do.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,181
And so for us, you know, we deliberated about this for a long, long time.

102
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:11,683
And for us, what that ultimately meant was we tried to target an old and abandoned genre.

103
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:20,465
which to us was kind of this Metroidvania side-scroller adventure genre that had been abandoned.

104
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:22,386
No one was making games in this genre.

105
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:28,531
And we said, what if we took that genre and we fused that with some of the modern sensibilities that have come out,

106
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:32,595
some of the modern ideas of AI and physics and graphics.

107
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:34,616
That would be a really cool combination.

108
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,158
And guess what? Nobody's going to do that at the $60 price point.

109
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:43,505
No one would do that. No one's going to make a next-gen side-scroller in this style.

110
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:47,326
So we said, we're going to, and we're going to do it on this platform.

111
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:55,947
If you even wanted to experience that kind of game, you needed to have a Super Nintendo or a Game Boy or an original PlayStation.

112
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:59,008
There was nothing on the 360, even remotely close to this.

113
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,008
So we found a niche and we decided to push it.

114
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:07,329
All right. So let's kind of actually get these all up here.

115
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:16,268
So, once we determined that, we feel pretty passionately about this next stuff that we're

116
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:23,715
going to talk about. Because you have a small team, you don't have time to write really,

117
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:28,199
really lengthy documents. The most important thing that you can do is create gameplay.

118
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:36,456
So we found that it was critical for us to quickly, quickly plan out what our game was

119
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:39,698
and have big sessions with your little team.

120
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:43,181
That's the advantage you have of a little team, is that you can all gather around a

121
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,681
little table and hash it out.

122
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,904
And you can get a collective understanding quickly of what you're trying to do.

123
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:54,468
And instead of then documenting it in a 50-page design document, make a three-page design

124
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:54,928
document.

125
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:59,531
The design document for Shadow Complex was, I think it was like five pages.

126
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,130
Right. And I had a couple of couple screenshots.

127
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,274
And I mean, it was it was nothing. It was very, very boiled down.

128
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:10,922
And but we quickly, quickly focused on getting gameplay up and running when he made undertow.

129
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:15,168
So undertow was a 16 player multiplayer shooter.

130
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:20,635
Within 10 days, within the first 10 days of development, we had the entire game up and

131
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,238
running and we were playing multiplayer matches against each other and it was freaking awesome.

132
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:25,799
I mean, it was really, really fun to do.

133
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:31,483
The Shadow Complex, within the first few weeks, we were in and we were refining gameplay already.

134
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:34,425
It was just little cubes and little stuff, but we were running around and jumping around

135
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,087
and we were trying to focus on our core gameplay loop.

136
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,350
Knowing the end from the beginning, you must scope your game.

137
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:49,627
You do not have the luxury, when you're making a game of this size, to waste your time on anything.

138
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,531
There might be a few games that this isn't appropriate for.

139
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:57,334
Like, I don't know, if you're making Tetris, maybe.

140
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:04,320
Or something like that, where the pacing of your game or the scope of your game isn't as critical.

141
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,725
But almost every game type is pretty reliant on pacing.

142
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:16,725
and on timing and how the game flows through from beginning to end. It's just like making

143
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:21,926
a film. People, if they're making a film, don't make a vertical slice of their film.

144
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:28,168
They gesture it all in. They create an animatic. They create storyboards of the entire thing

145
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:36,230
so they know how it flows through. So we developed a process where we very, very quickly, rapidly

146
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,391
prototype our entire game. And with Shadow Complex...

147
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:42,502
that that that was a few different things.

148
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:46,763
So we had our little, you know, couple page document.

149
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:55,306
But what we then did is we went into Illustrator and we created the entire game in Illustrator in about.

150
00:10:55,326 --> 00:11:00,108
A month and a half period, and I'm going to zoom out and show it to you.

151
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:04,029
So this. This is Shadow Complex.

152
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,310
There's the whole game that we made.

153
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:12,264
And we spent a lot of time going through and figuring out where everything needed to be

154
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:12,664
and what to do.

155
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:17,826
For us, our entire game is completely dependent on the power-up acquisition.

156
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:21,728
Going from a little guy with a flashlight to by the end of the game you're triple jumping

157
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,328
and hook-shotting and foaming stuff.

158
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:28,470
And so if we put, in creating like a non-linear game, we had to know where all those power-ups

159
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,792
were going to be and what they would affect so that we could get everything in the right

160
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:33,212
place.

161
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,572
And so to do this, we...

162
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:40,057
And we designed it all out, and then we made these little guides.

163
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,738
This right here was our core gameplay loop.

164
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:47,539
We said, that's how high you can jump, that's how high you can double jump, that's how high

165
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,099
you can triple jump, that's the extension of your hook shot.

166
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:54,740
And we started to design out exactly how we wanted things to move and flow.

167
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,701
And then we would take this little guy, and we would play through the game.

168
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,439
So we would go to the very start of the game.

169
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,679
I don't know if any of you have played it.

170
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,540
This is where Jason and Claire first dropped down into the

171
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,221
cave, so we'd go, oh, yeah, that was a cool jump.

172
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,682
And then we would walk through the game a little bit.

173
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,123
I mean, no, I'm totally serious.

174
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:17,124
And we'd drop down and be like, oh, see how, OK, they

175
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,325
could still make that jump and get back out of that hole

176
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,285
because they could jump that high and they could ledge grab.

177
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,211
And we'd start to play through and be like, oh, we want to train them that when they fall

178
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:28,754
down into here, that they have to hold down the jump button a little bit to get up to

179
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:28,994
this.

180
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,396
And so we made that jump height so they wouldn't make it across.

181
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:35,500
And we started to just go through and play through the entire game.

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,644
And we had the entire team playtesting this map for a few weeks.

183
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,987
And we would tweak it and tweak it until we thought it was fun.

184
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:47,230
And that requires a lot of imagination, but you guys are game developers!

185
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,531
You have imagination!

186
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:49,272
You know?

187
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:49,572
So it works!

188
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:50,313
It's a lot of fun.

189
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,407
And it was awesome. We learned so much by going through this process.

190
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:59,932
And honestly, the guilty side of this was it was so freaking fun.

191
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:02,775
To like, make a game on paper and you're playing through it and you're like,

192
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:05,218
yeah, yeah, that's awesome. I totally stealth killed that guy.

193
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:05,939
You know?

194
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:14,600
It was cool, you know, and so this is like, this is the funnest game that will never get

195
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,360
released, right?

196
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,241
Because you're going through and you're like, oh yeah, man, and we sit there in meetings

197
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:23,122
and be like, yeah, I went through and I like shot that guy in the head and then I jumped

198
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:30,204
up here and then I went back and, you know, so ridiculous, but, but it was pretty, it

199
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,064
was pretty awesome.

200
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:35,085
But we learned a lot by going through this process because it really helped us to define

201
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,045
what our core gameplay loop was.

202
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,446
Once we had this down then, can we switch over to...

203
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:45,759
the game engine. So once we had this down, we then quickly, quickly went into our editor,

204
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,222
the Unreal editor, and quickly prototyped out the entire game in what we call BSP. So

205
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,723
that's just basically these little cubes. We went through the whole game, and granted,

206
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,725
even this, like we have a few crates placed or whatever. So let me show you actually on

207
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,646
the Illustrator map that room. So in Illustrator...

208
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,733
This is what this area looked like.

209
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:11,433
We initially designed out this thing where we're like, oh, we want them to kind of learn

210
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:13,974
what wall jumping is going to be, so we're going to put these ladders here so they kind

211
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:17,775
of get the idea of going back and forth and we'll have this guy on a ledge and some shootable

212
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,315
stuff here.

213
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,856
And we quickly, quickly blocked that in to BSP like this.

214
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:27,557
So same thing, I see my little elevator shaft, I have a guy there, some crates, and we quickly

215
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,837
in about two weeks did this for the entire game.

216
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,238
We just threw it in there.

217
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:36,183
And we made the entire team play through the whole game from start to finish.

218
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,125
And it sucked, but...

219
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:41,268
it totally taught us where our pacing was.

220
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:42,869
Because we could go through and be like,

221
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:43,609
oh, you know what?

222
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:45,190
This does feel like the power-up's

223
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,050
gonna be in the right place.

224
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,271
You know, for boss fights, we put in cards

225
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,452
that said, boss fight.

226
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,033
You know, for cinematics, we put in story.

227
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,674
You know, I mean, we just, and it would,

228
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:54,875
but it would pace it out.

229
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:55,675
We could start to see,

230
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,576
this is where everything's gonna happen.

231
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,998
And that allowed us to very, very quickly

232
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,399
make really, really smart decisions

233
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,880
about what we needed to cut

234
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,560
and what we needed to keep.

235
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,695
And it also taught us to focus on our core loop.

236
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:17,381
Our core gameplay loop was exploration punctuated by moments of combat.

237
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:21,825
So for us, we decided that the players were going to have the most fun

238
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,567
when they were exploring this non-linear world,

239
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,569
when they were discovering power-ups and things like that.

240
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:32,172
And everything we decided needed to support that core fun loop.

241
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:36,776
And then we had the idea of combat as contrast.

242
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:44,025
to that core loop. It was not the focus of the game. So determining that really, really

243
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,048
helped us to make, again, smart cuts.

244
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,962
I mean, again, if you look at the map, anyone that's really, really familiar with the game,

245
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,643
which I don't know if any of you are, I mean, if you look at this map, there are drastic

246
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,204
differences between this and the actual shipped game.

247
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:04,505
This whole bottom area is gone.

248
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,526
That whole flying airship in the background that you were going to get on, not in the

249
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:09,087
final game.

250
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,468
There's all sorts of areas that did, because when we initially planned out, like, oh, this

251
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:12,908
will work.

252
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:13,968
But when we played it...

253
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,490
really quickly after, like, oh, the pacing's wrong,

254
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,771
this needs to be trimmed, this needs to be edited,

255
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:20,952
and it helped us to quickly mush the game

256
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:22,973
into something that was really, really fun.

257
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:27,255
So then we just had this really ugly, fun game,

258
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,696
and we spent the rest of the development

259
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:31,157
layering on polish.

260
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:32,757
It was easy after that,

261
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,219
because all of our hard questions were answered

262
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,380
in the first few months of development.

263
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:38,720
Oh.

264
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,547
I accidentally closed our slideshow.

265
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,148
Just click on here and say from current setting.

266
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:50,992
Alright.

267
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,716
So once you have that,

268
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,698
you can start to really, really work on stuff.

269
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,003
Our philosophy is that everything that you have in your game

270
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,305
must support your core gameplay loop.

271
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,668
And really, a lot of that was taught...

272
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:14,330
to us by making undertow. Where with on undertow we literally had only 50 megabytes for the

273
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,873
whole game. So we had to look at every single, every single thing that was going in the game

274
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:24,337
and say, does this sound actually matter? Does this pixel actually matter? Does this

275
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:29,281
normal map actually matter? And it really, I mean, we had to look at every single little

276
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:34,005
thing and make these tough choices between should our guy make a sound or should he have

277
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,186
a texture map? I mean, it was literally that.

278
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:41,900
that hard, right? And so it really taught us to say, you know, we can only have things

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,984
in here that are critical to the player actually having a good time. And we kind of brought

280
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:53,688
that lean mentality into Shadow Complex, because again, we only thought we had 150 megabytes.

281
00:17:54,228 --> 00:18:00,873
So that gestural process and that kind of mindset of always be cutting really kind of

282
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:06,756
helped us to just streamline, streamline, streamline down to what actually matters.

283
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:14,567
And that kind of brings us to what I think is one of the most kind of critical things

284
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:18,250
in any game development, which is the fully integrated experience.

285
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,513
How does every feature you have loop back into your core loop?

286
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:29,594
So to give you an example of that, in Shadow Complex we have this device we call the Foam Gun.

287
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:37,780
And what it let you do is shoot these little blobs that could stick on to each other so that you could make geometry to build your own platforms and get around the world.

288
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,962
When we initially conceived of the Foam Gun, that's all it was.

289
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,504
It was a device to build platforms and navigate.

290
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:45,425
Because to us...

291
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,259
Exploration is the core loop.

292
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,660
That's all that really matters is exploration.

293
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,321
So building platforms to navigate, fun, right?

294
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,802
So we focused on that, but as we got into development,

295
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:58,703
we said, no, everything in the world needs to work together.

296
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:02,985
Because what happens if the player wants to stick some foam

297
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,505
and then throw a grenade into it?

298
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,046
Or stick some foam and then hook shot into it?

299
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:11,188
Or all sorts of other different things

300
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,288
that they would try to do.

301
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:13,828
And we found that

302
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:22,435
The more that we integrated every feature into each other, the more emergent our game became, and the more fun our game became.

303
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,878
And this is something that we discovered.

304
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,579
I think a little too late.

305
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,360
So like in our game, you can.

306
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,283
You can build foam things, you can stick a grenade into it, it'll make a bigger explosion,

307
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,925
that's awesome.

308
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:40,149
You can't, like if you build some foam and you try and hookshot into it, I think it just

309
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:40,849
bounces off.

310
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,011
I wish we would have made the hookshot work with it.

311
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:48,655
I wish we would have really, really pushed to have everything be fully, fully integrated.

312
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:52,498
And the more that we pushed that, the more that we found.

313
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:57,129
again, that just things were cleaner, things were more exciting, and I think that's something

314
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,771
that you guys should think about in your games, is how can jumping be more integrated into

315
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,231
my world?

316
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:07,233
Again, in our game, we had the jump mechanic, it was our most basic mechanic, was jumping

317
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,315
and grabbing, but as we started to kind of develop this integrated mindset, we said,

318
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:14,263
There's got to be a... it just seems obvious.

319
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:17,324
There needs to be a reason to have combat with jumping.

320
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:21,305
So we put in a ground pound, you know, that you can jump up and hit the attack button,

321
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,906
you slam down on the ground and hit guys.

322
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:29,368
And to us that was just... it started to be an extension of this idea of the fully integrated experience.

323
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:31,949
So we don't have a ton of time.

324
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:37,511
And I'm so sorry, there's a billion things I would love to say that we don't have time for.

325
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:38,592
But...

326
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:44,179
This would be the biggest advice, or the biggest stuff that we learned was don't try and compete

327
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:45,140
with the retail games.

328
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,702
Offer something unique and original and understand that you actually are competing with them.

329
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:55,584
But that's how you compete with them, is to do something that's orthogonal and different

330
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,224
than what they're doing.

331
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:04,967
And thoughtful planning and early prototyping are absolutely essential to good pacing.

332
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,388
We think that, um...

333
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:13,549
the main thing that we did right with Shadow Complex was do this, because it allowed us

334
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:19,132
to solidify the entire game experience before we'd invested too heavily in any one area.

335
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:23,294
And it really, really helped us to focus on the right, right things to polish.

336
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:29,137
And then just, you know, the final advice, every bit of effort now yields dividends later.

337
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:32,438
I mean, so push, just push to your game playable.

338
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:39,766
I promise you that if you can kind of break from the mentality of drooling down and polishing

339
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:46,652
too fast, that you will find that you're freed up to really see much more clearly where you

340
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,033
need to focus your time and efforts.

341
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:52,456
Because again, when you have a small team, no budget, and all the constraints that you

342
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:55,119
have, you must, must make smart decisions.

343
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,842
And that's what we have found is the best way to do that.

344
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:00,863
So moving forward.

345
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,544
There's so much that we learn on shadow complex. We definitely don't know what we're doing.

346
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:13,248
You know, we're just we're just trying to make our best decisions as we go along.

347
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:19,232
We've started to really push this philosophy into our next project.

348
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:25,736
And now it's kind of a little different because we're really focusing on expanding and growing our team.

349
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:29,058
So we're going from a team of shadow complexes made with nine people.

350
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:31,805
So we had six artists and three programmers.

351
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:35,707
And we're now pushing a little bit in a different direction

352
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:36,347
and growing.

353
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:39,089
And we're trying to apply the same principle

354
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:39,849
to what we're doing.

355
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,670
And we're finding all sorts of new things.

356
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,952
But I'm telling you that this works.

357
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:49,714
And that's about all I have to say.

358
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:52,455
So questions.

359
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,937
Please, please let us know how we can help.

360
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:57,517
What questions do you guys have?

361
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:58,438
We have about.

362
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,434
two minutes for questions, but there's not another thing in here for half an hour.

363
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:05,339
So I'll answer questions until they shut off my mic.

364
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,466
Once you had the BSP layout after your paper file, how do you make changes?

365
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:15,073
Did the BSP layout become your existing roadmap?

366
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,631
uh... you might coming out what would you say that that the sd file can become

367
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:23,753
you're working like map of the game it is yeah someone's so actually did is the

368
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:27,936
bsp once we have a lot then and kind of refined that actually became all of our

369
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,097
collision geometry

370
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,998
the entire and we took the whole bsg map

371
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,279
converted to collision

372
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:32,979
and then

373
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:35,581
i don't know if we have

374
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:37,582
i'll show you a fast

375
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,543
select this level

376
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:41,404
in its and state

377
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:49,267
this, right? So this is what it starts to look like when it was actually finished. And

378
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:53,772
you can see that those little blocking volumes, that used to be the BSP, and that got changed

379
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:58,317
into stuff. And we refined that gameplay and kind of moved everything around. So, yeah,

380
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:58,958
it was perfect.

381
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:06,085
Hi. Nice and quick. 6.3 code, how long would you say until you got to like alpha beta?

382
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:11,178
So we, so Undertow came out in November of 2007.

383
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,881
We had that little illustrator map at that point.

384
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:21,205
And our alpha, our alpha for us meant completely, not just the BSP playable,

385
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,386
but every boss was in, every cinematic was in.

386
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:27,389
We could truly see everything, and that was about ten months later,

387
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:31,412
that next October, November, is when we were there.

388
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:38,631
How did the change from the 150 megabyte limit to whatever limit it is now, how did that

389
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:41,032
affect your design and development process?

390
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,714
Did it occur early enough that it didn't really matter?

391
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:49,178
Really what it let us do was, so on Undertow, what our plan was, we still wanted all the

392
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:54,502
content, so we were just planning on really, really, really compressing the audio.

393
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,584
So Shadow Complex was 834 megabytes, which is a lot bigger than 50.

394
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:05,437
help me out with. 450 megabytes of that was audio. And we

395
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:09,820
localized full audio in nine languages. So just removing

396
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,162
that, the game was only 400 megabytes. So we just allowed

397
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:16,083
our audio not to be so compressed. But audio and

398
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,564
textures, that's the big stuff.

399
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,026
Hey, making games for XBLA, we've kind of discovered that

400
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:25,428
the trial portion, like that experience is really, really

401
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:27,930
important. Is there anything surprising you guys learned

402
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,651
trying to make that as good as possible?

403
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:31,131
Uh, yeah.

404
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:56,340
No, you're right. I probably should have touched on that, and I apologize. The demo is critical, because you have no choice in giving away a portion of your game for free. So that really is your marketing. Your marketing is your demo. And we, on Undertow, we felt like we did not spend enough time focusing on our demo. And on Shadow Complex, we spent a ton of time focusing on the first

405
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,048
five seconds of gameplay, the first 30 seconds of gameplay,

406
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,809
the first five minutes of gameplay,

407
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:04,510
the first 20 minutes of gameplay, which was the demo,

408
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,491
and then the first 90 minutes of gameplay.

409
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,292
And we spent a lot of time.

410
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:11,073
Again, for Shadow Complex, we considered

411
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:13,874
the first five seconds of gameplay our title screen.

412
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:17,815
And so we purposely put a lot of really pretty graphics

413
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:18,596
on our title screen.

414
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:21,497
So the first thing you saw was, ooh, pretty game.

415
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,237
I've never seen this on Live Arcade before.

416
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:24,098
And so

417
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:27,222
We considered that the first interaction with the player.

418
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:28,124
And I do.

419
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,767
It's critical that you focus on that.

420
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:31,030
And what we found was.

421
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:34,152
You have to give the players a really, really good time,

422
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:37,175
but you've got to leave them really, really hanging.

423
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,677
So the best thing you can do is get them,

424
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:42,038
and we did lots of play testing to try and get this,

425
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,419
get them right to the moment where they're like,

426
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,461
this is awesome, this is awesome, and then take it away.

427
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,743
No, that's what you have to do, because if they're satisfied

428
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:50,785
at all, then they're satisfied.

429
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,086
They're like, ah, that was cool.

430
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,228
But that's not as good as, oh, oh, it's

431
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:55,569
going to be so awesome, no, buy?

432
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,030
OK, OK, I'll buy it.

433
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,832
So you want to kind of create that feeling of,

434
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,033
I must have more.

435
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:01,793
And.

436
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:06,806
I don't know how successfully we did that with Shadow Comics, but we have a pretty high conversion rate, so...

437
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:17,814
But, even moving forward, we have all sorts of ideas for next kind of titles and how we can make that an even more refined process of getting people appropriately titillated, right?

438
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:20,035
I mean, yeah. Okay, one more question.

439
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:26,440
Yeah, hi. I was just wondering, within your marketing plan, what are the things that you did to make your game unique and stand out?

440
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,540
Sorry, what?

441
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,963
Within your marketing plan, what are the things you guys did to make your game stand out and really unique?

442
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:38,972
So we think that some of the key things were, we took this old genre that we thought was beloved,

443
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:42,334
and luckily we guessed right, that people actually wanted games in that genre.

444
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:46,117
So a lot of people instantly, when they heard we were making that kind of a game,

445
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,078
that was a big draw.

446
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:49,919
But we also knew the drawback of that was,

447
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,742
if we were going to compete with these old games that are beloved,

448
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:57,724
our game had to really, really measure up.

449
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:01,026
So if you're going to go that far and be that bold, you have to like...

450
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,546
you have to deliver or else you're screwed, right?

451
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:08,950
And so I think an unused genre was a big deal.

452
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,334
We really, really thought that graphically we

453
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,575
had something that we could say.

454
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,377
There just hadn't been a lot of games.

455
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:18,279
I mean, we don't have the best graphics ever.

456
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,500
I mean, whatever, it's fine.

457
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,602
But in the space, there were not other games

458
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:23,783
that looked like this at the time.

459
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,985
And so we thought that that would be a big advantage.

460
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,500
That was all this window dressing to get people to play the game.

461
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,183
Because once we could get the media playing the game,

462
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:37,607
we knew that we had a fun, fun core game.

463
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:40,970
And that as they played the game, they would start to evangelize it for us.

464
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,192
So that was the key.

465
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,175
Oh, and okay, one last thing.

466
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:49,437
I'm going to probably get in trouble for saying this because it's such an awesome secret.

467
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,941
But this is the first game we launched with Twitter.

468
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:55,223
And one advantage that you guys have...

469
00:28:55,928 --> 00:29:01,814
that retail games don't is your game is downloadable. So a few days before Shadow Comics came out,

470
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:06,339
we got codes that we were supposed to give to the media to review. And we gave them codes

471
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:13,527
to review, but we also a few days before started leaking codes out onto Twitter. And so we

472
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:17,872
had people, a few random customers, playing the game.

473
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:23,593
before it actually shipped. And we exploded on Twitter. We were like the number three

474
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:31,356
thing on Twitter behind Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears crotch for like two weeks. And that

475
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:35,077
was huge because so many people were out there talking about, oh my gosh, Shadow Complex,

476
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:38,999
I'm playing it, it's awesome, it's so fun because people want free stuff. And you have

477
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:45,081
the ability to give your game away in a way that retail can't do. So try and think of

478
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,062
ways to use viral marketing to your advantage.

479
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,361
OK, thanks guys.

480
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:49,703
Sorry.
