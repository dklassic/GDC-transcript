00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:06,944
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:10,967
Thanks for coming by at the very, very end of GDC.

3
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,249
Happy to see so many people here.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:17,612
This is Legal Battle Royale, Not Boring Edition.

5
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:21,736
And put bluntly, the idea is to go

6
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:26,099
through hot and interesting topics in the game industry

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,682
from a legal perspective, but in a way that's going

8
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,303
to be useful to non-lawyers.

9
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:33,805
So can I get a sense of who in the audience,

10
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:34,746
how many lawyers do we have here?

11
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:38,399
Okay, oh, uh-oh.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,201
Uh-oh, sleeper agents.

13
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:45,305
But for those of you who are non-lawyers,

14
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,167
I assume that most of you are here

15
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,390
because you have either some questions

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,392
or you want to get a better sense

17
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:54,374
of how legal issues are going to impact decisions

18
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:57,297
you make as developers or publishers.

19
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:03,071
I think what we're going to do is maybe take about half the time to go through a couple

20
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:09,134
of topics that we consider pretty interesting and that are currently kind of hot legal topics

21
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:12,556
that we think there's something important to say about, and then about halfway through

22
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,616
we'll switch over to audience questions.

23
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,118
And I've got a million things we could talk about, so if there aren't a lot of burning

24
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:19,579
questions we can always go back to that.

25
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:24,941
So, I think I'm going to go through and allow everyone to introduce themselves.

26
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:25,421
I'll start.

27
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:26,261
My name is Chris Reed.

28
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:30,042
I'm in-house counsel for Tilting Point, who is a mobile game publisher and growth marketing

29
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:30,522
company in New York.

30
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:31,423
And then we have Stephen.

31
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:31,523
Right.

32
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:31,983
I'm Stephen MacArthur.

33
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:36,144
I will stand up just one time so that everyone on that side of the room can see me.

34
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:36,504
Hello.

35
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:37,885
I'm Stephen MacArthur.

36
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:38,505
I'm a developer.

37
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:39,005
I'm a developer.

38
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:39,325
I'm a developer.

39
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:39,905
I'm a developer.

40
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:40,426
I'm a developer.

41
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:40,886
I'm a developer.

42
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:41,226
I'm a developer.

43
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:41,506
I'm a developer.

44
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:41,966
I'm a developer.

45
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,207
I'm a developer.

46
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,022
My name is Stephen MacArthur.

47
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,904
I run a small law firm of four or five attorneys in Los

48
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:50,185
Angeles, and we work with video game developers.

49
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,687
I'll also stand up and wave to the other people with crazy

50
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:55,687
colored hair.

51
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:56,748
I'm Mona Ibrahim.

52
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:58,749
I'm with Interactive Entertainment Law Group.

53
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,870
We are based in El Segundo, California,

54
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,391
which is in Los Angeles.

55
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:07,113
And we represent about 300 companies, publishers, and

56
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:09,754
developers, all exclusively in the game space.

57
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:12,995
My name is Greg Boyd.

58
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:15,738
I am partner at Frankfurt Kernet, Klein & Selz.

59
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:18,360
We have office in New York and in Los Angeles.

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,303
We're a media and entertainment firm in general.

61
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:25,287
But my group is mainly interactive entertainment.

62
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:27,490
And I do about the other half of my time in advertising.

63
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:32,153
So I think before we get started,

64
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,053
there's two things I want to do.

65
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,635
And the first is that in the interests

66
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:42,177
of helping bridge the gap between lawyers and humans,

67
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:44,698
I've gotten some visual signifiers.

68
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,498
A lot of times people say,

69
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,779
hey, can you give me that contract

70
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,139
in like human readable format?

71
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,160
Which I've always taken a little bit of offense to

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,342
because it implies that lawyers aren't humans.

73
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:53,582
But-

74
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,162
We're not.

75
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:56,163
Yeah, not fully human.

76
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,443
We're more human than human.

77
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,844
Totally cyborgs, by the way.

78
00:02:58,844 --> 00:02:58,924
Yeah.

79
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:04,167
So, the idea is going to be that a lot of questions we're going to answer from a legal

80
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:08,970
perspective, giving sort of an angle from our legal knowledge, but then there may also

81
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,752
be cultural or non-legal aspects to the question.

82
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:16,734
And I want to be really distinct as when we're talking as lawyers and when we're speaking

83
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:17,195
as humans.

84
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:21,897
So to that end, we've got two sets of hats so that you can, we can literally wear our

85
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:25,660
lawyer hats when we're being lawyers and wear our human hats when we're pretending to be

86
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,740
human.

87
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:26,980
So.

88
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,681
Wait, pretending?

89
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:30,609
Yeah, emulating.

90
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,690
You're giving away the gifts.

91
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,630
Do I get to keep this?

92
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,591
Because this is awesome.

93
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:34,231
Oh, absolutely.

94
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:34,892
Oh, this is badass.

95
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,913
That's the gift.

96
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:37,913
There you go.

97
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,614
Best swag, best swag of GDC.

98
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:40,455
I know, I'm sorry.

99
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:40,595
It's okay.

100
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:40,895
I'm sorry.

101
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:41,636
You can hold it up.

102
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:42,416
I'll still wear it.

103
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,217
You don't have to wear it.

104
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:43,977
I'll still wear it.

105
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,310
All right, I'm going to start as lawyer.

106
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,691
What are you going to be?

107
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,632
I'm going to be human.

108
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:53,273
And the second thing I want to point out is,

109
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:55,855
and you've of course heard this if you've ever

110
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:59,158
dealt with lawyers, but we do not represent any of you.

111
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,399
Our firms are not representing you.

112
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:05,562
When we speak, we're giving generalized information

113
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,884
about legal issues and not specific legal advice

114
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,645
that you should go home and act on.

115
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,627
So I know that there will be questions where it's like,

116
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,608
well, my friend has this really specific scenario.

117
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,569
We can tell you generally about it,

118
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,869
but it's not legal advice.

119
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:21,330
And I think it also is important to state

120
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,130
that we all work for firms or for companies,

121
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,971
and the opinions we're gonna give

122
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,272
do not reflect those of the companies we work for

123
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:30,192
or any of the clients.

124
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,013
And there'll be certain issues

125
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:34,213
upon which some of the panelists cannot speak

126
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,334
because they may be working

127
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,955
with people involved in those issues.

128
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,415
So if someone is, yeah.

129
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,296
The human hats will be helpful there, but even then it's,

130
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,836
so if someone gets a little cagey,

131
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,316
it's probably because they're working,

132
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:50,937
you know, we're talking about one of their clients.

133
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,078
Okay, so with that, I'm just gonna jump around

134
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:56,678
to a couple of issues that I think probably

135
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,799
are top on people's minds that they've heard about.

136
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:05,160
And I think we kind of have to start with dancing.

137
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,180
I think everyone's aware that there's been a series of,

138
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,486
a series of lawsuits leveled at Epic for dances

139
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:16,288
that you can buy as emotes in Fortnite.

140
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,951
And they're not the only company that has emotes

141
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,675
that may be based on identifiable real-world dances.

142
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:25,658
But I think I wanted to throw it open to the panel.

143
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,580
From a legal perspective, how...

144
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,863
how likely are any of these suits to succeed?

145
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,484
And can we maybe just give a quick primer

146
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:39,485
on why you think that and how the law in this area works

147
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:44,287
and what the implications may be for any games using emotes

148
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:46,808
since mocap is becoming more and more common in games?

149
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:54,691
Sure, so I'll start and I'll let you both of course jump in and interrupt me as you

150
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:54,951
please.

151
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:59,036
So this issue is very, and I will be wearing my lawyer hat for this, for sure.

152
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,165
Okay, so the issue here is what is protectable?

153
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:06,107
So what happened for those that don't know is

154
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,309
there are these dances that have been popularized

155
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,250
and sometimes created by certain people.

156
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,112
They're often simple dance steps, two or three moves,

157
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:17,294
and these people become known for them.

158
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,936
And Fortnite, you can buy emotes in Fortnite

159
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:24,298
such that you can make your character do that certain dance.

160
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:25,299
And in every situation,

161
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,226
situation, they've renamed the dance. So, for example, this rapper 2 Millie created

162
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:34,291
something called the Millie Rock in 2014 and popularized it.

163
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,474
Can you show us?

164
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:36,995
I don't know it.

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,260
You didn't pay for the emote.

166
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,941
I did not pay for the emote.

167
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,001
But, so he popularizes this,

168
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,342
and it becomes known as the Milly Rock.

169
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:50,082
So in Fortnite, they rename it to,

170
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:51,843
I don't remember, something else.

171
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,903
The Fresh is what they call it, I think.

172
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,024
But they don't call it the Milly Rock.

173
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:57,184
And they don't use 2Milly's name,

174
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,804
they don't use his likeness.

175
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,265
All they're using is his dance moves.

176
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,185
So this begs the question,

177
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:05,906
if they steal his creation from him,

178
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,826
and they use it to make money.

179
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:14,212
What cause of action does 2MILLI have? How can he be reimbursed for this?

180
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,954
Cause of action means right to sue someone.

181
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:21,098
Yes, yes. When you sue someone, when you file a lawsuit, you have causes of action such as breach of contract.

182
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:25,082
It has to fit in a certain bucket. You can't just sue someone because.

183
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:25,122
So...

184
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:25,402
Wow.

185
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,146
So the interesting thing with...

186
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:28,826
That's not true.

187
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:33,510
So one of the first things they went to is copyright law, because copyright law is supposed

188
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,194
to be there to cover creative works and creative expressions, such as music and books and poetry.

189
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:43,297
Source code even, when you draft your source code, that is covered by copyright law.

190
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:48,681
And copyright law, the statute specifically says it covers choreography.

191
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:53,124
So it would seem at a first glance that perhaps they can sue for copyright infringement.

192
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:56,647
The problem is, the short answer is, no they can't.

193
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,869
And even though they can sue for it, but they will not win.

194
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,351
And the long answer is because the copyright office

195
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,214
and the federal courts have been very, very clear

196
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,516
that you cannot get copyright protection

197
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:08,697
for a simple dance step.

198
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:08,857
So.

199
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,198
So you need like a ballet.

200
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:16,485
Yes, you need the actual legislative history talks about a 22-minute ballet, and that is

201
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,487
what you can get copyright protection dance over.

202
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,569
It's awfully specific.

203
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:19,889
Yes, it is.

204
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,491
It's pointlessly specific.

205
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:21,671
It is.

206
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:22,392
Like 22 minutes.

207
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,814
Why not like 15?

208
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:28,319
Because they gave an example of a particular ballet that happened to be 22 minutes long

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,060
is I think the issue.

210
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:33,143
And so there have been other lawsuits in the past.

211
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:36,286
There was a lawsuit in the early 80s over the electric slide,

212
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:37,607
which was this 18-step dance move.

213
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:38,908
And the creator of the electric slide

214
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:41,430
started suing people who were doing the electric slide

215
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,591
because they were doing it wrong.

216
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,800
And that pissed him off that they were doing it wrong.

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,681
So he started suing them and lost.

218
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,902
And so we have this, and as you know,

219
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:53,764
the law looks at what's called precedent in case history,

220
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:55,565
you know, what happened in the past,

221
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,007
because it's very important that we are consistent.

222
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,687
It's often more important than being right,

223
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:00,828
it's just being consistent,

224
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,049
so that people know what they can do

225
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,590
and whether they're gonna get sued or not.

226
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,491
This is called precedent.

227
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,833
Precedent, yes. So the answer is that they will probably lose their copyright lawsuits,

228
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,656
although they have a couple of other interesting causes of action around right of publicity.

229
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,477
Trademark, things like that.

230
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:23,041
Right of publicity being your right to not have people put your face on a cereal box without your permission.

231
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,321
Right.

232
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:23,561
Essentially.

233
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,382
Unfair competition would be more accurate than trademark.

234
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:29,337
So it's a right of publicity issue which differs state by state.

235
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,920
So the issue with right of publicity is, and this is a huge issue in video games,

236
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,123
is you cannot use someone's, and we'll probably talk more about this later,

237
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:41,646
you cannot use someone's likeness without paying them, generally speaking,

238
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:42,887
because it's an economic right.

239
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,048
And what is your likeness?

240
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,690
Your likeness is your image, your name.

241
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,252
And some voices, someone has, I think Barbara Streisand won

242
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,414
that her voice was her likeness.

243
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,275
But

244
00:09:54,638 --> 00:10:01,524
So to win these cases based off likeness, it is very difficult because they have to argue that the floss, for example,

245
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:04,486
the kid that does the floss, if you see anyone do the floss...

246
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,247
I want to see the floss first.

247
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,229
You have volunteered.

248
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:08,930
Chris.

249
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,733
I don't know, something like this?

250
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,862
Yes! You can't see it, it's behind the thing.

251
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,343
My niece was teaching me that one. It's the one that goes like, one, two...

252
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,125
Yeah, I think you have to go in front and behind.

253
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,025
Yes. It's very complicated.

254
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:24,027
My nine-year-old niece was teaching me this at Disney World.

255
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,830
We have some volunteers in the back flossing, it's amazing.

256
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,331
Nice! There we go! Perfect.

257
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:34,357
So the long story short is this is going to be an uphill battle for them to win because

258
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:39,523
they have to establish that when you see this dance, it has become merged with their likeness.

259
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:40,965
It's basically a photograph of them.

260
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:45,670
And it's going to be really difficult for them to win that argument, I think.

261
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:51,695
point out though on that particular right of publicity issue is that, so for example,

262
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:58,079
the Carleton, the only dance I actually know out of all of these different cases, the Carleton

263
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,602
dance is actually owned by the studio that did the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

264
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:08,245
So the issue is more about preemption because the copyright law would preempt the right

265
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:10,126
of publicity that Carleton has.

266
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,998
Yeah, there's a lot of issues and preemption is another one.

267
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:19,022
These guys have a lot of reasons they're probably not going to win their cases, but that pulls

268
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,003
up another issue.

269
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:23,885
So speaking as a human now.

270
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,629
What does this mean if I'm a publisher or I'm a developer?

271
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:34,792
Practically speaking, given that there's a lot of cultural

272
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:39,174
artifacts like dance moves that sort of blow up, become

273
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:42,315
viral, and that a lot of times people want to reference in

274
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,816
their games in one way or another.

275
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:47,178
What does this mean for developers in how they're

276
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:48,138
going to?

277
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:51,619
How they're going to approach thinking about the risk of doing things?

278
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:55,001
Does that, you know, what you just said, does that mean, sure, fair game?

279
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:57,702
Should we just jump in and grab whatever we want?

280
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:03,804
You know, practically speaking, does it make sense to approach people who are creators of these?

281
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,925
And how do you even determine who gets credit for that?

282
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,905
Just ask your lawyer.

283
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:08,506
Right, so...

284
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,047
I mean, at the end of the day, it's a case-by-case basis, right?

285
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,588
We're not talking about something that you can just give a blanket answer to on this one.

286
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,620
Because it's going to come down to how much are you using, who are you taking it from,

287
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,223
how big, like how much of a mark are you going to be on the radar in terms of liability.

288
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:24,643
Go ahead.

289
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,824
I want to, I'm going to do the, I'm going to do the human hat for a second.

290
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:32,066
This is the way I explain it to people when they come to me.

291
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:39,649
So the more successful your game is, the worse cases people will bring against you.

292
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:40,009
And … ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

293
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:45,675
The less people play your game, the more you can do anything you want.

294
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,425
Okay, now you can come to me and I can tell you what the law is and here's the thing and I'm not talking about

295
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,527
In fact, I can't discuss this particular game

296
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,910
Let's be a hundred percent clear because we do an enormous amount of that particular game

297
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,314
But in general if your game makes a hundred million dollars a year

298
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:09,899
You are going to have to be beyond spotless or else and you're just gonna have a ton of things that have nuisance suits

299
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,901
now at the same time if you have a browser based game

300
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:16,984
that your grandmom and your aunt will play and your second grade teacher

301
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:21,368
put Kim Kardashian in it. You know, put

302
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,469
a Buy Now for heroin in it. I mean

303
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:30,474
the thing that I'm not actually... You might want to remove the human hat for that one.

304
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,415
And obviously not

305
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:35,317
connected to real Buy Now for that. But I'm just saying you can take a

306
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:38,700
tremendous amount more risk when you have a small audience but by the time

307
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,502
that you become very successful and think about a top 20 publisher

308
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:47,166
Things have to be ultra-buttoned up and things have to be conservative necessarily.

309
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:52,010
And you're going to, there's nothing you can do, you're going to draw crappy cases

310
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,712
and you're just going to have to have a budget for that.

311
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,123
Yeah, this is, I think being extremely successful, there is just a tax and people suing you is

312
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,544
just a tax on success and there is no way around it.

313
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,486
I have clients asking me, how can we avoid getting sued by patent trolls?

314
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,907
How can we avoid patent infringement?

315
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:07,467
Don't make money.

316
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,288
Exactly.

317
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:09,188
The answer is you can't.

318
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,750
At a certain point of success, you will be sued and you will be sued for patent infringement

319
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,552
and there is literally nothing you can do to stop it.

320
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,650
That's all I had to say, like don't make money.

321
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,070
That's pretty much the only way to not get sued.

322
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,033
And the interesting thing is there were many other video games doing this exact same thing,

323
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:25,953
yet they weren't sued.

324
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:29,535
Only Fortnite was sued, even though many other companies were doing this.

325
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,917
So, I have a question about, I'm going to put on my human hat,

326
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,718
because this is a legitimate question about World of Warcraft.

327
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:37,399
And I say this as somebody who played World of Warcraft for years.

328
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,699
There are all sorts of dances.

329
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,960
They were all sourced from fairly popular dances.

330
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,142
On top of that, just blanket theft of general IP like Dark Crystal.

331
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:51,343
There's an entire race of creatures in World of Warcraft,

332
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:53,864
which is a straight rip off from the Dark Crystal.

333
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:57,886
So you kind of have to wonder, how is it that a company like Activision

334
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:00,807
can borrow this material without?

335
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,365
the liability that, for example, Fortnite is seeing?

336
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:10,572
Well I think one issue that is going on is that, I think a lot of it is actually driven

337
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:11,353
by this law firm.

338
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:14,777
So there's been a lot of these lawsuits against Epic.

339
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,056
And they're all based on the same thing,

340
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,878
and they're all brought by the exact same law firm.

341
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:18,959
And there's this new law firm.

342
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,121
And I think it's a little bit of a disservice

343
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,483
because I think Fortnite or Epic

344
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,284
is at the wrong place at the wrong time

345
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:27,267
because this law firm wants to get their name out there,

346
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,691
and they're using these lawsuits and these celebrities

347
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:32,312
as a way to almost market themselves.

348
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:35,376
They're not going to be very popular with other lawyers in this space.

349
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,496
I'm just going to put that out there.

350
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,358
They are very unpopular with lawyers in this space right now.

351
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:46,583
So let's, speaking of being careful as you get more successful, and I think the message

352
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,965
here has been that, yeah, you can't stop people from suing you.

353
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:54,948
The best you can do is anticipate which things might be an issue and make sure that your

354
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:55,728
house is in order.

355
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:01,194
So another area where people have to be very careful,

356
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,416
and it's also garnered a lot of attention

357
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,620
the last couple years, is loot boxes.

358
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,782
People love to have opinions about it,

359
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:12,707
both as would-be game designers

360
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:15,530
and as would-be legislators.

361
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,342
So there's been, I think, a lot of discussion about it,

362
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:25,504
but also a lot of potential and actual regulation

363
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,785
in different countries and in different states.

364
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:31,447
Where do we see this shaking out?

365
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:36,129
I mean, if I'm a company that wants to use loot boxes,

366
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,691
or let's just open it up to gambling in general,

367
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,396
I think we need to be very careful about that line.

368
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,717
Please, let's be very careful about walking that line.

369
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,899
Let's start with the question of where on the line

370
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,079
do loot boxes fall?

371
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,920
And that comes in two questions.

372
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,922
One, looking at current legislation,

373
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:58,364
is it clear whether they may be defined as one or the other?

374
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:05,288
And then if you dare to opine on where that line should be,

375
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:06,208
I'd be happy to hear that too.

376
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:11,292
Gambling requires, under almost every single state's law, at least three things.

377
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,777
Consideration, prize, and chance.

378
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:20,025
And consideration is something that you give, usually in the form of cash or currency, in

379
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:23,009
order for the right to participate in this chance to receive a prize.

380
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,788
real simple way of explaining what gambling is from a legislative perspective.

381
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:32,430
And that more or less reflects what we see in the U.S. and what we see abroad for what

382
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,353
gambling is. Now, where loot boxes become tricky is, well,

383
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:41,115
a few things. First, let's look at the question of consideration.

384
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:44,837
What are you paying for it? If you're actually paying a cash price for

385
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:48,899
it, that's one thing, and, yes, that's pretty clearly well defined.

386
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:52,901
But then you look at a game like PUBG where you're not actually paying cash for it.

387
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:56,555
the currency you're generating is from time played, right?

388
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,456
At least that was my experience playing

389
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,857
or getting loot boxes from PUBG.

390
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:04,399
If that's the case, then what is your consideration?

391
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,160
Does it qualify as actual consideration

392
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,081
under the particular statute or whatever in question?

393
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,282
Then there's the question of chance.

394
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:16,521
Generally speaking, loop boxes are going to incorporate

395
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,802
an element of chance unless you're guaranteed

396
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:20,404
to get certain things in that loop box

397
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:21,184
that you're purchasing.

398
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,247
So it may, like whether or not there are odds

399
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:26,788
associated with the loop box or not

400
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:27,809
are going to be an issue.

401
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,682
And the final thing is obviously a prize.

402
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:37,106
And the issue with a prize is that the law isn't always really clear on whether or not

403
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:39,788
a prize needs to have cash value or not.

404
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:46,372
So if the prize that you receive isn't convertible to currency in some form or can't be sold,

405
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,515
then does it actually have value enough to qualify as a prize?

406
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:54,477
So we really actually do have to be very careful about whether we call loot boxes gambling

407
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,157
or not.

408
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:59,019
And honestly, the biggest issue with loot boxes from a regulatory standpoint, at least

409
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,841
as far as the FTC is concerned, has more to do with consumer protection and keeping kids

410
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,322
from spending like 3K on their parents' credit card.

411
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:12,365
And it's really just about informing the public if there are odds and stuff like that.

412
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:18,743
And this reason she's talking about being able to sell it is one of the reasons that when you read a Terms of Use,

413
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:22,388
I'm sure you always read the Terms of Use of every video game you play and download.

414
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:22,508
I do.

415
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,192
I draft them, I don't think I've ever read one.

416
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,273
The Terms of Use...

417
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,736
I read them because I draft them.

418
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,850
I copy paste ones, man. I think they're cool.

419
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,051
Like, ooh, this one's interesting.

420
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,411
I'll save that for later.

421
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:35,692
You never have time to play anything if you're reading them all.

422
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,033
But there's terms of use in the ULA.

423
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,233
Barrett and everyone will say things such as,

424
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,394
you know, you don't own any of this.

425
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:41,994
This software is all owned by the company.

426
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:43,035
We can revoke it anytime.

427
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:46,236
Importantly, you cannot sell this, right?

428
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:47,216
So even though technically,

429
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,598
even if you maybe could go out to a third-party marketplace,

430
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,058
the terms of use in the ULA says you cannot.

431
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,719
We disallied from selling and said, we figured out you've sold this, we'll ban you.

432
00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:01,481
And this actually became very relevant in a case where the judge said,

433
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,321
there was no cash value to these loot boxes.

434
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:06,802
Because even though they theoretically could go out on these third party websites

435
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,763
and sell them, I think this was the big fish case.

436
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:11,604
It's against the rules and they don't encourage it.

437
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,444
There's no official way to sell these.

438
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,465
And it's against the rules in the terms of use.

439
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,525
And so they got that case dismissed.

440
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,806
So where do we think

441
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:25,045
So that's a good explanation of sort of where we are right now with loop boxes.

442
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:29,396
But given that this mechanic is something that seems to be, you know, it.

443
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,676
It's useful in a lot of games, and people can debate

444
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,297
whether they like it as a game design thing,

445
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:37,078
but where do we see, if we had to predict,

446
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,539
legislation and regulation on this going?

447
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,361
Because obviously right now, yeah, it's quite complicated.

448
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,702
We're trying to fit a new phenomenon into existing laws

449
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,623
that were designed for casinos and slot machines

450
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,844
and that sort of thing, and it's not clear

451
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:53,146
always where it fits, but if you had to guess,

452
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:56,568
is it gonna continue to be a patchwork and a mess,

453
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,969
different states, different countries?

454
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,005
Yeah, so I have a few, well, I don't know which one this is.

455
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:05,406
This is kind of lawyer thoughts.

456
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:12,068
So, okay, I think there are two paths on this decision tree.

457
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,968
So one is less regulation of the status quo, right?

458
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:17,649
Like I would like it if, and it sure would be nice if,

459
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,290
and I mean it for all of us, the home team,

460
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,191
the game developers, and it's not bad

461
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:24,951
for the consumers either, is if the rule was,

462
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,692
and the rule,

463
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:27,893
pretty much is now, pretty much is,

464
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,314
it's like with some exceptions,

465
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,376
if you don't have a cash out mechanism, you're okay.

466
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:31,516
Right?

467
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:34,399
But then to the extent that it becomes more regulated,

468
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,220
I hope it's not more regulated

469
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,702
than we do sweepstakes contest and promotion.

470
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:40,984
So, and look, I know that sucks too,

471
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:43,746
but the thing is sweepstakes contest promotion

472
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:47,409
has state laws, but we have a consensus.

473
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:49,091
A lot of it's about disclosure.

474
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,452
I'm not wishing for it.

475
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:53,514
You know, what I wish is something like we have right now,

476
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:55,016
but I hope it doesn't get.

477
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,758
I hope that's the far right boundary, right?

478
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:03,742
I hope that it doesn't go beyond that and cross over into gambling regulatory, which

479
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:04,443
is much worse.

480
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:11,788
But to me, right now, if it's not harming children, if there's a special disclosure

481
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:17,532
for under 13 games, then I think it's in a pretty good spot, especially if you as game

482
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:19,814
companies—this is one of the things I say to people.

483
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:26,215
Just quickly in closing on this is that you can solve a lot of this in a customer service level if a mom calls you

484
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,396
And says 17 year old boy girl, whatever

485
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,497
Spent $3,000 on my credit card

486
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:36,818
You you make it right there on the customer service level and you don't eat that money and maybe you put a stop in there

487
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:39,158
Like they can't spend more than $100 a month or something, right?

488
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:43,799
There's something you can do on a customer service level and that's gonna save us

489
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:48,625
from some regulatory intervention because then that mom or dad's story doesn't become

490
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:54,472
a news story, which is what a politician reads in an election year and decides this is some

491
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:59,358
new kind of, you know, save the kids, mom and apple pie legislation that would be really

492
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,500
easy to be elected on.

493
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,722
So that would be the ideal for me.

494
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:07,288
Following on that, and we see this in copyright too,

495
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,148
we see this in censorship in general,

496
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,729
with violence in games.

497
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:13,370
Generally the best way the industry can insulate itself

498
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,930
from regulation is to be responsible,

499
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,292
like to actually exercise some level of social responsibility

500
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,992
with how you engage with your customers.

501
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:26,534
And that is as much true for gambling and loot boxes

502
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:28,815
as it is for violence in games or anything else.

503
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:34,385
The more we try to say, well, freedom of speech,

504
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:35,726
let's do whatever we want.

505
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:36,987
We can say and do however we want.

506
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:38,908
We don't need to be responsible for it.

507
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:41,269
The higher the likelihood that eventually some government

508
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,050
is going to come in and say, oh, yes, you do.

509
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,391
You need to be responsible for this,

510
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,332
because obviously you are incapable of regulating

511
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:50,233
yourselves.

512
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,274
One of the things that the video game industry has really

513
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:55,836
benefited from are programs like the ESRB and the ESA

514
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,016
that help us self-regulate.

515
00:23:57,417 --> 00:24:01,921
The more we get to self-regulate, the better off we are in terms of being able to service

516
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:07,085
our customers and give them what they want without government interference, because governments

517
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:10,408
are really terrible at economics and customer support in general.

518
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:14,672
I'll just end this, maybe the one time I put on my human hat for tonight.

519
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:21,558
The two things I will say that may not be technically required, but generally make loot

520
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,641
box type experiences less evil is when...

521
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,295
When game companies, one, show you the odds, right?

522
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:31,917
So if there is some chase item out there that everyone wants,

523
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,538
and there's a 1 in 10,000 chance of you getting it,

524
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,080
so people are spending $1 or $2 to buy these loot boxes that

525
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,142
look for this awesome chase object,

526
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:41,623
if the consumers know there's only 1 in 10,000

527
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,465
chance of getting it, that is important.

528
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,746
And I think that's something people should know, right?

529
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,027
When they're spending money on loot boxes,

530
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,308
they should know what the odds are.

531
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:51,589
And the second thing is, usually give them,

532
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,230
if they're gonna spend a dollar on your loot box,

533
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,431
give them a dollar's worth of product in there,

534
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,471
not 10 cents worth of product.

535
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:01,313
Also, just to put that in, if you're distributing in Japan,

536
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,814
you have to do that one way or the other

537
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:04,534
due to gotcha regulation.

538
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,635
Right, many countries do require that already.

539
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,923
So I want to move over to another area that I think has kind of exploded in the last five

540
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:19,707
years in the game industry, and that's streaming and the rise of sort of influencers as a very

541
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:20,648
dominant force.

542
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:25,831
So, you know, Apex Legends dropped with almost no fanfare and basically rode to five million

543
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,352
plus, you know, installs.

544
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:33,705
on the back of A, being a good game, but B, a lot of prominent streamers playing it.

545
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:36,467
And it then came out.

546
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:40,329
Why it came out makes it sound like it was a big secret, but no surprise,

547
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:43,931
some of these streamers were paid quite substantial sums

548
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:46,413
in order to stream it at a specific time all on the same...

549
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:47,393
on the launch date.

550
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,153
I think Ninja was paid a million dollars

551
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:51,554
or something like that to play it for like eight hours.

552
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:54,994
So I wanna ask a little bit about

553
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:58,695
what we think developers and publishers,

554
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:00,435
if they're the ones handling the marketing,

555
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:03,156
need to understand when they're interacting

556
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:06,497
with influencers, any kind of marketing or advertising,

557
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,517
what kind of pitfalls are there?

558
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,277
Can I just hand over a bunch of money

559
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,898
and say, hey, play my game, say X, Y, Z?

560
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,218
What do I have to do?

561
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,631
So I'll start this off and go real quick.

562
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:20,274
So the current guidelines for influencers are the same thing

563
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,837
for people in video games as there are for people that are

564
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:25,118
selling shoes, right?

565
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,180
The Federal Trade Commission has come out and said, if

566
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,442
there's a material connection between your company

567
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:34,824
and the influencer, then that influencer needs to disclose the material connection.

568
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:40,407
This is where you see hashtag ad or hashtag sponsored or hashtag, you know, your game ambassador.

569
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:45,350
Or the streamer says, I'd like to thank game company for their support, etc.

570
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,092
The disclosure has to be clear and conspicuous,

571
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:53,614
and the disclosure has to fit the medium and travel with the medium.

572
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,816
So there's a lot of complexity to unpack there. We don't have to do it right now.

573
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:00,857
but they are supposed to say something and they are supposed to disclose.

574
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:04,781
And here's the question or here's the way that you should think about it to the extent

575
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:08,285
that you're asking the question, you're making games and you're asking the question, or to

576
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:11,768
the extent that you're an attorney and people are asking you the question.

577
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:13,530
If your creative folks come to you and say,

578
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:19,233
Hey, you know, is such and such sufficient in the tiny little mouse voice?

579
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,313
The answer is no.

580
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:24,695
The answer is no because that's not clear and conspicuous, right?

581
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:28,136
So that doesn't meet the FTC guide.

582
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:29,797
Anyway, we can chat more about this.

583
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:34,339
We now have hundreds of FTC letters saying what's sufficient, what's not sufficient.

584
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:37,100
So you know, two years ago, we were guessing.

585
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,321
We don't have to guess anymore.

586
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:45,688
if I screw this up as a developer or a publisher,

587
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:49,330
who, what's the result going to be?

588
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,251
Who's going to sue me or fine me

589
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:52,452
and who should be worried?

590
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:54,333
Should it be the influencer?

591
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,734
Should it be the developer?

592
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:59,676
You know, how should they think about this in terms of risk?

593
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:00,817
This hat, okay.

594
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:03,318
So what would likely happen.

595
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:09,873
if what's happened in the past continues to happen is the brand, the publisher, the video

596
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:14,796
game publisher or the developer would get a letter from the FTC that they would be published

597
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:19,560
and it would be embarrassing, the influencer would also likely get one.

598
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,524
Now, the fear is at this point that there would be some combined regulatory business

599
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:29,227
that would occur and what's been letters in the past will now become fines.

600
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:33,331
Because they could look at us and say, we gave you guys hundreds of examples.

601
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:36,233
We have FTC cases on disclosure.

602
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:41,517
There was a Machinima case was a case on disclosure.

603
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:45,240
The Sony Vita case with the hashtag game changer was.

604
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:50,542
AstroTurfing, which is like fake grassroots, which that was essentially also a place on

605
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,883
disclosure because if they had properly disclosed, it wouldn't have been AstroTurfing.

606
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:58,123
So they could say now that, you know, you guys have had years of warning and years of

607
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:58,843
understanding.

608
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:01,924
The, you know, the stakes are going to be higher.

609
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:06,525
The thing I do want to point out that's a really big deal that should be unambiguously

610
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:11,266
described is if you are the party paying the money, meaning you're the ultimate brand,

611
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,146
you're the developer, you're the publisher, you cannot...

612
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:19,271
absolve yourself of responsibility by putting it on the influencers or putting it on your marketing agency.

613
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:25,097
The regulators have said outright it has to be you that is responsible for policing,

614
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,719
even if it's in the contract.

615
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,361
This is going to be a little bit of both.

616
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:36,429
The reason for that is because ultimately the party paying the money is the one benefiting the most from the advertisement,

617
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:37,230
from the endorsement.

618
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:42,354
Another thing that, because I actually did a talk on this with Online Performers Group

619
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:44,596
and some other people at PAX last year.

620
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:49,901
One of the other things that I hear from a lot from influencers is, well, they gave me

621
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,522
this for free, but it's not money.

622
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,183
Like, they didn't pay me to do the ad.

623
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:58,808
Or you know, they gave me, you know, this headset to test on, to test so I can talk

624
00:29:58,808 --> 00:29:59,248
about it.

625
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,669
Do I have to disclose that?

626
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,210
And the answer is yes.

627
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,532
You still have to disclose it, because unless you actually

628
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:07,954
paid for it yourself, you are receiving some kind of benefit,

629
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:09,776
whether it's financial or otherwise.

630
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,297
And you still have to disclose that you received this.

631
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:15,419
Now how you do that in a stream, like we have that

632
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,600
hashtag ad and whatnot.

633
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:20,525
We have the 30, okay.

634
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:25,086
So the hashtag thing is great for Twitter and whatnot,

635
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,246
but when you're running a stream,

636
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:28,827
how do you do these disclosures?

637
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,288
And generally I think like the FTC

638
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,829
has written guidelines on this as well,

639
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,329
and it's generally like, you know,

640
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:37,330
if you're doing a super long stream,

641
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,130
maybe once every couple of hours.

642
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,411
If you're doing like a short one hour stream,

643
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:45,412
maybe at the beginning and maybe have a card at the end,

644
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,573
disclosing the fact, so.

645
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,253
I'll see.

646
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,174
I'll say one other quick thing about streaming.

647
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:52,836
Another thing I'm seeing more of now are transparent badges,

648
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,339
especially if you are paying a streamer to stream for two

649
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,260
hours, early access to your game.

650
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,502
They come up and they say, thanks, game company, for

651
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,063
giving me early access to this level.

652
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,144
Really excited to be playing it tonight.

653
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:06,245
And then there might be some kind of transparent badge or

654
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:06,966
something like that.

655
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,568
The key is not one click away.

656
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,190
If you're one click away, you're hosed.

657
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,570
Don't do that.

658
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,511
Could you explain that?

659
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:20,548
Sure. So one click away is like people used to ask or were curious,

660
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:24,590
well what if I go to more and then at the bottom of more there's some disclosure

661
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,253
or what if it's in the about page for the streamer? And in fact,

662
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,253
I'm, I don't want to name.

663
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:32,515
You guys can look into this or talk to me after.

664
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:38,558
There's one particularly embarrassing case that all the way at the bottom of a whole

665
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:44,141
lot of lines of more, it actually wrote something like, I can't believe that you read this far.

666
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:50,784
You know, this is so embarrassing and unlikely, but this video was sponsored by such and such.

667
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,186
And that was reprinted in the FTC opinion against.

668
00:31:56,025 --> 00:32:01,951
this party. It's like how could you allow your influencer to sort of mock the process

669
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,973
like this? Yeah, so don't be that person.

670
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:08,997
So, human hat for this, because this is a general rule for streamers, for game developers,

671
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:11,059
for everyone, don't be a dick.

672
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:15,043
That's actually a general rule for everyone, I would hope.

673
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:18,006
Audience, audience.

674
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:21,509
Yeah, so I wanted to move to audience questions, though I do feel like...

675
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:23,323
What do you think?

676
00:32:23,323 --> 00:32:24,864
Should we dive into privacy GDPR?

677
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:29,265
Do we want to do privacy transactions?

678
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:32,186
Well, I think it's important to talk about privacy

679
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,926
because I think it's connected to a lot of things,

680
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,387
but I don't want us to take like 20 minutes

681
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,527
because I want to get to audience questions.

682
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,648
So the last like sort of preceded topic

683
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,649
that I'm gonna talk about is privacy.

684
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:47,471
Privacy you may recall around May last year you got approximately

685
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:55,115
400 emails that said we've updated our privacy policy and you may have scratched your head and said why am I getting these all in

686
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:57,657
The same week and the answer is that the EU

687
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:01,338
The answer is Mona. She drafted motion

688
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:07,141
Because the clients all came within the same like three-week period right before me 31st 2018

689
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:11,747
So what happened was the EU finally put into effect a

690
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:14,690
sweeping privacy regulation that sort of altered the

691
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,353
responsibilities of anyone on the internet collecting

692
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:21,916
personal data from people in the EU, which is a lot of

693
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,418
people, and so everyone scrambled to kind of figure

694
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:28,501
out, oh, what do we have to do to become compliant, because

695
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:31,343
some of the potential fines were huge.

696
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,205
Now the problem is this is a sort of a government

697
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:35,767
regulation where they said, here's what might happen, but

698
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,088
of course nobody knew.

699
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,928
whether they were going to be mean about it,

700
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:41,649
whether they were going to be chill about it,

701
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:43,129
for lack of a better term.

702
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:47,151
And so it has a lot of far-reaching implications.

703
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,231
For instance, Tilting Point does free-to-play mobile.

704
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:53,752
We spend a lot of effort making sure

705
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:56,873
that our technology is on point to separate out personal data

706
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:57,814
and do all of that.

707
00:33:57,814 --> 00:34:01,935
And in games in general, even if it's a single-player game,

708
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:04,035
you're generally collecting quite a bit of data.

709
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:05,676
And that data can be useful.

710
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,456
Some of it is.

711
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:10,197
a name for an account or things that can identify a person.

712
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:15,560
And this is especially interesting because just earlier this week, Google announced Stadia,

713
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,700
which is their...

714
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,001
Is it Stadia or Stadia?

715
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:18,961
I don't know what they're called.

716
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:19,101
Stadia.

717
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:19,761
Stadia, yeah.

718
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:20,762
That's what I thought.

719
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:26,884
And this is going to be interesting because Google is known for having quite a bit of

720
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:27,945
information about you.

721
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:32,006
So it raises some interesting questions as to how they might, you know...

722
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:37,930
Combine that data with the data they're gonna have of your every move within games as you stream it

723
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:45,056
so I think you know if anyone wants to take sort of a very top-level explanation of

724
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:46,136
Correct is not

725
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:51,120
Of why anyone should care about it and just very very generally

726
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,625
What are the new obligations that developers and anyone that's using data, which is everyone?

727
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,246
What new obligations do we have?

728
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:02,787
So as to why you should care, I will put out a number for you,

729
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:03,367
$57 million.

730
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:07,048
That's what Google was fined by the GDPR Commission

731
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:09,908
for violating GDPR.

732
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,449
Chances are this is going to continue to be litigated.

733
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,789
They're going to fight it back and forth.

734
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:15,469
But that's $57 million most of us don't have.

735
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:21,151
So just to put that out there, GDPR Commission

736
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,131
is not afraid of fining as much as they want.

737
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:25,392
They have some.

738
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:29,204
some benchmarks for that, but they are taking it very seriously.

739
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:33,787
A couple of high-level points on this. The entire point of GDPR and the

740
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:34,927
easiest way to explain it

741
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:39,911
is private, like what they are trying to accomplish is they want to make

742
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:44,454
the internet as an industry, privacy by design.

743
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:48,776
They want companies to sell privacy as a service. They want this to be

744
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:49,977
incorporated

745
00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:52,879
in how they service their customer base.

746
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,505
So they don't want data to be the selling point for the business unless their clients

747
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:02,269
are very, very, unless their customers are very aware of that fact.

748
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:07,995
One of the biggest issues for this and one of the reasons as to why Google was fined

749
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:11,758
$57 million, which probably isn't actually that big a number when we talk about Google.

750
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,093
The reason why Google got into so much trouble,

751
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,855
or one of the many reasons as to why Google

752
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:24,779
got in so much trouble is this idea of consent,

753
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:28,643
and when you need to ask people for permission

754
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:29,704
in order to collect their data.

755
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:34,327
your privacy policy is no longer a contract and that is something that you

756
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:38,952
need to be very aware of at this point in time. If at any point you thought,

757
00:36:38,952 --> 00:36:42,215
like, if at any point you had an accept or do not accept at the end of

758
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,197
your privacy policy, get rid of it now.

759
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:48,822
Because blanket consents are not allowed. You have to ask consent at the time of

760
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:50,484
collection for that specific point of data.

761
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:57,609
And to clarify, GDPR is talking primarily about what we call personal information.

762
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:04,537
So, you know, totally anonymized data is not so much the issue as any type of data that

763
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,981
would let me figure out who you are in the really real world.

764
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,983
But their definition of personal data is extremely...

765
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:14,144
It's not just your email address, date of birth, it can be your IP address.

766
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:19,025
So the tricky part about it is that it's not just any information you collect,

767
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:22,606
it's any information when taken with anybody else that you work with

768
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:27,587
could possibly identify that individual in some context.

769
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:31,048
That is considered bullshit. It's huge.

770
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,361
I stopped myself, I said, well...

771
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,284
Oh, the cursing wasn't my issue.

772
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:41,951
No, no, I was just like, one day you might find yourself in front of a regulator and they play this back.

773
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:50,943
I would say that maybe the argument is that the execution and the way that it was drafted is perhaps not clear or helpful, but...

774
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:55,433
perhaps they are aiming at very valid goals.

775
00:37:55,433 --> 00:38:00,276
So I was just going to put the human head on and just say this entirely non-legal thing.

776
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:03,417
The statute has its own website.

777
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,158
If you print it out, it is 500 pages.

778
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,821
It is the modern Necronomicon.

779
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:17,145
So if there's something in your life that you think you should get some help with, it

780
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:17,985
is GDPR.

781
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:18,606
Okay.

782
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:19,186
Fair.

783
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:22,619
All right, so I think at this point,

784
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,221
because I think GDPR, no matter how user friendly we make it,

785
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,942
is going to make people's eyes glaze over.

786
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,503
I'm going to throw it open to questions,

787
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:35,464
because I think maybe that will be a great way to sort of see

788
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:38,586
what people in the industry are actually concerned about.

789
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:40,946
And hopefully we can provide some clarity on how

790
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:44,228
you should be approaching it.

791
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:45,108
So, yeah.

792
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:45,408
Hi.

793
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:46,569
Thanks very much.

794
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:49,010
This is a very interesting panel.

795
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:52,366
I wanted to circle back to the loot box conversation,

796
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,007
but use it in the context of blockchain.

797
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:54,127
Okay.

798
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:58,188
So, blockchain technology,

799
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:01,709
especially non-fungible tokens in blockchain.

800
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,690
CryptoKitties is what you're talking about.

801
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,830
I'm actually legal counsel for CryptoKitties.

802
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,490
That would explain it.

803
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,531
Okay, hello, nice to meet you.

804
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:11,912
So, one of the questions that I have had

805
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:18,094
is how to manage the gaming mechanic question

806
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,662
when by its very nature, non-fungible tokens,

807
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:24,843
you were saying, look, the way to solve the problem

808
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:28,064
of loot boxes is make sure you can't cash out.

809
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,124
Guess what?

810
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:32,305
NFTs are based on being able

811
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:34,686
to have secondary market sources.

812
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:38,027
So, how would you handle it?

813
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:38,387
Well.

814
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,567
That's a very specific legal question.

815
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:41,288
I would say.

816
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:41,708
Yeah.

817
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,448
Well, I would say, to a certain extent,

818
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,769
again, it comes down to those three questions, right?

819
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:50,482
consideration, chance, and prize.

820
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:53,787
So the question is really that chance, I think,

821
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:55,510
when it comes to non-fungible tokens.

822
00:39:55,897 --> 00:40:00,380
because you are effectively guaranteed to get an entirely unique token.

823
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,141
Basically, from my understanding of CryptoKitties,

824
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:06,444
whenever you create one of those non-fungible tokens,

825
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:09,145
which is basically the kitten, right?

826
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:10,847
It's the cat you actually get from the game.

827
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:13,709
Those are each unique and those are each special.

828
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:17,951
So, by virtue of the fact that they are all distinctly unique

829
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:20,853
and distinctly special and therefore non-fungible

830
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:22,895
in the sense that they cannot be exchanged for something.

831
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:27,776
identical, then they all share effectively the same value at base

832
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,877
because they are all essentially unique.

833
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:33,578
This is me over-lawyering the crap out of this question, by the way.

834
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:34,559
But that would be the argument.

835
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,480
That would be the position I would take if I were counsel for CryptoKitties.

836
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,401
So I will also say, and maybe this is the human hat, I'm not sure.

837
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:51,488
To a certain extent, there's a lot of things out there that already meet all three of those definitions, or clearly each of those, yet are not illegal.

838
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:52,069
Magic cards.

839
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:54,050
Magic cards would be my example.

840
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,712
You pay, oh god, I've not bought magic cards since like 1999.

841
00:40:56,712 --> 00:41:00,255
It was like $3 for a pack of magic cards, I don't know what it is now.

842
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:01,776
Five, okay.

843
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:02,897
Get into it, man.

844
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:03,518
Inflation.

845
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:05,719
I played a lot of Artifact recently.

846
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,962
But these are all, yeah, I know, it died very quickly.

847
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:16,044
Anyway, you are paying money for something and there's a completely random chance of what you take out of there.

848
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:18,584
It is directly exchangeable for cash.

849
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:21,925
I mean, magic cards are just directly exchangeable for cash.

850
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:25,506
So this meets the entire definition, why aren't these illegal?

851
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:26,906
Isn't this a loot box?

852
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:32,967
And yet they've been around for 20, 25 years and no one's ever gone after them.

853
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:39,266
So just because you're doing something that meets the criteria does not mean anyone's ever come to come after you.

854
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:42,388
Yeah, because that really comes down to the gambling question, right?

855
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:44,810
It comes down to how are consumers using your product?

856
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,272
How are consumers actually like playing your game?

857
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:54,037
Are they spending a dangerous amount of income in order to get that specific kitten?

858
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:58,460
And if not, then you're probably not going to be getting on anybody's radar on anybody's bad side.

859
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:58,620
Yeah.

860
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:58,820
Cool.

861
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,381
Thank you.

862
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,222
But the magic is so huge, I don't know, I can't explain it.

863
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:04,203
Magic is magic.

864
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:08,607
Maybe the regulators are, maybe they play.

865
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:08,927
Yeah.

866
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,749
And Nick Mitchell is excellent.

867
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:12,090
What's that?

868
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,293
Oh gosh, we have two, sorry, I didn't realize there were two whole things.

869
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:19,137
I'm sorry to this side of the room, by the way, that they put this in the middle.

870
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:19,938
There was no way to...

871
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:20,982
Yeah, so.

872
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:21,402
Great panel.

873
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:24,203
I have a question about historically accurate games,

874
00:42:24,203 --> 00:42:26,664
especially if you're trying to preserve history

875
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:27,485
of like our present.

876
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:28,225
Is that mic on?

877
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:28,865
It sounds like.

878
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,126
I don't think so.

879
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:32,007
Oh, can we make sure that that mic is live as well

880
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,027
just for recording?

881
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:35,829
Yes, the question's about historically accurate video games.

882
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:36,489
Video games.

883
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:36,689
Yes.

884
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,050
Taking place in like.

885
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:41,595
Just get closer to it taking place in

886
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:48,798
2019 and you want to use maybe like trademarks like logos sure of real corporations real countries real people

887
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:56,221
Yeah, like it sounds totally illegal, but like not this I think all three of us may have a lot to say about this

888
00:42:56,221 --> 00:43:01,783
But it really depends. It's extremely it's extremely context

889
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:12,159
of that. It depends. Actually, Mona, why don't you tell us about Red Dead Redemption and Pinkerton?

890
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:18,347
No, I'm not touching that. But no, oh god, that was silly. That was really silly.

891
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:23,507
Oh yeah, well so this is an example. I guess this was not modern day, but there's a lawsuit ongoing right now,

892
00:43:23,507 --> 00:43:27,969
you guys may have heard of this, of Pinkerton versus Red Dead Redemption.

893
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:32,731
That's not the name of the company, so it's essentially the IP's issue.

894
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:37,473
And Red Dead Redemption is a sort of historically accurate Old West game.

895
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:38,354
Oh wow.

896
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:43,656
And they have Pinkerton agents in them, and Pinkerton sent them a threatening letter and said,

897
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,136
you need to pay us, you need a license.

898
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,864
By the way, Pinkerton, in case anybody hasn't played

899
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:57,695
Pinkertons were this bounty hunter company or agency that used to go around and pick people.

900
00:43:57,695 --> 00:43:59,655
It's also the best Weezer album.

901
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:00,616
Yes, it is. Thank you.

902
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:05,697
Union busting, there's like photographs of them with Abraham Lincoln.

903
00:44:05,697 --> 00:44:07,438
They're real historical figures.

904
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:10,959
I actually just gave a talk on this last week with the GC of Riot Games

905
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:16,381
and it turns out he used to be a Pinkerton agent before he went to law school.

906
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:17,381
It was really random.

907
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:23,223
So the point is that a Pinkerton's going to lose this, because you can, to a certain extent,

908
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:28,805
there's something called nominative trademark fair use, and that is just one of many considerations to use.

909
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:36,588
If you want to use a modern-day game and you're getting coat caps, and on every single coat cap is a Coca-Cola logo,

910
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:39,969
you're going to get sued and you're going to lose.

911
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:40,929
If you use...

912
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,672
photographs in your game or even architecture of modern day buildings,

913
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:49,514
that could be covered by copyright and if that's on the cover of the games, maybe that's not okay.

914
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:52,476
If it's just incorporated in the game, like in Spider-Man, maybe that is okay.

915
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,697
It's so context-dependent.

916
00:44:54,697 --> 00:45:00,220
And I just want, for fun, to just describe how this actually works in real life.

917
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,000
So you have...

918
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,741
You're going to make a game, let's say there's a thousand art assets in it that could be

919
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:07,462
something else.

920
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:08,902
It's not just generic whatever.

921
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:09,542
Let's say there's 10,000.

922
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:10,082
Let's say there's 100,000.

923
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:18,205
What those folks do are they send a spreadsheet to our firm, these guys' firms, and it has

924
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,026
little miniature links to the art asset.

925
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:22,407
and it has multiple columns about it,

926
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:23,847
including where it was sourced from

927
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,528
and whether or not it was modified.

928
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:27,168
And then this one particular company

929
00:45:27,168 --> 00:45:28,268
that I'm thinking about,

930
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,329
but a lot of them do a variation of this,

931
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:33,610
we color code a column red, yellow, and green

932
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,271
based on how it's used

933
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:36,971
and what we think the relative risk is.

934
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:37,991
Another thing we haven't discussed

935
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:39,452
that goes into this analysis,

936
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:43,293
that takes, I mean, it takes months of attorney time

937
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:44,413
to go through all of the assets.

938
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:46,373
is how litigious is the party.

939
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:51,456
So, you know, like those little tree air fresheners,

940
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:52,897
those are some dangerous bastards.

941
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:53,978
I'm just letting you know.

942
00:45:53,978 --> 00:45:57,181
Lindsay Lohan will sue you.

943
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:57,261
Yeah.

944
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:58,542
Anything Disney.

945
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,746
I mean, I think to summarize on a practical level, though,

946
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:05,268
you never know who's going to sue you.

947
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:09,090
There are risks, and it depends on if you're a tiny indie,

948
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,032
where you don't make any money, so no one cares.

949
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:14,614
And it depends on who you're using and how.

950
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:17,096
So there are no blanket rules for this.

951
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:21,338
So there's a lot of questions, so for the next couple,

952
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:24,200
I'm going to ask that we try and keep it

953
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,921
to a nice pithy response, so everyone can

954
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:26,862
get to ask their questions.

955
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:33,184
And I'm sorry in advance, because somebody like that question, we could have a whole one hour talk on.

956
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:35,664
It will all be available outside afterwards, by the way.

957
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:36,445
So, well, at least I won't. Are you guys?

958
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:36,545
Yes.

959
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:36,845
Stick around?

960
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:38,305
For like 15 minutes. I got a client meeting.

961
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:38,525
Okay, cool.

962
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:39,265
Okay, yes.

963
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:44,787
Okay, so this goes back to the issue of privacy.

964
00:46:44,787 --> 00:46:47,047
It kind of goes beyond just the GDPR.

965
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:52,089
Companies like Facebook and Fitbit and Google and so on,

966
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,950
they've been dealing with sort of personally identifiable information for a long time.

967
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,792
and they have formed, typically have formed,

968
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:04,973
an in-house review board of some sort,

969
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:06,273
which is not just lawyers,

970
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:09,675
but also user advocates and technical people and so on,

971
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:13,876
who basically review the issues here

972
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:17,077
and give a thumbs up or down

973
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:19,258
as to whether this process should be implemented.

974
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:27,283
This is sort of analogous to institutional review boards that you get in universities doing human subject testing.

975
00:47:27,283 --> 00:47:37,849
I'm wondering is there any kind of structure or standard way of dealing with this within the games industry?

976
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:37,889
No.

977
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,683
There's nothing standardized yet.

978
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:44,845
To keep in mind, a lot of these companies came into this

979
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:48,087
pretty late, in games in particular.

980
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:51,631
As I said, most of my clients didn't come to me, even though

981
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:54,433
I gave them notice on GDPR about a year ago, or a year

982
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:55,454
before.

983
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:02,131
they didn't start even thinking about implementing any kind of consumer-facing documentation

984
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:07,034
or their own back-end process until like a month before it went, until a month before

985
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:07,935
GDPR went into effect.

986
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:14,638
So do they, like, they are in the process of trying to establish a process right now.

987
00:48:14,678 --> 00:48:19,499
They haven't, most of the companies that I've worked with and even some of the bigger companies,

988
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:27,001
with the exception of a few who, you know, are owned by Google or Hasbro, for example,

989
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:31,202
because it's a very well-defined process.

990
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:35,302
You know, some companies have gotten there, usually the bigger ones, Microsoft, you know,

991
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:41,824
Wizards, whatever, but the smaller studios and the smaller publishers and the indies,

992
00:48:41,824 --> 00:48:43,424
no, they're still trying to figure this out.

993
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:46,525
Seems like it'd be good scope for an industry-wide sort of thing.

994
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:50,047
It costs a lot. I'm sorry. I have to, like, seriously censor myself. I apologize.

995
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:50,987
Thank you.

996
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:52,588
Oh, a quick reminder, by the way.

997
00:48:52,588 --> 00:48:55,148
After the talk, please do fill out the evaluations.

998
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:58,450
They're very, very helpful to let us know how we did.

999
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,971
So, you know, any comments, concerns, et cetera.

1000
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,092
And they should send you an email about it.

1001
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:04,232
Yes?

1002
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,693
So I kind of have a loaded question.

1003
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:11,215
Get really close to that mic, man. It's not good.

1004
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:11,555
I kind of have a...

1005
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:20,036
a loaded question away. So recently Civilization VI updated their EULA. And one of the paragraphs,

1006
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:26,379
I don't have it on me so I can't quote anything, but essentially allowed them to access and

1007
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:31,901
read any information whatsoever, not necessarily restricted to their product on our computers.

1008
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,584
and they updated that and with the,

1009
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:40,188
expands into the question with a lot of games,

1010
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:42,331
games only actually provide you the EULA

1011
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,632
after you purchase the game.

1012
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:47,155
And if they update at any time, you're not able,

1013
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:49,858
unless you agree to it, you're not able to play the game

1014
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:51,320
that you purchased and spent money on.

1015
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,342
If we take an example of Stellaris, that's $300 worth of game right there.

1016
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:56,083
Yeah, that's two entirely different questions.

1017
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:59,226
The second one is like a huge issue we actually discuss.

1018
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:02,468
It's like one of these few kind of issues we discuss in law schools,

1019
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:03,869
these shrink wrap agreements.

1020
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:07,432
You've already bought a game, and then you've already bought some software product.

1021
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:09,554
You get home and open it, and it says,

1022
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:11,896
great, you have now agreed to these terms of use.

1023
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:13,857
And essentially, if you can return it,

1024
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:16,939
If there's a method, I think, of returning it,

1025
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:19,701
then you are deemed, because you have not returned it,

1026
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:20,761
to have agreed to it.

1027
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:22,742
So I think as long as there's a method of returning it

1028
00:50:22,742 --> 00:50:25,484
or refunding your money, then you are out of luck.

1029
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,986
And they said, well, sure, you paid $300 for it, opened it,

1030
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:29,547
but you could have returned it.

1031
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:31,168
You had, like in Steam, when you buy something,

1032
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:33,349
you got like two hours or something to play it and return it.

1033
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,870
So you're SOL.

1034
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:39,733
Well, and just really quickly on that.

1035
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:40,813
So in my experience,

1036
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:46,104
If you contact the publisher and it means a lot to you, you can get your money back.

1037
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:48,385
That's what I always advise them to do.

1038
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:48,725
Try it.

1039
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:49,605
See if it works.

1040
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:51,686
They may ask you to send the game back or not.

1041
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:56,568
The second thing is the reason it has to say something that looks like that is because

1042
00:50:56,568 --> 00:51:02,750
the best cheat programs run entirely outside of the software.

1043
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,151
They're not looking at your Facebook photos.

1044
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:07,531
They shouldn't be.

1045
00:51:13,013 --> 00:51:13,814
Thank you.

1046
00:51:13,814 --> 00:51:15,214
Yes.

1047
00:51:15,214 --> 00:51:20,136
So my question has almost nothing to do with anything you've spoken about, which...

1048
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:20,396
Excellent.

1049
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:23,097
I mean, yes, I really enjoyed what you spoke about,

1050
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:28,099
because I have a consumer viewpoint about a lot of those topics that you mentioned.

1051
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:30,520
But my question is, I'm an indie,

1052
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,721
and we are a team that just came together as friends,

1053
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:37,562
wanting to make something really cool.

1054
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,663
We all care about, oh, I see an expression.

1055
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:46,416
We all care about the product and we all want to make it happen, but there has been almost

1056
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:51,457
no conversation as to how we're going to actually make this a business.

1057
00:51:51,457 --> 00:51:59,219
And while I think everyone would agree that having legal protections and bylaws and all

1058
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:01,900
that would be amazing and would be helpful in the long run.

1059
00:52:03,195 --> 00:52:08,778
I am concerned about bringing it up because we haven't had this conversation at all, and

1060
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:14,761
I don't even know if other people in the team have even thought about it.

1061
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:17,142
So, I have a quick question just to kind of elaborate.

1062
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:19,924
Is this a hobby project or are you actually planning on selling it?

1063
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:21,565
We're actually planning on selling it.

1064
00:52:21,565 --> 00:52:27,067
Then you need to incorporate or otherwise form a business entity because this is not

1065
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:27,628
a hobby?

1066
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:31,029
Well, my question is more not do we need to do this?

1067
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:31,490
More of.

1068
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:35,660
How do we broach this subject between a group of friends

1069
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,985
who, you know, we trust each other,

1070
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:41,594
but this is still contentious and difficult?

1071
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:01,794
Yeah, I agree.

1072
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:03,896
That's very well said.

1073
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:06,598
You need to be able to have that conversation.

1074
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:10,521
So, and also just, this is a situation I've seen quite a few times is,

1075
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,644
you guys don't incorporate or you guys have just some kind of loose agreement,

1076
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:14,825
maybe some handshake agreement.

1077
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,646
There's four of you, each on a fourth of the company,

1078
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:17,727
you're going to go forward.

1079
00:53:17,855 --> 00:53:18,956
This is great.

1080
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:21,938
Well, in six months, one of you takes a job at Epic,

1081
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:23,940
and now they're out of the picture.

1082
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,542
Two years later, your game releases.

1083
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:26,562
It's a huge success.

1084
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:27,143
Well, guess what?

1085
00:53:27,143 --> 00:53:28,664
That guy that never really worked on the game,

1086
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,366
that took the job at Epic and never input anything else,

1087
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:31,547
still owns a fourth of your game.

1088
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,201
So he owns a fourth year game.

1089
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:37,642
We were opposite counsel on this.

1090
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:39,823
You better have an agreement in place.

1091
00:53:39,823 --> 00:53:46,685
Yeah, and I too have been on, I've been on, I think we ended up settling this case, so it's not public,

1092
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:52,607
but for almost $100 million on a mega, mega game that just nobody decided to talk to each other for a long time.

1093
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:55,268
Somebody just went away and they thought they weren't ever going to hear from him again

1094
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:57,768
until that game started to make some real, real money.

1095
00:53:58,088 --> 00:54:03,050
I just realized that we actually had, that we were, the first time I ever worked against you on a case.

1096
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,110
This is the exact thing you did.

1097
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,311
Yeah, Zorna and I were opposite each other on a very contentious deal where this is literally what happened.

1098
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:13,452
And, but the thing I will say real quick is it's super common, but don't let it be common.

1099
00:54:13,452 --> 00:54:19,574
If you guys are in here, I mean, get it done right, you'll be so happy you got it done right, even if the game doesn't work out.

1100
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,016
To be honest, I can say this, I think for both of us,

1101
00:54:22,016 --> 00:54:23,137
it sucked for both of our clients.

1102
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:25,479
There was no happiness in that situation.

1103
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:27,981
So go ahead and have that conversation.

1104
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:31,644
If you're a team, if this is something you all care about,

1105
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:34,947
they should acknowledge that you are not selling out

1106
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:36,708
by actually creating a business

1107
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,470
if you plan on selling a product.

1108
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,312
You are always selling out if you're selling a product.

1109
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,900
selling out means you're selling something, right?

1110
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,060
Right?

1111
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:48,521
A good way to broach it in a way that won't be awkward if you feel awkward is to say,

1112
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:51,842
look, this is about protecting our friendship.

1113
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:58,903
Because, no, seriously, because I would say that the more you trust and like someone,

1114
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:00,923
the more important it is to have a contract.

1115
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,904
And the reason is that when you trust and like someone,

1116
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:06,704
many things will go unsaid because you trust each other.

1117
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,545
That's what trust is.

1118
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:10,446
And if you're dealing with a random stranger,

1119
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:12,206
you're gonna know to ask a lot of questions,

1120
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:14,187
say, well, how exactly do the percentages work?

1121
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,427
But you're not gonna know this.

1122
00:55:15,427 --> 00:55:18,348
And by having this conversation in this contract,

1123
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:19,949
you have the confidence that your friendship

1124
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,490
isn't gonna be destroyed if someone has a change of heart.

1125
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,551
So yeah, I would do it and you'll feel better about it.

1126
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:27,191
And they're gonna breathe a sigh of relief

1127
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,532
when you bring it up and say, oh yeah, great.

1128
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:30,052
We were thinking this too, let's get this.

1129
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:31,092
So there's a reason as to why

1130
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:32,853
I'm probably perpetually single.

1131
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,213
But one of my.

1132
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:37,845
One of the things that we do is...

1133
00:55:37,845 --> 00:55:38,446
Yes, my contract.

1134
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:40,589
Is it the lawyer hat?

1135
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:41,790
No, I treat...

1136
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:41,810
I...

1137
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,171
True.

1138
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:48,800
But I treat all relationships like they are...

1139
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,402
I treat business relationships the same way.

1140
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:52,485
I treat my romantic relationships and vice versa.

1141
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,946
And that is, you go through stages, right?

1142
00:55:55,946 --> 00:55:57,387
Yeah, see, this is why I'm single.

1143
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:01,169
You go through these stages.

1144
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:03,071
It's not a zero-sum game, right?

1145
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,632
It's not about winning and losing.

1146
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:07,174
And anybody who says otherwise is full of it and does not know

1147
00:56:07,174 --> 00:56:11,637
anything about contracts, and that means you, Donald Trump.

1148
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:15,720
When it comes down to it, you are creating a relationship,

1149
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,420
right?

1150
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,343
You are courting each other to find out if you have similar

1151
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:21,063
goals in mind.

1152
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:26,978
You are negotiating your values to determine what boundaries you establish in the relationship.

1153
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:30,180
And you have like a term sheet phase, which is kind of the honeymoon phase.

1154
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,144
And then you have the long term or the long form agreement, which is effectively like,

1155
00:56:35,144 --> 00:56:36,285
you know, your prenup.

1156
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:42,650
So at the end of the day, I mean, you the business relationship is still a relationship

1157
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,773
and the conversation isn't going to be that different.

1158
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:50,897
So we've got about five minutes left, so now we're going to go to lightning round,

1159
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:53,420
because I really want to make sure everyone gets their question.

1160
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:53,600
Yes.

1161
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:53,840
Thanks.

1162
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,562
I'll try to make this brief.

1163
00:56:55,562 --> 00:57:00,107
My question is related to personalization, and it connects with both the gotcha loot

1164
00:57:00,107 --> 00:57:01,930
box question as well as GDPR and privacy.

1165
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:08,177
When I think about monetization and mobile and sort of random-based monetization,

1166
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:13,567
We're entering a place where as Google and more players have more data,

1167
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:16,550
they're able to generate offers on a very individual level, right?

1168
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:22,996
And the bigger that the data sets get, the more personalized the offers become.

1169
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:27,560
What risks do you see for either publishers or developers from a legal perspective,

1170
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,962
in terms of like, how deep can you cut or?

1171
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:33,765
Can you change the odds based on consumers?

1172
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:36,847
What could you do and what pitfalls would you see

1173
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:39,429
as more players that deal with personalization

1174
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,509
enter the space?

1175
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:42,270
Yeah, I think, I mean, at a top level,

1176
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:47,534
the use of the personal data, the sort of GDPR,

1177
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:49,155
and it's not just that regulation,

1178
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:52,637
but is sort of about either consent

1179
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:55,079
or having what they call a legitimate business interest.

1180
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,940
So that frames how you,

1181
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,002
what it is you're allowed to use someone's data for.

1182
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:04,764
And if they're not aware that,

1183
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:05,904
they say, yeah, sure, of course,

1184
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:07,045
you can have my email and this,

1185
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:08,965
and you can track my clicks because I'm playing the game,

1186
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:09,946
and that's how the game works,

1187
00:58:09,946 --> 00:58:11,807
and yeah, I wanna get special offers, that's fine.

1188
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:13,267
And if they agree to that,

1189
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:17,609
or if it's clear that that's what you're doing, that's fine.

1190
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,590
If you start doing this, but they think,

1191
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,972
oh, it's just everyone gets the same ads, that's an issue.

1192
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:25,213
I think as far as the changing of the odds,

1193
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:27,314
I would assume that it has to do with.

1194
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:32,138
disclosure and that that they need there needs to be a way for them to

1195
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:37,282
understand and I don't know if if the fact that it's based on an algorithm and

1196
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:42,066
it could fluctuate ten times a day how do we disclose that I think if you find

1197
00:58:42,066 --> 00:58:46,389
out that someone is is is vulnerable or not very smart or likely make rash

1198
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,172
decisions so you start offering them deals where they have terrible chances

1199
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:52,594
of winning that seems really like predatory that's bad that's with my

1200
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:55,437
lawyer hat and my human hat that seems like that seems like it's gonna go

1201
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:55,997
what do you think

1202
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,470
Lightning round.

1203
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,150
Yeah, lightning round.

1204
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,971
All right.

1205
00:58:58,971 --> 00:58:59,431
Yes.

1206
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:00,271
Okay.

1207
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:05,253
So yeah, so on the disclosure and promotion type things, I work with educational institutions,

1208
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:09,314
I work with festivals, and we're talking about, okay, a click away doesn't count.

1209
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:13,395
If a university wants to retweet stuff that's a student project being shown someplace, if

1210
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:16,677
a festival wants to retweet something that's by creators, are there concerns there of like

1211
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:20,958
they paid tuition, they pay submission fees for access to those PR machines, or is that

1212
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,598
not a concern at all?

1213
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,050
That's not what they're paying for.

1214
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:24,171
OK.

1215
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:25,371
Thank you so much.

1216
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:25,791
Easy.

1217
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,432
Yes.

1218
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:29,573
So when it comes to, this is more also about Tyson

1219
00:59:29,573 --> 00:59:32,095
to communicating with the superiors.

1220
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:33,755
So for Rainbow Six Siege, what happened

1221
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:36,697
was there was a scandal of them censoring violence to, I

1222
00:59:36,697 --> 00:59:38,678
believe, fit into the Chinese market.

1223
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:43,762
And what happened was there was a lot of controversy surrounding that.

1224
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:45,904
And basically, there are different...

1225
00:59:45,904 --> 00:59:48,526
What I'm trying to say is that there are different costs

1226
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:50,147
to just being legally compliant,

1227
00:59:50,147 --> 00:59:53,130
whether that be financial or reputational.

1228
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,011
How do you...

1229
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:57,814
How would you suggest communicating that to a superior

1230
00:59:57,814 --> 01:00:00,917
who might be from a different culture or, you know, all that,

1231
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,479
to convince them that it is important to stay legal?

1232
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:05,100
I mean, it's the price of entry.

1233
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,462
Specifically with China, it's the price of entry.

1234
01:00:08,263 --> 01:00:12,970
Well that and, never mind, I'm not going to say it, that would be offensive.

1235
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:17,137
Yeah, like with China in particular, things are extremely regulatory.

1236
01:00:17,137 --> 01:00:20,923
Generally, you're working with the Chinese publisher anyway, so...

1237
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:27,857
Very few, I don't know of any companies that can get Chinese distribution without working for a company actually based in China.

1238
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,000
As a Chinese person, I give you full permission to say that.

1239
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,641
Like, you are so right.

1240
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:38,566
So the additional cost also goes to who you need to bribe to get it through the regulatory and licensing channels.

1241
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:42,490
Though the US has laws against Foreign Practices Act, so.

1242
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:43,230
Well, we do, but...

1243
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:46,047
Okay, I think we've hit time.

1244
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:47,388
What an ending.

1245
01:00:47,388 --> 01:00:51,972
Everyone who's still in line, we're happy to talk to you outside and take your questions

1246
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:52,292
off the air.

1247
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:53,293
Thank you very much.

1248
01:00:53,293 --> 01:00:53,934
Thank you.

1249
01:00:53,934 --> 01:00:55,855
Fill out your surveys, please.

1250
01:00:55,855 --> 01:00:56,236
Thank you.
