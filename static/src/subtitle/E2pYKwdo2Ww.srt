00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,732
Hey everyone, my name is Riley Peach.

2
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:13,119
I am a systems designer at Sledgehammer Games, and I am here to tell you about how easy it

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,604
is to build a friendly third-person social space in a competitive first-person shooter.

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,290
It's not. It's not.

5
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:27,336
On Call of Duty World War II, we wanted to build something that offered a lot of new social and creative outlets for players,

6
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,157
and we created Headquarters.

7
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:35,642
Headquarters is a large multiplayer social space that allows players to gear up,

8
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:40,506
check out various challenges, test out their weapons, play mini-games, and a whole lot more.

9
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,247
It's loosely themed around D-Day Plus Three,

10
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:45,228
three days after the invasion of Normandy.

11
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,450
And it's a military base where players can stay

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,191
wrapped up in our game world

13
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,171
while still interacting with core systems.

14
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:54,252
In a way, it's an evolution

15
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,914
of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare's virtual lobby.

16
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,954
A semi-interactive menu

17
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,716
that let people customize their characters

18
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:03,276
and then show them off to people

19
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:04,377
that they'll be in a match with

20
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:05,958
and see what everyone else has equipped.

21
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:08,592
We had a lot of goals setting out.

22
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:13,777
What we wanted to offer players, how we wanted to engender specific behavior, and how we

23
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:15,818
wanted to improve the typical player session.

24
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:21,143
We were successful in some ways, unsuccessful in others, and ultimately learned a lot along

25
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:26,648
the way about how mostly non-combative features can resonate with a combat-focused player

26
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:27,669
base when done right.

27
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,051
We'll examine Headquarters from a design perspective, from start to finish.

28
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,992
What were our goals setting out?

29
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,314
How did we set out to achieve those goals?

30
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:42,337
And what were ultimately the results, positive and negative, on the final player experience?

31
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,539
In between we're going to take a close look at a system, Orders and Contracts, which is

32
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,380
a familiar system with a bit of a spin, and wrap things up with some final thoughts on

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,860
Headquarters as a whole.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,841
In between we're going to take a close look at a system, Orders and Contracts, which is

35
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,523
a familiar system with a bit of a spin, and wrap things up with some final thoughts on

36
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:53,403
Headquarters as a whole.

37
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,553
We identified three goals from headquarters starting out,

38
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,194
although they formed a lot more over time.

39
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:03,216
First, improving the core loop for players,

40
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,697
how a typical session would go.

41
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,279
Second is adding social components

42
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,460
to existing features, familiar features to players.

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,402
And third, expanding the types of players that play the game,

44
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:17,384
as well as the types of content that we can offer players

45
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:18,445
who are already in it.

46
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:25,830
First and foremost, we wanted to improve the core player loop, how people spend their sessions

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,550
on a given day.

48
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:31,254
In previous releases, players tended to follow a pretty standard path through a multiplayer

49
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:31,654
session.

50
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,978
They'd boot up the game, they'd wait for some friends to get online, hang out in menus,

51
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:41,781
and then go off into multiplayer matches and play a set of multiplayer matches.

52
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,043
And then they'd stop for a number of reasons.

53
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,705
They maybe got frustrated by a string of hard matches.

54
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:51,226
They ran out of different things to do and wanted to stop for the day.

55
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,969
Or they, you know, they had other obligations.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,089
They had to run off somewhere else.

57
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:00,331
There's a lot of different reasons that might get them to stop, and Headquarters was something

58
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:03,132
that we built to insert new layers into that flow.

59
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:07,774
We wanted to get people to begin their session by setting new goals for the day than they

60
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:08,655
had yesterday.

61
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:08,835
Okay.

62
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,083
We wanted them to have their wait time be somewhere other than a menu.

63
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:17,388
We wanted to sprinkle headquarters visits in between individual matches and have players

64
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:22,152
consume something other than the fast-paced gunplay, effectively bookending individual

65
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:22,492
matches.

66
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:27,215
Probably most importantly, we wanted them to end the day differently.

67
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,197
Did you hit a big progression goal?

68
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,879
Well, you should go and flaunt the rewards of that in front of other people in headquarters.

69
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you frustrated?

70
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:39,364
Well, go into headquarters and play some lighthearted mini-games with various people that are hanging

71
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:39,724
out there.

72
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:40,765
Are you bored?

73
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:44,628
Well, now we have something to give you that's something different than fast-paced gunplay

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,131
to spice up the experience and then allow you to re-enter multiplayer matches when you

75
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:48,551
see fit.

76
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:53,390
Later on we'll talk about how some of this worked and how some of it didn't impact the

77
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,510
loop in ways that we had hoped.

78
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:01,493
Our second and probably an obvious goal was to add social components to existing features.

79
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,154
One of the better examples of this is prestige.

80
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:09,696
Prestige in Call of Duty is a huge milestone for players, something that they work countless

81
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,758
hours toward and then when they achieve it, it's something they're really, really proud

82
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,098
of and get to show off to their friends.

83
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,022
But it happens in a menu alone without very much fanfare.

84
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,923
So we decided to go all out.

85
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:24,425
And we put a big cliff in the middle of headquarters that

86
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,167
juts out into the playable space.

87
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,310
When you go and enter Prestige, planes fly by,

88
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,410
flares are going off.

89
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,651
There's a general saluting.

90
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,533
So you can have your own Lion King moment up on this cliff

91
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:36,534
in front of everybody else.

92
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:43,175
We took something that was previously celebrated alone, but now use it to drive interaction

93
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:44,836
and increase investment for players.

94
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,075
Other examples of things that we've taken that are existing features that we've made

95
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:54,297
more social and public, we have supply drops which can be opened in front of an audience.

96
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:59,058
We have items that can be worn in front of different players in this space you run around

97
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:03,520
in and in-world leaderboards that showcase your various multiplayer statistics.

98
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,281
All of this is in an effort to make Headquarters deliver on an added level of recognition and

99
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,182
immersion to the Call of Duty experience.

100
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:16,206
A lot of this had a new system intertwined into it called Social Score.

101
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:20,867
Social Score is a system we built that allowed players to positively reinforce one another

102
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:25,508
and contribute to the community in order to get really exciting rewards to use in front

103
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,308
of, using the rest of the game.

104
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:33,790
The goal was a system that allowed players to make more of their contributions to the

105
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,731
community like handmade weapon paint jobs or custom emblems that they built.

106
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:46,617
With it came commending, which is a way to give a player a one-time like that shows them that you like something they're doing,

107
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,201
or you had a fun minigame with them, or you like something that they're showing off.

108
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:56,046
Our final major goal was to expand the player archetypes that engage with the game.

109
00:05:56,686 --> 00:06:00,610
We sat down to assess how well our systems appeal to different kinds of players.

110
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:05,668
Call of Duty, being a competitive multiplayer game, resonates really well with people who

111
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,751
like that part of the experience.

112
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:12,497
So we, in building Headquarters, we did want to cater to that type of player, but really

113
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,461
we wanted to open up the reward landscape for other player types.

114
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,961
There are a wealth of new opportunities to socialize,

115
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,602
catalog your various achievements,

116
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,304
explore a myriad of Easter eggs

117
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,985
and systems you may not be accustomed to.

118
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,447
And we hoped, albeit we were unsure,

119
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,749
that the right incarnation of these systems

120
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,930
would expand the palette of our core player type

121
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,771
even a little bit.

122
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:39,437
In order to achieve these goals, we held some rough philosophies about how we get there.

123
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:44,983
These weren't formal, predetermined design pillars, but when we look back at the development,

124
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,107
we find that these were guiding our hand more than anything else.

125
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,383
First, and probably our best guiding light, was just embracing what players gravitated

126
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,245
toward during playtests and experiments.

127
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,029
If players did something that wasn't what we had in mind for Headquarters, rather than

128
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,332
say how do we get them back on track, our approach was to say how do we build systems

129
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:09,696
around this and foster that behavior and turn it into something that's even more engaging

130
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:10,697
and more exciting for players.

131
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:17,415
A really good example of this was, internally, we loved facing off one-on-one against one

132
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:17,735
another.

133
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:23,037
And people took time after hours to build out small maps where we would face off one-on-one

134
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,958
and have little mini tournaments within the studio.

135
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:30,060
And for us, that captured an excitement that we wanted to put into headquarters, because

136
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,341
in headquarters, people kept trying to bring that into playtests.

137
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:39,224
So we built a pit on the beach in headquarters that players can participate in and spectate

138
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:40,384
one-versus-one matches.

139
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,565
This probably, actually, this came out of what I think was one of the most impactful

140
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,968
parts of our development, a game jam.

141
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:54,695
When you're working on a feature that thrives on spontaneous, organic fun, game jams have

142
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:59,100
a unique ability to find immense potential within your systems that you weren't sure

143
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,420
was there.

144
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:04,560
We structured the game jam to be focused on headquarters and invited the team to contribute

145
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,444
whatever they thought would be fun within the headquarters space.

146
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:13,570
One versus one was one of many features that shipped after originating in the game jam.

147
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:21,522
Another philosophy for us, making this a low friction experience all around was key.

148
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:27,046
Part of this was an effort to make headquarters a single button press away and be loaded in

149
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,868
the background as often as possible.

150
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:33,371
Some technical challenges prevented us from being able to fully commit to this particular

151
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,994
point of low friction, but the philosophy helped guide more than one system.

152
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,898
We didn't want players getting frustrated by long loads or cumbersome tasks.

153
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,680
In fact, we didn't even want to make it required.

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,943
Instead, we wanted players to have an internal decision-making process of,

155
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:53,307
I could play without headquarters, but I get more by doing it,

156
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:57,150
and I'm excited to go back when I have items or challenges to pick up there.

157
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,314
We tailored systems to be opt-in for players to choose to do them in headquarters

158
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,575
versus doing them within menus.

159
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,833
Additionally, we wanted to provide new ways for players to unveil and celebrate things

160
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:12,437
that they unlock with people around them and used public supply drops to do this.

161
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:17,822
To make it even more social, we give rewards for people opening drops in front of others

162
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,905
and give people rewards for watching others open drops.

163
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:24,609
If you see something really rare come out, there's even more rewards associated with

164
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:24,769
that.

165
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,433
This is an act of, in a way, it's an act of generosity,

166
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:31,294
because you can open it in the menus or in headquarters.

167
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:35,455
And we found that even though you could do that

168
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,256
for some small currencies or rewards,

169
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,517
those sources of those rewards were never lucrative enough

170
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,719
to beat out many other ways to get those things.

171
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,659
And yet, when we look back on it,

172
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,560
we saw that many players still chose to do it

173
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,661
in headquarters, which led us to believe

174
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,022
that the system itself was more engaging

175
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:52,842
than doing it alone.

176
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:59,537
Our final design pillar centers on friction as well, creating a low barrier of entry

177
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:00,999
for interacting with other players.

178
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,524
We wanted any of our systems to not only promote interaction, but make it as easy as possible.

179
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,189
Interacting with a player is a simple task.

180
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,512
You can commit to an interaction and it lasts usually less than a minute.

181
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,536
You can have your microphone off, you can have your microphone on, you can decline it

182
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:17,956
easily.

183
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:18,597
It's your choice.

184
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:23,821
We figured that by creating the most accessible system possible for interaction, players can

185
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:28,485
take it as far as they want and not be put off by headquarters as a whole because the

186
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,027
interactions themselves are too daunting.

187
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:34,180
Oftentimes, the biggest barriers for interacting

188
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,902
are actually the moments leading up to the interaction itself.

189
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:40,465
Handpicking teammates, sending messages,

190
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:42,607
or accepting party invites, all of these

191
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:45,650
are pretty no-brainer tasks when you're with friends.

192
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,111
But the moment that you're starting

193
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,533
to consider them with strangers, apprehension creeps in.

194
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,995
So we made all of that non-essential

195
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,276
to interactions in headquarters.

196
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:55,699
Nothing is binding, but is instead

197
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,840
more like an icebreaker.

198
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,608
We did this with a few key decisions in implementation.

199
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,529
The menu you bring up to interact with the player

200
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,090
is both semi-transparent and not full screen,

201
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,451
so it never feels like you're leaving the world to do it.

202
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,732
All of the interactions themselves

203
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,293
can be abandoned at any point

204
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,974
and can often be done while queued for a match,

205
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,775
so you never feel like you're really committed

206
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,276
to the activity or can't back out.

207
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,537
There's no punishment for engaging with these things,

208
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:25,078
and the benefits are generally not enticing enough

209
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,279
to make it feel high stakes.

210
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,335
You can see that things in this menu are only a button press away.

211
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,877
We have, you know, you can commend a player with a button.

212
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,959
You can challenge them to a shootout.

213
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,240
You can check out the gear they have,

214
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,883
hopefully with the lowest barrier possible to doing these things.

215
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,628
During development, we ran into a pretty crucial issue

216
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,289
that we had trouble addressing for a while.

217
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,493
How do we meaningfully disrupt how people view a session of Call of Duty?

218
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,345
Our goal wasn't to replace the core multiplayer experience.

219
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,227
Instead, we wanted to supplement it

220
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:01,291
and create a variety that turned into a loop

221
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,853
of entering headquarters, grabbing various things,

222
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,236
going into core multiplayer matches,

223
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,258
going back into headquarters, and so on.

224
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:15,696
In short, we wanted players to develop a routine in interacting with headquarters with some

225
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,896
unpredictable surprises mixed throughout their session.

226
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:24,118
So we built orders and contracts, challenges that are available to players on a schedule

227
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:28,219
with a range of difficulty, time investment, and associated rewards.

228
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,060
Some of them can take a while to complete and rewards can range from small amounts of

229
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,300
currencies to unique rare rewards.

230
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:41,977
Contracts only differ from orders in that they have a cost to activate them and a time

231
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:45,359
frame to complete them, making them a high-risk, high-reward version of them.

232
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:54,225
The system goal is to achieve a better symbiosis of headquarters and core multiplayer.

233
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,304
We started by making it part of the tutorial for headquarters,

234
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,824
so that when players first started the game,

235
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:00,885
they'd be in headquarters,

236
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:03,146
they'd pick up a new player-friendly challenge,

237
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,007
they'd go off into their first match,

238
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,488
and then they'd come back to the lobby.

239
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:08,689
For the only time we'd do this,

240
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,049
we'd pull them out of that lobby

241
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,870
and show them how to redeem the rewards

242
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,651
and pick up new ones.

243
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:19,314
We also kept notifications on the menu level and in-world

244
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,495
to make sure that this process was ingrained in players.

245
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:27,293
We also purposely built the inventory size and order availability such that players would

246
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:30,035
have to return once or twice a day to headquarters to get more.

247
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:34,879
Our biggest hope with this was that organic exposure to things happening in headquarters

248
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,621
as they made the walk to pick up orders would be exciting and fun.

249
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:42,185
It was never intended to be cumbersome, the load is pretty short, the distance is small,

250
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,367
and the density of players and activity is high.

251
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:49,831
Instead, we wanted this short trip to headquarters to be a welcome break for players throughout

252
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,331
their session.

253
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:57,076
On top of that, building a limited size inventory actually allows for a little bit of fun and

254
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,096
creative efficiency.

255
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:04,220
If you, for instance, have a multi-kill challenge, pairing that up with a challenge to play in

256
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,163
a mode with a lot of player density can be a fun and smart decision for players to make.

257
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,296
This section's going to kick off a full retrospective on Headquarters.

258
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:20,600
What design aspirations panned out, what fell flat, and a lot of what went wrong along the

259
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:20,840
way.

260
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,681
And we'll start with orders and contracts.

261
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,294
Orders and contracts were probably one of our more successful systems in the game.

262
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:34,216
We saw notable upticks in engagement numbers with the modes that they sent players toward.

263
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,736
They also led to a ton of community activity.

264
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:44,418
People posting on a daily basis what the orders were, discussions, and very often rants about

265
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:46,319
the challenges associated with those rewards.

266
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,660
Frenzy over unique rewards showing up for the first time.

267
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:56,471
When we had new downloadable content come out, new orders would drive people to that

268
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,659
new content, allow them to find it more easily and experience the new maps or new items,

269
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,807
and give them a challenge-based path to unlock all those things.

270
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:13,527
A recent study of the system even showed that players who got orders that lined up nicely

271
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:17,809
with their favorite modes got them even more engaged, playing more and interacting with

272
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,530
the system more.

273
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,972
The rewards for our orders are typically supply drops or in-game currencies, which means that

274
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:29,234
we have a limitless and, more importantly, scalable set of rewards to give them.

275
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:34,937
So when we make a really fun but challenging order or contract, we can scale the rewards

276
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:35,337
to match.

277
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:40,116
From a standpoint of overall game health,

278
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:41,898
orders and contracts were a success,

279
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,582
typically with, especially with regards

280
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,123
to how they integrated headquarters

281
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:47,845
into the core multiplayer experience.

282
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,869
But where they fell flat was directly related

283
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,031
to headquarters and the issues that affected it

284
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:53,832
starting with launch.

285
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,795
That's where we'll start looking back

286
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:56,776
at the feature as a whole.

287
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,672
Our biggest hurdle happened at launch.

288
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,994
A few issues born out of the ambition of the design

289
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:05,275
led to a launch for Headquarters that took months

290
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,756
to react to and recover from.

291
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,137
The plan from the start was simple on paper.

292
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,679
Headquarters is only a button press away

293
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:12,999
when you're not in a match.

294
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,181
It would always be loaded in the background

295
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,161
when you're not in that match.

296
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,163
You'd be in the menus or in a lobby

297
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,884
and you'd press start and the UI would fade away

298
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,185
and you'd be standing in Headquarters.

299
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,894
In practice, what it took to accomplish this cascaded into issues that forced us to turn

300
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,237
headquarters into a solo experience for a while.

301
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:37,223
As you can imagine, when getting players to learn the ropes of and grow fond of a brand

302
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,807
new social space, the flipping the switch to turn that into a solo experience is not

303
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:44,610
a good, easy, or desirable process.

304
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,862
Over time, this painted headquarters as a secondary experience, despite it being a huge

305
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:51,923
priority for us to fix.

306
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:57,085
Ultimately, we turned things back on, and it just didn't come with the fanfare that

307
00:16:57,105 --> 00:16:57,966
we had hoped with launch.

308
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:03,469
The biggest fallout of this was that we had to abandon some of our zero friction, one

309
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,211
button press away, you know, goal that we had set for headquarters.

310
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:12,675
This was part of guaranteeing stability and a more streamlined multiplayer experience.

311
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:17,760
So in the end, it's good, but as a result, some items ended up in menus, like orders

312
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,384
and contracts, that driving force that kept people coming back and forth between headquarters

313
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:24,026
and core multiplayer.

314
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:28,090
It's still available in headquarters, but it gave players another option that sort of

315
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,532
took away from that loop experience that we had hoped.

316
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:35,901
It all sounds like doom and gloom, but once Headquarters was back up and running,

317
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:41,128
sentiment climbed and we got to see the results of our design intent across the board.

318
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:47,955
The various mini-games and micro-interactions that we had throughout the space were received

319
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:48,816
with mixed results.

320
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,499
Initially they created a lot of intrigue and variety for players.

321
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,943
We saw a lot of people going out of their way to interact with strangers, which made

322
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,886
us think that our low barrier to interactivity was working out really well.

323
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,109
Over time, though, the engagement with them dwindled a little bit,

324
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,630
and we suspect for two reasons.

325
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:09,453
One, we didn't add a lot of content

326
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,694
into these existing minigames after launch,

327
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,837
so it might have grown a little bit stale for some players.

328
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,739
But the second one, which is probably more important,

329
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,281
is that we didn't, you know,

330
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,062
we deliberately didn't build out

331
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,085
really meaningful reward structures around these minigames.

332
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,967
As we talked about earlier, we didn't want it to be high stakes,

333
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,609
so we didn't associate big rewards with them.

334
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,975
As a result, you have a fun thing here in Headquarters,

335
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,338
but then you have another fun thing here somewhere else

336
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,982
that has way more rewards associated with it,

337
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,204
and players often chose the latter over time.

338
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:49,232
If we were to explore these kinds of interactions again, we'd certainly stick to the low barrier

339
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:55,136
of entry and the casual nature of them, but work toward building out enticing reward structures

340
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,078
or shareable social challenges.

341
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,281
Striking that balance is really tough, though.

342
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:06,526
Keeping activities light-hearted and friendly, but also substantive in rewards, is tricky

343
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:10,129
if the players are being faced off against one another.

344
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:16,687
Cooperative activities and anonymized competitive activities might be a safer route toward trying

345
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,227
to check both of those boxes.

346
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:25,971
That said, they were pretty quick to develop, and they offered variety, which is what we

347
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:26,311
wanted.

348
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:32,133
Mini games like 1v1 are not meant to dethrone core multiplayer or team deathmatch, but to

349
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,054
offer alternatives.

350
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:38,618
It's hard to assess the targeted success of minigames beyond the fact that people still

351
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:42,441
engage with them to this day, and it keeps those parts of headquarters that they live

352
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,121
in lively.

353
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:49,746
Additionally, 1v1 resonated really well with pros and streamers alike because it gave them

354
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:54,289
an opportunity to invite fans into a more intimate setting within headquarters.

355
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,051
The visibility of that is really hard to measure.

356
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,812
These are generated media.

357
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:03,134
This is a big success for us, which

358
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:05,916
ties into our earlier goal of expanding player archetypes.

359
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:10,399
It's just how much varied online content media headquarters

360
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,280
was able to generate.

361
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:14,122
A lot of great online content we typically

362
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:17,185
see is surrounding the core multiplayer experience,

363
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:19,186
but headquarters added something new into the mix.

364
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,009
It vastly expanded the types of content we saw.

365
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,315
Lots of tutorial videos showing off how to find our many hidden Easter eggs.

366
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,118
Videos showcasing and explaining the feature.

367
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,244
Screenshots of friendly messages between players, which are very hard to come by sometimes.

368
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,728
And suggestions of more non-combat features.

369
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm personally the most happy about this positive.

370
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,224
Seeing people find new ways to get excited about and share their experiences was a huge

371
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:50,286
goal and in that regard the feature exceeded expectations.

372
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:56,847
Another part of our design for Headquarters was tailored toward flexibility, something

373
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,388
many online games and games as a service do these days.

374
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:06,291
We used Headquarters to envelop players in the spirit of the content patch or holiday

375
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:10,033
or season or component of the war that we really wanted to highlight at the time.

376
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:15,856
Themes for the game take over and it goes hand in hand with the maps and items that

377
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,036
we're releasing at the same time.

378
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:20,085
Headquarters becomes this living, breathing space

379
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,267
to convey those themes in a way that feels grounded within the game world.

380
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,969
During our Winter Siege event, for instance,

381
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,691
we have holiday-themed decorations,

382
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,433
warm soup stations, and cozy fires scattered throughout the space

383
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:36,496
to help reinforce the delivery of all the other cool content that comes with that patch.

384
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:43,858
As you can imagine, there are some unexpected results that come with building a space like this.

385
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:53,361
Going back to social score, we projected that it would take players roughly six months to get to the end of social score progression,

386
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,342
because we wanted it to be a really rare thing.

387
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:59,904
At the end of that progression, you get kind of an elite name tag as a player,

388
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:03,145
and get to show that off to other people around you,

389
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,886
and we wanted it to be a big thing for people to get excited about.

390
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:12,039
But a few players, you know it's supposed to be rare, a few players got it in about

391
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,703
a month, six times faster than we had anticipated.

392
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:21,769
So we had to look at how and why and what they did to pull that off.

393
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,855
So it turns out that they combined a lot of our systems in really creative ways.

394
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:31,823
First, they performed really well in core multiplayer matches, really well.

395
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:36,605
They would come into headquarters and as a result, they would be at the top of the leaderboards.

396
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:40,327
Part of that means you get to show off your custom created emblem.

397
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:45,349
And they would make that emblem say things like, commend me, I commend back, or commend

398
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,891
me for free loot, which is not a service we offer.

399
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:53,133
They did a lot of things like that to get people in and they would do emotes in front

400
00:22:53,153 --> 00:22:55,734
of them and people would come up and commend them.

401
00:22:56,595 --> 00:23:02,818
Turns out, the players that got it that quickly were commended by over 10,000 unique players in the span of about a month or two,

402
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:07,941
which is astonishing to us, and it's not a kind of behavior we expected,

403
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:18,386
but it was great to see players dedicated to achievements and social status in the same way that others might cherish or show off their kill-death ratio or other core multiplayer statistics.

404
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:26,059
We also had players create and name Commend Day, the day in the week that we put up an

405
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,841
order to go around and commend people.

406
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:32,026
And you see a bunch of people hanging out in headquarters, running around, commending

407
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:35,350
one another and having online discussion about it, which we were happy to see.

408
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,013
I can't speak toward future plans, but as a member of the design team behind this feature,

409
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:48,196
we are really proud to see it come to life in the way that it did.

410
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:52,179
Building headquarters led to a vast spectrum of feedback and impressions.

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,883
On one hand, beyond the shaky start, we heard a lot of things like, you should have spent

412
00:23:56,943 --> 00:24:00,385
more time building feature X, Y, or Z in core multiplayer.

413
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:04,108
But on the other, we heard a lot of people saying, I love that there are things for me

414
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:06,450
to do in multiplayer outside of the fast gunplay.

415
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:11,577
and the passively positive implications of people taking videos of

416
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,621
memorable moments with strangers or positive community interactions.

417
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:20,524
HQ was a daunting ambition for Call of Duty World War II.

418
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,505
And as a game designer, I think it's a healthy aspiration

419
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:24,946
to create content that appeals

420
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,546
to the widest variety of interests.

421
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:31,709
Our pillars, embracing unexpected fun, low friction access,

422
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:33,770
and a low barrier to interactivity,

423
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,151
are all the same principles that I would use

424
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,451
to build a feature like this again.

425
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,592
But I believe there's plenty of room

426
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:42,974
to reflect on what could be focused and refined

427
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:44,714
for a more targeted experience

428
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:46,815
that still delivers a rich social atmosphere.

429
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:53,828
In part, that would be expanding on the social components of familiar features like prestige,

430
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:55,869
ranking up, showing off gear.

431
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,714
I think we could have intertwined systems like social score and commendations more fluidly

432
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:05,297
into core multiplayer so people saw the relationship between the spaces better.

433
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,780
There are also a number of questions and lessons

434
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,641
surrounding what kind of player density

435
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:13,183
is required to achieve a space

436
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:15,004
that has organic fun moments occur.

437
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:19,146
Player count alone does not beget activity or density,

438
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,407
but it's a factor that you balance

439
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:24,569
alongside your level design and your matchmaking systems

440
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,811
because both of those need to keep people active

441
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:28,011
and interacting with one another.

442
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:30,152
For instance, we built our levels

443
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:31,873
such that all the essential features

444
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,915
were clustered in one area,

445
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,776
so you could get to them quickly in between matches.

446
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:40,988
Turns out the other parts of the space are less lively as a result because the essential

447
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:42,949
features are in the other parts of headquarters.

448
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:48,074
Lastly, it's okay for some features to be in menus.

449
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:53,219
Just because you have a cool space to ground things in doesn't mean that that's necessarily

450
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,540
the right call for any feature.

451
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,525
Things can be accessible in both and it still allows for this space, a space like this,

452
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:00,005
to shine.

453
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,826
There were a lot of lessons learned in building headquarters.

454
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:08,750
It's hard, if not impossible, to have binary answers to questions like,

455
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,112
do social spaces always make games better,

456
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:13,894
given that you don't often have a strong comparison point,

457
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:18,018
and they're never intended to dethrone things like core multiplayer,

458
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,340
but to supplement and support those features.

459
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,663
Headquarters made Call of Duty World War II different

460
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:28,207
and helped cast the experience in a new light for players old and new.

461
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,399
Thank you so much for your time.

462
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,222
I'd like to thank the rest of the team on headquarters

463
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,144
who put a lot of hard work and passion

464
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:37,125
toward building this feature

465
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:39,788
and helped create the insight and lessons shared today.

466
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:42,671
I'd also like to thank Dan Kendall at Sledgehammer

467
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,092
who helped create this presentation.

468
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:46,094
If you have any questions,

469
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,517
I think we might be able to hang out here for a bit

470
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,379
since we're rolling into lunch here.

471
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:51,080
Thank you.
