1
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:08,858
Okay.

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

3
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:25,006
I'm always blown away by the incredible support that we get from everybody about Baldur's Gate 3.

4
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,948
How many, show of hands, how many of you guys have played it?

5
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,124
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,106
I'm Jason Latino, Cinematic Director at Larian Studios.

7
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:42,888
I'll try not to talk too fast, but I did not think about how many people would be in this room with me when I was talking.

8
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:49,071
This will be a top-down look at our bottom-up approach to cinematics on Baldur's Gate 3.

9
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:56,725
I imagine many of you are here to figure out how we put so many cinematics in the game.

10
00:00:56,865 --> 00:01:02,527
We went from making Divinity Original Sin 2 with node cinematics to making all of the cinematics.

11
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:04,848
And we'll get there.

12
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:10,330
But first, things being the way they are this year, I want to address the layoffs.

13
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,712
I have no great wisdom.

14
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:18,239
I have not much to offer on this topic, but I will say a bit of optimism.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,363
I did take this job off of a six month layoff.

16
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:27,851
I think I kept track, which is maybe a good or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.

17
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:33,915
and I think I applied for and interviewed for about 67 jobs before getting this one.

18
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:47,385
Track your actions anywhere that you apply for, keep track of that on the date that you applied for it, figure out if you know anybody at that studio, if you just put your application into a web portal.

19
00:01:49,366 --> 00:02:11,948
figure out like go on linkedin see if there are any recruiters that you can find reach out to them anything that you can make some noise and with the recruiters don't ghost them like sometimes they're busy people too and they're also working with hiring managers that are also busy sometimes poking them helps them poke them you get it so everybody's juggling a lot on with the show back to cinematics

20
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:18,118
There's a lot of what we do with cinematics that is a lot like other cinematic pipelines.

21
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,401
I'm going to focus on the things that are different about what we do.

22
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,682
We still have story.

23
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:33,488
We still go into previz for some of our scenes and we iterate until it looks great and we're happy with it so you guys can be happy with it.

24
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:57,083
The format of this talk, there'll be a couple cycles, it'll take you a while to catch on maybe, but we're going to talk about what was the initial vision when we started, what did we think it would take to make cinematics, what were the problems that we discovered with those initial ideas, and we'll go through a couple of those, and then we'll move to a new vision, how do we adapt

25
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:16,057
how do we recover from those bumps along the road and what were the new wrinkles that were introduced from our new cool clever ideas and then some resolutions one that'll be for the kind of the project and our general approach to cinematics and kind of a personal note for myself start on a personal note and on a personal note you get a personal sandwich

26
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:30,335
The initial vision, there were kind of four main things when I went back to look at all my documents from 2019 to figure out, like, okay, where was my head at before this whole thing shook the world, right?

27
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,756
Flexible cinematics.

28
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:39,342
I describe cinematics to a lot of people, which was less helpful in Europe, it turns out, as peanut brittle, because they don't make it over there very much.

29
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,262
It's toffee.

30
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:45,987
It tastes great, but it shatters into a million pieces when you try to bend it into a different shape.

31
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:46,987
I'm

32
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,145
We didn't want to make the game smaller.

33
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:19,795
Divinity Original Sin 2, and that's a mouthful, so I'm going to call that DOS 2 for the rest of the presentation, had about 54,000 lines of dialogue that were delivered in what would be considered, what cinematics would consider an interactive dialogue for BG3.

34
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:26,119
There's much more writing in the game, but kind of that was how we were determining what do we actually have to support.

35
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,980
And we didn't want that number to go down.

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,642
I didn't want to be the guy that came on and ruined Larian Games.

37
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:31,876
nobody would.

38
00:04:51,155 --> 00:05:00,027
through just syncopated motions, bouncing up and down and flapping the gums at the right times along with the words.

39
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:06,736
And that created infinitely relatable characters of Kermit and Fozzie the Bear and Miss Piggy and all of them.

40
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:26,577
The reason that I'm mentioning that about a video game is we knew that we were going to mocap our entire VO pipeline to hide the NPC-ness, and this was going to amount to the largest pile of animation that was going to go into our game.

41
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:31,058
And if we agonized over art directing all of that animation,

42
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:34,379
we were going to, it was just going to stop us in our tracks.

43
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,860
So we had to basically figure out, like, what are we actually looking for?

44
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,740
And what we're looking for is a simulacrum of life.

45
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:48,803
We wanted to capture the idiosyncrasies of the actors themselves, rather than, and just worry about, do they, are they working on the level of a Muppet?

46
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:50,763
Are they a believable person?

47
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:55,844
Rather than, are they the exact right person to deliver this quest line all the time?

48
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,425
We had to pick and choose our battles.

49
00:05:58,513 --> 00:05:59,455
and then grounded tone.

50
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,519
We wanted to adjust a little bit of the storybook.

51
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:09,656
We still had a narrator that we brought over from DOS 2, but it had to work on a personal and cinematic level.

52
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,449
So this is kind of where the loop starts, guys.

53
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,892
Flexible cinematics.

54
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:21,337
Our initial victory was this, is we came up with scene templates that would stamp out cinematics anywhere.

55
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:32,647
And I got this really good advice one time when I was looking at getting into watercolors by a guy named Derek Stratton, amazing artist, amazing art director.

56
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:41,896
They said, paint with the broadest brush possible, which is not saying always paint with a broad brush, but paint with the broadest brush possible.

57
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:45,961
Whatever the part of the job that you're doing, use the broadest tool.

58
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,243
So what was that for cinematics?

59
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,827
And for us, it was basic staging for basic conversations.

60
00:06:52,327 --> 00:07:04,272
There's only so many ways that two people can stand and talk and look at each other, and figuring out how to turn that into an infinite snowflake of possibilities was not going to be great.

61
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:10,095
So we figured out how to templatize our basic conversation setups.

62
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:18,480
This allowed us to also standardize where our cameras were going to be and how they could respond and kind of deal with all the height variations.

63
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:29,267
If they just had to deal with the height variations of being a half-orc or a half-ling, we didn't have to worry about, like, finding them in the horizontal axis as well.

64
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:33,249
And this also established an inherited authorship.

65
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:39,433
We had something where we could change a few template files, and then we could watch those changes ripple across the entire game.

66
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,172
So I'll explain how this falls into the pipeline.

67
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,193
We have our dialogue file.

68
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:45,754
We have writers.

69
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,075
They're working on story authorship.

70
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:55,863
They're writing the lines of dialogue and the order of the lines of dialogue and all of the intricate spiderweb paths through those dialogues.

71
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,185
And then we have these scene templates.

72
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:03,190
I want to skip over that for a second, because this is where a lot of this is kind of what's different about us.

73
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:05,903
the timeline file.

74
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:20,858
Everything is brittle.

75
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,799
Everything is bespoke.

76
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,500
Every last moment is custom.

77
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:34,665
So what we did is we introduced the scene template, took care of character staging, and took care of camera setup, and it gave us a safety net of authorship that we could bank on.

78
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:44,250
And it also allowed us to have a reliable line of action so that we could organize our actors and how they were standing when they were recording in the booth.

79
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,557
The timeline file, this is where we would start.

80
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,637
We kind of have our cinematic team set up in two different teams.

81
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,118
And it does take pretty much the entire company to make cinematics.

82
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:57,779
But two main teams, we have cinematic artists.

83
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:06,221
And they are focused on the timing, acting, pacing, custom work, and implementing assets from VFX, sound effects, and all this kind of stuff.

84
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,502
And bringing in especially the animations from our wonderful cinematic animation team.

85
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,283
So it's kind of an implementation timeline.

86
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:22,887
And then we have the game itself, which places these timeline files into specific areas of Faerun that make up the story of Baldur's Gate.

87
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,942
initial problems with flexible cinematics.

88
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:37,308
Top-down games don't have horizon line, folks, so our cinematics could play everywhere, but not everywhere was designed for viewing at eye level.

89
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,249
We had short draw distances at first.

90
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:47,033
We had one-sided textures, odd decoration placement, floating scenery, visual scripting asylums where somebody just said, oh, put these over here.

91
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,794
No one will ever see these over here.

92
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,097
If you look at the bottom right, we did see them.

93
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:57,340
And so we had this game where you could talk to all of your companions.

94
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,901
You could click on them anywhere in the world.

95
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,703
And suddenly, our top-down game turned into a third-person game.

96
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:07,626
And we had to figure out what this meant for our art pipelines and our level design best practices.

97
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:08,967
Oh, I forgot a bullet point.

98
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:09,708
Ceilings.

99
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:13,150
Ceilings are not a thing in a top-down game that became very important to Baldur's Gate 3.

100
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:16,747
I'm

101
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:42,531
We had about a year to achieve, like we achieved like shipping level results, but the in-game cinematic tools were irreducibly complex.

102
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:49,195
If you're starting up a cinematic program, you kind of need your entire feature set working before you know if you have anything.

103
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:55,859
Before that, it's just like you need like acting to know what you're shooting and then you need all of this stuff kind of working at once.

104
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,281
So it took a while to get all that stuff online.

105
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:03,256
initial problems about not making games smaller.

106
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:07,076
There were no small scenes at first, for sure.

107
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:11,097
Casual conversations would have complications.

108
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:19,879
We have this bard, Alfira, in the game, and her conversation took more effort than her song of singing this magical song to the woodland creatures.

109
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,500
And I'll show you on the next slide kind of why that was.

110
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,083
But to a certain degree, that was by design.

111
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:33,269
It keeps the players on their toes when they can't tell whether or not they're on the golden path.

112
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:44,942
And it encourages exploration if every nook and cranny of this world can have crazy things where you can talk to a squirrel and then kick it into a tree, and the guy who storyboarded that is right over there.

113
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:59,096
So you would think that we spend all our energy working on this and making sure all the, like we were making real chords with the fingers and all that kind of stuff.

114
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,618
And we spent a lot of time on that because we cared about it and we knew players would too.

115
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:05,200
But this is really what we spend our time on.

116
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:20,010
Making sure that there weren't continuity mistakes because we had this really wonderful dialogue tool that would allow you to take these non-linear paths through this, getting to know this person, getting their baggage as an artist, which seems really personal now while I'm on stage.

117
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:27,357
but making sure that her guitar was always in the right position no matter what path you played through the dialog file.

118
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:39,208
So we had to figure out how to communicate this to a writing team and scripting team and figure out how we could create a shared language for, we'd rather work on this, but right now we're spending a lot of energy on this.

119
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:52,728
initial victories muppet acting uh... we got so much characterization from our actors uh... we initially got like kind of some paddle hands and then we adapted to stretch sense thank you ricardo for finding them

120
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:57,263
And then we started getting a lot of finger gestures that you're seeing Gail do here.

121
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,703
And then the cinematic team actually authored a lot of that.

122
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,284
We did body capture, but we didn't do facial capture.

123
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:12,245
So the cinematic team, you can see, placed these cute little emojis around and timed that out so we could basically go from different intensities of different emotions.

124
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:16,386
And that would interface with the face effects and lip sync.

125
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:23,087
And what we found is that when we were placing all these intended contextual timings of these emotion keys,

126
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:27,077
we didn't need some of the extra bells and whistles of that really deep tool set.

127
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:34,541
So we have happy A, B, and C. Happy A, B, and C here, and everybody loves Gale.

128
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:43,829
Happy A, B, and C, you'll notice these are closed-lipped, and that they are also, they kind of go up in intensity.

129
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:47,652
So happy A is the least amount of happy that somebody could be.

130
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,254
Happy Z is the most amount of happy.

131
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:53,517
But you'll notice X, Y, and Z are all open-faced.

132
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,659
So what's the difference here?

133
00:13:55,719 --> 00:14:00,604
When we didn't have the entire alphabet, that would be too many choices to make for every frame of dialogue.

134
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:07,991
So we had A, B, and C as a set, and then X, Y, and Z. So the A, B, and C would all work with phonemes.

135
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,535
X, Y, and Z wouldn't, or X, Y, and Z if you're in the UK.

136
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:12,555
and

137
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:36,648
So when you mocap every line of dialogue in your game, you're baking in their whole performance.

138
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:49,601
And the VO team, the direction team, as informed as they are in all the great information that we put into our dialogues, they don't always know if you're talking to an ogre or if you're talking to a mouse.

139
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,803
So they can't, and in some cases it could be either.

140
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:57,086
So they can't direct the actor all the time.

141
00:14:57,286 --> 00:15:05,950
Or if the actor, they're essentially, we moved them from directing their attention to an iPad on a music stand next to them.

142
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,493
They had a head mic and they were looking at a teleprompter and they were treating that as their acting partner.

143
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,254
But what if they were talking to multiple people?

144
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,396
They can't look away from the teleprompter because then they don't know what to say.

145
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:23,276
So this, we needed more flexibility and we needed to give our artists control over what the head was doing.

146
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:32,683
So we, but we, we initially, when we started making this look at tool, it nuked all of the wonderful head bobbing and Muppet acting that we were trying to get.

147
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:35,745
So we had to incorporate this on an additive layer.

148
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,387
Problem solved.

149
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,552
We actually did fix it eventually, but

150
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,668
YouTube, you know what you did.

151
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:55,551
Initial victories.

152
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:56,853
Grounded tone.

153
00:15:57,253 --> 00:16:00,596
Our CGI trailers served as excellent tonal pieces.

154
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:04,520
Working with Unit Image was the highlight of the project for me, personally.

155
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,322
They are brilliant collaborators.

156
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:09,125
You should work with them, unless I'm working with them, and then you wait your turn.

157
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:26,054
their PBR style really provided some aspirational targets for us as we were building out our own art style and our own world and there was a lot of collaboration on what we thought we could do and the assets they would provide I think there was even some sharing of assets back and forth

158
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:30,323
This also cemented body horror as a tool.

159
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:35,146
Everybody who learned something about themselves when that tadpole went into Lae'zel's eyes, you're welcome.

160
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:49,976
Later on, when Oren, we were introducing this shapeshifter character, we knew that, well, this could just be a normal mystique X-Men kind of UV scroll, or we could do something a bit more interesting.

161
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:55,320
And it also let us know, with our narrative tone, we knew how dark we could go.

162
00:16:56,803 --> 00:17:14,391
here's some side by side comparisons of what unit gave us and some similar things where we could test the lighting, we could test the rendering, we could test the materials and all that sort of stuff, camera angles and figure out how we could kind of chase after the excellent images that they gave us and introduced our IP to you guys with.

163
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:30,189
and we started with that wonderful serophthalmosis in fast speed teaser and then we have Oren later on with this kind of body cracking motion and we could use these because it rhymed and it felt right.

164
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,844
uh, initial problem with Grounded Tone.

165
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:36,345
There were some old habits.

166
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,728
Scenes were always not written with visuals in mind back in 2019.

167
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:46,593
So Asterian's initial recruitment scene was him actually in one of those pods because he was a vampire and he was afraid to come out in the daylight.

168
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,596
So you're trying to talk to him whether or not the sun was out.

169
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,359
And this is, this makes a lot of sense and it offers really good role play.

170
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,681
But if you look at that lower image

171
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,965
You're just looking at a screen.

172
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,328
You're not looking at a person.

173
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,412
There's nothing to connect with.

174
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,880
There's not any emotion that you're getting from that pod.

175
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:10,997
I remember having a conversation with one of the writers early on.

176
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,320
I was like, is this romance scene?

177
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,162
Did they find a haystack somewhere?

178
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:19,065
Is there a hotel nearby?

179
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,307
Where exactly is this happening?

180
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,048
And it kind of dawned on us at that point.

181
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:26,791
There was information that never had to be thought about before.

182
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:39,696
So we added a cinematic context field in our dialogue editor for talking about what was narrative information that the player needed to know, but the developers definitely needed to know first.

183
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,317
What was non-verbal information that was telling the story?

184
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,058
And they took to this fantastically.

185
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:52,120
So we got all of that, and we hit our very first impasse, and it goes back to our core principle of flexible cinematics.

186
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,955
We wanted scripted motion.

187
00:18:55,095 --> 00:19:03,737
We wanted scripted movement for our cinematics so they could be one-to-one, so that our cinematics were happening exactly where the gameplay characters were standing.

188
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:10,099
Movement would be driven by go-to commands, and minor staging changes would be handled by gameplay locomotion.

189
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,980
The results were interesting.

190
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:18,902
I'm going to talk over this because it's the only way I can feel comfortable.

191
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,443
You can see, so, like, actually,

192
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:24,572
laughter helps too.

193
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:34,201
We're actually, like, there's not even, like, an auto-continue on this stuff, so there's somebody who's, like, clicking continue every time we get to the end of one of these shots.

194
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:43,690
I remember this was, like, two weeks of work, standing this thing up, and I went back home that day, and I was like, I might have made a huge mistake.

195
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:45,792
I don't know about this.

196
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,560
the world.

197
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:07,342
So this, but you can see a lot of things that are working.

198
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,944
There's a lot of the art assets that are being used.

199
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,644
You can see the beginning of the material system.

200
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,886
We would improve the lighting and all that sort of stuff.

201
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:18,688
This next shot coming up is interesting, I think.

202
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:20,789
Maybe it's two shots from now.

203
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,709
Probably after we get an air message.

204
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,070
Wait for the air message.

205
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:25,831
Hold.

206
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,354
There we go.

207
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,436
That's the sweet stuff.

208
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:37,763
This custom movement right here, we didn't actually know if the goblins would be on the screen because their AI could send them anywhere.

209
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:41,908
And it was pretty difficult, guys.

210
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,713
It was time to find a plan B.

211
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:49,776
So what did we do?

212
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,598
We implemented cinematic dummies!

213
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:52,839
Not like that.

214
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,248
Cinematic dummies for us were timeline entities that would replicate their in-game counterparts and hide them.

215
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:08,457
So this allowed us to show the players a cool cinematic without actually disrupting the game state at all.

216
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:15,788
This kept the cinematic tool as an artist tool instead of a scripting tool.

217
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:22,994
It cut down on animation blends because not everything had to work from 360 degrees, and it allowed us to cheat things.

218
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:31,160
As a cinematic storyteller, if you want somebody to walk from one end of the hall to the other end of the hall, you don't want to show that whole journey.

219
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,062
If you're using scripted motion, you have to do that.

220
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:42,167
The results would take, fairly quick for tech, I think they anticipated the need for change.

221
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,369
And then pipeline authorship and all that kind of stuff would take months.

222
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,411
The results would get us here.

223
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,616
Open the bloody gate!

224
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,357
Nobody gets in!

225
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,038
Zevlov's orders!

226
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:09,057
You can see Aroden, we changed him, but there's a lot of these shots that are very similar if you've played this moment in the game.

227
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:13,998
There's kind of some blinking out that you'll see that some of the characters are doing at the end of shots.

228
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,139
That was a problem with our animation export.

229
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,680
We slowly got to fix that.

230
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,861
You can already see the materials look way better than they did a few months ago.

231
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:25,122
The sound team really brought it.

232
00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:26,403
We got music in here.

233
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:32,988
It was really important for me that we nailed the scene, even though it's just kind of like this transitionary beat in the story itself.

234
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,570
We spent a lot of time on this.

235
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,992
You'll see this wheel kind of screw around.

236
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:45,839
That arrow is really tiny because the animation was changing the render scale, but we felt like we were there.

237
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,460
We felt like we had impact.

238
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,822
We felt like we were connecting with this moment.

239
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:18,955
for everybody who says that form they say form a line and then two people walk off leaving the third person behind I'll point out that the you only need two points in a line this was great we were all set nothing could stop us now one month later

240
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,369
We were all sent home and locked away and working remotely.

241
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,054
I'm not going to turn this into a COVID talk.

242
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:32,727
I will say that I got to know all the neighborhood kitties and I played a lot of D&D with my friends on the internet.

243
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:45,677
What this did give us was time to think and recognize that we actually accomplished our kind of initial goal of flexible cinematics, not making the game smaller, muppet acting, and grounded tone.

244
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:52,864
And then COVID slowed down the writing pipeline a little bit, and that gave us time to evolve the team and pivot

245
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:58,048
And our team was very, very junior heavy.

246
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:05,355
Lots of folks, it was their first job out of college in general, and very many their first job in games.

247
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,338
But they weren't the new kids on the block anymore.

248
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:12,923
They were growing into developers instead of just timeline jockeys.

249
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,172
So what was the evolving vision?

250
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:19,877
So we needed to start targeting final quality.

251
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:26,526
What we had gotten to with that plea of the gate sequence that I just showed you, we had to spread that out a little, get more of those in the game.

252
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:28,969
We wouldn't have EA to hide behind forever.

253
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,831
We had to maintain the floor.

254
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:40,153
Most of our game cinematics, most of that 174,000 million hours of cinematics, was going to be conversational.

255
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:51,916
It was going to be a conveyance of information to the player about what effect they can have on the world, what effect they have had on the world, and where they can affect the world next.

256
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:53,716
That had to feel good.

257
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,637
We couldn't take those scenes for granted.

258
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:57,798
We had to collaborate to shape.

259
00:24:57,838 --> 00:25:10,926
We had to provide a new team identity for our cinematic team to model how their role at the studio could change and how they could evolve outside of just their ever-changing timeline tool.

260
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:13,609
We had to focus fire on the ceiling.

261
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,233
And the hardest part about that was figuring out where the ceiling was.

262
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,477
And we'll get to more on that later.

263
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,579
And then we had to solve lighting.

264
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:24,606
The majority of the game, we only had one or two lighting artists internally.

265
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,411
And there were a lot of cinematics.

266
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:30,062
Victories.

267
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:31,364
Maintaining the floor.

268
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:40,191
We had time with the production slowdown to revisit all of our scene templates and kind of drag those characters closer together.

269
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,554
The party makeup is really important to players.

270
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:50,220
It's an expression of what characters they value in combat and who they're romancing.

271
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,205
And getting them in the background of player decision and question shots was really important for us.

272
00:25:55,765 --> 00:26:07,277
and tighter staging allowed for more visible companions and also left a smaller footprint for gameplay cinematics so they could play closer to that game state that we were chasing initially.

273
00:26:08,254 --> 00:26:09,715
and also established a baseline.

274
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:20,886
We had these scene templates, but when we started looking at it, we had a lot more than we thought we did, because people were just making a bunch of custom ones to do a lot of slight variations.

275
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:23,369
And so we figured out, OK, well, what are the best decisions?

276
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:30,556
And then how do we homogenize those and then set them up into a proper hierarchy that would then get all of that inheritance actually working for us?

277
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:32,932
talking about

278
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:57,986
Mid development, we kind of opted for just keeping the player off camera during these.

279
00:26:58,627 --> 00:26:59,867
You guys didn't seem to mind much.

280
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:00,568
Thank you so much.

281
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,470
We're still toying with how we can handle that better.

282
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:09,713
Evolving victories.

283
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:10,593
Collaborate to shape.

284
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:13,655
So there are two columns on here.

285
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,616
We have execution and broader tasks.

286
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:25,153
Execution is kind of what I told people the job was going to be when I hired them, like it's moving around cameras and characters and editing and facial performances and all that kind of stuff.

287
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,756
The broader tasks were things that were emerging as we were making the game.

288
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,597
We were understanding the drama.

289
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,759
We were advocating for fidelity.

290
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:40,303
If this was a gold scene, we had this kind of tiered system, you know, bronze, silver, brass, gold, bronze, brass, silver, gold, there you go.

291
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:47,346
Owning kickoff meetings, kind of collaborating, bundling information and context for everybody to do their work.

292
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,107
Advocating for asset reuse.

293
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:56,629
If we had somebody jumping off of a platform, we didn't need to mocap that again, and the cinematic team would know this, and they could communicate this.

294
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,052
They could refactor old workflows like those scenes, and then that would have broad effect on the entire game.

295
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:07,274
Incorporating new workflows and new features that were coming out of the tool all across production.

296
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:15,221
and they would escalate technical and narrative issues when we were trying to get things into the game that just wouldn't work with our tool set.

297
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:22,159
So we chopped all of these things up and we figured out that these were actually pillars of expertise.

298
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,420
So we have analysis, how well is the assignment understood?

299
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,621
That's understanding the drama.

300
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,122
Ideation, how strong are your visual goals?

301
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,343
Strategy, how clear is your plan of action?

302
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:32,823
Execution, we all know and love.

303
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:36,264
And revision, how quickly does your work achieve polish?

304
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:40,026
We turned this into a bit of an HR grid, performance and development, all that kind of stuff.

305
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:42,427
But the important thing for us was that

306
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,168
Yes, working in the timeline tool is really important.

307
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:46,829
Telling a story is very, very important.

308
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:57,154
But collaborating and fitting into the rest of the company at large and spreading that context, spreading that passion is a majority of what your identity is as a team.

309
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:58,411
that

310
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:27,307
This added field for visual information was used also for making our mocap shot list.

311
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:32,111
It was very easy to do a quick export and kind of read and say it's like, yes, this context needs new animation.

312
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,912
No, this context doesn't need new animation.

313
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:38,846
Once writing got up to speed, we suddenly had more work than we could review.

314
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:46,229
It felt like we could either read the dialog files or we could make cinematics, but we couldn't do both, and that was really, really daunting.

315
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:52,312
We needed a way to prioritize our most complicated scenes without having to read them.

316
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:56,034
This is where we came up with the idea of custom nodes.

317
00:29:56,134 --> 00:30:00,516
We added a toggle so that we could count the nodes with cinematic context.

318
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:04,579
We then had this idea of dialogue fidelity.

319
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,781
It's a gold dialogue file, right?

320
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:10,164
And then we had these context nodes, and we married the two.

321
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:16,711
So one custom node, or a node with cinematic context, in a gold dialogue would become one gold node.

322
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:30,394
And so we could look at, if we had 20 gold dialog files, and one of them had more gold nodes than the other ones, we knew to read that one first, because that item needed scoping, or that needed to get into the pipeline as fast as possible.

323
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:36,478
And we could also, and this is kind of oddly enough, with the game being so big,

324
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:38,880
Data was on our side.

325
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,061
There were trends.

326
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,522
There was an aggregate truth.

327
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:47,929
Most of the time we spend time agonizing over our jiras and task flows and all this kind of stuff to figure out what is the specific truth.

328
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,151
But suddenly we discovered there was an aggregate truth.

329
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:59,220
We could find a ratio of how many custom nodes in a gold dialog file would result in the ask of a new animation asset.

330
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:08,945
So we could predict not only what was going to be most expensive, but how many animation assets that might require, and so we could then prioritize the cinematic animation team.

331
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:13,267
And, you know, that's, I think, moving on.

332
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:16,088
So we have the dialog tool.

333
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:21,431
We have, this is the same dialog file you'll see on the top and in the middle there.

334
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,673
We also highlighted our custom nodes.

335
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:28,174
So you'll see there's a lot of these little green nodes.

336
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:36,095
We made a joke that a bronze dialog file would have no green nodes in it, so you had to get in there and wipe the boogers if they were there.

337
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:41,416
We have 99 nodes in this dialog file.

338
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:45,017
71 of them would be timeline nodes.

339
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,477
They would generate visuals in some way.

340
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,058
There was a line of dialog or there was something that needed to happen.

341
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:57,973
So that meant there were 22 nodes on here that are logical or they're display options for your branching paths and all that kind of stuff.

342
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,807
But 24 nodes would be custom nodes.

343
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,329
And this is where we actually had to spend our time.

344
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:10,552
They were more likely to take more time from our team as cinematic artists or more time from the cinematic animators.

345
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,832
And we could focus on those.

346
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:18,636
And now, when we open a dialog file, we knew that, essentially, I was going to spend all my time on the green nodes.

347
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:22,438
And I could let the scene template take care of the yellow nodes.

348
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:28,160
We knew where to read, because not everything was bespoke.

349
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,161
Not everything was custom.

350
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,050
Evolving problems, solving lighting.

351
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,692
So it was a big game, two lighting artists.

352
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:37,774
This was not by design.

353
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,796
We did try much recruiting.

354
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,517
It's a very high demand role.

355
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:46,760
And we found that adjacent industries didn't translate as well in our efforts.

356
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:55,766
TV and film just don't have to deal with, you could throw 50 lights onto a scene in TV and film because you're doing offline rendering.

357
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,488
And that just wasn't working in a game engine.

358
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:06,914
Our proprietary workflow was not outsourcing friendly, so we couldn't just go hire a bunch of extra hands to chew through the work.

359
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,433
And we had an auto lighting solution for early access, but it didn't handle movement.

360
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:16,556
People, like, the moment they moved, they would step out of the light, and they would be in darkness.

361
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:23,160
So we built this massive backlog of super time-consuming work that needed to happen in the game.

362
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:33,927
I chose this example because you can see, even though we have VFX that emit some amount of light, you can really see the difference between an unlit scene and a beautifully lit scene.

363
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,863
So we came up with this idea of light linking.

364
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:48,317
So we initially, for early access, you can kind of see it in that middle area, there's like the green line and the red line, those are binary keys we're toggling on and off the lights.

365
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:50,978
We had to do this for every light, for every camera, all across.

366
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:54,920
We had to turn it on for this shot, and then turn it off for the next shot, and it was maintenanceing.

367
00:33:55,321 --> 00:34:06,227
And God forbid, you might actually have to change the length of that shot, which happened a lot, and then you would have to move all those keys, and it created a lot of bugs, the maintenanceing was kind of nuts.

368
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:07,651
and

369
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:31,638
Wouldn't it be great if we just put light activation in with the camera activation and this concept of light linking was born?

370
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:41,384
It was very intuitive and it saved massive amounts of time and it suddenly kind of led us to realize that we had two buckets of lighting work.

371
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:44,827
We had bulk light linking and we had custom work.

372
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:47,389
Remember those scene templates?

373
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:54,542
The scene templates that every dialogue in the game, every cinematic in the game used and referenced.

374
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,867
What if we could throw our lights in there?

375
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:19,713
and this was like this was a very like we kind of got lucky because what this allowed us to do is we could take all of these scene templates and we could light them for every different environment in the game and it was a lot of work but it was a finite amount of work we could put our standard lights do all the linking for all the standard cameras that were in those template files and do our color authorship there

376
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:25,579
And then on the timeline layer, we only had to do the custom work, where people were moving, where they were stepping out of their lights.

377
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:34,288
And it was like we figured out a way to infect the game with lighting authorship, rather than just doing it the way that you would normally do it.

378
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:40,395
And then we had the game, which was essentially selecting what colors the lights needed to be.

379
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:42,022
Here's an example.

380
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,283
For Valentine's Day, we released More Kissing.

381
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:45,403
Everybody loves More Kissing.

382
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:49,564
And we put that in our in-party dialogue.

383
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:54,905
So you can talk to one of your companion characters, and we'll peck on the cheek, or more.

384
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:58,686
And the lights would respond to wherever you were.

385
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:07,929
Even though it was the same timeline file, the scene file could be swapped out on the back end, and we could infect the game with very, very cool lights that fit the mood of the environment around you.

386
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:09,609
So project takeaways.

387
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:10,882
what

388
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:38,644
provided a tremendous amount of characterization and really helped I think the players connect with the amazing actors both in the game and on Twitter.

389
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:50,611
And then scaling the team's expectations to just like you're not just an artist toiling away on your timeline file, you are participating and informing the processes that are happening around you.

390
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,632
and then using data-prioritized vetting.

391
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,874
The one thing that is never out of date is P4.

392
00:36:57,455 --> 00:37:00,456
I mean, unless somebody leaves a file checked out over, you know, the weekend.

393
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:01,517
That never happens, though.

394
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:14,425
But when you go into, like, JIRA and you spend so much time fretting about these tracking algorithms and this kind of stuff, it's, you can get out of sync with some of your systems.

395
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:29,445
but if you're just looking at the raw data if you can just look at this dialogue file has three lines of dialogue that don't have a wave file connected to them and use that for your tracking it's constantly telling you what work it needs you to do

396
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,990
What didn't work?

397
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:32,472
Golden path scoping.

398
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:33,772
Like this is typically what you do.

399
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:37,535
This is important to the game, so we won't spend any money on it.

400
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,016
Well, that wasn't going to work.

401
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:42,279
That de-incentivized the exploration that we wanted to achieve.

402
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,420
And then one-to-one cinematics.

403
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,523
It still stings, but we adopted our cinematic dummies.

404
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:52,306
And the game looks good, but I still want another crack at this.

405
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:55,861
I'm going to get personal for a second.

406
00:37:56,922 --> 00:37:57,743
Personal takeaways.

407
00:37:58,123 --> 00:37:58,843
Kill your darling.

408
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,445
So this is a phrase that's used for storytellers.

409
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:05,308
You eliminate all the parts of the story that you love, but you cannot justify.

410
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:08,990
And what remains are the moments that actually serve your story.

411
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:12,893
This, over the course of Baldur's Gate 3, is what I did with my job.

412
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:14,834
I loved storyboarding.

413
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:16,495
And I got storyboard artists.

414
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:20,198
I love working with team and making their shots better.

415
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:23,220
And I took a lot of that and handed that off to my leads.

416
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:33,627
I loved doing mo-cap shoots and working with actors, and I hired a performance director who's now our head of animation, and I hope you saw his talk earlier, because he did a fantastic job earlier.

417
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:37,850
And what remained were director tasks.

418
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:43,454
What remained was unblocking these people so they could do their jobs.

419
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:47,977
And I'll read off one of these quotes at the bottom of the screen from Lazel.

420
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:48,898
Go ahead, go ahead.

421
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:58,228
Thank you.

422
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,249
I'll try a Lae'zel impersonation here.

423
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,969
It's like, it must be said.

424
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,490
Because of you, I still breathe.

425
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,891
Because of you, I still battle.

426
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:12,012
I am not one to show gratitude, but ahem.

427
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,202
I had a new vision for Vision.

428
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:37,413
I thought being a cinematic director was about me delivering the story, and that is what I had worked my career toward, was trying to chase this auteurism, which at this point sounds more like a disease to me.

429
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:43,392
And instead, it was removing obstacles so my team could deliver the story.

430
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,334
And that's the bottom-up approach.

431
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,376
My raw material wasn't the story.

432
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:49,258
My raw material was ambiguity.

433
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:51,640
And my goal was processing this into clarity.

434
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:55,163
And the clarity meant that my team could focus on storytelling.

435
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:56,585
Thank you so much.

436
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,826
You've all been a wonderful audience.

437
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:09,608
I'm sure I said a lot of weird, confusing things, so let's do Q&A.

438
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:10,949
How did you solve the ceiling problem?

439
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,584
The ceiling problem?

440
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:31,267
That would be a GDC talk of its own.

441
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:33,530
It was the art team.

442
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:38,736
They basically just bailed me out on that one.

443
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:43,842
I'm not going to claim to know what they did.

444
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:45,164
They made the ceilings show up.

445
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Hello, wonderful talk.

446
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,001
Thank you for that.

447
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,143
At one point you mentioned that your team was a lot like junior heavy.

448
00:40:57,063 --> 00:41:08,329
So how did you guys approach making the product, but also like teaching the juniors to become better professionals, but the product wouldn't also, you know, kind of suffer in quality because, well, people don't know what they're doing.

449
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,452
So we focus very heavily, we have a pretty tough skills test.

450
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:22,384
and what I would look for, especially because I knew we were going to take this template approach with those scene templates that I talked a lot about.

451
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:33,535
It minimized where people that are learning the pipeline and learning the cinematic rules could actually damage the vision.

452
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:39,919
and this left me open to just looking for people who could take notes well.

453
00:41:40,059 --> 00:42:04,006
I often gave feedback on the skills test and I wouldn't ask them to redo the whole thing but I'd ask for a section to be redone to see that they could take direction well and it really allowed me to just focus on can they learn and does their work get better with notes and if on that rock I can actually build the foundation from.

454
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:05,387
Sweet, thank you.

455
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,917
You mentioned cinematic dummies.

456
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:25,447
that

457
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:45,476
No, just not in the problematic art assets, just the characters themselves.

458
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:54,439
So we could have, you could have the gameplay characters standing here and then you could have the cinematic character actually like talking to the audience and that sort of stuff.

459
00:42:54,479 --> 00:43:05,364
And so we created these like little micro desyncs and we tried to keep them as close as possible, but it allowed the cinematic team to have a character they were controlling and then the scripting and gameplay team to have a character they were controlling.

460
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:10,106
And then when you were in a cinematic, you were seeing the cinematic dummy, but not the gameplay character and vice versa.

461
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:13,587
OK, so it's less to do with the scene, more to do with the characters itself.

462
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:14,387
Yes, correct.

463
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:15,807
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

464
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:16,447
OK, thank you.

465
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:17,107
No problem.

466
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:21,908
Hello, I have a much less serious question.

467
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:22,568
Oh, OK.

468
00:43:22,588 --> 00:43:30,129
I think it was update two or three where they added the extra leaning down for romantic partners to kiss the player character.

469
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:30,529
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:31,710
Gnomes are halflings.

471
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,870
My question is, one, why wasn't that in the main game?

472
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,571
And two, what was the reaction when you realized you didn't put it in there?

473
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:45,522
So, there's like technical reasons and that sort of stuff.

474
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:47,686
There was...

475
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:50,295
of the game.

476
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:18,199
You mentioned that one of your core principles was not making the game smaller.

477
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:20,420
And do you still live by that?

478
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,341
Should I quit my job for the next game or something like that?

479
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,402
And at what point enough is enough?

480
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:29,963
At what point is enough enough?

481
00:44:30,663 --> 00:44:31,903
That's a great question.

482
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,885
I'm not going to speculate on that.

483
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,065
That is something that I ask Sven often.

484
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:43,027
But it is always, as always, his question to answer.

485
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:45,128
Sorry.

486
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:52,715
Hey, I am Jan, and thank you for that very entertaining talk, Jason.

487
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:57,218
I had a question regarding more production and team.

488
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:02,823
So you've shown very vividly the victories you had, the challenges you faced throughout the process.

489
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:08,748
But I was wondering, especially during COVID, how did you and your team counteract burnout?

490
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:10,756
pronouns?

491
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:12,398
Burnouts.

492
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:21,044
So there's a little bit of working in the EU.

493
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:26,228
There's actually limitations on how many days in a row people can work and that sort of stuff.

494
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:27,289
That certainly helps.

495
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:34,615
This was one of the things where I was talking about all of our custom nodes and all of our tracking and this kind of thing.

496
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:41,957
This eventually led to, I didn't want it to become a spreadsheet kind of demonstration because I'm not a producer, but I do look at a lot of spreadsheets.

497
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:52,099
We were able to predict how long we thought it would take a cinematic artist to chew through their work, and if they were working at a good pace, we would make sure that we would kind of, we sent them home sometimes.

498
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,760
It was something where I wanted

499
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,322
I had some long hours when I was coming up in the industry, and I wanted better for my team.

500
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:07,404
So we tried to look after them in that way by really having a clear idea on how long it should take them to get things.

501
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:15,847
And then if they were taking too long, sometimes they would protest, but we would redistribute the work to other team members who were moving ahead.

502
00:46:15,967 --> 00:46:18,027
So that's how we took it very personally.

503
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:19,368
Very insightful.

504
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:19,688
Thank you.

505
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:20,088
Thank you.

506
00:46:22,557 --> 00:46:23,237
Hey, Jason.

507
00:46:24,038 --> 00:46:25,758
So super informative talks.

508
00:46:25,798 --> 00:46:27,779
Thanks so much for sharing the information.

509
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:32,741
So I, too, work for RPG games, RPG single-player games.

510
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:39,204
So I'm wondering, you mentioned a lot about the staging, and I really like the staging for Baldur's Gate.

511
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:43,006
So I'm just wondering, who are responsible for those staging?

512
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:52,010
Are designers or writers, do they also contribute to how scenes are staged, lit, or how are they composed?

513
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,151
implement it.

514
00:46:53,551 --> 00:47:04,117
So our director of world building, Farang, once said, you can look at no part of Baldur's Gate 3 and point to something that 30 people didn't touch.

515
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:10,702
So there'll be, for the most part, cinematics would read and be inspired by the work of writers and come up with the staging plan.

516
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:15,745
But sometimes the writers would have specific ideas, or you would gather ideas from the level design itself.

517
00:47:16,685 --> 00:47:30,930
As far as the standard staging, that was mostly the cinematic leadership because we needed to make sure that we had alignment on what the standard setup was going to be and what the goals were, and then the rest of the team got to implement and use those.

518
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:32,371
Yeah, that makes sense.

519
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:37,193
Thanks so much, and also thanks so much for bringing out such a beautiful experience.

520
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:38,133
Thank you.

521
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:44,938
Yeah, hello.

522
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,279
First of all, thank you.

523
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:50,279
Second of all, I have a very serious question.

524
00:47:50,379 --> 00:47:59,321
So with the Valentine's Day update, not ascended Astarian got less kiss animations than other characters.

525
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:04,602
So how are you going to fix this?

526
00:48:06,122 --> 00:48:07,322
This ground injustice?

527
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:10,843
I mean, this goes back to how much is enough, right?

528
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:18,939
It's something that, yeah, I have no good answer for this.

529
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,180
Bye.

530
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,702
Yeah, thank you anyways.

531
00:48:25,722 --> 00:48:26,142
Thank you.

532
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:32,205
You said something so profound.

533
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:40,929
You said you as a lead don't worry about delivering the story, but you unblock the rest of the team so that they can create the story.

534
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:50,936
And I wanted to know how that type of communication actually went between the departments involved with that type of mentality geared towards that.

535
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:55,138
Well, so it's funny.

536
00:48:55,178 --> 00:49:01,320
So I have a twin brother, and he's here at GDC.

537
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:06,623
And so the joke is like now all my team get to meet him and figure out which one of us is the evil twin.

538
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:09,806
And everybody at Larian knows it's me.

539
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:14,431
Because unblocking would take confrontation.

540
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:18,315
It would take some real talk with some of the other collaborators.

541
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,177
And we would do that on a director level.

542
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:25,844
And that's how we arrive at consensus and something that would work for their team and would work for my team as well.

543
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:46,934
And, yeah, I think it did take, like, some of the folks that joined the cinematic teams from other cinematic pipelines that had shipped games before, it kind of took them a while to get used to me, like, not having something to say about everything they were doing, because I wanted them to, they needed to grow.

544
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:52,297
And there's a kind of a term, this is one of my weird terms, of compatible mutation.

545
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:59,259
You want everybody to invest in a little of their own creativity in something.

546
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:02,540
And as long as it's not going in the wrong direction, it works.

547
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,760
If a plant is seeking the sun, it won't die.

548
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:08,201
So you have to make sure that it's seeking the sun.

549
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:11,842
And that's when you would choose whether or not I would intervene on something.

550
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:13,042
Was it veering off course?

551
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,003
Or was it working well?

552
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:19,004
And if it could be clearer, that's where I would typically intervene.

553
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:26,811
But if it was just like, I didn't want the team to try and play the song that only I could hear, because the game was too big for that.

554
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:32,335
And then how did you handle the more difficult conflicts?

555
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:37,080
Like maybe you had somebody that was stubborn and was like, no, I want to tell this specific story, and this is all I want to tell.

556
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,581
And you're like, eh.

557
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:41,203
A lot of times it's the communicative goals.

558
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:43,846
Like there's every, like it goes back to analysis.

559
00:50:44,406 --> 00:50:53,929
what is the scene about, and then if we make the conversation about what the scene is about, then we can arrive at a consensus on what the execution should be.

560
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:58,010
But you have to go back to core principles, and that's something that I pushed a lot with the team.

561
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:04,171
So there weren't many, like, there was no, like, loggerheads with, with my team that I can remember.

562
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,472
Maybe they disagree.

563
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:07,492
Q Got you.

564
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:07,992
Thank you, sir.

565
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,618
Thank you for the genuinely most funny session.

566
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,419
This GDC is amazing.

567
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:22,541
And it's also always wonderful to get to see that it's truly an iterative process, riddled with all these things.

568
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:36,426
How did you get your player community to be so tolerant of what's going on in the cinematics, some of these funky things going on in the background, until everything gets patched up?

569
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,999
They were just with us.

570
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,941
They had us.

571
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:44,082
They supported us.

572
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:53,990
I inherited a wonderfully trusting community from the Divinity franchise and all the stuff that they had already done.

573
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:58,194
I got very lucky with that, but I don't know what makes them so awesome.

574
00:51:58,354 --> 00:51:59,415
Thank you for being awesome.

575
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:04,029
Awesome.

576
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:04,710
Amazing talk.

577
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:05,611
It's been a lot of fun.

578
00:52:06,011 --> 00:52:07,252
And thank you for making Baldur's Gate 3.

579
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:13,357
I was also impressed by the comment where your job was to unblock the team and allow their creativity to thrive.

580
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:25,007
I'm curious if you have advice for people who are not lead level, not managers, for when their managers are overstepping or where they would like to try to involve or bring that culture to their own studios.

581
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:29,486
I think it is, it depends, right?

582
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:36,129
There are two truisms that I've found about, that has applied to my whole career.

583
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:40,211
And the first is, reward for good work is more work.

584
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:43,792
And you can never be right at the wrong time.

585
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:50,975
And sometimes you're in a situation like that, where you know in your bones, this is right, but the universe is like, nobody's feeling that need yet.

586
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:54,277
Nobody's hungry for what that truth is.

587
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:56,859
sensing whether or not that's the case.

588
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,505
And I also know that expending a lot of energy trying to make it the right time when it's the wrong time, you can burn a lot of political capital that way.

589
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:05,926
So tread lightly with that.

590
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:10,570
If you can, have a conversation about those initial principles.

591
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,891
What are the communicative goals?

592
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:17,176
If you just feel that a good kickoff keeps notes from feeling punitive,

593
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:27,462
Because if you have an agreement on what the scene's about, again, it's just kind of talking about how clear are your artistic decisions in making the point of that scene.

594
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:40,570
And if you've lost your way in that conversation with your lead, bringing it back to that and making sure that you're on board and aligned with what their goals are is typically going to be where you're going to find that collaboration.

595
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:41,550
Amazing.

596
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:41,931
Thank you.

597
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:42,571
Cool.

598
00:53:43,672 --> 00:53:43,932
All right.

599
00:53:43,992 --> 00:53:44,592
I think that's it.

600
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:46,033
Thank you, everyone.

601
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:47,114
Have a great GDC.
