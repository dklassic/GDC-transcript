1
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:11,401
I'm supposed to tell you to turn off your cell phones and things like that, so please do that.

2
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:16,024
And I'm supposed to also tell you to sort of like scoot in and make room for more people,

3
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:18,085
but I see that's not really necessary, so good job.

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:22,347
Okay, I really appreciate you guys all being here.

5
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:24,869
This is actually my first time talking at GDC,

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,232
so the fact that any of you are here at all really means something to me. Thanks.

7
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,510
I'm guessing there are a lot of artists and designers in the room.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,891
That's kind of what I put on the schedule.

9
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,752
So I hope you are.

10
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:42,974
And if you're anything like the people I've worked with,

11
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,215
or me for example,

12
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:46,557
there are times when you're working on a project

13
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:48,998
and it becomes difficult to sort of

14
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:51,380
mesh a clear artistic vision

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,641
with sort of a gameplay direction

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:56,103
and combine them into something that works for everybody

17
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,804
and makes sort of a harmonious whole for the game.

18
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:01,606
And there can be a little bit of a clash between artists and designers.

19
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:06,891
And one thing that we've done with our workflow to create the game Rayman Legends

20
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,734
is build a tool and sort of a pipeline and a way of working

21
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:16,339
that tries to sort of mitigate this issue a little bit and make the process smoother for everybody,

22
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,941
but also make it really fast, intuitive, and flexible

23
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:24,326
so that we can produce a lot and produce quality a lot faster than normal.

24
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:27,950
So, who am I? Why am I here talking to you? Why do you care?

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,162
I'm a game and level designer at Ubisoft Montpellier in southern France.

26
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:36,546
I've had the pleasure of working with them for about three years now.

27
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:40,770
I've been working exclusively on Rayman titles in the Ubiart framework, which is our tool

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,231
that we use to build them.

29
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:47,116
So I've got quite a bit of experience using this tool pretty much exclusively for my career.

30
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:50,899
So I have a lot of experience that I'd like to share with you guys, and hopefully you'll

31
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,340
take something interesting away from it.

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,601
What's the plan?

33
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,547
I'm going to start by just giving you a little bit of a rundown of our design process in a nutshell.

34
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:03,469
So you can sort of see why it's an interesting process,

35
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:10,574
or maybe why it's a little bit different from the ones that you're familiar with.

36
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:13,636
Then of course, what's the tech?

37
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:16,637
Why do we use this tool? What have we built to use?

38
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,859
And how does it help us follow this process that we set for ourselves?

39
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:22,341
And then of course I'm going to talk about Rayman.

40
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,922
It's my only frame of reference.

41
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,557
So I'm going to talk about some useful systems and tools that we have,

42
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,937
case studies from the actual production of the game,

43
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:35,378
and a little bit of a post-mortem to give you some insight into things that we know went right

44
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:39,119
and things that we know could have gone a little bit better.

45
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,279
And I'm going to end

46
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:43,900
the presentation by giving you a little bit of information about

47
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,861
a couple other games that are being made in the framework that aren't exactly Rayman.

48
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,282
So I'm going to let you guys in on a little secret, okay?

49
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:57,509
The secret to designing Rayman is actually quite similar to the secret of playing Rayman,

50
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,695
which is rapid, iterative failure.

51
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,898
So basically what I mean by that is

52
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:08,859
with our tool, with our process,

53
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,240
we can design so quickly,

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,601
we can try a bunch of different things so fast,

55
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,741
that we can fail so much more often.

56
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,702
Sounds awesome, right?

57
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:17,643
You fail about 40 times a day,

58
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,104
but then you get one win before you go home for the night.

59
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:20,924
And that's enough.

60
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:23,645
Because tomorrow you have something to work from.

61
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:26,506
And it's really great to be able to put all these ideas in front of somebody

62
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,487
and prove concepts and disprove concepts

63
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:30,568
really fast

64
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:32,068
and know that you're moving in the right direction.

65
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:38,758
So, one of these core philosophies we have to work from is no idea is sacred.

66
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:43,660
I've seen a lot of people, I still see a lot of people do this, and I still do this myself

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,102
sometimes that people hold on to an idea.

68
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,163
It's like, no, no, no, but trust me, this is the best thing.

69
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,148
We need this. It's gonna make or break the game.

70
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,969
And they just put like little bandages.

71
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,650
You know, it's like your arm just got cut off,

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,010
but you're putting a band-aid on it.

73
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,111
It's not really gonna change much.

74
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,612
It's already messed up. It's not gonna happen.

75
00:03:58,612 --> 00:03:59,713
So why are you trying to fix it?

76
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,714
And so sometimes it's just about learning

77
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:03,655
when to let go of an idea

78
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:05,395
and move on to something more promising.

79
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,636
And that's usually what happens for us,

80
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:10,458
is we're able to create so many different little ideas

81
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,559
and different executions of the same idea

82
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,720
that we learn to let go a lot quicker

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,801
and move on in the right direction without too much fuss.

84
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:26,097
I don't want to waste anybody's time, except for my own, because, I mean, I know why I'm

85
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:26,618
wasting it.

86
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:31,281
I have an idea, I want to see if it works, so I'm okay spending a bit of extra time to

87
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,902
prove or disprove it.

88
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:37,585
But I don't like the idea of briefing two programmers and an artist on an idea of mine,

89
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:42,208
and then telling them, hey, invest two weeks of your time to make a prototype to prove

90
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,069
or disprove whether or not this is a great idea.

91
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,032
Because then after two weeks it sucks, and it's all my fault, and I wasted their time

92
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,653
when they could have been doing something more important.

93
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:57,401
So, I'm perfectly happy to spend a little bit of extra time doing a bit of art, doing a bit of scripting,

94
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:03,130
and some sort of messy combination in our engine, to make something that works, or doesn't work,

95
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,415
rather than actually having to go to someone that doesn't need to be involved yet.

96
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,759
that allows the programmers and the artists to actually be investigating things

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,842
that we know are going to be in the game later.

98
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:16,227
Larger systems, things that are really important to investigate in the long term.

99
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:19,371
And only when I've proven my concept to a creative director

100
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,835
or somebody else that's important, do we actually invest the time to make it.

101
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:30,200
We also tend to work together, but separately at the same time.

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,361
What we basically do is, because you know when you're making a level, right?

103
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:39,423
You build the level design layer, and then it's time for the artist to start doing his art pass.

104
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,103
And it's like, okay, give me the level, it's my turn to work on it.

105
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,204
Okay, fine.

106
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,904
But then you're kind of got some downtime, and every time you want to work on it,

107
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:48,205
you have to sort of like pass it back and forth,

108
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,606
unless you're working in a more structured way.

109
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,626
I mean, at least that's how I've done it in the past, which is a shame.

110
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,531
So what we do is we basically say,

111
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,596
this is the level design layer, right?

112
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,999
This is where I'm building my level,

113
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,444
all the gameplay elements in the game plane.

114
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:05,306
no bullshit, just the stuff that I need, right?

115
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:06,347
Then there's the art layer.

116
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,068
It's in the exact same level,

117
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,791
but it's only the art elements that complement

118
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,013
the visual aspect of what I've created.

119
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:16,115
And that's inside of the root file, of course.

120
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,297
So you have one scene, which is the entire level.

121
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,079
And then you have sub-scenes

122
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,582
that are manipulable individually by different people.

123
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:26,384
And when they send their updates,

124
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,566
and I can get the new data and open it,

125
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:32,869
When I open the whole file, their part is updated, and I'm still working on my thing.

126
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,650
So nobody is slowed down in the process.

127
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,591
And that's extremely important.

128
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,873
Because that means that once I stumble upon that little gem,

129
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,034
where it's like, ah, this is the idea that's working,

130
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,916
let's move on from there, and everybody approves it,

131
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,857
the artist can start working on that already,

132
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:50,780
while I'm continuing to flesh it out and work on new things.

133
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,601
And also we need to remain flexible,

134
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,042
because later when you're debugging,

135
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:57,244
or when you're sort of re-evaluating work you've already done a while ago,

136
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:01,227
You want to reserve the right to be able to adjust things

137
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:04,388
without having to adjust all the artwork too.

138
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:10,130
On Rayman, it's especially important for us to design with the artist in mind.

139
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,591
We can't just make something that we think plays cool,

140
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,792
oh, it looks a lot of fun, whatever.

141
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,413
No, but trust me, the inputs are great,

142
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,074
and I'm teaching the player exactly what I need to,

143
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,114
so it's going to be great.

144
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,395
And then the artist has to go in there and say,

145
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,056
oh, but how am I supposed to decorate this?

146
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,357
It just doesn't work, it looks like crap, what are you doing?

147
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,578
It's like, yeah, but trust me, it's important for the game.

148
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:30,180
It's like they're not your mom, they don't just come in and clean up your mess

149
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,863
because you're the designer and you're all powerful and you say what you want and it has to go.

150
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:38,065
And so we try to design with the artist in mind.

151
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,566
What they do is they create art kits.

152
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:43,068
I mean, when you've got art this beautiful, do you really want to mess it up?

153
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:47,772
Or do you want to complement it and make the whole game feel better?

154
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:50,213
So they give us an art kit, something like this for example.

155
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:54,536
This is a concept, but they can actually extract the artwork from it and make a kit out of it.

156
00:07:55,217 --> 00:08:00,079
So in this case, it's a nice, you know, flat ground, some little hills with flowers on it,

157
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,981
and you say, oh, I want to make a right angle, because I want to have a wall jump.

158
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:07,123
It just doesn't work. It looks ugly. It doesn't make any sense.

159
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,865
And so what we have to do is think, do we need this wall jump?

160
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,566
Or can I think of an interesting alternative,

161
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:17,668
or a totally different idea altogether that complements the kit that I've been given?

162
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,336
And that's one of the cores of the production on the design side of Rayman Legends and Rayman Origins

163
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,682
is that we're constantly thinking about the rules and the constraints that the artists have given us

164
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:31,247
with the artwork they've created, and trying to use it to our advantage

165
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,671
rather than seeing it as something that's holding us back.

166
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:39,208
This is an example of when I was doing pre-production for one of the worlds in the game.

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,069
It was supposed to be an underwater base.

168
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:45,391
And I didn't really know what the topology should be like.

169
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,952
And there wasn't any concept, which was rare for us.

170
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,333
Normally the artists do concepts and we build on top of those.

171
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,754
But here we didn't have the time.

172
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:56,335
And I had to investigate before they could actually draw something.

173
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,976
So I was thinking about what could I do to make interesting topology

174
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:04,698
that would fit with the setting that I already knew.

175
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:12,062
But it had to be solid and artistic and so you can see that for example the larger pipes are sort of the borders and

176
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:18,206
The smaller pipes are connected things don't feel unbalanced it all sort of it's a solid and on top of that

177
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:22,729
I had an interesting gameplay layer. You know it's actually a fun level to play

178
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,091
So then I passed that to the concept artist and he paints over it

179
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,713
And then of course, it looks good.

180
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,314
I mean, it's a rough concept, but it says,

181
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:33,096
hey, that layout actually works. Not bad.

182
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:36,318
So then we go through the process of approving things,

183
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:37,598
and one thing leads to another.

184
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,580
The artists make the final assets.

185
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,021
We integrate it into the level.

186
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,102
The level design didn't change.

187
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,163
I defined the topology.

188
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:47,465
And at the same time, the artist had what they needed

189
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,406
to be able to make something beautiful.

190
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,548
But it's because I designed with the artist in mind from the beginning.

191
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,745
So how is this magical process done?

192
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:01,246
It's not necessarily the easiest thing in the world to say we make

193
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,926
five million prototypes every week,

194
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:06,047
throw away four million of them, we have one little gem and everyone's happy.

195
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,608
Not everybody has that luxury.

196
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,609
Of course we have a very talented team.

197
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,089
That's important. We work well together.

198
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:17,091
But also we have an interesting piece of technology that we developed

199
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:20,352
for Rayman Origins and have been constantly updating alongside the

200
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,732
development of future titles.

201
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,192
So the magic tech is the Ubiart framework.

202
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:31,236
I'm going to show you a little video just to get you into the mood,

203
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:34,599
and then we'll continue from there, and I'll give you some more details

204
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,321
on why it's an interesting tool for me as a designer.

205
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:22,898
kind of pretty right? Not bad. So as it said, the tool was designed for artists.

206
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:28,981
So it's, it's a, it was a 2D game engine. It always was. It's what it was designed for.

207
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,183
It has full HD, 60 frames per second, all that technical nonsense. But it's impressive.

208
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:37,186
I mean, our games are very fast and fluid. We can have a lot of detailed textures in

209
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:40,968
there. We have a lot of layers. And it still runs very, very smoothly. And that was one

210
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,950
of the key selling points for us when building this tech. It needed to run well.

211
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,608
but it's artist-friendly at its core.

212
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:54,357
I mean, what an artist has to do to get an asset from concept

213
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,044
into the engine in the playable game, all he has to do

214
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:58,605
is paint a concept.

215
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:04,011
cut a piece out, like a tree or a rock or something that he likes in the scenery,

216
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,712
save it out with an alpha channel, drag and drop and it's in the engine.

217
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:12,775
And they can just scale, move it around, whatever, change the colors, change the distance in the Z, everything like that.

218
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,355
But it's that easy.

219
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:19,378
There are other, more complicated methods of bringing art into the engine that I'm going to show you,

220
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,739
that help me as a designer.

221
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:28,611
But it doesn't change the fact that it's extremely easy for artists and designers to create content in this engine

222
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:32,037
because it was built with the artist in mind.

223
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:36,043
And it's fast, intuitive, and flexible in everything that it does.

224
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:43,806
So, just a little bit of information on the Rayman series,

225
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,950
because that's where all the examples are going to be coming from.

226
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,674
Like I said, I got the chance to work on Origins and Legends.

227
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:53,277
And back in 2011, when we released Origins,

228
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:55,159
we had four-player co-op,

229
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,804
a large number of levels, HD 2D graphics, 60 frames per second, all that stuff I said, right?

230
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,947
And of course when you're making a sequel, you don't want to just make a direct sequel.

231
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:07,570
You want to actually make it meaningful, make it something that people want to buy.

232
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,272
So we wanted to add new features, make the engine more robust.

233
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:14,395
This is just a small list. We have a lot of new additions that we made

234
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,297
during the course of transitioning from Origins to Legends.

235
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:21,059
But some big changes we made were online functionality that we didn't have before.

236
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:25,790
a lighting system, touchscreen gameplay, 3D bosses.

237
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,532
We didn't have support for any 3D objects in the environment before, and then we added

238
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:32,654
it for Rayman Legends, and the game still runs the same.

239
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:37,897
So we wanted to make sure that we're constantly updating our technology to give us the capability

240
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:41,419
to do more than we ever thought that we could with the tool.

241
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,642
And it also gives us a larger range of things that we can actually do to surprise the player.

242
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:53,459
So this is sort of like the most impressive part of the talk.

243
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,181
I'm going to be showing quite a few videos of the tools that we use

244
00:14:57,181 --> 00:15:00,283
and explaining sort of why they're interesting from the perspective of a designer.

245
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,684
I think they're kind of going to speak for themselves,

246
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,447
but I'll talk anyway because I like to do it.

247
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,208
So here's the biggest one.

248
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,508
It's our gameplay geometry.

249
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,350
And for some reason it's called freezes.

250
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,790
I think it's a French thing, but I don't really know.

251
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,214
And basically, you just double-click and you start dragging vertices around.

252
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,045
It's like manipulating something in a 3D modeling package on a plane,

253
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:25,726
but what's impressive is that it's graphically complete.

254
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,407
All the textures are already there.

255
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,228
As you move the vertices around,

256
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:32,668
the textures update depending on the angle

257
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,489
that the vertex is at, for example.

258
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,890
So when you have a vertical face, it changes to a cliffside.

259
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,230
If it's horizontal, then you're going to get the grass.

260
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,155
And of course I can check and see where Rayman's been for the past few steps,

261
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:52,282
which allows me to quickly add new elements and improve my level or continue designing the level I'm working on.

262
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:56,947
So that thing was a little bit too high, now I brought it down and it feels better.

263
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,870
And I can move on to the next step, so I can bring a platform in.

264
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:08,288
And just this ease of use is really the key to making so many prototypes all day, every day,

265
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:09,929
and being okay with throwing them away.

266
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:14,051
Because if it takes you five minutes to make an entire screen sequence,

267
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,512
who cares if you have to throw it away?

268
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,213
That's business as usual.

269
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:19,054
But if you had to draw it out on paper,

270
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:21,935
and then convince somebody to help you build something so you can do your sequence,

271
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,836
and then it takes you three weeks, and then, oh, it doesn't work?

272
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,492
you're not going to be happy throwing that away exactly.

273
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:30,153
I can actually pause while I'm playing too.

274
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,795
And I can place things where they need to be.

275
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,496
So I can sort of have real great precision

276
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,677
on where my enemies are going to be placed, where my platforms are.

277
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,198
And then I just press P and I'm back to the game.

278
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,340
So the most important thing about all of this

279
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,201
is that the game is live

280
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,743
while you're manipulating anything in the environment.

281
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:50,825
It's really, really important for the speed of iteration,

282
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:52,066
for testing your sequences,

283
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,067
for knowing that what you're doing is actually working or not.

284
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:58,425
and everything that we have in this tool just helps to

285
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,366
push that feeling of flexibility, creativity,

286
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:05,347
and allowing someone to express themselves with minimal hassle.

287
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:08,028
And also what's interesting about this visually complete geometry

288
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,868
is that just in the level design layer,

289
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,649
you already have a visually representative prototype

290
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,950
of what the final thing might look like.

291
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,430
You know that it's cliffs and grass,

292
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,731
and you know when something doesn't look right.

293
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,792
It's easy for us to fall into the trap of just saying,

294
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,473
I'm going to use white box,

295
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:27,474
make something that I think could look like a space station,

296
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:28,755
and then the artist looks at it and says,

297
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:31,016
how am I supposed to make a space station out of this?

298
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,037
This doesn't make any sense.

299
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:34,298
It's too organic, it's too this, it's too that.

300
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,458
And what this does is they say,

301
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,780
these are the things that you can use,

302
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,040
this is how they work,

303
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,901
work within those constraints.

304
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:43,302
And it changes the way that we have to think about our levels,

305
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:43,983
for the better.

306
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,692
So, we have other types of freezes though.

307
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,294
We have pipe freezes, which are simpler to manipulate

308
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,815
because you only need about two or three vertices

309
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,777
and everything is already built around it.

310
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:58,959
The collision, the shape, the way that everything looks.

311
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,101
So it's extremely fast to just build a pipe network,

312
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,161
connect things to one another.

313
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,743
What you're seeing here actually,

314
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:07,804
since we don't have perspective in the game,

315
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,245
we obviously have to fake it somehow

316
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,666
to make the game look nice.

317
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,583
So we have the ability to add two extremity textures

318
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,445
on the same area, basically, of the freeze,

319
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:20,008
and we can switch between the two at any time.

320
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,491
So we just say, OK, Rayman needs to stand on top of this,

321
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,673
and perspective-wise, this looks wrong.

322
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,795
So you just right-click, switch texture,

323
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:32,178
and then it looks the way it's supposed to.

324
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:32,959
It's super fast.

325
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:38,556
We also have this thing called Metaphreezes.

326
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,879
This is something that we actually designed

327
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,081
during the production of Rayman Legends,

328
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,663
so it was an addition later,

329
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:47,146
because we realized, yeah, everything's live,

330
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:47,967
even the enemy's dying.

331
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:53,214
we realized that we were sort of working backwards sometimes.

332
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:57,678
We were actually having three or four freezes we had to manipulate at the same time every time.

333
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,360
And that's not really something you want to do.

334
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,742
So what we did is we combined multiple freezes,

335
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,185
the background, the playground, the foreground of this platform,

336
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,646
into one manipulable object.

337
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,609
What that does is it preserves the flexibility of the tiling

338
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,050
of each of the individual freezes

339
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,372
without causing unnecessary stretching or compromising

340
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:15,773
the visual quality, and at the same time,

341
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,575
preserving the flexibility of manipulation, which

342
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:18,335
is extremely important for us.

343
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,076
These ones are really cool.

344
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,078
They look a bit like pipe freezes,

345
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,719
but they're nothing like pipe freezes.

346
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:37,813
They're Bezier, so they're spline controlled.

347
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,713
And the collision is dynamically generated

348
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,534
based on the spline that you have.

349
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,434
It's updated in real time, obviously,

350
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,035
and manipulation is extremely easy.

351
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:48,096
You can see it's also visually complete,

352
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:49,817
like all the other freezes.

353
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,378
It tiles properly, stretches, updates.

354
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:55,278
You're playing it, it's live, just like everything else.

355
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,099
And there are a lot of extra parameters

356
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,079
on top of these things

357
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,260
that make them even more interesting for prototyping.

358
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:06,427
One thing you can also see here is that we use the same system of manipulation for our collectibles now.

359
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:11,850
In Rayman Origins, we actually placed every single loom, the little collectible guys,

360
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,991
we used to place every single one by hand.

361
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:19,935
And now all we have to do is put a spline to say they start here, they end there, you trigger it,

362
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,956
and they just sort of fly to the end position.

363
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:30,281
So it just makes the whole level design process that little bit less tedious

364
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:35,063
and that makes it fine if I throw it away.

365
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,864
It didn't take me 10 minutes just to place 500 stupid looms.

366
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,044
It took me two seconds, so I can delete them.

367
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:39,304
Who cares?

368
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:44,306
We also have things like the ability to make them grow and retract,

369
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:45,306
just with a simple trigger.

370
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:50,235
And now, of course, if you're a designer, you can imagine all kinds of interesting things you can do with this.

371
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:50,935
And that's not all.

372
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:54,197
But it's just one of the many little features that were added

373
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:57,559
that just brings so much more to the table as a designer to make creative levels.

374
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,481
And when it's integrated into a visually complete package,

375
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,642
there's no reason not to use it.

376
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:04,804
So here's just a little example of a combination of some traditional freezes,

377
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:05,464
some Bezier freezes, some animation.

378
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,712
and a coin.

379
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:17,293
And that's about it.

380
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:20,855
It's just a combination of a couple simple systems.

381
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:24,858
To build this, it wouldn't take more than five minutes for us.

382
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,719
It's really, really fast.

383
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,480
And I'm talking about visually speaking, too.

384
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,881
The background, foreground, who cares?

385
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:31,983
But the stuff that you're playing on,

386
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:33,764
it looks like that when you build it.

387
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:34,864
There's no extra work necessary.

388
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:40,640
Of course, every level designer needs white box

389
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,183
because there are some prototypes that you just need the freedom to do what you want

390
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:46,544
exactly the way that you want.

391
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:50,267
It's cool to have these visually complete freezes, but sometimes we don't know where

392
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,248
we're going with the world

393
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:55,372
or where the specific sequence fits into the grand scheme of the game.

394
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,814
As you can see, it's still flexible, like everything else.

395
00:21:57,814 --> 00:22:00,075
It's very fast to work with this kind of stuff.

396
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:04,119
But what's really powerful for me personally about these white box freezes

397
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,261
is what I can do with them when it comes to prototyping.

398
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,787
Because I can combine them with other elements

399
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,509
and I can make my own gameplay.

400
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:15,594
Basically, it's just a mixture of a couple different freezes,

401
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:18,458
a couple movement tweens, and a trigger.

402
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,181
And what I've basically simulated is

403
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,864
a button that gets pressed and it triggers a door to open.

404
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:28,459
And that's just the speed at which I can make a gameplay element

405
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:32,640
that would normally take an artist and some programmers some time to develop

406
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
before it can prove that it works.

407
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,441
I've proven that it worked in about half a day of work.

408
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:40,001
And I can easily manipulate it too, if the scale is wrong,

409
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,461
if the shape is a bit wrong, or the color.

410
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,282
One thing I like to do too, is white box sketching.

411
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:42,462
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:58,652
I don't know what happened.

413
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:02,315
I'm going to continue while this boots up.

414
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,077
I'm really, really sorry.

415
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:04,597
I don't know why.

416
00:23:04,597 --> 00:23:10,502
One thing I like to do is I really take this sort of white box geometry and I sketch what

417
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:11,783
it is that I want it to look like.

418
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:18,909
Because what I need to do is I have to convince the artist and everybody of what my vision

419
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:19,309
is, basically.

420
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,073
What I could do is I could simply make this object a red circle and say it's a dangerous

421
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:24,453
object.

422
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:24,614
Go.

423
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:29,627
And the artist, okay, well, what do you want for this red circle and all that kind of stuff?

424
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:31,168
And they have to figure it out.

425
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,470
But for me, I think it's important that it has spikes.

426
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,272
It needs to be clear why it's dangerous for the player.

427
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:39,294
Because science and feedback are important, right?

428
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,695
And so the ability for me to actually sketch that out

429
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:45,938
makes it a lot more powerful for me to be able to pitch that idea to somebody.

430
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:51,385
And what's interesting is when you look at the final art asset, basically,

431
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:56,251
it looks relatively similar to what I was able to actually produce with the white box.

432
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:57,092
So it makes sense.

433
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:02,115
And actually this is one of the things that I do on a daily basis.

434
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:06,038
It's one of the things that is the strongest thing for me

435
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:07,880
as a level designer in this engine

436
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,602
is to be able to sketch things out like this so rapidly.

437
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:13,244
What you could say is, you can just draw it out in Photoshop

438
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,165
and drag and drop it into the engine.

439
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:16,766
Okay, why not? That's fine.

440
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:18,387
That's what it's built for, right?

441
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:19,808
But for someone like me,

442
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,691
I'm 100% used to actually working in the engine.

443
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:25,112
These freezes, they're like, it's my Maya.

444
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:28,814
You know, I don't need to leave the engine to do things.

445
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:31,995
And the fact that I can actually do it so fast like this,

446
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,555
it just makes my life that much easier.

447
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,175
And it makes it more flexible for me too.

448
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:39,357
I don't actually have to open another package to make a small change,

449
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:40,577
resave, reload.

450
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:40,937
No.

451
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,558
I just grab a vertex, drag it up.

452
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:43,158
Does it work?

453
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:43,418
Cool.

454
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:43,938
Does it not work?

455
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:44,078
Okay.

456
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:44,918
Move it around again.

457
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:45,618
I'm very sorry about this.

458
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:45,858
I can juggle.

459
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,220
But basically, I mean, that's what it comes down to, right?

460
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,721
Is everything about this tool is about empowering us,

461
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,802
as designers and artists, to do our job

462
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:10,502
that much faster than we normally could.

463
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:13,623
And that's why all the systems are built that way.

464
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:17,043
And honestly, working in it is a dream.

465
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:20,224
I worked in other editors before, in school,

466
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,844
for fun, whatever.

467
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:25,205
But, to be fair, it just doesn't compare at all

468
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,625
to the power that we have with UBART framework.

469
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,230
I'm very sorry.

470
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,710
I hope so.

471
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,531
On my first time too, what are the chances?

472
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,411
I think we're back for now.

473
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:15,573
Cross your fingers.

474
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,173
If not, I'll just juggle.

475
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:24,374
So what I was talking about, and then it turns into something like that when the artist gets

476
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,655
their hands on it.

477
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:26,095
It's great.

478
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:27,113
It's awesome.

479
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:31,396
And it's cool that I was able to sort of inspire them in a certain direction, even though I'm

480
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,317
not an artist myself.

481
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:34,618
We have Lua scripting as well.

482
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:40,522
So there's a way that we can actually add a little bit more functionality to our visual

483
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:41,443
prototypes.

484
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,844
It's not just all artsy-fartsy.

485
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:45,165
But it's simple scripting.

486
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,466
It's nothing too complicated.

487
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:49,228
I picked this up very quickly, and I'm not really a programmer.

488
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:55,412
So what we have is we have simple chunks of behavior, like a shake, a movement, ease in, ease out, things like that.

489
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:58,974
And you can just sort of stick one in front of the other, it's a series of events.

490
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:05,859
And that's how we can do simple things like moving an object down the screen, making a crusher that shakes and comes back.

491
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:10,802
We can pretty much prototype everything we need to using these tweens, these movement tweens in Lua scripting,

492
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:13,764
plus all the tools that I've shown you already in the editor.

493
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,851
One thing we also like to do on this side of things

494
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,072
is separate templates and instances.

495
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,773
So basically, for all of our gameplay elements,

496
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:26,774
we have templates which have a set series of behavior

497
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:28,134
that is sort of like non-negotiable.

498
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:28,934
It has to be that way.

499
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:30,835
But there's always a couple of parameters

500
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:31,835
that you can mess with a bit

501
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:33,396
to do something different with it.

502
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:35,056
And those are in the instance file.

503
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:36,957
So that enables the designer

504
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,497
to actually manipulate certain things

505
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,938
in a way that fits his current situation

506
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:42,478
without the game designer pulling his hair out

507
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,719
that you're changing everything about the enemy, basically.

508
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:50,112
We have a sequence editor too.

509
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:54,263
This is sort of our cut scene tool in the UBR framework.

510
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:59,886
Well, what's really interesting is sometimes when you go exploring in areas of an engine that you're not supposed to touch,

511
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,327
you find out that it actually has something to bring to your job, too.

512
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:06,750
And during Rayman Origins, I was in charge of building a boss

513
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,551
inside of the stomach of a dragon.

514
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:15,354
Lucky for me, there were no big animated characters that needed to be integrated with complex behavioral patterns and things like that.

515
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:20,097
So I could use what I had at my disposal as a level designer to build an interesting boss sequence.

516
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:25,620
So I took the sequence editor, I took things like these fire patches and other interesting gameplay elements,

517
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,542
and I made a series of events.

518
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:32,425
So, trigger flame, trigger flame, trigger the weak point, hit the weak point,

519
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:35,407
if you don't, restart, if you do, go to the next sequence.

520
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:41,355
And I was able to prototype 10, 20 different versions of this boss by myself, without a programmer,

521
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,515
and in the end, it's a 100% level design boss.

522
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:45,477
Which is something interesting. I wouldn't imagine I'd be able to do that,

523
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:49,600
but this tool that wasn't meant for it was powerful enough and integrated well into the engine

524
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,161
and the other systems that allowed me to do it.

525
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,282
We also have a very interesting tool that I will not be able to explain to you.

526
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:03,722
It's our animation tool in the engine.

527
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:04,923
It's really, really cool.

528
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,124
It allows us to hybridize hand-animated keyframes

529
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:09,385
with bone animation.

530
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,266
And actually, there was a talk last year

531
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,007
by two of my colleagues where they explain everything

532
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,688
there is to know about GenAnim.

533
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,308
So since you all have access to the vault,

534
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:19,389
I suggest you watch it when you get back to your studios.

535
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:22,351
It's a very interesting talk, and it's definitely

536
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:23,891
a cool tool worth checking out, especially

537
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:25,472
if you're on the more artsy side of things.

538
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:30,686
But I'm going to push through in the spirit of level design

539
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,828
with some case studies in the production of Rayman Legends

540
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:38,772
that greatly benefited from the workflow

541
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:39,973
that I'm talking about, basically,

542
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:41,795
because of the tools we have in the engine.

543
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:44,897
So one of the things that I personally was tasked to do

544
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:48,620
during the production was investigate stealth in Rayman.

545
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,142
Rayman's a happy, flowy, platformy game.

546
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:53,084
It's not usually something you want to slow down in.

547
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:55,346
But we wanted you to feel a bit like a spy

548
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:56,307
and avoid detection.

549
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,892
but we had to preserve the flow.

550
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:00,973
Because flow for us in Rayman is paramount.

551
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,395
It's something that we need to have all the time.

552
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,236
So how do you impose that on people?

553
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:08,817
We played around with systems, we tested a lot,

554
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:11,518
we threw a lot away, and we finally got to the thing

555
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,379
that felt best.

556
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,340
What I'm gonna show you now is a couple

557
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,401
little prototype videos of the early shadow system

558
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,582
and some interesting directions I took

559
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:21,203
with developing new features.

560
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,494
So, basically, when I was first working with these shadows,

561
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,918
I realized that when there's something that's collidable, like ground,

562
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:32,758
it would cast a shadow.

563
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:35,281
And when there was no ground, it wouldn't cast a shadow.

564
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:37,483
That meant that all of my situations

565
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:39,926
had sort of like an empty void that you could fall into.

566
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:42,748
And that doesn't really challenge the shadow or light mechanic.

567
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,951
That just challenges avoiding falling through a pit.

568
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,672
So how am I going to use that in an interesting way to reinforce the mechanic?

569
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,173
And so I just took a template freeze,

570
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:53,074
I made it semi-transparent in blue,

571
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,935
and I didn't apply the shadow collision to it.

572
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:56,255
And that's it.

573
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:59,737
And all of a sudden now, I invented a new type of freeze

574
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:00,957
that we had to add to the kit

575
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:04,639
that was integral to making this shadow gameplay work in the final world.

576
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,721
But before I could convince them, I had to convince them.

577
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:12,864
So I had to make more prototypes that sort of stress tested

578
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:17,587
or proved that it's really an interesting addition to the art kit

579
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,968
and the tool set as a level designer.

580
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,750
So I had to make a number of different prototypes

581
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,491
that showed the use of the glass in different ways.

582
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,672
And eventually it got approved.

583
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:31,442
So then, there are many different uses in the final game.

584
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:32,583
This is just one of them.

585
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:38,567
It's an interesting combination of the basic sentry plus the glass.

586
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:44,832
Another interesting example is these underwater snakes.

587
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:47,714
They are not normally meant to be used this way.

588
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,476
They didn't have the shadow functionality to begin with.

589
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,537
They were meant for something else.

590
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,222
But we thought, well if they're already there,

591
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:58,284
why don't we just give them the shadow collision property,

592
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,464
and that's it.

593
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,825
So I just opened the script,

594
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,866
I changed the material definition,

595
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,427
and suddenly it was casting shadows,

596
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,808
and it was a really interesting thing to use

597
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:07,668
for the shadow gameplay.

598
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:11,190
Easy peasy.

599
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,771
And here it's just a simple matter of

600
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:16,232
putting a trigger that pauses and unpauses the light.

601
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:16,653
And that was it.

602
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,964
And it worked. It really worked. It was very fast and it made it into the final game.

603
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:29,330
One thing that was interesting for me though, is I made sure to make the flicker when I was doing this.

604
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,493
Because you need to have clear signs and feedback to tell the player,

605
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,595
okay, the light's going to turn on, the light's going to turn off.

606
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:37,577
And it was important even in the prototype to prove that.

607
00:32:37,577 --> 00:32:42,741
So here, we actually had to work on a little thing called the Wii U for a while.

608
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,903
And we had to make some prototypes for it.

609
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:49,573
So, we had these elements you could pick up using the Wii U tablet.

610
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:51,956
You could drag them around.

611
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:54,581
And we had this shadow casting thing.

612
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,966
So I thought, why not parent one to the other and see what happens.

613
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:58,367
And this happened.

614
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,649
And it worked.

615
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:04,035
So we ended up making a different version of the light casting thing.

616
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:07,097
We integrated the components of being able to carry it on the screen.

617
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:09,939
And we had a new gameplay element to use in different situations.

618
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,841
And it was sort of just like a happy experiment.

619
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,121
A happy accident, actually.

620
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:16,164
I just, I thought, why can't I combine these two things?

621
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:17,885
So I tried, and they worked.

622
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:22,428
And that's really the biggest thing in this engine for me, I think.

623
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:26,330
Is it's just like, taking two things that don't really belong together,

624
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,132
and sort of thinking like, well why not?

625
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,893
They could, right?

626
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,842
And this is another example of that.

627
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:35,344
We have this thing in the game, digging,

628
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,886
where basically on the touch screen,

629
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:40,929
you can touch these cakes and dig tunnels for your friends.

630
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:43,771
We wanted to reuse this mechanic for the rest of the world

631
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,172
to make it consistent.

632
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:47,874
But not every level needed to have the touch screen gameplay.

633
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,815
We didn't want to force that on the player for every level.

634
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:53,939
So what we tried to do was separate the functionality

635
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:57,341
and combine it with other things to give the same feeling,

636
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:58,402
but in a different way.

637
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,169
So I used the parenting system, of course, that we have.

638
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:05,633
We had a separate actor for the digging,

639
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,238
and allowed us to have flexibility in prototyping,

640
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:09,360
because we just said.

641
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:12,415
I think that this thing should be able to dig through cakes.

642
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,958
So you parent the object to it and you see what happens.

643
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,859
Okay, that doesn't work.

644
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,262
You try something else, you move on.

645
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:19,803
If something starts to work, okay, cool.

646
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:22,066
You move on from there and do a number of different prototypes.

647
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:25,249
And eventually, you integrate the component

648
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:26,690
into the gameplay element.

649
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,894
So, every snake now has this digging component,

650
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:32,236
and when you put it in these sort of digging cakes,

651
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,137
they start to dig tunnels.

652
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:40,269
So here, for example, you've got this lovely dancing skeleton.

653
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:44,154
And this is how the digging works, basically,

654
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:44,895
with the touchscreen.

655
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:47,598
But what I'm going to grab over here

656
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:48,979
is the actor that's separate.

657
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,563
And you can see it has the exact same functionality,

658
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:55,707
but it's not attached to the touchscreen gameplay.

659
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,752
So what I'm going to do is use our parenting system

660
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:02,873
and you can actually see all the bones in the character

661
00:35:02,873 --> 00:35:05,435
and you can parent anything to any of the bones.

662
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:07,075
So I could parent something to the hand of the guy

663
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:08,796
and it'll be attached to his hand

664
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:11,757
and when he moves it up and down, it'll move with him.

665
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,678
It's really, really strangely powerful.

666
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,479
And now you can see that as he walks around,

667
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,779
he's destroying the cake.

668
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,660
And that's what I did with the snakes.

669
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,121
The snakes were more interesting than this guy,

670
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:22,902
so I stuck with the snakes.

671
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:28,607
But there are some other interesting cases too.

672
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:31,616
For example, there's this really big luchador.

673
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:37,719
And one thing that's interesting about this case is

674
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,320
the original version of this

675
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,641
there was this flat ground, he jumped, he landed

676
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,322
and he sat there and you had to kill him.

677
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,723
But because of his animation and the way that he was

678
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,244
it just felt a bit weird.

679
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,285
So what they did was the level designer just

680
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:50,525
dropped some digging at the bottom

681
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,847
and put the digging component into the guy.

682
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:55,028
All of a sudden he jumps off,

683
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,409
falls into the abyss, it solves one problem

684
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,210
and it creates an extra danger behind the player

685
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,350
which pushes him forward.

686
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,580
Problem solved.

687
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,982
And it's just a matter of replacing one little functionality for another

688
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,783
and seeing what happens.

689
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,223
And here's the snakes I was talking about.

690
00:36:10,223 --> 00:36:14,725
It's really interesting because you can make all kinds of interesting tunnels,

691
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:17,706
configurations, with different snakes digging through.

692
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:20,547
And visually it's really interesting too. It's very different from something that

693
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,488
you would normally get with a player controlling it.

694
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,729
Usually they'll just wipe the screen clean and done.

695
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:28,010
But here you've actually got a nice, tailored level design

696
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,591
that's created and generated by these enemies in the game.

697
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:35,976
This is an example that I'm particularly proud of,

698
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:36,996
because I did it.

699
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:42,860
It was basically just, we were between projects,

700
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,601
after Rayman Origins was finished,

701
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,643
and we were playing around with some adversarial gameplay.

702
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:49,324
You know, it's a co-op game, but we like to smack each other.

703
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:51,786
Can we make that a thing?

704
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:54,008
We wanted slight randomness, because otherwise one guy

705
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:56,109
dominates and everybody feels bad, and we don't want that.

706
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:56,869
We're a family game.

707
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:58,150
Everyone should feel good.

708
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:02,237
And it needed to be a convincing prototype.

709
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,578
Because if it's not a convincing prototype,

710
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:07,321
you're not convincing anyone, are you?

711
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,662
So, ultimately, this is what it is.

712
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,903
It's just a soccer ball, and you can kick it around.

713
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,745
It's fun in four players.

714
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:13,826
People can smack each other.

715
00:37:13,826 --> 00:37:16,007
It's two versus two, three versus one,

716
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:16,928
all that kind of good stuff.

717
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,770
And what it basically started was,

718
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,693
was I just tossed a projectile from an enemy in Rayman

719
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:23,093
Origins.

720
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:26,656
He threw boulders, and they bounced once or twice.

721
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,777
The ironic thing is that.

722
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:31,277
after they bounced once or twice, they died.

723
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:32,438
It exploded.

724
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,499
So I had one shot to get it into a goal,

725
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,659
and otherwise I had to restart the map.

726
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,660
So it wasn't really easy to prototype that one,

727
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,901
but it proved a point.

728
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,982
It felt good to try to kick a ball into a goal.

729
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:46,143
So then I made a trigger that detected the ball exclusively,

730
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:47,823
and when I triggered something,

731
00:37:47,823 --> 00:37:48,864
for example, I had numbers.

732
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:52,707
And I would just say, when the ball enters, shift the numbers up.

733
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:53,909
So it says 1, now it's 2, now it's 3.

734
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:58,133
It was like a really rudimentary, messy prototype.

735
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,276
But on the outside when you're playing it, you don't feel it.

736
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:02,478
You don't know that it's a messy prototype.

737
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:04,340
It feels like what it's supposed to be.

738
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,822
So then we developed it.

739
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:06,863
That was the final version.

740
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:08,184
This is the first version.

741
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:16,068
This is actually something internal. We did this for our Rayman Origins release party, actually.

742
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:21,070
In the final version, you've got some nice little enemies dancing in the foreground when you kick the ball in.

743
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,271
For this version, we have our lovely creative director's face on it.

744
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:30,295
but it was good fun. And actually, what's interesting to note here, we had moving goals,

745
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:34,737
multiball at the top, bouncing surfaces for the floor, and we removed all of them for

746
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:39,140
the final version. It was fun, we could have done more, but we felt that the simple version

747
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,922
was clear enough and we had more things to focus on. But it was a lot of fun. And the

748
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:47,364
reason that we kept it was because we made the prototype, we brought it to our Rayman

749
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:48,505
Origins release party.

750
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:50,627
and everybody started playing it.

751
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:53,409
And they couldn't stop for the entire evening.

752
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:56,512
Can you imagine, in the evening you're supposed to be drinking

753
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,435
and celebrating that you're done with that freaking game?

754
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:02,677
You don't have to look at it anymore.

755
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:03,918
Yeah, party hardy.

756
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:06,100
And everyone wants to play the prototype?

757
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,321
It just doesn't make any sense.

758
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:08,362
But it told us something.

759
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,103
It knew that it was actually quite special.

760
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:10,624
So we pushed it forward,

761
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,465
and it made it into the final game.

762
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,687
So, through all of this,

763
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:15,408
I mean, what went right?

764
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,065
Obviously a lot went right, right?

765
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,767
Otherwise I wouldn't be here talking about it like this.

766
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:21,728
Or I'm just hopelessly optimistic.

767
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:25,831
Well, there's the rapid iterative failure thing.

768
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,012
We did fail a lot.

769
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,494
We failed hard sometimes, less hard other times.

770
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,656
But we failed consistently, and that was by design.

771
00:39:32,656 --> 00:39:35,718
We knew that the better off we were,

772
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:38,520
we were better off by building a lot of things,

773
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,602
throwing them away, building more, throwing them away,

774
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,443
and then putting all of our eggs into one basket

775
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:44,805
and realizing when it was too late that it wasn't working.

776
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:51,119
our actors, our templates, the freeze system, which I'm sure impressed a number of you.

777
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,546
All of these different systems, they're obviously going right, because they allow us to do our

778
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:59,690
job so fast, it's unimaginable, until you try it.

779
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:05,017
And we're a small team, for ease of communication.

780
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,890
Because with a tool like this as well, you don't need so many people.

781
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,851
You know, you build systems.

782
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:12,652
It's like, it's procedural, which is what everyone's doing these days.

783
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:13,573
It's kind of a hot topic.

784
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,134
It is relatively procedural, the way that it's set up.

785
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,675
These freezes and everything.

786
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,276
It saves a lot of people a lot of time.

787
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,718
And also having a small team is great, because you can actually go up to somebody who's right

788
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:27,240
next to your programmer and smack him for something or tell him this or that.

789
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,623
There's not this sort of like hierarchy or you have to report to his lead and this and

790
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:32,123
that.

791
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:36,785
We're a small team, we work together in little strike teams sometimes, other times we're

792
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:41,128
in our big level design group, programming group, but we're all in the same little villa

793
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:41,648
in France.

794
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,930
It doesn't really make a difference when I have to go upstairs to the water cooler and

795
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,771
talk to somebody or just down the hall.

796
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:53,019
And of course there's the simplicity of workflow and the flexible systems,

797
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,700
which I've hopefully demonstrated to you guys already,

798
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,621
but they're there and they work very, very well.

799
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,642
Of course, everyone makes mistakes.

800
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,543
When you say that failure is sort of by design in your workflow,

801
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:05,663
you're going to fail a lot, but

802
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,104
we didn't really do design documentation.

803
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:11,645
You can imagine that when you're working extremely quickly,

804
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:13,266
when do you find the time to write things down?

805
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:16,527
And when you do write things down, aren't they obsolete?

806
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:19,884
that's pretty much the way that it went for us.

807
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:21,325
But the bad part about this

808
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:23,187
is the fact that when someone new joins a team,

809
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:24,908
they don't really have a resource to go to.

810
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,129
They can't just say, like, oh, read the Bible.

811
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:28,891
And then there you go, you go through it,

812
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:31,292
and you figure out everything, and then you start working.

813
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,773
We have a help menu in the editor, which is good.

814
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,034
It's a good base.

815
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,755
But for example, the design of the game.

816
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,617
No, no, we're not ready yet.

817
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:38,998
We're still experimenting.

818
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:39,978
We have two months left.

819
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:41,119
Well, we're still experimenting.

820
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:41,540
We'll see.

821
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,242
Sometimes we had a lack of tools for specific tasks.

822
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:49,444
I mean, we have some great systems in there,

823
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:53,268
but there are some other processes that are a little bit more tedious,

824
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:55,430
less flexible, basically.

825
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,953
And sometimes we could have communicated better on what we needed,

826
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:02,077
so that way we could actually work more efficiently.

827
00:42:02,077 --> 00:42:05,600
And there was a lack of communication of engine workflow issues.

828
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:08,809
Because the thing is, when you're used to working so fast,

829
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:10,830
and trying to pump things out very quickly,

830
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,473
when you realize that you have to do a very tedious workaround for something,

831
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,255
just to get it to work,

832
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:18,096
you take the extra 10 seconds to do the workaround,

833
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:19,758
rather than telling somebody,

834
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:23,741
the parenting system isn't working, you have to parent three times instead of one.

835
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,442
But it's like, oh, whatever, I'm sure they know,

836
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,545
and I work with it, and then like six months later,

837
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,526
I hope someone knows.

838
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:32,587
but you keep working with it instead of just going.

839
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:34,630
And if I just went to the guy and told him it's not working,

840
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,951
it would be fixed in the next build.

841
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:38,213
But it's just this mentality that we get into of, just deal with it.

842
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:38,974
Just push forward.

843
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,677
You're going to fail anyway, so you might as well just keep going.

844
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:44,960
And when you hit something that's good, then you improve it.

845
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,321
But the engine is a different story.

846
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:48,283
And sometimes we have to realize that.

847
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:53,206
And there, of course, was sometimes a lack of communication

848
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:54,787
of new features and additions.

849
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:56,788
Because we worked so informally sometimes,

850
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:59,550
going straight to a programmer and asking for a new feature,

851
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,631
that meant that there were times that a new feature was created,

852
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:05,354
and one level designer knew about it,

853
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:06,255
and he didn't tell the rest of us.

854
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:07,075
And we lost a lot of time.

855
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:09,957
And then some guy comes up to me a year and a half later,

856
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:15,941
and says that we had the thing all that time,

857
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:18,803
and I've been doing it the wrong way.

858
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:20,513
People get annoyed.

859
00:43:20,513 --> 00:43:23,215
And it's definitely something we need to work on.

860
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:25,196
But it's cool when you get new features.

861
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:28,679
Just tell people when they come out at the beginning.

862
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:33,983
So it's not just Rayman in the UBR framework.

863
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:36,505
It started with Rayman, but it's sort of evolved since then.

864
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:39,908
We actually do mobile games in UBR as well.

865
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,570
Rayman Fiesta Run, Rayman Jungle Run.

866
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,151
Actually, can I have a show of hands

867
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,293
who's played one of the new Rayman games, from Origins

868
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,213
to Legends to Mobile?

869
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:49,661
Not bad.

870
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:52,831
Good job, guys.

871
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,898
Thanks for helping me survive and eat every day.

872
00:43:56,517 --> 00:44:02,783
So we do mobile, but we're also exper- well, not me personally, but Ubisoft is experimenting

873
00:44:02,783 --> 00:44:04,945
with other genres in UbiArt, of course.

874
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:09,308
So in Montreal, they're working on a Japanese RPG, Child of Light, using the same framework.

875
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:13,732
It's still a 2D game, it's still using a lot of the similar systems, but they're adding

876
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:18,296
some really cool features that we didn't necessarily add for our projects, but it's cool for us

877
00:44:18,296 --> 00:44:21,759
to see how other teams adapt and impact the development of the engine.

878
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,938
And of course, we also have another one, Valiant Hearts,

879
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:29,001
which is a World War I adventure game

880
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,405
that's being developed actually by the guys

881
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:32,206
who did Rayman Legends.

882
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:37,334
I'm not on the team personally, I have other things to do, but a lot of my friends are

883
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:37,914
working on it.

884
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,555
You should buy it, it's going to be great.

885
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:45,137
And it's a really cool game, it's different to have something that's a bit slower paced,

886
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:49,158
less action-y, more emotional and everything, and having an adventure game in an engine

887
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:50,839
that was built originally for a platformer.

888
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,780
But it's working, it's an interesting take on the genre, and we're trying to push forward

889
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,741
and see what we can do with the engine from there.

890
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:03,484
I actually write sometimes for the Ubisoft Ubi blog.

891
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:06,805
I've written a couple columns about working in the engine,

892
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:10,966
working on the games, and working with the artists,

893
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:14,987
and trying not to fight with them, and all that kind of stuff.

894
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:16,847
And they could be quite interesting for you to check in,

895
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,668
especially if you found this presentation interesting,

896
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:20,048
despite the blackout.

897
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:21,969
You might want to check this out and have some further reading.

898
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,190
Just to give me some hits anyway, you know?

899
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,250
So...

900
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,131
If I'm going to give you a couple things to take away,

901
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:33,512
apart from the fact that have a good engine that empowers your artists and designers,

902
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:35,112
which is a given,

903
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:36,312
fail often.

904
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:37,672
Don't be scared of it.

905
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,833
You know, plan for it.

906
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:40,593
Or don't plan.

907
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:41,653
Why do we need to plan failure?

908
00:45:41,653 --> 00:45:44,274
Let's just build stuff and see what happens.

909
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:47,655
Try to make the most efficient, fast process that you can

910
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:49,595
for getting to that sort of proof of concept stage.

911
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:52,916
Get there, see if it's working, or move on.

912
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,236
But that's it.

913
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:57,037
Just push to fail often and you'll eventually stumble on the right thing.

914
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,368
embrace artistic constraints.

915
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:01,829
A lot of people think,

916
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:04,812
oh, constraints, oh, they're so constraining.

917
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:08,456
But they're not.

918
00:46:08,456 --> 00:46:10,398
They really push you to be more creative

919
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:11,839
and work outside of your comfort zone.

920
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,302
There have been so many times

921
00:46:14,302 --> 00:46:15,202
that I'm given a new art kit

922
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:16,344
in a new world and I'm like,

923
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:17,425
what am I supposed to do with this?

924
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:18,526
Come on, guys.

925
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:18,866
And then I think,

926
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,828
oh no, but actually I can do something

927
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:21,909
I've never done before.

928
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,471
And that's the point.

929
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:27,095
If they just gave us the same kit, re-skinned every time,

930
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:30,256
we'd be making the same levels every time, we wouldn't move anywhere.

931
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:32,377
And now we have worlds that are very unique,

932
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:34,217
different gameplay elements, different direction.

933
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:38,259
And it's because of these artistic constraints that we sort of have to live with

934
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:39,259
and embrace.

935
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:42,300
And my personal motto is,

936
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,261
waste your own time, not someone else's.

937
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,903
I'm very happy to spend a lot of time making my prototypes,

938
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:50,583
trying to prove people that it's going to work.

939
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:56,130
And I don't mind if I have to throw it away, because I know I'm not impacting the rest of the production.

940
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,114
I can make up for my own lost time, but I don't want to feel guilty for somebody else's.

941
00:47:00,114 --> 00:47:05,138
And so you have to find a way to really clearly express yourself and your ideas so that everybody understands

942
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:08,181
and knows where you want to go with it, and we can make it together.

943
00:47:08,181 --> 00:47:14,386
So that's it. Check us out at the UB Lounge upstairs. We're doing demos of the engine.

944
00:47:14,386 --> 00:47:16,488
And I hope you appreciated it, and thanks for being here.

945
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,580
As far as I know, I think there's some time for questions if anyone has it.

946
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,521
You have to step up to the mic, and otherwise I'll be in the wrap-up room after the question time.

947
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:43,964
Can you talk about the process for choosing the concepts and art kits for the levels, and who's involved in those discussions?

948
00:47:44,853 --> 00:47:56,281
Yeah, so the people that choose the art kits that we use, basically the artists do the concepts, of course, and there's always a higher level artist or creative person that oversees it and stuff like that.

949
00:47:56,281 --> 00:48:09,230
And they just sort of decide, okay, this one's interesting, not clean enough. They have to be able to visualize the gameplay as well. If they can't really see how this concept is going to translate to the level or be clear enough, then they go back to the drawing board and...

950
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,073
you know, revamp it a little bit or throw it away and try something new.

951
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,996
There are worlds we didn't include in the game because

952
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:18,938
they didn't work as well as others and we didn't have the time to make them work.

953
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,920
But so basically it just comes down to people working hard

954
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,763
and somebody above them telling them it's good enough or it's not.

955
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:26,744
Business as usual, you know.

956
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:26,824
Sure.

957
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:26,924
Hey.

958
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:31,128
So you talked a lot about the art impacting the design

959
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:37,693
and I was wondering if there are any instances where the art impacted things on the programming side.

960
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:40,268
Uh, yeah, I mean...

961
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:45,400
I'm guessing there's a lot of times when, especially in a game like this that's cartoony,

962
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,601
that the animations sort of guide the way that you program certain functionality, right?

963
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:55,222
For example, the character controls of Rayman and the other main characters of the game,

964
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:58,023
they're very, very based on the animations.

965
00:48:58,023 --> 00:49:01,944
The cartoony, sort of ease in, ease out, floppy animations.

966
00:49:01,944 --> 00:49:02,824
That's why it feels that way.

967
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:07,265
But it works because it's sort of linked to the animation that was originally given to

968
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:08,745
the programmer to work with.

969
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,246
So yes, of course, in cases like that, it comes down to...

970
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:18,055
Taking the artwork understanding the intention of it and programming the functionality to make sure it feels the way it's supposed to

971
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,480
Of course, so anything like new features that were added

972
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:28,196
Well, of course, I mean, the artists, they did tests for the lighting system, the new

973
00:49:28,196 --> 00:49:29,677
2D lighting system, basically.

974
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:34,298
They did them in things like 3ds Max and Maya, just to sort of get a feel for what kind of

975
00:49:34,298 --> 00:49:35,098
system they wanted.

976
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:39,159
And then they told the programmers, this is what we want, this is how we want it, it needs

977
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:39,759
to work this way.

978
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:42,220
And they said, okay, boss, and they did it.

979
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,200
And it turned out cool in the end.

980
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,701
But it's because they had a clear direction, they knew what they wanted, and they had to

981
00:49:46,701 --> 00:49:47,741
convey it to the programmers.

982
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:48,942
Okay, thanks.

983
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:49,082
Yep.

984
00:49:50,663 --> 00:49:53,626
Hi, I was really curious, how did you get your job at Ubisoft?

985
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:53,826
Uh... magic.

986
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:54,486
You know a guy who does that?

987
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:57,709
No, I was a student three years ago,

988
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,350
and I made a portfolio for level design because I wanted to.

989
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,852
One of my teachers used to work at Ubisoft,

990
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:05,554
and he was like, hey, it looks pretty good.

991
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:07,736
And so he sort of like sent it under the table.

992
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:10,538
I was actually busy an entire weekend

993
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:14,841
putting together stacks of applications for other companies,

994
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:16,102
like, I'm gonna do this.

995
00:50:16,102 --> 00:50:18,944
And then on Monday it's like, ready to send.

996
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,190
want to work at Ubisoft?

997
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,191
Well, whatever.

998
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:24,931
So I went and worked at Ubisoft.

999
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:27,512
And then I stuck around, and I have a contract now.

1000
00:50:27,512 --> 00:50:31,033
So I've been there for three years.

1001
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,474
But it was really that.

1002
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:34,355
But I guess they like my portfolio or something.

1003
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:34,675
Great work.

1004
00:50:34,675 --> 00:50:35,095
Great work.

1005
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,236
I think it's you now.

1006
00:50:37,236 --> 00:50:37,696
Hi.

1007
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:42,738
My question concerns, I know you talked a lot about just creating

1008
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:45,399
levels just by doing and prototyping and testing

1009
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:46,619
and failing.

1010
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,300
Whenever you got those

1011
00:50:49,192 --> 00:50:51,575
gem moments and you had success.

1012
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:55,580
Because the iteration process is so fast and easy and awesome,

1013
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,502
how did you know when to just stop?

1014
00:50:57,502 --> 00:51:01,326
Did you ever get sucked into just being in that level

1015
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,147
and enjoying it?

1016
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:04,830
And how would you move past that to the next one?

1017
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,811
How did you know to move on?

1018
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:08,274
Well, a game is never done.

1019
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,856
Everyone knows that.

1020
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:13,905
so it can be hard sometimes to say

1021
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:16,047
done and move on. There have been times that I actually

1022
00:51:16,047 --> 00:51:17,989
cut out an entire portion of my level

1023
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:19,851
after it's been approved, after it's in beta,

1024
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:22,254
rebuild it, sort of like a ninja thing.

1025
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:23,355
And, um,

1026
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:26,559
somebody notices and they ask, what the hell, dude?

1027
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,960
And I'm like, no, trust me, it's better.

1028
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,843
And I'll make sure it's clean, don't worry, and it usually is, but, um...

1029
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:36,035
Honestly, it's just a matter of saying, like, did I fulfill what I needed to?

1030
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:40,078
They want a boss level with three arenas and creative ideas.

1031
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:41,379
I built all three of them.

1032
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:46,262
I could iterate on top of it more and all this kind of stuff, but it's like, scope-wise,

1033
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:47,002
it's there.

1034
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:49,204
Functionality-wise, it's there.

1035
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:49,664
It's cool.

1036
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:51,765
People appreciate it.

1037
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:52,586
It works in the playtest.

1038
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:53,006
Let's leave it.

1039
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:54,587
Unless I get tired and I fix it later.

1040
00:51:56,129 --> 00:51:56,349
Hello.

1041
00:51:56,349 --> 00:52:00,052
This might be a big question for here,

1042
00:52:00,052 --> 00:52:03,314
but if there's some information on the blog or could be,

1043
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:04,455
I'd be very interested.

1044
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,076
So basically, you talk about these freezes for creating,

1045
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:09,138
for example, ground or pipes or similar.

1046
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:11,639
And I assume creating a completely new type of freeze

1047
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,660
requires some programming.

1048
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,041
But I'm curious about the process.

1049
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,702
If you have a freeze already, and you

1050
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,663
want to adapt it to a new environment

1051
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:21,446
with completely new art, what are the tools for doing that?

1052
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:32,576
It's a good question. As far as I know, what it comes down to is, it's like an atlas, and you can see all of the pieces, like the top, the side, and all that stuff.

1053
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:41,906
Things that tile. And it's a matter of making a new atlas, and then using a tool to sort of specify, this is the top, this is the side, this is the fill, and things like that.

1054
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,149
the technical, actually at the UbiLounge there's a technical artist

1055
00:52:46,149 --> 00:52:49,951
who uses UbiArt at the moment and he can actually open everything and show you

1056
00:52:49,951 --> 00:52:51,192
all those tools and how it works

1057
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:55,175
so you can get some real details. Because I'm just a level designer. But it's more or less like that.

1058
00:52:55,175 --> 00:53:00,158
You I think? Yeah I had a question about Rayman Legends, about the musical levels.

1059
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:06,382
So you mentioned working with the artists to create a look and feel.

1060
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:10,605
Can you tell me, was there a different process making musical levels considering

1061
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,146
their very sync to the beats?

1062
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:20,807
That's an interesting one. Actually it was just sort of like a happy accident that we started making musical levels.

1063
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:29,072
We were just making some challenges and we made a video of it to show internally and put some really cool rock music synchronized with the action in the video.

1064
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,693
And after they showed that it was kind of like...

1065
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:32,718
Can we play with the music?

1066
00:53:32,718 --> 00:53:34,358
I mean, is this real or is this just a video?

1067
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:36,639
And it's like, well, no, but maybe we can make it.

1068
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,060
And so then they started building a system

1069
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,461
for synchronizing the gameplay to the music.

1070
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:42,602
The composer, Christophe Héral,

1071
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:44,042
he made the original version of the song,

1072
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,743
and then the level designer built a level based on it,

1073
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:48,264
and then it was a process of back and forth

1074
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:50,485
between the two of them to make the final product.

1075
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:52,005
And then, of course, the animators came in

1076
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:53,346
and did all the fun animations,

1077
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:54,767
background art, things like that.

1078
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:54,847
You.

1079
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:02,395
How much do you think the editor evolved during this frame?

1080
00:54:02,395 --> 00:54:09,065
I mean, it sounds like you create the levels, the graphics guy creates the graphics, but the editor just was there somehow.

1081
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:13,752
How many new features came up, or had to be done by the programmers?

1082
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,442
Lots changed. I mean, if you look at the, for example, just the touchscreen functionality alone, or the three-dimensional

1083
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:27,305
entities in the game, they just weren't there. And those are a big chunk of what makes Rayman Legends different from Rayman Origins, right?

1084
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:35,169
We also had a lighting system that wasn't there at all. It changes everything about the way the artists decorate their levels.

1085
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:39,250
If you actually press a button to turn off the lights, the levels look really bad.

1086
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:43,746
like in more Rayman Origins we worked with it and we made the levels look like they were

1087
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:48,770
maybe lit, but it was a different style. But here, you turn it off, and so it's important

1088
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,874
that it was developed properly. And so there are big, big features like that that really

1089
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:57,098
impacted the way that we started to produce things. And there were just so many countless

1090
00:54:57,098 --> 00:55:02,162
little features, I can't even remember, because I'm just used to the current version. But

1091
00:55:02,162 --> 00:55:07,367
it was a very different tool when we did Rayman Origins, and it's improved a lot since.

1092
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:11,950
You mentioned working on a small team. How small was your team?

1093
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:19,972
I think at its peak, it was about maybe a little bit over 100 people. I'm not sure.

1094
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:21,632
But usually we were about 60, 70.

1095
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:26,973
Then we ramp up a little bit more near the end to get things done.

1096
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:30,594
Not that small.

1097
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,815
Yep. Anyone else?

1098
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:39,615
How do the decisions get made about what levels are selected and what aren't?

1099
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:42,497
Lead level designer, creative director.

1100
00:55:42,497 --> 00:55:42,617
Okay.

1101
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:44,159
I mean, pretty much.

1102
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,923
I mean, are there any things that you thought were particularly a good level that...

1103
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:52,748
they weren't into and you had to make your case for more or?

1104
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:53,028
Of course.

1105
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:53,108
Yeah.

1106
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:54,909
But I mean that's what it comes down to, right?

1107
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:55,869
It's about convincing people.

1108
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,609
That's what I've been talking about with the prototyping process and everything.

1109
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:01,670
It needs to be clear to convince somebody that this is a good idea.

1110
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,551
And I've seen a lot of people that go in with a half-baked proposal.

1111
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:07,892
They say, oh look, it's a red square on the floor.

1112
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:08,632
It's a button.

1113
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:09,392
It's like, oh, okay.

1114
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:10,953
I guess, I trust you."

1115
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:14,454
And they jump and it doesn't do anything except open a door and stuff and it doesn't make

1116
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:14,934
sense.

1117
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:18,175
But when you make it look like what it's supposed to be, feel like what it's supposed to be,

1118
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,417
and then you show it in a multitude of different situations, then it's very clear for them

1119
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:27,339
whether or not they just hate the idea or they can't deny that it's actually quite cool.

1120
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:30,021
So when it comes to reviewing levels and things like that,

1121
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:32,523
it's just that the level design lead comes, sits down with you,

1122
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,784
and says, this is good, this is not,

1123
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:35,885
try to go more in this direction.

1124
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:38,607
And if you really disagree, you can take one more chance

1125
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:39,808
to try to prove it to him.

1126
00:56:39,808 --> 00:56:42,410
But honestly, that's the whole part about failing and moving on.

1127
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,731
Nothing is sacred. Just trash it and move on.

1128
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:46,793
You can make something better in five minutes anyway.

1129
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:47,033
Thank you.

1130
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:51,516
I'm a little curious about the development

1131
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:56,860
of the engine itself, or the framework.

1132
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,958
what led up to it, and how long was it in development

1133
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:01,939
before it was used?

1134
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:06,704
And when you add key features and stuff,

1135
00:57:06,704 --> 00:57:07,905
how long does that typically take?

1136
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:12,322
Well, the engine was originally created by the creative director,

1137
00:57:12,322 --> 00:57:16,584
Michel Ancel, and a small team of, I believe, five senior programmers.

1138
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:18,265
The initial version, of course.

1139
00:57:18,265 --> 00:57:20,946
I mean, then we ramped up to a few more engineers

1140
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:22,327
as the process went on.

1141
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:23,727
We were building the game itself.

1142
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:25,848
But it was a small team developing the tools for that.

1143
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:30,791
And then the team started to ramp up maybe a year later, I believe.

1144
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,952
And we started to actually go into production on Rayman Origins.

1145
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,993
And it's just been in constant update status ever since.

1146
00:57:37,613 --> 00:57:40,194
But when it came to something like the lighting engine,

1147
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,815
the new update for the lighting system,

1148
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:43,595
it took quite a while.

1149
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:46,076
Like, I believe, if I remember correctly,

1150
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:47,776
maybe a month or two

1151
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:50,217
to wait to get that thing actually working.

1152
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,798
But it's a heavier system, so it takes more time.

1153
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:54,738
But some engine improvements,

1154
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:57,079
they don't take any time at all.

1155
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,400
They take like maybe one, two, three days tops,

1156
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,140
depending on what it is.

1157
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:01,440
Thank you.

1158
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,500
Yep.

1159
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:06,082
I think I can't take any more because they held up a yellow sign or something.

1160
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:06,942
So thanks for being here.

1161
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:07,903
I really appreciate it, guys.
