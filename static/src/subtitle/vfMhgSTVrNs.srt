00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,866
Welcome to Surviving Vampire Survivors Agile Community Management.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,617
My name is Beth Molloy, and I'm the community manager at Pongal.

3
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:26,339
I live near Essex in England, and I studied business and finance at college

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,640
before having roles in customer service and sales.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,561
And I also ran my own children's party entertainment company.

6
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:37,963
This is my first role in the games industry, and I started in February of 2022.

7
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:42,124
I love roller skating, theme parks, playing cozy games,

8
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,925
and I have two cats called Mango and Mochi.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,661
So, I work for a company called Ponkel,

10
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,002
which is based in London in the UK,

11
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:51,022
and we all work remotely.

12
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:55,164
It was founded in April of 2022 by Luca Galante,

13
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:58,105
who is the creator of Vampire Survivors.

14
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:00,105
We are now a team of 14.

15
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:01,906
We've grown very quickly over the year.

16
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:05,487
And you may notice that Ponkel has a lowercase p

17
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:06,287
in the logo.

18
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:08,848
And this was Luca's.

19
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:16,516
He made the decision to do this and he thought it would serve him, serve as a reminder to stay small and humble no matter what.

20
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:23,102
Which is very relevant considering the success of Vampire Survivors so far.

21
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:28,400
Just a little background on the community and marketing team.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,623
In February, it was just me and also Luca.

23
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,826
And then in April, we were joined by Future Friends Games,

24
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,147
who are a marketing company.

25
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,670
In August, we hired another community manager and player

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,352
support person.

27
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:47,655
And then in December, we hired a marketing manager.

28
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:54,536
So in case you haven't heard of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Survivors is a time survival roguelite

29
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,397
game and it has really simple controls.

30
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:00,857
All you have to do is go around and slay hordes of monsters with one control.

31
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:09,519
It's inspired by many of Lucas' favorite games and it also has lots of Italian references

32
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:10,459
and play on words.

33
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,400
So unless you're Italian you probably won't get half of the references but it helps to

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,620
make the game really unique.

35
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:23,636
It's currently on Steam, mobile, Xbox console, PC, and it's on Game Pass.

36
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,279
And we wanted to keep it a really low and fair price.

37
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,524
Um, cause when it first went onto Steam, it was a really small game and there

38
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,606
wasn't much content, so it was a low price.

39
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,688
And since then we've added a lot of content to it, but we've

40
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,849
still kept it a fair price.

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,572
And you can get hundreds of hours out of the game.

42
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,095
We love to exceed player expectations.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,341
So today I want to cover a few different topics.

44
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:54,784
Firstly, how I caught up with our game's existing community,

45
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:58,947
how I found the voice for vampire survivors on socials,

46
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:03,350
benefits of early access, and also some challenges as well.

47
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,973
The opportunities and projects of varying success

48
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,855
that we've had, how I increased the reach and engagement,

49
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:14,318
and how I learned my role and the games industry.

50
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:23,590
So to start off with, just want to give you a quick timeline of the last year.

51
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:29,497
So on the 17th of December, 2021, Vampire Survivors launched in early access on Steam.

52
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:36,310
By the 3rd of January, it was picked up by streamers such as Gorgorra, Splattercat, and Northern Lion,

53
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:41,713
which really helped to boost the game's popularity and make it go viral.

54
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:43,755
In January...

55
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:49,958
Like, from January to April, Luka hired some of his friends to help with the development of Vampire Survivors

56
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,440
because he couldn't do it all on his own.

57
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,602
It went a bit crazy, so he was getting help with the development, fixing bugs,

58
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,223
and also the community side of things.

59
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,109
By April, Ponker was set up officially,

60
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,330
and we started hiring a team.

61
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,613
In May, Vampire Survivors was launched on Xbox Game Pass PC.

62
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:18,559
And between May and September, we did a lot of content updates.

63
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,681
So we kept publishing new content for the players

64
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,362
and adding new achievements.

65
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,203
And players loved to chase all the achievements.

66
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:34,103
So, before 1.0, we did a little road to 1.0.

67
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,285
So we did a teaser every day for about two and a half weeks,

68
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:38,705
I believe.

69
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:43,988
And that helped to just spread the word of the game.

70
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:48,230
And it was just our big marketing push for 1.0.

71
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,513
On the 10th of November, Vampire Survivors

72
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,053
launched on Xbox console.

73
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,918
And between the 10th of November and the 8th of December,

74
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:01,900
the dev team had to start from scratch the mobile version.

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,382
And we shadow dropped the trailer for the mobile version

76
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,683
at the Game Awards on the 8th of December.

77
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:10,525
So it was a very quick turnaround.

78
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:14,947
Then to finish off the year, we launched our first DLC,

79
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,388
which was Legacy of the Moonspell.

80
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:20,550
So keeping up with the fast-growing community.

81
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:27,906
The first thing I did was I had to go and grab all the handles that I wanted on social

82
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:36,013
media and buy the domains, set everything up, and not only did I set up all the domains,

83
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:41,878
all the handles on the social medias I wanted to do immediately, I got all of them, just

84
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,339
to make sure we had them for the future.

85
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:50,488
I then prioritized which ones I thought our audience would be on, so I chose Twitter,

86
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:54,890
and we already had an existing Discord, so I continued to grow that.

87
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,072
I spent a lot of time on them and made sure I did them properly before we hired new people

88
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,953
and then we could add new socials, so we started doing TikTok.

89
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:12,489
I wanted to make sure that I wasn't just selling to our community, and I did a lot

90
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,991
of fun and entertaining posts.

91
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:20,217
We welcome everyone in our community and we like to keep it safe and regulated, so Discord

92
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:23,661
is our main place for our fans, like all our...

93
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:33,985
We have community helpers on there so they make sure that the discord is run well and everyone's welcome and listened to.

94
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:40,007
We also have bots on there too to help filter out some of the negative things.

95
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:46,050
We make sure we listen to all the feedback that our community has.

96
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:53,911
comes up with. And we don't ignore negative feedback. We don't just respond to all the

97
00:06:53,931 --> 00:07:02,459
positive feedback. So far we haven't really done any advertising on social media, paid advertising.

98
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,323
It's all been through word of mouth, which is really great. We have a lot of

99
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:10,206
content creators who like to share vampire survivors.

100
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,981
I like to encourage engagement by doing calls to action,

101
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,965
by doing polls and asking the players

102
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,025
about their favorite things.

103
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,768
So asking them how many achievements they've got,

104
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:24,888
what their favorite weapon is.

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,492
It really helps that the game is consistently updated as well.

106
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,554
At one point, I think we were doing patches every two weeks.

107
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,837
So there was always a lot to post about,

108
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:37,598
and it made my job a lot easier.

109
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:44,872
And to make sure we're reaching new audiences, I always check the analytics.

110
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:52,696
So I've seen from our YouTube that our main player base is males in America, age 25 to 40.

111
00:07:52,776 --> 00:08:00,700
So I need to make my posts apply to them and also try and expand and reach new people.

112
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:03,692
So did it work?

113
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:04,693
Let's have a look at the stats.

114
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,315
So as you can see here, in February 2022,

115
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,997
we had 11,000 Discord members and we now have 58,000.

116
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,098
We had 14,000, 14.5,000 Steam reviews

117
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:11,899
and we now have 178,000.

118
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,581
They are mostly overwhelmingly positive.

119
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,201
So that's amazing.

120
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,543
Our Steam announcements now reach 50 times more people

121
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,364
than they did to start off with.

122
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:35,822
And our game is the second most reviewed on Steam.

123
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,805
We have now got over 3 million mobile players,

124
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:43,308
which is great considering it was not launched very long ago.

125
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,510
So that's doing really well.

126
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,371
We're really pleased with that.

127
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,834
And also, we were the top played Steam Deck game

128
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:51,815
for five months from July.

129
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,099
Finding our voice in socials.

130
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:02,957
So when I started at Ponkel, I didn't really have a clue what I was doing.

131
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,919
Um, to be honest, I didn't know how to use Twitter properly.

132
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,419
I didn't know how to use discord.

133
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:13,402
So I had to learn those and work out the best way to use each of those platforms.

134
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:18,904
I made sure I varied the content that I was posting, um, such as game updates

135
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:25,327
and polls, um, any, yeah, any bug fixes and all of that kind of thing, um, just

136
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,408
to reach all different people.

137
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,307
And over my time posting over the last year,

138
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,228
I've really worked out what does well

139
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:36,310
and what doesn't do so well for our posts.

140
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,691
So things that get high engagement

141
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,912
are anything such as big game updates

142
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:43,355
and interacting with the players

143
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:44,936
and asking them for their feedback

144
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:46,517
and what they're enjoying the most

145
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,918
and how many achievements they've got,

146
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,520
if they've 100%ed the game or not.

147
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,323
And the low engagement posts are anything such as

148
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:59,486
Fan art, unfortunately, and just smaller game updates,

149
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:00,327
little patches.

150
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,368
I like to try and jump on trends,

151
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,530
but I'm very selective about what trends we jump on.

152
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,072
It's great for visibility and reaching new audiences,

153
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:14,714
but you want to make sure that you don't

154
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,555
jump on every single trend.

155
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,796
Just choose the ones that fit your brand the best.

156
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,998
I try and use the trending hashtags as well,

157
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:23,918
just to get you.

158
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:29,525
to reach new audiences and get better visibility for our posts.

159
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,566
In summary, you've got to be agile.

160
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,467
Study what works and make sure you're looking at your analytics.

161
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:43,309
For example, for Vampire Survivors, I realized that the players really love Garlic, Flaw

162
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,450
Chicken and our character Poe Racho, who is a stinky old man.

163
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,885
And any post about them, just, they love it.

164
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:54,726
They love to share it and yeah, it's really fun.

165
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,207
Consistency and timing is really important.

166
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,928
So as I mentioned before, we did the teasers

167
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:05,489
leading up to the 1.0 launch,

168
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,689
where we posted every single day.

169
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,590
I realized that 4 p.m. is a really good time

170
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,791
for us to post, as we reach people in the UK

171
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:17,032
and in America, so it gets better visibility.

172
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:27,675
Once I discovered what kind of tone of voice worked with our audience and the kind of branding

173
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:31,197
for Pongal and Vampire Survivors, it was a really big turning point for me.

174
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:35,679
Because to start off with, as I said I wasn't that experienced, I thought I had to be really

175
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,582
serious on social and just post about game updates and bugs and keep it really serious.

176
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:44,703
But as soon as I started relaxing and

177
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:48,965
writing more friendly posts like the one you see there, just a bit more fun.

178
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:53,927
They started doing a lot better and they're a lot more shareable and got a lot better engagement.

179
00:11:55,928 --> 00:12:00,550
It was important for me to pay attention to the player likes and dislikes as mentioned before,

180
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:07,974
so they really like garlic and floor chicken, whereas things like the character reskins,

181
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,975
all that kind of stuff doesn't really do as well.

182
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,789
If you're hiring a community manager, it's really important to trust them.

183
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:25,074
Give them space to experiment with different types of posts, to jump on trends,

184
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,257
and also to kind of create their own guidelines.

185
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,099
So, what I mean by this is...

186
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,803
Like they've got to look after their own mental health.

187
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:40,063
So not responding to really negative hate comments

188
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:43,084
and all of that is, it makes a big difference,

189
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:44,604
like if you don't make them respond to those.

190
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,684
So personally, I just ignore those

191
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,265
and also set boundaries such as people,

192
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:54,046
when you get messages asking constantly for new platforms,

193
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:56,766
it's a lot of work to respond to all of those.

194
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,987
And yeah, personally I ignore those

195
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,707
because I don't want to say the wrong thing

196
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:02,827
and give people the wrong impression.

197
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:15,485
So I find that one of the things that Pongal does best is acknowledge players.

198
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:21,849
In our Discord we get a lot of feedback and we're always making sure that our players

199
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,170
know that they're listened to.

200
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,873
So we respond to all types of feedback, positive, negative, and any bug reports.

201
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:34,956
This screenshot here shows a tweet that I received one morning and it...

202
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,329
was basically saying that when you load the game, the file name shows up and that has

203
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,012
the person's actual name in it.

204
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,557
So this showed up on the loading screen of the game.

205
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,731
And it's obviously a big problem for VTubers.

206
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:51,733
They don't want their name out there.

207
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:55,016
So when I saw this report, I told the devs straight away.

208
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,559
And they managed to turn it around within about an hour.

209
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,181
Like, they literally fixed it, pushed the patch,

210
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,203
and I responded to this person in an hour.

211
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,564
They were really impressed.

212
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:08,027
And it just helps to show you that you're listening

213
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,670
and that you actually care about, yeah,

214
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,751
the impact your game has.

215
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:20,488
So, to summarize our social media, we focus on Discord, Twitter and TikTok.

216
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,190
But it's really important to delegate.

217
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,731
I don't do all of these on my own.

218
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:29,815
And one social media person, one social media manager can't do everything.

219
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,497
So you've got to make sure you prioritize everything.

220
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,099
So Discord is where all of our VIPs are.

221
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,321
It's our most dedicated player base.

222
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:43,544
They get game updates first and they also get access to the beta versions.

223
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:48,929
They, it's a great place for everyone to report bugs and give suggestions

224
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,031
and share challenges that they have.

225
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:53,394
And it's quite independent now.

226
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,577
When I first started, I spent a lot of time on discord.

227
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:59,800
I think when at the very beginning, I was reading every single message we were

228
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,182
getting, which was just not working.

229
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:07,007
Um, but yeah, with bots and also really good community helpers.

230
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,748
Um, it's quite independent now.

231
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:12,740
Twitter is a really good place for creators and press,

232
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,782
for us to interact with them.

233
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:18,645
And we also do a lot of giveaways and polls on Twitter.

234
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,206
So we've given away a Steam Deck

235
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,028
and we give away like game keys,

236
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:25,950
just lots of things to increase engagement.

237
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,773
And it's a great place for trends as well

238
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:30,974
because it's fast turnaround.

239
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,216
I mainly run the Twitter

240
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,977
and I try to post daily on there now.

241
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:38,780
Since I started posting daily, it's grown a lot.

242
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,041
TikTok is the other one that we focus on.

243
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,866
And this is really good for us, because since we launched on mobile,

244
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:50,791
there's obviously a player base there.

245
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:56,978
It's a younger demographic, and we make really silly, unhinged TikToks.

246
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,200
and try and make the most of memes and trending sounds.

247
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,943
We post every few days, like every two to three days on there.

248
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:11,187
And this is run by Lucy, who's our other community manager, and also future friends.

249
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,069
Releasing in early access.

250
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:18,669
There's many benefits to releasing in Early Access.

251
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,592
One of the main ones is you can involve your players

252
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,953
with a development from a really early stage.

253
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,215
So you can listen to their feedback and their suggestions,

254
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:30,676
and they will help you make your game better,

255
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:33,698
if you listen to the right ones.

256
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:39,525
Um, yeah, you can, as I said, you can receive and implement that feedback.

257
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:45,627
Early on, I made a Trello board, which was a public issue tracker, and we had a

258
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:52,110
lot of the most common bugs and issues on there and the players could go on there

259
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,551
and see what the progress was with those, whether we were like fixing them or

260
00:16:56,611 --> 00:17:01,312
whether they were fixed yet, which really helped and that helped to prevent a lot

261
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,073
of repeated questions as well, especially in the Discord.

262
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:09,341
It helps you to build a really strong community and create brand advocates.

263
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:14,283
And it also helps you to develop your brand image if you're a new company.

264
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,986
So for Ponko, I believe that we're quite quirky, grounded and responsive company.

265
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:26,030
And making sure you listen to your players creates a lot of goodwill.

266
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,691
Like I feel like they trust us and they know that we're going to

267
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,672
listen to what they have to say.

268
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:38,715
There's also many challenges of early access, such as constant changes with the game, which

269
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:41,318
means I was making a lot of content last minute.

270
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:49,627
It's difficult to schedule, because timelines are constantly changing, and for an overnight

271
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,130
success game like Vampire Survivors...

272
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:59,541
It's, I don't know, it was really hard to create systems on the go.

273
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:04,522
So at the moment we have Notion, Trello, Hack and Plan.

274
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,762
We have loads, loads of things going on.

275
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:10,063
We still haven't worked that out, but we'll get there.

276
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:14,484
But yeah, trying to stay organized is tough when you have a really fast

277
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:19,226
growing company and you have no idea what you're going to be doing the next day.

278
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,147
Opportunities and projects are varying success.

279
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:34,372
So in my first week at Pwncool, I was approached by Discord and they wanted

280
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:38,015
us to do a French speaking Discord server.

281
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,101
We thought this sounded like a great idea,

282
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:47,525
and also they had the promise of trialing a Japanese server next.

283
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,886
So, we have a big player base in Japan,

284
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:53,508
so we thought, okay, that's great, we'll try the French one first and see how it goes.

285
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:58,131
It was a really good idea, and I believe it would have been really successful, but...

286
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,879
We did know that we didn't have that many French-speaking players,

287
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,480
so it might not go too well.

288
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,402
We spent a lot of time and energy on it,

289
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:09,524
and as expected, it didn't really pick up.

290
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:14,347
So I would just say there's a lot of really good opportunities out there,

291
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,569
but just be selective about what you go for,

292
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,050
because you don't have to say yes to everything.

293
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:23,413
Pick and choose the opportunities that sound best to you.

294
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:30,908
We shadow dropped the soundtrack during the teasers to 1.0.

295
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,951
And this sounded like a good idea at the time,

296
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,893
but I feel like if we had to put a big marketing push

297
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:41,035
behind it and done it as its own thing,

298
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,296
instead of just one teaser,

299
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,459
it would have gotten a lot better.

300
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,141
So shadow drops can be really good,

301
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:51,263
but it has to be the right timing and the right product.

302
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:53,745
And you want to make the most of something big,

303
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:54,465
like a soundtrack.

304
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,400
Finally, making merch boxes for 1.0.

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,881
As you can see here on the screen,

306
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:03,962
this is Lyric opening up his merch box on his live stream.

307
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:09,004
So we wanted to do merch boxes for 1.0,

308
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,225
just to thank creators that had helped

309
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:12,786
push the game and play it.

310
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:18,748
And we did look from a merch company for probably two

311
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:19,368
or three months.

312
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,609
We were on a really tight timeline.

313
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,890
And in my...

314
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:29,100
Like personally I thought, okay, I could probably do this because it's a really

315
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,004
tight turnaround and I could put some things together in a box and send them out.

316
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:33,785
Um,

317
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:38,494
We looked for a merch company, but we weren't really successful

318
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:40,896
because everyone thought it was way too tight of a timeline.

319
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:42,897
So I ended up doing it myself anyway.

320
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:46,959
And it went really well, but it was very stressful

321
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,640
because we had a lot less time than I could have had.

322
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,382
So I would just say, evaluate the situation.

323
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,644
Look at the facts and the timelines,

324
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,305
and just make sure that.

325
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:00,237
I don't know, just consider all the options.

326
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,224
I probably should have done it myself in the first place,

327
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:07,575
and it would have been a lot less stressful.

328
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:08,797
So increasing reach and engagement.

329
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:14,028
There are many things that you can do to increase reach and engagement, and some of them can

330
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,429
be controlled and some of them can't.

331
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,990
So one of the things that you can control is doing giveaways.

332
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:26,152
So on Twitter, as I mentioned, we did Steam Key giveaways, and we've also done a Steam

333
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:28,733
deck to celebrate 1.0.

334
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,736
You can also do press releases.

335
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,179
Future Friends started helping us with press releases in July

336
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,860
and it helped to create a lot more articles

337
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,202
from the press, of course,

338
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:42,364
which really helped push the game

339
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:43,885
and advertise the new patches.

340
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:49,089
Live streams is also another big thing.

341
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:51,351
So, as you can see here, this is Ellie Joy Panek

342
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,172
and she did a live stream for us

343
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:55,014
on our Steam page on launch day.

344
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:59,856
It went really well, and it just helps to expand your audience,

345
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,516
that you're going to show all of your,

346
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:05,077
you're going to show off your game to all of their audience.

347
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:10,039
It was really hard to see the exact impact of this

348
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,219
because we did a lot of, we did a big marketing push for 1.0.

349
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:20,521
However, we do see a lot of people still in our Discord coming to us saying that they

350
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:23,684
saw Vampire Survivors on Ellie or Lyric's stream.

351
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:28,588
So it did make an impact, it's just hard to quantify it.

352
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:33,932
And also doing in real life events, such as EGX and WASD in London.

353
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:39,036
We've done both of these events so far, and it's really nice to meet players and just

354
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:41,118
connect with people in real life.

355
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:45,968
So there are some things that are out of our control as well.

356
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,750
We're really lucky with Vampire Survivors

357
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,351
that it took off in the way it did.

358
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:53,453
So we were nominated for some awards and we won a couple.

359
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,635
So being in the award shows

360
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,776
has created a lot of exposure for us.

361
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,439
And also we entered the Steam Awards.

362
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,401
So I believe anyone can enter the Steam Awards.

363
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,263
And when people vote for you,

364
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:08,564
they're encouraged to leave a review.

365
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:10,405
So just entering that.

366
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:15,595
We got a lot of reviews, so that was really good for us.

367
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:19,625
I think at one point we were getting more reviews than Elden Ring for a few days.

368
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,350
So that was really cool.

369
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:26,127
It doesn't hurt to reach out to platforms.

370
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:32,910
So if you're working with Xbox or Steam, if you just contact them and ask them their requirements

371
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:40,214
for what they need in order to retweet your post or anything like that, because they'll

372
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:44,376
have requirements that they need to meet, then you can make sure you're doing that and

373
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,538
there's a lot more chance that they will help you out and work with you and retweet.

374
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,512
Also, working with creators and companies,

375
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,775
it's really good to work with these.

376
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:58,537
And you could just ask to collab,

377
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,279
like we asked to collab with Lyric and Ellie.

378
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,601
And the worst thing they can say is no,

379
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:04,762
so you might as well give it a go.

380
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,666
Learning and growing into my role and into the games

381
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:11,047
industry.

382
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,822
So, as I said, I'm really new to the games industry,

383
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:22,523
and also to this role of being a community manager.

384
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:26,165
So, over the last year, whilst I've been working on Vampire Survivors,

385
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,266
I've had to learn a lot of new skills.

386
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,408
I did this by watching videos and doing courses,

387
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:37,591
and also attending talks at industry events such as DEVELOP in Brighton last year.

388
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:41,706
I've been trying to familiarize myself with the industry

389
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,586
by watching showcases and award shows,

390
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,347
such as the Streamr Awards and BAFTA,

391
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:49,188
and spending a lot of time on Twitter and LinkedIn

392
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:53,450
to just learn about the people and the companies that are around,

393
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,391
and also about different content creators,

394
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,131
so we know who to work with.

395
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,233
It's really important to stay up to date with...

396
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,244
The algorithms and just news around socials.

397
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:08,228
So signing up to newsletters has really helped me.

398
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:11,353
There's Victoria Trans Community Dev Newsletter.

399
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:13,917
And also there's a TikTok Gaming Newsletter that you can get

400
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,839
and that will help you with all the trending sounds.

401
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,503
And also just watching YouTube videos.

402
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:21,676
Of course, talking to people.

403
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:24,557
There's Discord groups that you can join.

404
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:27,618
I'm in some for indie games.

405
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm also in some community manager Discords as well.

406
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,902
Yeah, just spending time on Twitter and meeting up with people in real life, like we're doing now.

407
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,423
And also online gatherings.

408
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:43,204
Finally, there's podcasts.

409
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:45,225
So I listen to one called She Plays Games.

410
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:53,586
That one's really helpful because it's a lot of different women in the gaming industry talking about their roles and their experiences.

411
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:02,339
So, last year I did Safe in Our World,

412
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,021
which is a mental health training course.

413
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:09,425
That was really important for me to learn about the impact of community management

414
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:14,029
for my own mental health, and also to help our players,

415
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:15,330
so in our Discord.

416
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:25,398
I also did Limit Break UK, which is a mentorship program, and I was really lucky to get two

417
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:30,021
mentors who have helped guide me and give me advice throughout the last year.

418
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:35,064
And also I've just been trying to play more games instead of just spending nearly 400

419
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:36,645
hours on Animal Crossing.

420
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:43,013
Um, so yeah, how have I built my confidence and learned to

421
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:44,594
question processes along the way?

422
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:48,015
There's been a lot of trial and error over the last year, um,

423
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:49,236
with all the different posts.

424
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:54,077
So yeah, just seeing what works and what doesn't, um, when you

425
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:56,358
find something that works, obviously gives you more confidence to

426
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:57,539
keep going and try that again.

427
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,980
Um, and yeah, just more knowledge about the industry has given me a

428
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,061
lot more confidence as well.

429
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:09,485
It helps me make better informed suggestions and decisions in my job.

430
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:15,646
And it also helps to improve my, like, it helps that I improved my organization.

431
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:19,887
So the more I learn and the better processes that I made, like using

432
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:23,368
Notion and everything, I streamlined everything a lot more.

433
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:27,749
So that helped to free up more time to start new projects.

434
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,419
So yeah, I just want to summarize my talk for you quickly.

435
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:38,341
So I've learned how important community management is

436
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,842
for growing, nurturing, and entertaining your community.

437
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,004
How a strong tone of voice and branding

438
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:47,725
will help build your image, your company, and your game.

439
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,487
How being consistent, willing to listen,

440
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,628
reliable, and authentic as a company goes a really long way.

441
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:56,429
How early...

442
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:01,456
You can get a lot of player feedback and build your company image and values.

443
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:05,218
And also that you don't have to say yes to everything.

444
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:08,700
Not everything will go to plan, but you can always learn from it.

445
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:14,683
Also that it's really important to keep learning, making connections and developing your skills.

446
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,626
Community management is crucial for your game's success and is definitely worth investing in.

447
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:25,609
That was Vampire Survivors Agile Community Management.

448
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,744
Thank you for listening. You've been fantastic. Terrible.
