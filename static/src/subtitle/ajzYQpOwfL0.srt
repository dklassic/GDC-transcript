1
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:11,446
What I'd like everyone to think about is a time where you felt most competent in

2
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:15,809
your daily work, that you felt most trusted and had a lot of space to make

3
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:19,592
your own choices, where you felt like the work you were doing was contributing to

4
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:20,433
something meaningful.

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,496
Think about basically the time where you most enjoyed your work.

6
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:30,939
I'm ready to bet that this was also the time where you had one of the best managers you've ever had.

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,122
I know my managers always had a huge impact on my motivation, my performance, and also my health.

8
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:43,606
So when I first became someone else's manager for the first time years ago, I took it really seriously.

9
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,428
As a great responsibility and with great professionalism, I completely freaked out.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,261
So I seek guidance.

11
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:53,944
What do you do to become a good manager?

12
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:59,010
And I start looking for inspiration in books and articles

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,053
and also the scientific literature on motivation.

14
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,576
And what I've learned about motivation

15
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:07,619
has completely changed how I think about this

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,542
in terms of my own motivation,

17
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,564
but also the motivation of my teams.

18
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:14,358
And I absolutely love teams.

19
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:15,819
Teams are the best.

20
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,981
This delicate ensemble of artists, designers, researchers,

21
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,964
engineers coming together, pulling their energy and talent

22
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,486
in the service of something that is bigger than themselves.

23
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:30,587
Teams are really the best.

24
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,509
And for the last 10 years, producing AAA games,

25
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,611
but also working on interactive experiences

26
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,871
in the consumer robotics.

27
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:44,723
And today, using video games to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence,

28
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:49,229
I've been passionate about understanding what makes a great team.

29
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:56,400
The topic I want to explore today with you is human motivation, what drives us to act.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,961
I've came across an interesting research from Bard, Deasy, and Ryan.

31
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:10,725
Studies they'd done in 2004, where they explored the individual differences, the people on

32
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:15,247
the team and how that can impact the motivation of them as individuals, but also the group,

33
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:19,468
compared to the impact that their managers would have on their motivation.

34
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:26,482
It turns out the manager's support has 3x the impact that any individual on the team.

35
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:31,805
So you can find the right people for your team, the best people, the most competent,

36
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:34,187
the most autonomous and mission driven people ever.

37
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:38,870
The managers they will have will still have a 3x impact on their motivation.

38
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:46,375
And if this didn't freak me out, that number was more than I needed.

39
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:49,497
So I really, really needed to understand this.

40
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,671
So this was the question I asked myself back then.

41
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:55,053
What do I need to do to motivate my team?

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,996
How does a manager motivate someone else?

43
00:02:58,276 --> 00:02:58,997
What's the secret?

44
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:00,458
This is what this talk is about,

45
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,660
and exploring intrinsically motivated teams

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,821
through the manager's toolbox.

47
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:06,898
Here's what we're going to talk about.

48
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,040
First, I'll do a short introduction

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,402
on one of the most robust and supported theories

50
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,443
of human motivation.

51
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,804
And then we'll look at a use case,

52
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,026
and we'll talk about the winner of 2019's

53
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,266
Manager of the Year Award.

54
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,708
We would explore what is it that this manager does

55
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:25,989
that deserves such an award.

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,050
But first, let's start with chapter one,

57
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,631
self-determined what?

58
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,638
Self-determination theory.

59
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,760
This is the work of two American psychologists,

60
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,121
Edward Deci and Richard Ryan.

61
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,662
In 2000, they published this paper

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,743
titled Self-determination Theory

63
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,684
and the Facilitation of Intrinsic Motivation,

64
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,625
Social Development and Well-Being.

65
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:51,766
Those things are all connected.

66
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,347
And I really highly recommend everyone here

67
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:55,448
to read this paper.

68
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:03,510
If you haven't heard of self-determination theory, maybe you've seen this TED talk by Dan Pink called The Puzzle of Motivation.

69
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,651
Or maybe you've read his book, Drive. This is self-determination theory.

70
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:14,713
Or maybe you've seen other talks on player motivation and motivation of people and interactive experiences.

71
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:20,595
And a lot of great research has been done on this topic to understand the motivational pull of video games.

72
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,516
This also is inspired by self-determination theory.

73
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,785
Or maybe you've heard about those terms, those terms,

74
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:31,246
intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation.

75
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,747
Self-determination theory emerged from the research

76
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:38,927
on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation back in 1971,

77
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,868
where Edward D.C. was the first psychologist

78
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,628
to do experiments with human subjects.

79
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,369
Back then, most psychologists believed

80
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,949
that motivation was a quantity,

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,250
something you have enough of to do something

82
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,010
or not enough of to do something.

83
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,260
But DC and Ryan had a different perspective.

84
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:04,028
They believe quality to be a continuum of different quality of motivation,

85
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,129
rather than the quantity.

86
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,955
And since this talk is not titled Extrinsically Motivated Teams,

87
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:13,699
you've guessed it, intrinsic motivation leads to better outcomes.

88
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,887
But in order to facilitate intrinsic motivation,

89
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:24,750
SDT stipulates that three basic psychological needs need to be satisfied.

90
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:30,995
This is our need for competence, for autonomy, and for relatedness.

91
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:36,478
Competence is our need to seek to control the outcome and

92
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:38,480
to experience mastery in everything we do.

93
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,963
This is about seeking novelty and getting better at something you find meaningful.

94
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:51,608
Autonomy is to be a causal agent of one's own life, which means to have meaningful choices

95
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:57,652
about the things you do and the way you do them, but also to act in harmony with one's

96
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:03,517
integrated self, which means to do something with full volition, doing something that you'd

97
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:07,380
happily endorse because it aligns with your personal values and beliefs.

98
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:11,908
Note that here autonomy does not mean independence,

99
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,349
because this is about having autonomy

100
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:15,929
within the wider group,

101
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,210
which leads us to our third basic psychological need,

102
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:20,491
relatedness.

103
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,432
Relatedness is our need to interact,

104
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,572
be connected to,

105
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:26,713
and experience caring for others.

106
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,494
This is about being part of a community,

107
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:30,434
a family,

108
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,576
or a team of people you care for and who care for you,

109
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,036
and together you have a shared purpose.

110
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:42,106
So these are the three basic psychological needs identified by self-determination

111
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:46,127
theory, competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

112
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:51,449
Over the years, they've been shown to be innate, things that we are born with,

113
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:54,170
rather than things that are learned through life experiences.

114
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:59,472
They've been also shown to be universal, true of all humans.

115
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,133
Hands up who has humans on their teams.

116
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:05,805
So you should all think of them.

117
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,188
They all have those three basic psychological needs,

118
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:10,069
and so do you.

119
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,351
So when you think about motivation in your own,

120
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:15,853
think about those three facets.

121
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,334
Are you satisfied in terms of competence,

122
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,455
autonomy, and relatedness?

123
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:21,557
Are you learning something new?

124
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,678
Do you have autonomy about the choices that you make?

125
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,420
And do you understand the meaning of the work that you do?

126
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,142
You can be super passionate about something.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,461
and then suddenly be disengaged.

128
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,383
Usually it tracks back to one of those tenets of motivation

129
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:41,985
being underrepresented, under-supported.

130
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,366
50 years of academic studies,

131
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:44,867
both in the lab and in the field,

132
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,548
have shown that extrinsic motivators,

133
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:50,549
money, promotion, fame, things like this,

134
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,790
can have a negative impact on work

135
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,551
that requires creativity and problem solving.

136
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,733
anything that requires even rudimentary cognitive skill.

137
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:08,182
On the other hand, intrinsic motivation has been shown to not only provide better results,

138
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,985
better performance in work that requires cognitive skills,

139
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,408
which is exactly the type of work that we do every day.

140
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:21,015
but has also shown that to have a positive impact on people's well-being and thus, decreasing

141
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:28,181
the level of burnout in teams over more than 50 studies in the last 30 years.

142
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:33,086
And also for teams, it shows that there is, it tends to be a, to lead to lower turnover

143
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:36,369
rates in teams that are intrinsically motivated by the work that they do.

144
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,513
So to recap on self-determination theory.

145
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,758
Know that it's a macro theory of human motivation.

146
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:48,299
It encompulates a lot of different aspects of research

147
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,099
in the last 50 years under this one umbrella.

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
It has emerged from the research on extrinsic

149
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,541
and intrinsic motivation and considered motivation

150
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,081
to be a quality, a continuum of quality

151
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:03,442
that leads to different outcomes.

152
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:07,603
An intrinsic motivation is the one that has been shown

153
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,383
to lead to better outcomes in our line of work.

154
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:19,289
as it not only impacts performance but also well-being, and is facilitated when three

155
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:24,192
innate universal basic psychological needs are satisfied.

156
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,794
Those are competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

157
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:33,219
I'm going to stop here for the theory, but I think it's a fascinating topic on which

158
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:38,863
you can spend hours and hours, I know I did, and I'm happy to talk about this offline after

159
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:39,983
the talk if you're interested to know more.

160
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:45,759
But for now, we're going to talk about what we all want to be one day as manager of the year.

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,521
So who could be our manager of the year 2019?

162
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:54,023
Is it one of those corporate CEOs?

163
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:57,505
It could be. They're all remarkable in their own ways.

164
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:58,846
There's a lot to learn from them.

165
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,568
A lot of articles and books are written about them every year.

166
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,789
They're quite inspiring.

167
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,570
But I always find it hard to kind of.

168
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:17,781
compare my daily work to their context and thus finding inspiration in the things I read about those CEOs.

169
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:24,224
So I'm looking for something that's closer to the type of work I do, working with 10 to 20 people every day,

170
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:29,527
maybe 30 if you started looking at teams slightly beyond the teams you're working with directly.

171
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:33,989
So I want to talk about this gentleman. Raise your hand if you know who that is.

172
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,606
Okay, lower your hand if you're a football fan.

173
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,467
Okay, this is a football manager.

174
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:44,728
This is Jurgen Klopp.

175
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,808
He is the manager of Liverpool FC.

176
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:52,030
And he is the best manager of 2019 for FIFA men's team.

177
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,811
Now disclaimer, I'm not a football fan,

178
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:59,953
nor am I a fan of Liverpool in particular.

179
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,033
This is not why I chose this example.

180
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:07,477
What I'm interested in understanding with someone who works in a context where the number

181
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:12,920
of teams and the impact of creativity and also enabling others to do good work is closer

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,503
to what I do every day, what can science teach us about the reason why that team is particularly

183
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:19,963
performing this year?

184
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,545
In particular, what I'm interested in understanding is

185
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:31,122
Liverpool is a great club, but it has access to the same financials and same talents that

186
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:31,742
everyone else.

187
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:35,484
And yet that team stand out last year and is doing pretty well this year as well.

188
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:39,085
So let's explore what this manager does.

189
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:44,788
First you need to know that Jürgen Klopp is known for the range of emotions that he

190
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:45,588
shows on the pitch.

191
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:54,915
He's quite a colorful character, and he's also known for the personal and very close relationship he has with his players.

192
00:11:56,736 --> 00:12:01,778
But he's also known for a close relationship he has with the supporters.

193
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,565
Wouldn't it be great to be doing this every morning coming into work?

194
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:16,545
How's everyone doing?

195
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,513
Anyway, this thing will not translate to your daily work.

196
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,554
The rest is more likely.

197
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:24,036
But still, it's pretty cool.

198
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,879
But most importantly, he is known for the incredible results

199
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,381
that the team has and the performance

200
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,142
they've shown last year.

201
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:34,145
So out of 56 games across all competitions in 2019,

202
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:38,169
only six losses, 43 wins, and is the first English club

203
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,531
to have won the international treble

204
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,853
of Champions League, Super Cup, and the Club World Cup.

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,782
It's a once in a lifetime achievement from a team that always had access to the same

206
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:53,165
talents and the same budget and some equipment as everyone else, as they've done for the

207
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:53,765
last 10 years.

208
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,687
And yet, it's this manager that makes a big difference.

209
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:02,390
We know that intrinsic motivation does deliver better performance.

210
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,966
So if intrinsic motivation and the intrinsic motivation

211
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:10,608
to win is how we can explain their performance,

212
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:13,649
then surely we should be able to look at the way

213
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,870
Jurgen Klopp manages his team,

214
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:18,832
and also cross-reference how he supports competence,

215
00:13:19,913 --> 00:13:22,334
autonomy, and relatedness.

216
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,255
Now, before we dig into this,

217
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,356
I'm going to change the pictures

218
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,697
because this is unfair to who that person is.

219
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,459
He has a great smile, so it's much better to look at this.

220
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:37,570
So we're going to look at three short clips where he talks about how he manages his team,

221
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,214
and we're trying to reference this back to those three basic psychological needs and

222
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:45,918
see if science can explain to us what's happening there, because I don't know anything about

223
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:46,158
football.

224
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,238
I have a lot more information than I give to the players.

225
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,220
Not because I want to keep that,

226
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,042
just because they have to play a football game.

227
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:01,885
Football is a game and you have to play it with freedom.

228
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:04,407
In the beginning, for example, when a new player is coming in,

229
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,808
I don't give them any information.

230
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,209
It's like, let them play, let's...

231
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,191
learn that I learn about him, what he's doing naturally,

232
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,773
and what we want to adjust and what we want to leave with him,

233
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,435
and what we want to stop him doing and stuff like that.

234
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:18,377
So you learn more about your players each day

235
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,419
and then you know how to treat them, how to deal with them.

236
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,222
A lot happens in the one-one talk, actually,

237
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,943
but that's with the player and with the team,

238
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:30,645
there are more things to do and they're all in the right shape

239
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,807
and in the right position and you try to...

240
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,123
Yeah, to help 11 players to do the right things in the right moment.

241
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:42,328
I love how he looks at the floor and he says,

242
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,711
you have to make 11 people do the right thing.

243
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:50,496
It's so hard. And yet this is something that we we come across every day.

244
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,839
So let's look at the things he mentioned in this video.

245
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:59,968
So first he talks about giving people and his new members of the team on board properly,

246
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,053
figure out how they fit in the wider group, get into the role that they're supposed to

247
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:10,997
be playing for the rest of the team, but also feel competent about, yes, I can do the job

248
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,940
I'm supposed to do, to give them time to understand that.

249
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,623
He also talks about sharing the right information.

250
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:21,966
So when you have someone coming on your team, you can either be fully transparent, give

251
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,988
them access to all the information that you have.

252
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:29,110
but you risk overwhelming them with information to a point where they cannot

253
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,912
make a decision without your input anymore, which is not really a way to get

254
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:36,033
them autonomous. But if you give them just enough information so they can act

255
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,755
autonomously and don't require you for the key pieces of information that will

256
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,357
lead to a meaningful decision, then you are supporting their autonomy.

257
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:47,425
He talks about understanding each member of the team.

258
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:51,288
Obviously, if you are to provide people with meaningful choices,

259
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:53,289
you need to understand their perspective,

260
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,691
where they're coming from, how they see things,

261
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:59,855
so you can give them information from a different context

262
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,616
that will either complement their view

263
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,457
or just help them make a decision.

264
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:07,501
And he also separates talking to individuals

265
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:10,183
and taking care of them from taking care of the team.

266
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:11,744
There are two different entities.

267
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:17,628
If you are to manage a team and don't consider the wider group,

268
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,469
you're missing part of the interactions.

269
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,771
But if you as a manager put things

270
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,392
in the perspective of the team with every individual

271
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:27,054
on your team, you help foster those connections

272
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:30,776
and show that you value the relatedness of your team

273
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:33,697
and every member and how they connect to each one,

274
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:35,858
each of the members of the team.

275
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,959
And finally, this is the end goal, obviously, of autonomy,

276
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,940
is to enabling others to make decisions,

277
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,143
not becoming a bottleneck, however it is,

278
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,724
to information or decision making

279
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,546
to foster people's autonomy.

280
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:50,408
Let's look at another clip.

281
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,516
All what we do in life, how I understand, is about relationship.

282
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:02,559
Because otherwise you live in a forest alone, on a mountain alone,

283
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,101
and if you only want to be alone and want to be responsible for exactly the things you do

284
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,482
and no responsibility for anything else.

285
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:11,763
You have to live alone. Otherwise, always when you enter a room,

286
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:15,825
you have a little bit of responsibility, at least, for the mood in the room.

287
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:19,346
As a football team, we have to work really close together.

288
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:23,048
Each player knows each name of each person that works at Melbourne.

289
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,868
It's not me to create an atmosphere.

290
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:27,609
I have each person in the room, each person is responsible for that,

291
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,610
and the football team especially.

292
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,991
It worked out well. We all win for each other meanwhile.

293
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,632
We do it for our...

294
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,886
for Carol and Caroline. We do it because we know how important it is to them

295
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:44,931
and that makes it just more valuable, more worthy. It's just it feels different.

296
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:50,336
If you have a bigger group to do it for, the more, the better it feels for yourself. That's all.

297
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:54,875
So here he talks about relationships.

298
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,836
So obviously it has a huge impact on relatedness,

299
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,216
of course.

300
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,897
So it's understanding how everyone plays a role

301
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,457
and impact the other people in the team.

302
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:05,378
Those connections and how your mood on a particular day

303
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,919
will have an impact on other people.

304
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,080
Just like if you're really positive and really confident

305
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,100
in getting something done,

306
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,941
you will get other people to feel the same way.

307
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,062
Fear on the other hand is contagious.

308
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,602
If you're freaking out about something

309
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,502
and you're the manager,

310
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,524
that's probably a good thing for other people

311
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,964
to be freaking out about the same thing.

312
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,798
So being conscious of this and projecting that is important to think about how you're

313
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,363
impacting the rest of the team is quite key.

314
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,910
he talks about knowing everyone personally.

315
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,592
So this is not just about him knowing them,

316
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,453
it's people knowing each other quite well.

317
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:38,015
Again, understanding other people's perspective,

318
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,797
not just the manager with their reports,

319
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,098
but also everyone on the team.

320
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,100
This is a key thing, of course,

321
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,322
if you want to foster close collaboration.

322
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,684
You are more likely, and this is, again,

323
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:52,147
supported by a lot of research studies on this,

324
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:56,691
you're more likely to give away some of your comfort

325
00:18:57,392 --> 00:19:01,075
if it's for the gain of someone you know closely.

326
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:04,918
Knowing someone, their name, their family,

327
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,180
or any other aspects of their personal life

328
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,082
will make you more likely to make concessions.

329
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:11,884
Which at the end of the day,

330
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,886
working in really complex projects across many, many themes,

331
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,509
you have to give something for the bigger goal

332
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:21,072
and not defend, actually, your own gain.

333
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,854
So this is another way to foster close collaboration.

334
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:30,580
Which then leads for something that he has been bringing to Liverpool quite a lot.

335
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,224
There's a lot of articles and videos on this, how he has put those star players, players

336
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:42,267
who have been trained to think about their career and their personal gain in the long

337
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,008
run, to think about how they're supporting the team.

338
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,009
So he mentions Carol and Caroline.

339
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,630
there are two cooks who work at Melwood

340
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,590
and they've been there for years.

341
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,551
They've been there way before he came

342
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,732
or any of the players came

343
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,592
and they'll be there long after they're gone.

344
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,873
So it's putting yourself in the service of others.

345
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:03,215
There is another great way to satisfy people's needs

346
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,455
for relatedness and the connections they have

347
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,116
with other people.

348
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,056
Now let's look at one last clip.

349
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:14,239
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

350
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,359
I try everything.

351
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,546
to be as successful as possible.

352
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,929
I live 100 per cent for the boys, with the boys,

353
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,691
what we do for the club and all that stuff.

354
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,074
And I think that's leadership in the first case.

355
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:28,257
As a leader, you cannot be the last to come in and the first to go out.

356
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:28,938
That's how it is.

357
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:33,363
You don't have to be always the first coming in or the last going out,

358
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:34,904
but you have to be an example as well.

359
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,569
That's how it is. You have enough confidence and that's very important for a leader.

360
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:42,313
Because confidence... I would expect from myself that I know everything

361
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:46,699
and I'm the best in everything. I couldn't have confidence but I don't expect that.

362
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,923
I know I'm good in a couple of things, really good in a few things.

363
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,233
That's enough for what I can do.

364
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:57,115
My confidence is big enough that I can really let people grow next to me.

365
00:20:57,135 --> 00:21:00,156
It's no problem. I need experts around me.

366
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,297
It's really, really very important that you're empathic,

367
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,998
that you try to understand the people around you,

368
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,300
and that you give real support to the people around you.

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,541
And then everybody can act. That's what leadership is.

370
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:15,742
Have strong people around you with a better knowledge in different departments than yourself.

371
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,003
Don't act like you know everything.

372
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,084
Be ready to admit that...

373
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:24,113
I have no clue in the moment, so give me a couple of minutes, then I will have a clue probably.

374
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:28,556
And that's exactly how I understand it. But it's not really philosophy, it's just my way of life.

375
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,747
And again, having confidence goes back to what I mentioned earlier.

376
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:52,552
Showing other people in the team that they are able to get the goal,

377
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,474
to achieve the goal they all set for themselves.

378
00:21:55,535 --> 00:22:00,677
has been shown to have a huge impact, obviously, on the probability that the outcome will be

379
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,457
positive is believing you are able to do it.

380
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:07,779
And also being quite transparent about both your strengths and weaknesses.

381
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:13,881
As a manager, showing that this is okay to not be perfect and to have room to grow in

382
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:14,521
different areas.

383
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:14,661
And

384
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:20,946
benefiting from training is a great sign sending to other people who might think I have a weakness.

385
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:24,289
Can I actually express it openly to my manager?

386
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:29,794
Am I going to have a negative impact on my performance review or anything else if I talk

387
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:30,415
about this now?

388
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:35,280
Or will I get actual support from my manager and potentially the training that I need?

389
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,524
As a manager showing that it's okay to have those because you have them as well will make

390
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:41,225
everyone more comfortable sharing those.

391
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,040
And essentially this is how you can enable other people to grow.

392
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,142
And he talks about how you want other people to be able to do things better than you do

393
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:50,802
in different areas.

394
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:52,803
Again, he is not a football player.

395
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:55,184
He cannot stand on the pitch and play instead of his players.

396
00:22:55,224 --> 00:23:01,327
So all he can do is help others make decisions, but eventually helping them grow, become a

397
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,268
better player, leading to better performance.

398
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,917
He talks about having empathy, understanding other people.

399
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:10,662
Again, this is about putting yourself in other people's shoes,

400
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:12,865
understanding their perspective, helping them,

401
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:17,053
helping provide them with meaningful choices to them.

402
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:17,834
This supports autonomy.

403
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:21,535
but not just by letting everyone do whatever they like

404
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:25,077
or how they want to do things, giving the proper context,

405
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,538
and then actively supporting their exploration

406
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,519
and figuring out the best way to achieve something

407
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:31,800
and give them the feedback they need along the way.

408
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,681
This is what giving real support is about.

409
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,422
And you see here in just three short clips,

410
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,923
we can see how a range of different things he does

411
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:43,004
nicely support both competence, autonomy,

412
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,966
and also relatedness in just under three minutes.

413
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:49,611
This is something I do for myself as a manager quite often,

414
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:52,234
asking myself when I'm about to do something

415
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,056
or in the way I communicated something

416
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,959
or a process I want to use, I ask myself this question.

417
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,502
Am I supporting competence, autonomy, and relatedness?

418
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:01,164
Or am I creating barriers

419
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,986
that will limit my team's autonomy?

420
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,453
And also, I think this is something that is not a checkbox.

421
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:11,456
It's not a list that you can magically complete

422
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:13,658
and then one day you get better results.

423
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:16,620
If we look at the results that the Liverpool team has had,

424
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,482
he's not a new manager.

425
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,463
He's been with that team for over three seasons.

426
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:21,984
And for the first three years,

427
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,406
doing exactly what he's been doing all his career,

428
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,849
there was no major impact on performance.

429
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,972
And then over time, the team started to get better

430
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:31,432
as a group.

431
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:34,597
and is now one of the best teams in the league.

432
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:38,641
Last week they've had their first loss of the season

433
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,103
and it was newsworthy.

434
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:43,286
It was so surprising that they were losing a game

435
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:46,549
because they are at a point where no one understands

436
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:49,152
what is their secret and how they could be beaten

437
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:51,855
and what's the thing that gets them all together.

438
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:54,498
Another thing that's quite unique is that

439
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,128
they didn't win a single title in three seasons.

440
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:01,310
This is unique in football because most of the time

441
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,671
the manager would have been fired after a season

442
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:05,752
or two at best.

443
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:08,873
Here I think that if he is a good manager to his team,

444
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,314
he also has good managers who have given him the space

445
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,315
and the autonomy to explore different ways

446
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:18,277
of growing his team, who understand that you need patience

447
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:21,058
and take the time for things to get in place.

448
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:27,505
And I think it's, again, those connections of things that make the team perform in the end.

449
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,966
And it was interesting to me from a game developer's perspective,

450
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:36,288
to think about this as most projects in the games industry will start,

451
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,630
they're really complex, it takes a lot of time to get anything fun or anything on screen.

452
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,851
And then suddenly at the end, every piece comes together.

453
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,104
This is just a kind of anecdote, but interestingly, the CEO of Liverpool comes from the games industry

454
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,047
and was the CEO of Electronic Arts and the head of EA Sports.

455
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:00,594
So to close on human motivation and trying to answer that question I asked myself many

456
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:03,897
years ago, what do I need to do to motivate my team?

457
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:08,401
What I've learned through the study of human motivation is I wasn't asking myself the right

458
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:08,702
question.

459
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,841
Instead, I should have been asking myself how me as a manager, or actually anyone on

460
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:18,943
the team, can help facilitate your team's intrinsic motivation, create an environment

461
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:22,244
in the conditions where they will be intrinsically motivated.

462
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:27,266
It's not something you will give them, it's something you can facilitate, which essentially

463
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:32,127
means doing things that will support their need for competence, for autonomy, and relatedness.

464
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:37,234
And what this research on, on motivation shows is that happy game developers make

465
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,015
happy gamers.

466
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:39,157
It's not just a saying.

467
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:41,661
Eventually, it's, it's just science.

468
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:43,544
Thank you very much.
