1
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:09,625
Hi.

2
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,407
Here we all are at GDC 2017.

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:14,468
I hope that you're well today.

4
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:17,610
And I hope that you've been learning, expanding,

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,852
and feeling deeply in your experience at this conference.

6
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:25,194
Even more so, I hope all else, above all else,

7
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:27,716
that on this journey this week that you

8
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:31,818
take the advantage of accessing the brilliant minds and hearts

9
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:32,659
to congregate here.

10
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:37,442
This place, this time we share, and these people around you

11
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:39,362
are something really special.

12
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:41,543
I'm grateful to have you in my life,

13
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:44,003
and I'm honored that you've chosen to attend this talk.

14
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:45,184
So let's begin.

15
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:50,805
Firstly, now that that's awkward,

16
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,045
let's make sure you're in the right room.

17
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,326
Here's everything that we'll be discussing today.

18
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,286
I'll briefly introduce myself,

19
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,667
I'll tell you a little bit about what Tacoma is, and...

20
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,452
why the VO production needed to be so weird.

21
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:08,153
The majority of our time today, thankfully,

22
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,394
will be spent focusing on the pre-production,

23
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:13,975
directorial, and technical techniques

24
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,656
developed specifically for this project

25
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:17,297
and the lessons we learned along the way.

26
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,898
Damn, you know, I was really, really trying

27
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:21,858
to get technical techniques out so much

28
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,499
that I just flubbed the next, but whatever.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,641
And finally, we'll wrap up with my personal favorite,

30
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,561
the Ask Me Anything style Q&A.

31
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,359
All right, let's do this.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:33,940
That's me.

33
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,043
My name is Michael, and I write and direct video games.

34
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,864
I am the casting and voice director of Tacoma.

35
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,327
I used to be the dialogue lead at a company called 2K,

36
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,548
and then I started a company called

37
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:47,869
the Bright Skull Entertainment Group.

38
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:49,670
I'm originally from New York.

39
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,752
I currently live in Los Angeles.

40
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:54,633
In the rare hours when I'm not making games,

41
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,275
like most of you, I do other things.

42
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,947
So what exactly is Tacoma?

43
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,708
And again, why did it need the fancy hoopla?

44
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:10,229
Well, in short, Tacoma is Fulbright's follow-up game

45
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,790
to their inaugural divisive smash hit, Gone Home.

46
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,111
It's a narrative exploration game

47
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:17,331
and it takes place on a lunar transfer station

48
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,272
midway between the moon and Earth

49
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,092
in the not too distant future, 2088.

50
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:27,214
You arrive at the space station to discover it abandoned

51
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:28,915
and need to figure out what happened to the crew.

52
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:32,407
You do this by uncovering fragments of footage that shows

53
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:36,329
in the environment around you AR security recordings of the

54
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,850
missing crews' interactions and movements.

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,292
You can choose to follow and observe any of the AR ghosts of

56
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,013
whichever characters you wish, and at any time, then play,

57
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:50,915
pause, or rewind the footage and explore the playback from

58
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:51,735
other perspectives.

59
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,957
If any of you guys are familiar with the off-Broadway theater

60
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,518
experiment that is Sleep No More.

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,503
Tacoma's gameplay is heavily influenced by it.

62
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,925
And if you are not familiar with Sleep No More,

63
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:07,969
I highly encourage you to get your ass on a plane,

64
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,852
fly to New York, try and get tickets,

65
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:12,453
wait until you get them.

66
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:13,594
No, you should probably, you know what,

67
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,056
buy your tickets online and then just go.

68
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:20,668
This is very much so one of those things that's best shown

69
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,729
by visualization as opposed to verbalization.

70
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,510
So here's a short clip of Tacoma's gameplay

71
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,051
to show you what I'm talking about.

72
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,373
I can't believe it.

73
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,393
Well, you told me we could renewed.

74
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:39,774
Yeah, but I mean us, us, not the whole crew.

75
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,015
I guess there's just something special,

76
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,156
something special about Tacoma Crew 88.

77
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,958
Yeah, not just special, it's unprecedented.

78
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,960
I looked it up, it's never happened before.

79
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,422
Well, everything happens once.

80
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,784
I don't know, personally I'm happy for us.

81
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,107
Happy to be stuck up here with these people for another year.

82
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,528
Some of them?

83
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,970
Some of them aren't as pissy as you.

84
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,611
What's so bad about these people?

85
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,193
Well, they live in a tin can for one thing.

86
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,315
I think it's a pretty nice can.

87
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,817
Oh, you have a pretty nice can.

88
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:11,978
Oh, yeah?

89
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,034
Well, I think you have a pretty nice can.

90
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:15,336
Shut up.

91
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,493
So the name Obsolescence Day is more like a joke.

92
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:39,815
You could say it's facetious.

93
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:43,699
Kai, you probably think I'm an idiot for never even thinking about why it's called that.

94
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:47,883
Out of curiosity, why did you think it was called that?

95
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:52,227
I thought maybe it was when some old type of AI had become obsolete.

96
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,729
But, well, I guess that doesn't make sense.

97
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:57,772
I think you get the idea.

98
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,502
And I also want you to remember that scene there where they're baking something, because

99
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,483
it's going to be relevant later.

100
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:04,443
Okay.

101
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:12,009
So, as you can see, the narrative paths often split and rejoin, creating very complex scenes

102
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,972
where timing and performance of work are concerned.

103
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:19,293
Combined with the aesthetic choices made for the vocal performance in this game,

104
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:24,615
we knew the traditional solo and even basic fixed mic ensemble recording were just not going to cut it.

105
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:30,416
So we made the decision very early on to do full cast ensemble sessions,

106
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:35,978
but then also decided to add choreographed full movement performances on top of that,

107
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:41,079
focusing solely on the VO performance and not actually performing any motion capture.

108
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:46,249
because we are very, very clearly insane people.

109
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,110
Um... click.

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,631
The end result is a technique I've been semi-jokingly referring to as FOCAP.

111
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:59,773
So without further ado, I'm going to share with you some of the experiences we had

112
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,233
and the lessons that we learned.

113
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:06,355
Usually one of the largest hurdles in ensemble recording is scheduling,

114
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,475
which is as mundane as it sounds.

115
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:14,223
Coordinating recording sessions where all the actors, studios, creative stakeholders

116
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:18,187
and so on are available at the same time is no small task.

117
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:24,593
I did a talk specifically on this at GDC a few years ago and in the same year also at

118
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:24,974
MIGS.

119
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:29,859
So I know it's available on the vault if you really want to dive down that rabbit hole.

120
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,981
Hope you like Excel.

121
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:37,643
Because pretty much every scene in Tacoma has every actor in it,

122
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,844
having disjointed and separate conversations,

123
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,326
it made it actually really easy to juggle what would have been a

124
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:47,326
complex shot list.

125
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:52,668
We didn't have to rework the scripts and all the actors could show up at the

126
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,269
same time,

127
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:58,530
which made actually scheduling this really the easiest ensemble I've ever

128
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:58,770
done.

129
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,612
We did have one major setback though.

130
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,743
In order to get the material together for the early press builds,

131
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:09,105
we wound up finalizing the cast a year before the principal recordings.

132
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:13,827
Then that year later, when we went back to do the principal recordings,

133
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,949
one of our core cast members was unavailable and shooting on location

134
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,049
on the other side of the country.

135
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,671
So we had to make a really hard call, and it's a call that I don't really take lightly.

136
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:26,532
I hate recasting. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

137
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,953
And especially when you're doing an ensemble.

138
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,221
because the actors grow attached to each other and they get attached to each other's characters.

139
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:39,226
So part of the psychology behind Ensemble is the actors look forward to coming back and playing

140
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:46,392
with those same people over and over again. Their actual real human being interpersonal dynamics

141
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:51,156
start blending into their characters that they're playing and it really echoes in the performance

142
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:57,201
quite nicely. However, because of this recast we had to bring a new guy in.

143
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,765
And man, he did really good.

144
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,106
He slotted in very quickly.

145
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,787
We were very fortunate with this.

146
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:07,110
And he really brought something to the character

147
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,691
that I hadn't seen before.

148
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,533
And it's a very complex character,

149
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,034
so it was a nice addition.

150
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,216
That I just, you know, I'd have been remissed

151
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,757
if I didn't give you a big old warning

152
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,059
when doing ensemble and having large gaps

153
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,460
in your production cycle.

154
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,761
On the plus side.

155
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:28,928
Because of these pre-alpha sessions we were able to stress test our work flow and the

156
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,512
techniques we invented for the project to make sure they worked.

157
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:32,593
Some of them did.

158
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,996
Some of them became lessons to be learned.

159
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:37,560
And it became really valuable.

160
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:39,603
So that was cool.

161
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,044
I'll show you some of that.

162
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,037
Script preparation and shot lists we talked a little bit about before.

163
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,578
This is usually a complex part of producing ensemble content.

164
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,999
This too is covered in the talks I mentioned in the vault, so I'm not going to go too far into it.

165
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,800
And again, for this project, it was dead simple.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,482
We actually wound up being able to very neatly package everything into three and a half hour long sessions.

167
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:13,425
And then with a half hour buffer for everybody getting there and being like, oh, hey, the traffic's terrible

168
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,107
You know getting to know one another and so

169
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:23,609
So yeah, we actually had the opportunity to do this project end-to-end linear, which was amazing

170
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,530
We basically got to do it as a play

171
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:32,632
And because of that, we were able to have something that sometimes is really difficult to manage in ensemble work,

172
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:36,153
where you're disjointedly going back and forth between scenes.

173
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:43,954
We were able to ensure, without a shadow of a doubt, that the emotional transitions between the scenes would be consistent.

174
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,415
Which was very nice, I thought, and it worked really well.

175
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:53,361
onto something new, choreography. So because we

176
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:57,284
were entering, because we wanted the talent to be able to move

177
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,908
around and interact with each other and do things with props,

178
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,752
every scene needed to be choreographed. So here's some

179
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:09,795
excerpts from my blocking notes. Now, I'm going to bring out the

180
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:13,959
laser pointer because my drawings are shitty.

181
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:16,082
Where is it?

182
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:17,343
Pointer options.

183
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,285
Laser pointer.

184
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:18,665
Great.

185
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,949
So on these pages I have blocking notes for every scene.

186
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,133
Most of what you're seeing here is set dressing and movement.

187
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:33,562
The actors are these crudely drawn circles with their characters' first initials scratched

188
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:34,283
into the center.

189
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,331
Okay, here is an example of two people starting in a location

190
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,513
crossing the room to meet up with another two people.

191
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:50,034
And here's an example of two people walking back and forth

192
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:54,135
to simulate having a walk and talk in a long hallway scene

193
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,336
which I'll show you the results of that in a second.

194
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,757
Actually, have any of you guys seen the footage

195
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:01,918
from Tacoma, like the 15 minute gameplay or anything?

196
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:11,425
No? Okay, cool. That sequence that's choreographed right there is the opening shot that you see in the station.

197
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:21,509
I kept the set dressing as minimal as possible, and I wanted to use what we already had in the studio.

198
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:30,695
So, we use chairs, which are these insanely weird H-shaped runes that are sort of pushed

199
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,817
onto the page with quite an eloquent hand, I must add.

200
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:40,661
And then music stands are notated by these crudely drawn straight lines.

201
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:49,966
So I also sent this little beauty to the studio ahead of time for setup.

202
00:11:51,835 --> 00:12:00,419
It is, if you can't tell, a room layout drawing that is labeled because my drawing is terrible

203
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,842
because my handwriting apparently makes things clearer to no one. For those of you who can't

204
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:10,904
read my handwriting, which is all of you, this says music stands, this is the director's

205
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:18,628
stand, reader's stand, talent chairs and chairs because I just can't draw a chair, okay?

206
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:23,400
We've got Ashley cool to draw some chairs.

207
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,201
All right.

208
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,463
Why aren't we going?

209
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:27,284
There we go.

210
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:29,306
No, get back.

211
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:29,887
Good, sorry.

212
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:33,230
So would it have been simpler to record the game

213
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,393
by bringing everybody in for solo recording sessions?

214
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,394
Absolutely.

215
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:39,097
Would it have sounded nearly as good?

216
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:41,119
Hell no.

217
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:48,111
I've said it before, I'll say it again, and I'll say it on every freaking opportunity I get to say it until it is the norm.

218
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:56,438
Acting is reacting. You can't react to nothing and nobody while you're standing in an isolation booth with an Excel sheet in front of you.

219
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,623
I think Matt Mercer said it best when we were recording Masquerada, he said...

220
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,884
Ensemble is giving us the opportunity and the ability to make adjustments in real time,

221
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,865
which is a really good way of looking at it.

222
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:15,489
From my point of view, it removes the mandate for me to have to have the actors play to

223
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,433
the voices in my head and allows them to collaborate with me and build scenes together organically

224
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,976
and actually do the fucking jobs that we were hired to do.

225
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,757
So that's always nice.

226
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:32,859
It was decided early on that the creative direction for the

227
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,640
games dialogue should be what I've been referring to as sci-fi

228
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,061
mumble core. The emphasis here is being placed on getting

229
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,801
organic realism focused performances as opposed to

230
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:49,643
cinematic realism. A good sound design analog for any of you who

231
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:53,443
may happen to be sound designers would be like an explosion

232
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:53,683
sound.

233
00:13:54,604 --> 00:14:00,227
Audience expectations are big, boomy, oofy, and utterly ridiculously over the top,

234
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,829
but a realistic explosion sound is a big pop.

235
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,492
So, it's the difference between realism and audience expectation.

236
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:15,056
So, when an actor is stationary, standing in front of a microphone,

237
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:18,918
as you would in solo recording, or even in large room ensemble,

238
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:22,459
their instinct is to focus more on their own vocal performance,

239
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,145
which naturally draws them back into cinematic realism.

240
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:31,073
This is generally the desired result for pretty much every other project

241
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,297
on the planet, but not this one.

242
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,213
Think about it really. I mean, in your day-to-day life, are you focused on the quality of your voice

243
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:44,837
and emoting effectively as you talk to a friend or co-worker or giving a lecture at GDC? Probably

244
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:48,459
not, because you sound ridiculous, though I could probably sound a lot better. I'm really sorry.

245
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:54,543
I tried to go to bed at 10 last night. It did not happen. So for organic realism,

246
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:57,025
the more distracted the actor is, the better.

247
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:03,616
Movement helps put the actor in the scene and it gives them honest pacing and it also allows them to focus less on their vocal

248
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:09,299
performance. So here's some example of performances that without the help of movement in the faux capture methods

249
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,921
it's my opinion we would have never gotten to. Now

250
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:17,624
please note before I show you this the audio and the videos is from the camera and not from the board.

251
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:23,227
So be gentle. Oh my god. Wait is today obsolescence day?

252
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:24,308
Yeah

253
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,190
Didn't Odin give you a job to do?

254
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:33,919
No. A computer playing favorites. Well, one does never cease.

255
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,783
Are you okay? Can you feel your feet and hands? Yeah. Oh, my hip just hurts.

256
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:51,406
Bert? Bert!

257
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:00,523
You enjoy it while you can, Williams.

258
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,205
You won't have microgravity on your side forever!

259
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,746
Oh, I will dunk on you in any gravity!

260
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,426
Jupiter gravity dunk!

261
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,128
Ha ha ha!

262
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:16,170
Maybe I stopped thinking we should really like each other.

263
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,511
Ha ha ha!

264
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,732
She called me!

265
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,392
Ha ha ha!

266
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,873
It's like, um, it's our dirty dancing move.

267
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,535
Sorry, I had to leave that, uh, that out, that out to get you.

268
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,285
So that last shot by the way, where she jumps into her arms,

269
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,329
that is the final screen use take.

270
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,314
The audio quality was fucking perfect, which blew me away.

271
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,296
And I'll talk a little bit about how we got to that

272
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:42,877
in a moment.

273
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:51,283
In addition to the stage blocking, I also used some basic props to further distract the talent and help them with the scene pacing.

274
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:57,606
Being in a treated recording environment though, I had to be extremely eudicious in which props we could and could not use.

275
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:01,548
Obviously we wanted to steer away from anything that generates self-noise,

276
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:07,652
but we also needed to avoid props that would make noise by way of manual manipulation or brushing against.

277
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:15,455
Also, I wanted to give the talent the smallest possible tool set so that they could familiarize

278
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:20,596
themselves with the props quickly and not have to learn new mechanics for how to handle

279
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:20,896
things.

280
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,537
So I narrowed it down to these.

281
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:29,500
a set of rubber coated dumbbells and a couple of packs of broken in bicycle playing cars

282
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,382
of which my house has many. I used the weights to help in scenes where the talent needed

283
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:41,865
to show efforts or if they were like unpacking supplies, carrying large objects or catching

284
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:47,908
something. The cards I used in scenes where the characters were doing detailed tasks like

285
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:49,369
checking in on lab equipment or

286
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:56,175
decorating a cake. And what I would do is I would have them, I

287
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:59,617
had like a red deck and a blue deck and I would have them sort

288
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:06,299
the cards in suit order, in natural deck suit order and then

289
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,540
also by red and by blue. So it was something they had to focus

290
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,941
on while they were performing and you'll see in a second how

291
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:19,103
cool that sounded. It does. And I have proof. And action.

292
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:22,575
So, the clean room?

293
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,036
Yeah, it's fucked.

294
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,117
But we'll be able to breathe on the drone,

295
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:26,957
so that'll be nice.

296
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:28,178
Oh, come on, lift.

297
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:34,481
I thought maybe it was some old type of AI

298
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,202
that had become obsolete,

299
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:38,703
but I guess that doesn't make sense.

300
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:39,944
Yes.

301
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:44,966
No, AI, art-like designer hardware.

302
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,487
As soon as the new model's out,

303
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,768
you trade in the old one for customer loyalty.

304
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:55,092
AI are more like, well, they're more like mighty redwoods.

305
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,974
Ancient organisms growing and adapting year after year,

306
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:00,235
decade after decade.

307
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:01,876
Right.

308
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:04,658
How do you think this looks?

309
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:11,317
that man, both of those guys, all the actors that you just saw

310
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:14,738
are really, really talented people. T.J. Ramini is charming

311
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:19,559
as fuck in real life. All right. Another little trick I used

312
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:24,740
concerns the 7th member of the crew, Odin, the ship's AI. He's

313
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,541
a sort of ubiquitous 7th crew member that can be in multiple

314
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:32,922
locations and engage in multiple dialogues simultaneously. It's

315
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,923
very similar to the AIOS structure in the movie Her. Has

316
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:36,703
everybody seen Her?

317
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,630
wanted the performance between the human crew members to feel

318
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,175
so naturally organic but I wanted to have a psychoacoustic

319
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:51,640
cue that was different when they were interacting with Odin. So

320
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,962
we did something a little different there.

321
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,274
To get to there, I had Odin record outside of the ensemble

322
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:00,776
in a traditional solo isolated recording session.

323
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:04,179
We also did this with the protagonist,

324
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,340
who is not a crew member.

325
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,781
She's actually sitting right there.

326
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,364
Sarah Grayson, everyone.

327
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,247
And we did that so that they would

328
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,868
have a disconnected feel from the rest

329
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:16,970
of the organic performances that were going on around them.

330
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,491
It came out really cool.

331
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:23,036
And what we did in the ensemble sessions though,

332
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,018
was I had my production assistant stand in as a reader,

333
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,502
face to face with whoever was talking to Odin at the time.

334
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,345
That was the two little crudely drawn sticks.

335
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:34,427
They were on the other side of those

336
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,488
whenever they were talking to Odin.

337
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:36,692
All right.

338
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:39,453
So let's get into some technical stuff.

339
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:40,894
Script preparation.

340
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,595
Something we do on every project is

341
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,495
to take the script as it's delivered to us

342
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:48,837
and reformat it into our game script template, which

343
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:51,497
is basically the standard theatrical format

344
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:55,139
with a few minor modifications like scene numbers,

345
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,879
individual line numbers.

346
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,785
If the game has it, file names. If it doesn't, then we just leave that blank.

347
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:07,854
Usually, by the way, when we do file names, we do them in micro text on the far right margin,

348
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:11,119
in case you're really nerdy about script formatting and really want to know that one.

349
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,077
But the reason we do the line numbering though,

350
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,079
it allows me to quickly tell the talent

351
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,661
which sections of the script we'll be working on

352
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,242
for each take.

353
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:20,844
I'll call things and say like,

354
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,068
all right, let's take one and two,

355
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:26,190
and we'll grab those two takes back to back.

356
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,332
And then I'll say, all right, let's move on,

357
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,633
and we'll do three on down to 12.

358
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:32,576
or in this case I'd say three to end of page.

359
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:35,158
And it allows us to quickly communicate

360
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:37,720
what chunks of script we want to be working on

361
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,480
at any given moment.

362
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,002
It also allows me to, after we're doing the ensemble takes,

363
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:44,684
if there's something that I feel

364
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:45,845
that we didn't get there on,

365
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,886
a line that we didn't quite get to

366
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,627
and needs a safety pickup,

367
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,048
go back and give me four

368
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:52,649
and give them the lead in on three.

369
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:53,570
So give me three and four.

370
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:57,392
It's just a quick way of communicating.

371
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:57,893
It takes.

372
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:04,926
like 30 seconds to do it, or that's how much I assume that my assistants take to do this.

373
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:06,488
It's probably a lot longer.

374
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:13,099
It's also very important, and silly for me to have to say this, but numbering your pages

375
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,803
When you're using paper scripts, it gets really messy in the studio, and you will totally

376
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:25,346
kill valuable actor and studio time having your actors or an assistant or an engineer

377
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:29,288
or you digging around on the ground looking for page 6 when you're on page 200.

378
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,749
Not fun.

379
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,592
Well, I mean, you can easily do it if it's numbered 6, but if it has no page numbers

380
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:37,312
on it, you're fucked.

381
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:45,054
It's also really useful when you're using tablets, which we pretty much exclusively do now.

382
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,875
This motion happens all the time.

383
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,878
And then, oh fuck, where am I? Everybody else is on page 20? 20, 20, 20, 20, 20.

384
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:58,640
If they have the page number, they can see that it's page 20.

385
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,002
I'm telling you this because when I first started out, nobody was numbering pages.

386
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,603
I'm hoping by now this is standard. I'm sorry, this is really boring stuff.

387
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,658
Um, I love actors with all my heart.

388
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:22,855
Truly. But for the most part, actors, they don't really have a lot of knowledge about audio and what microphones pick up and what it sounds like at the end, and how it gets from their mouths to the in-game.

389
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:29,797
I mean, it's not that they don't have the vaguest of ideas, I'm talking about really technical stuff like shirt motion or things like that.

390
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:34,317
But mostly I'm talking about paper. So that's why we use tablets.

391
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:39,498
And there's been so many times when we were using paper that...

392
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,623
the actor be performing, they'd be in the middle of the most beautiful take you've ever seen,

393
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:48,626
little golden BAFTA trophies were just smiling in your eyes, and then...

394
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,070
Can't use that take.

395
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:59,376
One of the biggest lessons from our pilot session was that paper scripts absolutely

396
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:03,840
need to be eliminated when you're doing any sort of movement in the studio for the same reason.

397
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,882
For the same reason.

398
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,245
So tablets for everyone. You get a tablet, you get a tablet, you get a tablet.

399
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,788
And for- you get a meme for anyone who didn't get that joke.

400
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,341
All right, when working with Focap Ensemble

401
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,242
or any Ensemble project really,

402
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:22,823
pre-populating your markers and Pro Tools

403
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:24,304
is practically essential.

404
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,146
So, and the same with providing shot lists

405
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,947
for the engineers to work off of

406
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,829
and for you when you're at your director post

407
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:35,850
to understand how much time you've used

408
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,891
versus where you should be in your estimates.

409
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:42,590
Here's a sample of the shot list and then following that the

410
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,373
template that I sent over for the engineering team a few days

411
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:53,038
before the session. Here's the shot list. If you want to

412
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:55,961
effectively manage your sessions, not waste money and

413
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,001
make your engineers happy.

414
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:02,335
you need to be really fucking organized. This shot list shows

415
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:06,679
the engineer on the B column every name of every scene that

416
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:09,261
we're doing in the order that we're doing it. This one was

417
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,764
easy because it was linear. Column C is showing the

418
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:18,108
estimated time for how long each shot should take to record. And

419
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:21,932
then the other columns are all a list of who is on mic and should

420
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,014
be being recorded at any given time.

421
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:29,146
That's a really, really, really, I can't make it any smoother than that.

422
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,992
But on the Pro Tools side of things...

423
00:25:33,954 --> 00:25:43,301
I had this made. It's one track per actor character. The track names are pre-populated with

424
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:48,084
the file naming convention that I've been using forever. It's year underscore month day

425
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:52,067
underscore actor name underscore character name. That way when your files come out and if

426
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,889
you've ever seen me talk about my post production process.

427
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,688
When your files come out, they're all auto-numbered.

428
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:01,055
Pro Tools is one of the only DAWs that'll do underscore 01,

429
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:04,502
which is one of the reasons that I use this, sorry.

430
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,672
It's one of the only reasons I use Pro Tools. Every other

431
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:12,813
system uses the operating system's file naming convention

432
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:17,255
in order to name its files. So your first take will always be

433
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,136
named file name. Your second take will then in Windows be

434
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:24,437
named file name parentheses one end parentheses dot wave. File

435
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:29,239
three will be end parentheses two end parentheses. The reason

436
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,680
that I use Pro Tools isn't because I think it's a great

437
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,940
DAW.

438
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,805
because file number one is named underscore oh one so that when I'm tracking all it when

439
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:43,130
Either I or somebody else is tracking all this stuff in an Excel sheet, and they're saying okay

440
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,513
That was take 1a was the select

441
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:50,057
That we have a tool that parses that Excel file at the end of the day

442
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:55,002
Goes through and auto renames all the file names with zero margin of human error

443
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,534
into the, into the depot. So that saves a shit load of time.

444
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:06,278
Alright. Boo, boo, boo, sorry. Markers are then pre-populated

445
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:10,001
horizontally across the timeline. Uh, what I do is, is I use the

446
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:13,543
estimated time, uh, that I have in the shot list, and then I add

447
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,766
a healthy 5 minutes to each, between each marker. So if a

448
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:19,588
scene took 10 minutes, there's 15 minutes worth of timeline to

449
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:20,508
work with, uh, there.

450
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,450
It makes post-production so much faster

451
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,492
because when you fire up your sessions later,

452
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:26,913
all the scenes are there,

453
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,035
all of the actors' takes are there,

454
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,357
and you can just quickly identify where you need to be.

455
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:32,938
And there's a lot of separation,

456
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,200
so it's not all clumped together.

457
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,075
So rounding things out, we did some serious homework on mic selection.

458
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:47,780
I needed to have something that would work for full motion and not have any proximity

459
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,582
alteration, you know, getting too close to the microphone or getting too far away from

460
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:52,063
the microphone.

461
00:27:52,803 --> 00:28:01,410
microphone. Any movement noise, self generated noise. And what

462
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,212
happens with lavaliers a lot too because really thin cable and

463
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:09,717
really shitty shielding is self noise made from conductance. So

464
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:13,059
that you hear like a movement noise when the cable is moving

465
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,862
around on you. So we tested a ton of mics. I also if we were

466
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:16,822
using lavaliers.

467
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:20,205
So we tested a ton of mics. I also if we were using lavaliers.

468
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:26,817
Wanted all the warmth and fullness that can really I thought to this moment only be provided by a large diaphragm mic

469
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,364
Because you know, I'm I'm really easy like that

470
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:35,189
After numerous shootouts with a cater of really disappointing

471
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,551
lavalier solutions, we found a clear winner in the DPA4061.

472
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:44,074
Oh man, that mic sounded so good. I'll play you some stuff in a

473
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:48,416
few seconds. After some experimentation with several mic

474
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,938
placements, which is very important in lavaliers, we

475
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:57,764
which included the headgear with the head-facing microphone

476
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:01,387
placement, which we found to be much too prone to plosiveness.

477
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:05,972
And then also hairline mounting, so over the ear

478
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:08,814
with a little countryman B3 style kind of thing.

479
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,899
And you see that all the time in stage and on pop singers

480
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:14,580
and stuff like that.

481
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:19,744
We found that was too prone to cross nose air movement

482
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:23,908
problems. Which your nose is basically a fucking little

483
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:31,435
baffle. Yeah. So we ended up wig micing. So center forehead.

484
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:33,497
This got rid of all plosives.

485
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:39,678
It sounds super clean. It also makes everyone look ridiculous,

486
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:49,684
which is great. By placing it here, we removed all of those

487
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:53,346
things. So if you're going to use a lavalier, that's where I

488
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:56,508
would put it. If you don't believe me, which I wouldn't

489
00:29:56,568 --> 00:30:01,671
either, here's some raw, completely unaltered audio from

490
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:02,391
those sessions.

491
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:12,094
I think. Oh, it's still on the laser pointer. That's the pen.

492
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:18,556
Sorry. Sorry. I'm not going to sing for you while we're

493
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:19,216
waiting. There we go.

494
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:36,208
Yeah, that was that little walk and talk from before.

495
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:39,149
And again, there's zero editing on this.

496
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:40,589
I just pulled these straight out of Pro Tools.

497
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:42,289
So the clean room?

498
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,790
Yeah, it's fucked.

499
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,911
But we'll be able to breathe on the drone,

500
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:46,731
so that'll be nice.

501
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:47,951
Oh, come on, lift.

502
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:52,752
That was the little weight scene that you saw earlier.

503
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:56,974
And then I'm telling you, this is completely raw.

504
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,014
This is the jump scene.

505
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:03,944
Then I start thinking we should really make the most of it.

506
00:31:06,385 --> 00:31:07,586
Fucking clean as a whistle.

507
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:09,207
I couldn't believe it.

508
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:11,749
When that happened, I was just like,

509
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:13,870
oh yeah, we're not gonna be able to use that take.

510
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,311
And the engineer's in my cans like,

511
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:16,792
yeah, no, that was clean.

512
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:19,093
I stopped the session.

513
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,314
I went into the, sorry.

514
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:23,636
I stopped the session, I went into the control room

515
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:25,156
and I said, play it back.

516
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,337
And I heard that and I went.

517
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:33,955
So yeah, there's DPA4061s, I really like them.

518
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,636
All right, so here's an area

519
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:38,976
where you really don't want to scrimp.

520
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,938
You do not want to try and save yourself a few dollars

521
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,419
by getting four sets of labs for six actors

522
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,880
and have them switch out in between scenes

523
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,741
and then start dividing your shot list

524
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,182
so you only have four on mic while you could be using six.

525
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,074
The logic there being that you're going to save a few dollars renting or purchasing microphones,

526
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:07,000
but your talent is the most expensive commodity in that studio when you're doing ensemble.

527
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:10,474
you will absolutely come out cost negative factor

528
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:13,816
and the time suck that is swapping out between takes.

529
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:19,479
So one mic per actor, belt clipped with an XLR.

530
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,262
The engineer would come in in between each shot,

531
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:27,204
he would unclip and he would recoil all six mics

532
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:29,525
and then start addressing everybody else.

533
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:36,803
Additionally, when I wrote out that stage blocking, I was really conscious and made

534
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:43,005
previsualization drawings, which I then erased because they were even shittier, to

535
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:49,307
visualize the cable pathways when blocking out those scenes so that I would make sure

536
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:54,048
the actors didn't cross paths or do anything stupid like wrap themselves around a chair.

537
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,050
I mean, who knows, what, right?

538
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:02,980
That's pretty much it for the technical stuff,

539
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,425
which really kind of rounds us out.

540
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:13,565
And that's it. So thank you all so much for coming. Please stick around for Q&A which is

541
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,846
again like I said my favorite and I hope you guys have questions because this is really weird

542
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:24,968
shit. There's mics in the aisle so if you have questions please line up now and use them. Also

543
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:30,870
as you leave please thank the CAs and the AV team for doing such a great job at this show.

544
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,432
Without them this entire conference would be an unmitigated disaster. So please also

545
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,116
Thank you.

546
00:33:43,817 --> 00:33:45,978
And please also remember to fill out your surveys,

547
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:48,139
especially if you really like the session.

548
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,720
And my review of you today,

549
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,721
I just really enjoyed having you here.

550
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:58,123
So without further ado, Q and A.

551
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,505
You were here first, I believe.

552
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:01,945
Fight it out.

553
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:03,986
Okay, I win.

554
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:04,706
Okay.

555
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,329
Really insightful talk, really awesome.

556
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:09,829
Thank you.

557
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,225
On your shot list, you had time budgeted for each of your shots in the scenes that you were recording.

558
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:16,585
Mm-hmm.

559
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:20,629
Um, did you ever go over time for any of those shots?

560
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,592
And if so, like, how was the best way to deal with that?

561
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:26,174
Thank you. That's a really good question.

562
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:27,095
Uh, so...

563
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,043
What I do is I buffer in a little bit of time for each shot.

564
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:34,546
I also know that the earlier shots in the day

565
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,687
are gonna take longer than the later shots in the day

566
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,189
because like I said, that's everybody's getting there,

567
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,650
especially if it's the first day,

568
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,653
you gotta buffer in like half an hour or so,

569
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:44,453
maybe even an hour.

570
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:51,159
I don't even call that buffer. I actually just call that getting to know each other and try and do like an hour of dedicated just

571
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,302
Hey, let's meet each other and figure each other. Oh you were in that

572
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:56,504
I was I know so-and-so from that like all that kind of crap

573
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:59,907
So you need to put that in once everybody gets to starting to work

574
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:04,950
Yeah, you need to make sure that you're going at a pretty good clip and making sure that you're staying on schedule

575
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,511
But you also need to have the foresight to know that you're gonna need a little bit of buffer

576
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:15,355
Also on multi-day shoots if you go if you if you do hit a little bit under it's okay because you have you you have

577
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:18,856
Thankfully left space on each of your sheets because you're scheduling this

578
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:22,438
That's why I schedule them at three and a half hours and not like max to four

579
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:27,549
cool. It's also, if you're doing it like we did, you also need to

580
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:31,674
factor in time for getting everybody mic'd up, wig taping,

581
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:34,978
wig un-taping, all that kind of stuff. So, yeah.

582
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:36,520
Awesome, thanks. Hey, no worries.

583
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:37,727
Hi.

584
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:38,967
This was great.

585
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:39,628
Thank you.

586
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:40,989
Thank you.

587
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,570
So what I was really struck by was even

588
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,112
your use of the word ensemble, because especially talking

589
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:50,014
to voiceover actors, often they'd never meet each other,

590
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,395
and they have the other human in their ear.

591
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:56,418
So what is the moment that they all went and had pizza together

592
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:57,919
and became an ensemble?

593
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:58,479
What is that?

594
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,420
That's a really, really good question.

595
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,282
I'll tell an anecdote, and then I'll

596
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:06,304
answer the question, the specific question.

597
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:06,684
Is that OK?

598
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:13,038
So we're working on another project. We're working on Masquerada Songs and Shadows, which was a

599
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:20,704
1,200 page, 60 person cast, full ensemble that we did end to end ensemble. It's great. And if

600
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:26,588
you haven't played it, which I know most of you haven't, you should. Story is brilliant. But I

601
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:33,953
remember there was a really, really, really seasoned high profile voice actor. And I don't do

602
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:36,435
the name thing. He came in.

603
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:43,345
to our studio and was just like, he walked into the room and was just like, oh, you guys are

604
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:48,607
recording? I can go wait out in the thing. It's just like, no, dude, we need to get you in here.

605
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:53,849
We're performing ensemble. Which his agent should have told him, by the way, because we told

606
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:59,851
her. That's a whole other mess. And he just fucking froze.

607
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,414
And was just like, I could see the shock on his face

608
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,977
and the happiness that was exuding off of him moments later.

609
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:14,364
And this is a guy who's done hundreds and hundreds of games

610
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:18,228
and animated films and he's like a major commercial voice

611
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:19,770
that you hear all the fucking time.

612
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,333
And he said, I've never gotten to do this.

613
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,961
And he gets in the booth and it's like, it's just fucking,

614
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,662
it was just incredible to see him be overjoyed.

615
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,882
I mean, his character needed to be mean,

616
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,943
but to see him be overjoyed with the idea and concept

617
00:37:36,983 --> 00:37:38,704
of being able to play off each other.

618
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,264
And I think that's when Matt said that quote from earlier

619
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:43,785
that, you know, like you're able to make those adjustments

620
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,226
in real time, which you cannot do in solo recording.

621
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,986
So the specific question that you asked though,

622
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,747
is what was the moment where they all like pizzaed up

623
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,687
and got to know each other?

624
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:59,024
Yes, and how do you convince people to pay for that extra time to have everyone in the room?

625
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,165
Ah, that's a great question.

626
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:02,226
Um...

627
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:08,610
If someone is hiring me to do ensemble,

628
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,732
they've got a pretty good idea of what I'm going to bring to the table,

629
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,754
and they usually trust my methods.

630
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:19,577
If it was when it was earlier on in my career,

631
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,078
and I was just starting to try this kind of stuff...

632
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,323
It was a little bit of a challenge.

633
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,108
So what we did was we called it a table read.

634
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,873
And we had everybody come in for the table read.

635
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,222
And yes, they familiarized themselves with the material.

636
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:35,803
Yes, they got to know one another.

637
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:38,965
We also, because we labeled it as a table read,

638
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:40,806
brought in all the writers.

639
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:44,869
We brought in the creative director.

640
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:49,291
And we brought in the audio producer

641
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:51,533
and the executive producer.

642
00:38:52,073 --> 00:38:54,495
And we all sat down with the actors.

643
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:58,157
And I had the writers, I had each one talk about

644
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:00,198
what their contributions were to the project.

645
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,286
I had the creative director talk a little bit about the high-level concept of the game.

646
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:10,133
And we gave... people had their character sides ahead of time,

647
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,897
so they were able to ask intelligent questions about their characters.

648
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:17,816
I made sure that the writers were explaining the dynamics and relationships between each

649
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:18,877
character in that room.

650
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:21,640
So this is how you feel about them, this is how you feel about them.

651
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:27,066
Usually what I do when I'm writing is I make a character relationship matrix for every

652
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:28,247
single character in that game.

653
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:33,112
Even if they don't know them, I will want to know how they would feel if they had met

654
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:33,713
that character.

655
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:39,916
And then I usually end up doing that just naturally when I have a script handed to me

656
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:44,319
that I'm trying to think about the dynamic relationship between each character.

657
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,340
So does that help you?

658
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,280
That was great.

659
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,541
I want to see that Matrix.

660
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,762
You should share it online.

661
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:55,071
Hello, thank you for the wonderful talk.

662
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,993
Thank you for coming.

663
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:01,278
I had a question about, assuming that you knew that you were going to be doing this

664
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:07,686
sort of more experimental method for the actual sessions, did that in any way influence the

665
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:12,232
means by which you auditioned actors and made your casting decisions?

666
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:15,555
Yeah, that's a really good question.

667
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:21,682
We did actually have the agents, we highly encouraged them

668
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:25,165
to submit their theatrical resumes, which you sometimes

669
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:26,347
can't just pull up.

670
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,969
So we had them submit their theatrical resumes

671
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,833
and any footage that they may have had

672
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:34,455
that highlighted movement.

673
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:40,097
So whether it be like a walk-on role or a recording of a stage performance, things like that.

674
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:48,680
The reason that you don't recognize a lot of the people in that room is because most of them came from TV and film.

675
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,041
So that was something else that we ended up doing on this.

676
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:57,583
I mean, a few of them, like Abigail Marlowe and Natasha Loring are like killing it in voiceover right now.

677
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,965
But the others are like, are film and TV people.

678
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:08,949
one of them wrote the damn Cosby theme song and was on one of my favorite shows of all time.

679
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:13,252
So that was cool. That's a really good question. However, because we were centered on vocal

680
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:16,434
performance, we were able to do a lot of things that were not necessarily

681
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:25,974
we really, really leaned into who was going to provide the best characterization of the voice

682
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:31,761
because movement is natural and we didn't need like, okay, so T-pose and then freaking go into

683
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:35,325
your thing and hey, I am angry and rush in or whatever, you know, like.

684
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:36,998
Oh, that's a whole other thing.

685
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:40,121
Localized movement should absolutely be a thing.

686
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:42,523
Does that answer your question?

687
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:43,544
Yes, thank you.

688
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:44,385
That was very insightful.

689
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:45,206
Thank you for the question.

690
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:46,287
Hello.

691
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,147
Hi, Michael.

692
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:47,848
Thanks for your talk.

693
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:51,451
I'm wondering, you said earlier that it

694
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:54,534
would have been easier had you done non-ensemble recordings

695
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:55,435
for this game.

696
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,238
But it wouldn't have been as good.

697
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:03,963
uh... if you had to estimate how much more time it took to do the ensemble recording

698
00:42:03,983 --> 00:42:09,027
like percentage wise uh... could you? Is it like twenty percent thirty? I will give you a

699
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:14,012
really uh... really good answer to that I hope. Um... so with ensemble

700
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:20,043
by its very nature, more of your time is spent in pre-production and post-production,

701
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:25,906
but less of your time is spent in the studio. And in fact, most of the time, and I can't

702
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:29,247
guarantee this for anybody out there who's like, we're gonna do ensemble and this could be great,

703
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:33,968
and Michael Cervix said this, and we're taking that to our producers, but most of the time is,

704
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:40,371
and that's how you all sound in my head, by the way, most of the time it ends up being cost neutral.

705
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,554
and I know that that sounds insane but it is. It ends up

706
00:42:47,574 --> 00:42:50,255
being cost neutral. That's a good argument. Thank you.

707
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:55,799
Thanks. Cool. Yes. Hi, Michael, thank you very much. It was

708
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,182
terrific. My question is were there any unforeseen challenges

709
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:04,964
that came in on the post side of things from doing the ensemble

710
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:06,404
sessions? Like I guess if you...

711
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,712
had a performance from one actor that really worked well for the take,

712
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:13,874
but maybe not from the second actor or third in the scene?

713
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:20,116
Did that make editing those lines more difficult once you got into post-production?

714
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:23,778
Would you mind repeating your question and possibly rephrasing it?

715
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,359
Sure.

716
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:31,261
Because you had multiple actors in the scene, I guess within the recording,

717
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:36,311
did that make editing those lines more difficult

718
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:37,812
once you did post-production?

719
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:39,453
Got it, thank you.

720
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:43,077
So I think what you're talking about is step over lines.

721
00:43:43,597 --> 00:43:45,819
So yeah, so like just there.

722
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,903
So, and I'm sorry that I didn't go into too much detail

723
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:50,663
on things like that.

724
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:53,666
I've just, I've given a lot of talks about Ensemble at GDC.

725
00:43:53,706 --> 00:43:55,147
So I was hoping that we would highlight

726
00:43:55,288 --> 00:43:57,690
just the stuff that's specific to the Tacoma project.

727
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,051
But I've covered that before

728
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,132
and it's an excellent question.

729
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:04,993
What I do is I have them perform the scene as best as possible.

730
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:06,594
Get the scene to sound amazing.

731
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:08,854
And if there's a line that's a step over line,

732
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,095
now that they've already got it in their system

733
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
and know what it is, I tell them to do the scene again,

734
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:15,836
but give me pause for the ellipses.

735
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:18,336
And it works really well.

736
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,132
This game had very little step over.

737
00:44:24,753 --> 00:44:25,695
It worked out really well.

738
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:28,279
But for things like combat and that too,

739
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,903
like when, you know, that was a good example

740
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:34,329
of how you saw I had a three burst pain reaction in there.

741
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,112
That was because in the scene,

742
00:44:37,053 --> 00:44:39,154
she's pain reacting while other people are talking.

743
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:40,595
So you do that one time,

744
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:42,757
because you don't want to stress the actor's voice.

745
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,019
You want to let them do that one time

746
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:49,882
so they get the amplitude of the scene

747
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:51,563
to the place where you want it.

748
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:54,906
And then you go back and have them do the scene

749
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:58,668
without onomatopoeia or any sort of stressful voice work

750
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:01,731
and save that for the end of the scene.

751
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,292
Does that help you?

752
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:04,112
Yeah, absolutely.

753
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:04,553
Thank you very much.

754
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,312
Does anybody else have questions? You can literally ask me anything. You want to know how

755
00:45:10,392 --> 00:45:18,976
magic works? Hey, how are you? Hey, great, how are you? I'm well, thanks. Awesome, thank you for

756
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:26,560
the talk, it was really great. Thank you, thank you for coming. So the arm jumping take, if the

757
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,062
one you thought wouldn't work, what alternative way would be that you would have recorded that?

758
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,264
That's a really good question.

759
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,646
The reason that we did the arm jump

760
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,511
was because we had done like three or four takes

761
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:43,755
of that scene that just weren't getting there

762
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:48,641
with that joyous, exuberant, movement-based performance.

763
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:53,906
And so, because we had them standing still and just being like jumping for joy,

764
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:58,710
or just like, just moving or hugging, like air hugging each other,

765
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,252
and just wasn't getting there.

766
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:05,756
And I'll be honest with you, like, as a voiceover director, working with voice actors,

767
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:10,000
sometimes it's really challenging to do things like ask an actor to do something physical

768
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,201
to interact with each other.

769
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:17,868
You don't want to make anybody uncomfortable or to put them outside of their sphere of comfort

770
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:24,634
And damage the relationship between you and the talent and also between the talent and the other actor. They're not fucking toys

771
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:31,921
They're people so you can do things like ask them like I want to try something that might be a little bit weird

772
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:36,005
It's okay to say no. Would you mind actually jumping but in this case

773
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:42,085
In this case, the two actresses that were playing the couple

774
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:45,907
really, really, really liked each other,

775
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,988
like right off the bat, like in reality.

776
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:52,130
And Natasha's just a very, very much so her character,

777
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,831
like they're both very much so their characters.

778
00:46:55,091 --> 00:46:56,312
And so Natasha's just like,

779
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:58,373
would it be okay if I just actually jump on her?

780
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:00,674
And Abigail's like, and she looks at Abigail,

781
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,114
and Abigail's like, yeah.

782
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:05,956
Which is why when Natasha comes off of that,

783
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:06,677
she's just like, she comes.

784
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:10,460
I can't believe it!

785
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,541
And that ended up just being really cool.

786
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:15,504
So I wanted them to do that just the one time,

787
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,567
because I didn't think that the audio quality was going to be very good,

788
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:24,271
but to get that amplitude of emotive response into the scene work

789
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:27,134
and be like, oh, that's how far we need to bring it.

790
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,796
That's why that scene worked out really well.

791
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:32,018
There was a couple of other points in the production as well where that happened.

792
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:36,261
without getting out, I did this to be as spoiler free

793
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:40,643
as possible, by the way, but there is a scene

794
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,264
where the scene just played better,

795
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:46,147
where one person had their head in another person's lap.

796
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:47,388
And it worked out really well.

797
00:47:47,928 --> 00:47:50,129
And again, I asked permission, said like,

798
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:51,690
hey, would it be cool if we tried this?

799
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,991
And they were just like, fuck yeah, let's do it.

800
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:54,212
I was like, all right, great.

801
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:57,734
So yeah, does that answer your question?

802
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:02,233
Yeah, well, another part would be if that didn't work out,

803
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:05,877
how would you adjust, what would an alternative thing be?

804
00:48:06,077 --> 00:48:09,040
I mean, you got the weight and they know how it'd feel,

805
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,242
but if the audio didn't come?

806
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:13,285
Oh, if it hadn't have worked out, I guess.

807
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:23,043
I mean, I don't want to like, at the risk of sounding brash or arrogant, I think I'm

808
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:28,686
a pretty okay director, and I like to think that I'm able to coach people into difficult

809
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:29,767
situations if need be.

810
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:33,709
Again, this one worked out, but I see your point, like what if she jumped and she was

811
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:35,830
just still emoting, just like, yay.

812
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,091
That wasn't how she was doing it, by the way.

813
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:48,599
But if she had been, it's one of those things where there's a few subtle triggers that you can do to help to coach that performance without being obnoxious.

814
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,282
One of them is to... Have you voice acted before?

815
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:53,983
Yeah.

816
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:57,286
Okay. Who is someone who has not voice acted before?

817
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:06,093
Who is someone who has not voice acted before that would be totally cool with standing two feet away from a microphone and giving... You? You?

818
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:08,567
Okay, we'll do both of you.

819
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:11,728
Why don't you come on up?

820
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:22,611
And while they're coming up, I'm...

821
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:24,292
I'm not very good at miming, I'm sorry.

822
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:26,713
Oh, five minutes, thank you.

823
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:31,020
Okay, so you're in a fight.

824
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:34,222
You are going to be punching him.

825
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:36,683
It's going to be a one-hit punch.

826
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:41,306
So, and remember, I already have previous knowledge that neither of these guys are professional voice actors.

827
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:45,249
So, I want you to do a one-hit punch to him.

828
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,991
And it's going to be a quick, quick burst of kind of thing.

829
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:49,732
So you're going to be like,

830
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:55,296
And when he hits you, your reaction is going to be like,

831
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:56,797
Wait, no, face, sorry.

832
00:49:59,004 --> 00:50:02,344
There, that. You're gonna go and break a little bit. Is that okay?

833
00:50:02,985 --> 00:50:03,685
Don't actually...

834
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,805
Okay, so how hard is he gonna hit me?

835
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:08,206
He's not actually gonna hit you.

836
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:10,246
Is it more about the speech or the reaction?

837
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:14,487
It's much more about the reaction, and the way that I like to describe combat,

838
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:16,608
which I'm totally stealing from DB Cooper, is this.

839
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:21,269
When you're hit, it's always a surprise.

840
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:23,629
So you're caught off guard and things are very vowel-driven.

841
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:28,747
They're diaphragmatic, but in the face especially, your mouth is caught open.

842
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:35,830
If you are doing the punching, the combat comes from a place of knowledge.

843
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,351
You know that you're going to give a punch, so you're secure.

844
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,513
Your jaw might be a little bit tighter, so things can be a little bit more consonant

845
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:41,753
driven.

846
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:45,194
Okay?

847
00:50:45,515 --> 00:50:48,116
So, I want you to punch him.

848
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:49,196
Not really.

849
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:50,317
Go ahead.

850
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:51,117
Okay.

851
00:50:51,558 --> 00:50:52,698
That's my... This is my reach.

852
00:50:52,878 --> 00:50:53,719
Don't actually punch him.

853
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:55,519
No, I...

854
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:57,580
I don't want to be that guy.

855
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:57,780
Okay.

856
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,620
And here we go.

857
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,061
That was pretty good.

858
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,101
Can you give me one more take?

859
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:03,322
And instead of coming from the...

860
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:04,142
Coming from the belly,

861
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:04,822
come from the chest.

862
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:05,583
Really get it...

863
00:51:05,703 --> 00:51:06,603
Really get your face set.

864
00:51:07,123 --> 00:51:07,283
Okay.

865
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:10,864
That was really good.

866
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:12,505
Do me a favor this time.

867
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:14,746
I want you to stay on mic.

868
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:16,646
And I want you to...

869
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,267
I want you to stay on mic.

870
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:19,747
And I want you to...

871
00:51:19,787 --> 00:51:21,348
Keep your hand like this on your face.

872
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:26,432
Good. Sharper.

873
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:42,577
Coaching people into doing combat rapidly like that really, really helps set the tone

874
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:44,098
for the urgency of the scene.

875
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:47,400
You're faking them into being in a dangerous environment.

876
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:47,860
Faster.

877
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,461
Oh my god, I have to...

878
00:51:48,641 --> 00:51:51,363
They're in a panic state when you get them to do things really fast.

879
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:52,724
So that helps great.

880
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,104
And thank you guys both so much.

881
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:02,390
I also pretty much always put audience participation in my talks that I hadn't planned to this

882
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:02,530
year.

883
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,571
So I'm just so happy that happened.

884
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:06,189
Yes?

885
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:10,210
First of all, awesome talk and awesome audience participation.

886
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:10,851
Great job, y'all.

887
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:11,951
Thank you for being here.

888
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:12,251
Thank you.

889
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:15,992
I got to play the demo down at Day of the Devs, which was really cool.

890
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:19,053
I was really curious about how you got the zero G scenes to work.

891
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:19,793
The what now?

892
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:22,554
The zero gravity scenes where they're like in the Tacoma Dome.

893
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:27,696
Oh, as far as the voice stuff was concerned?

894
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:29,456
Yeah, and like the...

895
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:30,896
We played a little bit of it before.

896
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:32,737
I don't know if you saw, but when...

897
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:36,145
Oh, okay, so we played a little bit about that before.

898
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:39,607
So what we did was we had them just trash talking each other.

899
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:41,108
You know, here, I'll just go back to the slide,

900
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:41,608
because it's fun.

901
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,090
Boop, boop, doo.

902
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,511
And then I think that,

903
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:47,352
why don't I answer your question

904
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:48,832
while I'm getting the scene queued up?

905
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:50,433
Just a quick question.

906
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:52,955
How much rewriting was there during the sessions?

907
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:54,676
I know with this type of game,

908
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:55,836
it can be pretty heavily structured,

909
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:57,237
but was there a time when the ensemble was like,

910
00:52:57,337 --> 00:52:57,697
what if?

911
00:52:58,658 --> 00:52:59,218
Or no rewriting?

912
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:00,779
Wait, one more time, what was that?

913
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,261
Was there any rewriting during the ensemble work?

914
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:03,601
No.

915
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:09,256
Yeah. Writing during rewrites or rewrites. Yeah, there were minor tweaks, but I mean, it wasn't like

916
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,245
It wasn't like how Amy...

917
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:13,145
You're talking about the way that Amy Henning does her stuff?

918
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:14,906
Um...

919
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:16,226
Steve is the writer on this.

920
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:17,946
They're a little bit different.

921
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:22,107
He and Carl are working very creatively together outside of the studio.

922
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,108
And they work great together inside the studio too.

923
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:29,728
But they're just very, very rigorous in making sure that everything is like scratch-recorded

924
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,149
and play-tested a million times before they bring it to the studio.

925
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:35,890
I want to point out, this game, we had a very limited budget for the audio recordings.

926
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,070
So everything they could do to prepare properly, they did.

927
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,792
And we had been working together for a very long time on other projects, so it was just

928
00:53:43,273 --> 00:53:47,015
a very natural, like, hey, this is what we're doing, can we do this?

929
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:48,476
And I was like, yes, we'll make that work.

930
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:51,338
So you know what?

931
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,559
See me after class and I'll play you that video.

932
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:56,241
Unless everybody really wants to see Jupiter Gravity dunk.

933
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:56,981
All right, fine.

934
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,282
Do I have time to fire up Jupiter Gravity dunk?

935
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:58,882
All right, cool.

936
00:53:58,903 --> 00:53:59,283
All right, cool.

937
00:53:59,303 --> 00:53:59,823
All right, cool.

938
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:00,263
All right, cool.

939
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:00,984
All right, cool.

940
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:01,344
All right, cool.

941
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:01,784
All right, cool.

942
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:02,145
All right, cool.

943
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,480
Yeah.

944
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:03,921
All right.

945
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,362
Do you want to keep your ink in?

946
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:05,602
No.

947
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,683
Get rid of that stuff.

948
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:08,805
All right.

949
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:09,646
And then after.

950
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,262
So after this, I'll be in the hallway,

951
00:54:14,302 --> 00:54:16,023
and you guys can all find me there.

952
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:17,424
I'm around all week.

953
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:19,947
This conference is about meeting people.

954
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,108
It's about building connections.

955
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:23,270
It's about having friendships.

956
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,833
Please, please, please don't be frightened to talk to a person.

957
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:30,936
Just remember that they're a person and be kind.

958
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:35,280
I encourage you, if you want to talk to me, please just do so.

959
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,363
I was really scared and nervous at my first conference.

960
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:43,764
and George Sanger made everything okay for me, just like he did with DB if you were in that talk before.

961
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:49,386
So I hope that at some point I can, I or somebody that I know or one of you can

962
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:54,687
pass that along to somebody else. Here is the motion video with Jupiter Gravity, donk.

963
00:54:55,928 --> 00:55:04,410
Oh my god, wait, is today obsolescence day? Yeah, but didn't Odin give you a job to do? No.

964
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:07,962
Huh, a computer playing favorites.

965
00:55:08,482 --> 00:55:09,782
Oh, wonders never cease.

966
00:55:09,802 --> 00:55:12,463
I don't think I can fast forward.

967
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:14,503
Are you okay? Can you feel your feet and hands?

968
00:55:15,164 --> 00:55:15,564
Yeah.

969
00:55:17,124 --> 00:55:18,685
Oh, my hip just hurts.

970
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:25,266
Bert?

971
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:27,327
Bert!

972
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:34,244
Here it is.

973
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,405
You enjoy it while you can, Williams!

974
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:39,127
You won't have microgravity on your side forever!

975
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:41,628
Oh! I will dunk on you in any gravity!

976
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:43,349
Jupiter gravity dunk!

977
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:44,329
Ha ha ha!

978
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:47,030
Might as well see it.

979
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:52,173
But then I stopped thinking we should really make the most of it.

980
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:53,574
Ha ha ha!

981
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:56,875
She called me!

982
00:55:57,015 --> 00:55:59,536
It's like, um, it's our dirty dancing move.

983
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:05,302
Sorry, that was me tapping my rings on my giant jug of water

984
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:06,283
that I usually carry around.

985
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:06,904
It's a weird thing.

986
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:08,707
So that's our talk.

987
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,652
My talk, okay.

988
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:14,356
Thank you for coming, and I hope to see you outside.
