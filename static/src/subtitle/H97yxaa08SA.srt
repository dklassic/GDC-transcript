1
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:07,895
So, are you ready?

2
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:07,975
Yes!

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:10,756
Alright.

4
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:15,778
So, welcome to SimCity Build It.

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:19,620
What did I learn as a game designer?

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,903
My name is Petri Ikonen and I come from Track20.

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:28,444
I'm creative director there

8
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:34,887
and Track20 is EA's mobile studio in Helsinki, Finland.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,312
And first, I will very briefly talk about my background a bit.

10
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:47,753
So I changed to games industry 2003.

11
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:52,954
Before that, I worked in field of theater and drama

12
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:56,055
as an actor, director, script writer.

13
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,395
But then I jumped into games.

14
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,176
And I have not regretted a day.

15
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,437
It's been a great industry to work for.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,726
So I joined Sumea 2003.

17
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:13,311
Sumea was a very small startup in Helsinki.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,331
And then very quickly it was acquired by Digital Chocolate.

19
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:22,913
And those first years we were creating Java mobile games.

20
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:24,974
Very different times.

21
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:27,054
Very big restrictions.

22
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,195
Very small screens.

23
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,276
Very small build sizes.

24
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:35,357
The business was controlled by operators.

25
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:37,918
And it was premium model.

26
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,460
And then came the first big change.

27
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:45,693
touch screen, app store.

28
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:50,418
And we really, as game developers, we needed, again,

29
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:55,243
to learn something new, learn a totally new type of

30
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,928
interface, touch controls.

31
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,651
Very interesting times.

32
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:08,316
And then came even bigger revolution, free to play.

33
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:15,267
I was working as an executive producer in multiple Facebook games.

34
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:19,431
And I had to learn free-to-play as early as 2009, 2010.

35
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:28,458
And it was tough, but I'm really grateful that I had to do that.

36
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:35,784
And also, I had to learn what it means to run games as a service.

37
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,718
So that's my background in very briefly.

38
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:44,520
And all these years I've been really concentrating on game

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,621
design, because I love game design.

40
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:47,481
And it's tough.

41
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,043
So at the moment, I'm working at Track 20.

42
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,444
It's a very small studio.

43
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,885
There's less than 50 people.

44
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:00,438
But we have 17 nationalities.

45
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:04,160
And that one, it's a very big asset for us,

46
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,082
to have all those people from all over the world

47
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,763
to working together.

48
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,166
And that's one big thing that you can have in your studio,

49
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,768
because we are creating games for global market.

50
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,550
And then the game, SimCity build it.

51
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:26,891
This was a very tough project, very difficult to design.

52
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:32,634
The game was soft launched October 2014, and then we went worldwide December 2014.

53
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,115
And it's been a big success.

54
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:46,520
We have a very big amount of users every day playing the

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,880
game.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,222
It's been on top crossing charts since, and I'm very

57
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,183
proud of this game.

58
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:56,524
But the project was a very difficult one.

59
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,285
So this is the overview.

60
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:05,488
I'm going to talk about four very tricky design challenges

61
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:09,469
that I did face during this project.

62
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,074
And I try to explain also that what do I think that I learned.

63
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:19,597
And then after that, I will kind of think that, hey,

64
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:25,521
why did we succeed even though the challenges were so tough?

65
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:29,204
So let's go further.

66
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:33,547
First design challenge, classic IP.

67
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,905
It's a huge IP, you know it.

68
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,469
The game is older than 25 years.

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,732
And it's been, of course, the main platform has been PC.

70
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,075
And then we got that as a project.

71
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:55,639
And you can think that what kind of excitement it is.

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,363
So the whole team is really excited that, hey, we are the

73
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,926
ones who will be creating the next SimCity.

74
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,751
And you get all that inspiration.

75
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,153
And you are so kind of that, yes!

76
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:13,898
But then, very quickly, after a couple of weeks of the project,

77
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,440
you start to realize that, oops!

78
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,183
This will be a very tricky one.

79
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:22,445
This will be so hard.

80
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,968
And a couple of weeks more and you are that,

81
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:28,230
oops! Can we make this?

82
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:33,698
And also what you understand that, whoo, there is so much

83
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:38,700
fun fans out there, and they have huge expectations.

84
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,141
They are expecting something.

85
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,362
Are we able to deliver that?

86
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:48,283
So that was kind of the first big design challenge that I,

87
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:51,584
or what we faced as a team.

88
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,085
So what did I learn?

89
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:55,326
I think that

90
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:04,422
We really needed to reimagine what is SimCity on mobile.

91
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:09,245
So it's not enough to kind of take the things from the PC

92
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:13,427
game and somehow adapt or port those.

93
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,769
You have to really reimagine.

94
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,331
It meant that we had to kind of redesign the

95
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,852
whole game from scratch.

96
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:27,679
So definitely the platform is what defines how the game

97
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,279
should play.

98
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,822
So you can't take PC stuff and just put it on mobile.

99
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:37,686
And then one thing that I think fortunately we managed

100
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:41,949
to do was that because the expectations are high, you

101
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:46,553
have to really manage those expectations, communicate to

102
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,794
the fans that this is a mobile game.

103
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,891
This is a free-to-play game, so that they don't think that

104
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,933
there is a next SimCity 2000 coming again on mobile.

105
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,755
Second design challenge.

106
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,555
This was even tougher.

107
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:06,356
Free-to-play.

108
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:10,498
I think free-to-play is very difficult to design.

109
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,221
It's much more difficult than old premium model, at

110
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,041
least for me.

111
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:18,062
And.

112
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,407
When we started the project, we thought that, yes, it's easy.

113
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:27,670
We just kind of follow the very typical free-to-play

114
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,470
conventions.

115
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:34,294
And what we did, we started to try energy mechanics, builder

116
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:38,936
mechanics, and more or less all those failed, because the

117
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:44,239
pacing of the game would have been really slow very quickly.

118
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:48,987
And we realized that the game would be very boring with those mechanics.

119
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:53,772
And that was actually the reason that after multiple prototypes we decided that

120
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:59,076
okay, the crafting mechanics is the one that we will follow in the core loop.

121
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,024
So, what did I really learn about free-to-play in this project was that

122
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,747
I think that there is a big...

123
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:15,117
big change at the moment, or even kind of a change of

124
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:15,777
paradigm.

125
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:20,200
And I think that we shouldn't pinch players too much.

126
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:26,084
We shouldn't pinch players and say that you either wait, or

127
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:26,945
then you pay.

128
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:31,988
We should be much more gentle and kind of develop games that

129
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:36,751
are fun to play, and then offer even more fun by saying

130
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,692
that, hey, you love this game.

131
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:39,893
You enjoy this game.

132
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:46,039
you are willing to spend weeks and months playing this game.

133
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,820
So perhaps you should invest some money

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,720
and enjoy it even more.

135
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,721
So we should really kind of swap the whole thinking,

136
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:59,222
not pinching players, instead offering them more value.

137
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:03,803
Offering them things that they can be more efficient

138
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:05,423
and enjoy the game more.

139
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:16,756
Third design challenge. Mobile user experience, mobile UI.

140
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:29,542
SimCity PC version, and kind of a tradition of SimCity is, it's lots of information.

141
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:35,179
big PC screen, numbers, lots of numbers.

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
And of course, that's very crucial.

143
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,521
As a mayor, you need all that information

144
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:43,783
so that you can make meaningful choices

145
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,603
based on that information.

146
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:49,565
And what we found out immediately was that, oops,

147
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:53,326
we want to support very small screens.

148
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:58,108
How are we able to fit all that information

149
00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,328
on a small screen?

150
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:04,188
And then, very quickly, we understood also that it's very

151
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:09,090
difficult to find very natural, easy ways to control

152
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,251
your city with touch controls.

153
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,872
How do you do all the build actions?

154
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,334
And then we started to think that, hey, how do

155
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:19,434
you play the game?

156
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:24,076
Classical SimCity PC thing is that you play

157
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,657
very long sessions.

158
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:29,318
But now mobile playing, it's about very short sessions.

159
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:34,387
So our players play perhaps five, six, seven sessions per

160
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,869
day, but each session is just two, three minutes long.

161
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,271
So we really needed to think our kind of the whole user

162
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:48,014
experience and pacing of the game to support typical mobile

163
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:52,756
usage instead of that old PC thing.

164
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:56,778
So what did I learn?

165
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:59,479
I think that on mobile.

166
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,264
Design equals UI.

167
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:06,705
And what do I mean with that is that if your user interface

168
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:10,086
is not able to communicate the design,

169
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,367
the design is worthless.

170
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:17,749
So you have to always think that is the UI able to

171
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,509
communicate?

172
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,130
Is the gameplay able to communicate the design?

173
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,792
And most of the mobile games, they are very, uh,

174
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:36,791
UI heavy and information heavy and we had that kind of very big trap that all that information

175
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,374
Do we spam all that?

176
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:44,780
But fortunately we understood that yes, we have to simplify simplify

177
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:48,995
And also, abandon always conventions from old platforms.

178
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,215
So what easily happened was that I was very excited

179
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:55,476
something that was on PC game.

180
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:58,656
And then I wanted to more or less copy that on mobile.

181
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,177
And every time it failed.

182
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:02,797
So it was totally stupid.

183
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:08,118
And also, what we learned about the production that when

184
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:12,139
you want to create great touch controls, it will take time.

185
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,879
It will take lots of iteration rounds.

186
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,897
Then the fourth design challenge.

187
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:24,598
Open-ended simulation.

188
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:30,299
I think one core thing in SimCity is really the

189
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:35,680
simulation and that it's very open-ended and it's sandboxy.

190
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,141
And as a mayor, you can do whatever you like.

191
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,901
And you can really experiment and be creative.

192
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,082
And we want this to support that core idea.

193
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,371
And we ran, kind of, we faced lots of problems.

194
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,816
For example, what is time?

195
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,699
What is concept of time?

196
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
We have real time.

197
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,380
We have device time.

198
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,782
Then we have the city time, where the day is just perhaps

199
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:08,423
10 minutes long, and the night is a couple of minutes.

200
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:11,144
And we were kind of confused.

201
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:15,025
How should we kind of think the whole simulation?

202
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,086
That is it following the city time, or real time, or device

203
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:18,366
time?

204
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:23,254
And then we started to think that, hey, what happens if you close the app?

205
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,997
Is the simulation still running there?

206
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:33,663
And what happens when you come back after two hours, two weeks, two months?

207
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,586
Is the whole city destroyed?

208
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,649
Is it just ruins or every building is on fire?

209
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:50,961
And we didn't want to punish the player too much, so we created very exact rules so that the simulation slows down.

210
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:59,607
And yes, there has happened some things in the city when you are away, but when you come back, you see that, oh, there has been something.

211
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:06,612
You can understand what has happened, you can react on those, but we can't punish the player too much.

212
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:11,235
And also, a very interesting problem was that, how is your

213
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,376
city talking to you?

214
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,998
Now, simulation engine is running under the hood.

215
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:21,161
But if we can't communicate those things to players, it's

216
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:22,682
basically worthless there.

217
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:28,165
So we had to implement multiple parallel systems how

218
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:30,306
to make the city communicate.

219
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,888
So SimCitizens, they are having speech bubbles and

220
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:34,669
thought bubbles.

221
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:42,111
each service data layer has information what's happening in that particular service.

222
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:46,816
And then if you tap on any residential building, you again get information that

223
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:50,761
how is that particular building doing.

224
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,403
So what did I learn?

225
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:54,325
I think...

226
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:59,677
Simulation under the hood is a great thing, and it's very fascinating.

227
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:09,544
But if you implement it, make sure that you are able also to pass that information to players.

228
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,087
Because if it's just under the hood, who cares?

229
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:17,490
So don't overdo. I think that was a big lesson for me that...

230
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,591
Because what happened to us was that we created a big

231
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:25,052
simulation, and then we realized that, oh, we don't

232
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,933
get any information on that.

233
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:31,816
And it was quick to implement the simulation under the hood,

234
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:35,458
but very time consuming and difficult to implement all the

235
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,780
systems that then pass the information to the player.

236
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:45,824
Those were typical problems that we faced.

237
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,940
from design point of view during the project.

238
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,163
But we did succeed.

239
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,545
And why did we succeed?

240
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,329
That's something that I've been thinking a lot.

241
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,635
One thing that I'm very proud of is our team culture.

242
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:13,511
There is a very big trust there.

243
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:17,755
And then there is also a very big passion to create games.

244
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,218
And then there is this kind of very Finnish culture thing

245
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,259
that never give up.

246
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:27,883
You know, living up there in north, if you give up,

247
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:31,706
especially during winter time, you'll die very quickly.

248
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:36,424
So that was kind of in our DNA.

249
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:41,568
And how, I mean, that however, I mean, that the project was so

250
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:45,071
hard, and we redesigned and redesigned and re-implemented.

251
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:47,152
But no one left the team.

252
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,714
No one said that let's quit or anything.

253
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:52,377
So we kind of kept on iterating.

254
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,899
And kind of the mentality was all the time

255
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:55,919
that we won't give up.

256
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,160
We will do this.

257
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:01,849
Also, I'm very proud that we don't waste time talking that

258
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,931
is this a free-to-play game or not a free-to-play game.

259
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:09,094
I can say that we are a free-to-play friendly studio.

260
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:11,076
So we are playing free-to-play games.

261
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,357
We are analyzing those.

262
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:13,657
We are talking about those.

263
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,842
It happens to be the standard monetization thing at the

264
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:25,246
moment, and we are doing that and not arguing inside the

265
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,427
team that should we do premium or free-to-play.

266
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:32,819
Also, very interesting stuff happened to design process.

267
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,901
When we started the project, we had a quite small team at that

268
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:43,663
time, about 15 people, and I was the only designer.

269
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,443
Big mistake.

270
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:50,984
And also, the process was quite like a waterfall.

271
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:55,485
So during a sprint, I did some design.

272
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,866
Artists did the assets.

273
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,366
We implemented it.

274
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:01,907
And surprise, it failed.

275
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,048
And we just lost two weeks.

276
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,509
And then we did that again, and it failed again.

277
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,490
So we realized that we are not agile enough, and also that

278
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,031
one designer can't solve all that stuff.

279
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:20,434
So we totally changed our team culture that, hey, everybody's

280
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:21,554
a game designer.

281
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,335
Everybody is free to contribute.

282
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,837
Anybody can, anytime, say that this sucks.

283
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,757
We are not happy with this.

284
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:31,838
So it's very frank culture.

285
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,600
And then we changed it so that, hey, let's have always a very

286
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,021
big kickoff meeting where everybody in the team is

287
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,838
who is working on that particular feature,

288
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,881
let's talk about design true together so that everybody's happy.

289
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:50,205
And we won't implement anything or draw anything before everybody's happy.

290
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,347
And then when we start to implement,

291
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:56,250
all the time we kind of double check the design.

292
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:01,195
If there are any flaws, on the fly we change the design.

293
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,538
So we can already in the mockups,

294
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:06,519
for example, see that, hey, UIs...

295
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:11,770
they can't handle the information, let's simplify.

296
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,311
Or when we have implemented the very first version, we can see that

297
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:21,413
oh, the design doesn't work, it's not perfect, let's quickly iterate it.

298
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,453
And that was a simple thing that we changed

299
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:28,995
and it kind of improved our productivity a lot.

300
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:31,035
And it also kind of kept the...

301
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,877
Kind of the team morale went up, because everybody felt that,

302
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:38,518
hey, we all are responsible that this is a great game,

303
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:39,558
and this is a fun game.

304
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,542
Then, next big learning for me was user testing.

305
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,105
I know that we all are, we are big artists.

306
00:19:55,955 --> 00:20:03,062
We kind of want to nurture our babies and we don't want to show it anyone before it's perfect.

307
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:04,964
So let's hide it.

308
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,047
And that's totally stupid.

309
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:08,107
So...

310
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:17,175
You know that how blind we will be soon when we are developing a game.

311
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:20,138
We are doing the same thing week after week,

312
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:23,862
and then the team starts to argue that is this good enough,

313
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:27,425
is this fun, or is this not, and it's so subjective.

314
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:32,950
Fortunately, we had a first big user testing round way before Alpha,

315
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:37,295
and what we found out, we found out that the game sucks.

316
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,527
It was so bad.

317
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:44,489
The players didn't understand what is really their role, what

318
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:45,769
is the goal of the game.

319
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,750
They didn't be able to really use the controls.

320
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,310
And there was lots of problems.

321
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,452
But thanks to user testing, we kind of got that information.

322
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:04,333
And we did a very big design pivot, re-implemented,

323
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,113
redesigned.

324
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:13,171
basically all the features. And when reaching alpha we had the second round, we were able to see that,

325
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:20,255
oh, we have fixed and addressed most of the problems. Okay, there are still some more,

326
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:26,979
and we wanted to address those. And then during the soft launch, very short soft launch period,

327
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:32,682
during that we had the third round. And with that third round we saw that, yes,

328
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,603
Finally, the game works.

329
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:39,975
We have been able to improve and address all the biggest

330
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:40,537
problems.

331
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,141
And then we did.

332
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:48,698
still before the worldwide launch, a very big kind of update for the game.

333
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,299
And it was also very interesting because it was soft launch.

334
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:56,981
It was interesting to cross-check that, hey, what is the metric saying

335
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,062
and what is user testing round saying?

336
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:03,584
And see that, yes, they match, which was very interesting.

337
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:04,924
So I think that...

338
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:10,025
For a developer, this is kind of this magic if.

339
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,866
And magic if comes from actor's work.

340
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,327
If you are an actor, it's a very typical way of working.

341
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,068
This, what if I would be that person

342
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:22,388
in this particular situation?

343
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:23,749
How would I feel?

344
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:24,769
How would I act?

345
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:28,130
So kind of changing that, that, hey, as a game developer,

346
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,491
what if I am the player playing this game?

347
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,791
How would I feel?

348
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,971
Would I find this fun?

349
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:40,294
So that changed our theme culture a lot.

350
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,896
So nowadays when we are starting a new feature or new idea,

351
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:48,138
it's always that, as a player, I want to do this or that.

352
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:50,279
As a player, I would like to.

353
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,602
So we always start from kind of point of view of a player.

354
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:55,722
And that's great.

355
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:59,765
So it's really playing, kind of putting players first.

356
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,240
So let's wrap up.

357
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:10,045
So if you are working on great IP, leverage that.

358
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,988
It's such a big inspiration.

359
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:22,252
you get all that excitement. It won't be an easy project, but yes, you have a lot of material.

360
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:30,096
Think really what is the DNA of that IP, what's the core, and then redesign for your platform,

361
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:35,240
or for mobile, and for whatever the monetization model is.

362
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:42,504
Also think your team culture. Is trust there? Is the passion there?

363
00:23:43,393 --> 00:23:45,794
how well you are able to communicate,

364
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,876
and are you kind of open and frank?

365
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:52,617
Or is there something that there is fear

366
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:57,719
and you are not able to say aloud if something is bad,

367
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:58,559
for example?

368
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,401
And then think also your design process.

369
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:15,371
How agile it is. Are you wasting time because you can't change design because you are following certain process that is perhaps slow or bad.

370
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:26,220
So break those rules. Make the design process very agile. And then don't forget user testing. Use that.

371
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,102
And I think that's my, definitely the key.

372
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,145
The key takeaway.

373
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:33,966
Importance of user testing.

374
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:36,987
So, that was my talk.

375
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:38,367
Thank you very much.

376
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:46,791
Applause

377
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,451
I guess we have a couple of minutes

378
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:50,272
time for a question.

379
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:53,233
Yeah, hello.

380
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,374
Hey, so my name's Sean.

381
00:24:55,967 --> 00:25:02,113
So when you made the transition on your team from thinking of as a lone designer to everybody's a designer and everybody can be brutally honest

382
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:08,439
How did you communicate that to the team and change that culture so that everybody on the team knew that they were now free to contribute?

383
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:08,939
No

384
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,866
Sorry, I'm very difficult to hear the question. Can you could you please repeat it? Yeah

385
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:20,790
When you made that change on your team from the lone designer to everybody's a designer

386
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,726
How did you communicate that to the team

387
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,687
and manage to make that cultural shift

388
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:28,849
so that everybody was willing to contribute design?

389
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:31,191
Very good question.

390
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:32,892
So the question, I think everybody

391
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:34,593
heard the question right.

392
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,955
So how did we do that?

393
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:42,518
I think everybody in the team felt and realized

394
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:43,799
that this is not working.

395
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,340
I'm too alone.

396
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:52,555
And people understood that we have to change this and get more design power.

397
00:25:56,567 --> 00:26:00,970
Also, it's typical for our team that there are very design

398
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,892
oriented guys also in programming and in art.

399
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,974
And they really express that, hey, we

400
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:11,537
are fine if we are able to contribute and be

401
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:13,378
part of that process.

402
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:16,300
And then we kind of said, OK, always,

403
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,041
let's start with the kickoff meetings.

404
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,463
Let's discuss together about the feature

405
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:23,385
before starting even the actual design work.

406
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,822
And it has been working very nicely.

407
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:29,585
And I mean that it's a big kind of thing for us.

408
00:26:31,627 --> 00:26:32,227
Next, please.

409
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,670
You talked a lot about the importance of user testing.

410
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,931
And I was curious if you could talk more about your process.

411
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,053
Do you bring people in the office and watch them play?

412
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:42,136
Or especially testing, like balancing of things that take

413
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:43,757
months or weeks to finish.

414
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,939
Fortunately, EA is a big company.

415
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,562
And we used our LA consumer insight.

416
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:57,586
unit. So they handled those and basically we had some people here watching those sessions

417
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:04,829
and then we later got kind of hours and hours of videos and then we watched those in Helsinki.

418
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:12,753
But those were big rounds so we had I think over 100 test players playing for more than a week.

419
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:16,921
And we got videos from the day one, first session, and then

420
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:20,004
day eight or seven sessions.

421
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:24,307
So we kind of got how the player is feeling and doing in

422
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:26,789
the very first session, and then after playing a week.

423
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,953
Did players play at home, or they come in once a week?

424
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:31,633
No, no.

425
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:34,576
They had their own build on their own device.

426
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:35,396
So they are playing.

427
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,238
So somehow instrumented to record video while they're

428
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:37,498
playing.

429
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:37,838
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:40,480
Played at home, and they did the recordings and so on.

431
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:41,041
Thank you.

432
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:42,562
Yes, please.

433
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:51,627
Hi, my name's Tom, and I just wanted to know, so clearly SimCity Build has a lot in common with Hay Day, the crafting loop, the cargo ship, the trade market.

434
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:59,554
Did the idea kind of start there, or did it evolve there? What was the process, and were there other sort of strong ideas for the way this game could have gone instead?

435
00:27:59,854 --> 00:28:05,980
More or less, I, some, at some point I, very good question, at some point I, I...

436
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:12,625
thought that our way of doing design is brute force,

437
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:17,729
meaning that we try everything and then something works.

438
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:23,713
Hello.

439
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:25,995
I'm actually kind of curious about when

440
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:28,076
you talked about the iterative process after getting user

441
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:31,359
testing, what sort of stuff, if you're able to share,

442
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,581
what sort of stuff that was dropped or totally changed

443
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:36,983
in the feature set of the game?

444
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:43,853
Did you ask that what changed totally based on user testing, right?

445
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:45,334
Yeah, what are the major changes that you made?

446
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:48,137
Or what did you find that was just total shit and you wanted to get rid of?

447
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:51,660
One of, one biggest perhaps was that...

448
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:58,706
players didn't understand what is the big goal in the game.

449
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:01,088
Which is silly, that hey, you are building a city.

450
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,631
You should understand the big goal.

451
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:11,179
But we added lots of hints that what should you, what would

452
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,964
be your goal, like visiting in the tutorial flow another nice

453
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:17,165
looking big city.

454
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:26,028
Then later adding challenges and tasks and that kind of stuff, because players were confused because all that, all those

455
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:33,691
possibilities that you have as a mayor. So it was, I mean that it's okay perhaps in the PC game and PC audience, but

456
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:38,393
mobile audience is so broad and perhaps more casual.

457
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:44,195
So they needed a bit more hand-holding and kind of hints that what can you do as a mayor?

458
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:55,299
Sorry, quick follow-up question, but I was actually kind of curious about why you guys dropped the whole build and abandon cycle that was so core to the PC version.

459
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,539
Sorry, what loop? Build?

460
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,981
The build and abandon cycle.

461
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,242
Oh, okay. Yes, very good question.

462
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:06,385
We definitely thought about that a lot.

463
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,674
But then, kind of combining free-to-play mechanics,

464
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:17,678
we kind of agreed that, OK, you have to have a persistent city.

465
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,160
And that is the reason that it's very difficult

466
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,342
to destroy your whole city.

467
00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:26,124
And we wanted that, hey, OK, you have one city.

468
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,466
You will play that, hopefully, for years.

469
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:30,807
And you can do a lot of different stuff there.

470
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:34,687
That would be another take that you are suggesting.

471
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,988
Definitely we could do another SimCity with that kind of that.

472
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:39,969
It's more like that, hey, I created something.

473
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,951
I destroy, abandon, and start a new one.

474
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,633
But it would perhaps then need different kind of also

475
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:47,773
free-to-play design.

476
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:51,355
Because it feels like it doesn't fit in with the what

477
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:52,996
happens when the player's away sort of stuff

478
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:53,796
that you were talking about.

479
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:55,297
Sorry, now I didn't hear.

480
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:57,758
It feels like it fits in with what you were talking about,

481
00:30:57,878 --> 00:30:58,278
about how

482
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:02,269
when the player goes away from the game, what actually happens.

483
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:03,150
Yes.

484
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,352
So it was just too much punishment, you thought?

485
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:06,292
Yeah, that's true.

486
00:31:06,453 --> 00:31:07,033
That's one thing.

487
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:07,493
Yeah.

488
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:07,834
Thank you.

489
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:08,574
Yeah.

490
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:09,995
Do we have still time, hopefully?

491
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:12,458
Yes, one question at least.

492
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:12,858
Great.

493
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,499
Hello.

494
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:15,180
Nice pitch.

495
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,283
So for how long have you been developing the game

496
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,205
before the first user testing?

497
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:23,707
It was about half a year.

498
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:28,707
And how long did you take to soft launch the game?

499
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,127
How long it take to?

500
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:32,747
Soft launch the game.

501
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:34,508
Launch the game.

502
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:36,948
After the first less than a year.

503
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:39,929
The whole project was less than one and a half years.

504
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:43,709
From very first day that we start,

505
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,290
the first day that we knew that, oh, we

506
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,910
are going to do a SimCity, it took a bit less than one

507
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,271
and a half years for the worldwide launch.

508
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,319
Thank you.

509
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,621
Thank you very much.

510
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:59,670
I was also asked that please remember to return the feedback

511
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:01,173
or whatever it is called.

512
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,297
So thank you very much.
