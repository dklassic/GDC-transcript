00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:06,185
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:07,726
My name is Brian Francis.

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:10,889
I am, as always, the invisible voice inside your head.

4
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:15,472
I am here today playing a game called Heaven's Vault.

5
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,295
It comes to you from the folks at Inkle,

6
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:19,456
based out of Cambridge.

7
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:20,597
You guys are in Cambridge, right?

8
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:21,678
That's right.

9
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:22,258
Yeah, we are.

10
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:23,599
OK, I'm going to actually need you.

11
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,041
I'm going to need to do something down here real quick.

12
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,103
John has unfortunately, you can't see John down there,

13
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:29,845
everyone, but we have both Joe and John.

14
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:30,625
Yeah, there we go.

15
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,397
I'm going to have to get a bit uncomfortable to play, so that's all.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,093
Anyway, we are here today with some lovely folks in chat. I already see CliftonB out there.

17
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,814
I think I saw someone else but I refreshed the page and I lost their name.

18
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:53,357
Hi everyone in chat. We are here today, like I said, we're playing Heaven's Vault.

19
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:58,500
It is just releasing today. It is a narrative archaeology game where you can walk around,

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,002
have great interactive conversations with people, with great interesting characters.

21
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,084
The setting is probably my favorite part of the game. We'll get to that in a bit.

22
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:14,687
Right now we are looking for the friend of the Archeal, of another academic type who we're friends with.

23
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:18,589
So we're on a kind of a friend-goes-missing-ancient-mysteries kind of quest.

24
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:23,251
Which is how Indiana Jones starts, but this game takes a very different tack from Indiana Jones.

25
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,152
Alex, I need you to introduce yourself, even though a lot of folks probably know who you are.

26
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,583
Hey, what's up? My name is Alex Warrow.

27
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:34,406
I am a contributing editor at Gamasutra.com and I help out on GDC.

28
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,688
And most importantly, I skipped lunch to be here,

29
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:39,029
and I'm just now starting to regret it.

30
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,031
I told him not to.

31
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:41,531
But luckily...

32
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,373
I've been getting some rumblings in the background.

33
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,554
Yeah, no joke.

34
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:50,217
We have two very special guests here who can do most of the hard thinking for me.

35
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,019
Special guest, will you tell everyone who you are and what you do, please?

36
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,960
Hey, I'm Joe.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,362
I'm a gameplay director at Inkle.

38
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:02,529
I'm John, I'm the narrative director here at Inglewood.

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,010
Welcome.

40
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,371
Brian, where are you?

41
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:07,112
I forget the planet name, gonna be honest.

42
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,773
We're in the middle of the cyclones.

43
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:09,813
Okay.

44
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:16,257
So this game takes place in a nebula, which is instead of moons in a nebula, instead of

45
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:21,699
navigating through what's kind of a traditional space setting, you, you, um, uh, yeah I know

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,100
they don't take this naturally, we're robots.

47
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:30,064
So instead of navigating through a space setting, you ride these rivers around the nebula.

48
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:38,789
And we have made our way to an unknown moon way back in the uncharted waters of this place.

49
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,131
We beam down to the planet's surface.

50
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:45,976
There's kind of, me and my robot pal are here looking for our friend.

51
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,838
We have a clue that led us here about this robe.

52
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,882
So, you know, lost civilization, mysteries to explore.

53
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,905
Unfortunately, forward in chat, I will point out,

54
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,147
reading games are often some of the hardest to stream

55
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,571
because I have to read and process information that I need to lose later

56
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,292
and talk to our illustrious guests.

57
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:10,117
So, for now, I am going to work on this gameplay and toss a question out to our guests.

58
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:13,259
Would you please introduce Heaven's Vault from your perspective?

59
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:17,121
I think you've been working on it since shortly after 80 Days wrapped up, right?

60
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:18,782
Yeah, that's right.

61
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:26,966
So, 80 Days shipped in 2014, back when the world was a normal and sane place.

62
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:30,822
And that did quite well for us.

63
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,063
And we thought, let's do something ambitious.

64
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,785
Let's see what we can do that isn't just like 81 days or 240 days.

65
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:41,946
Let's try and do something different and something special.

66
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,087
So we decided to do something graphical.

67
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,948
We decided to try and go to PlayStation, make something for consoles.

68
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,069
And we didn't really know what else we wanted to do.

69
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,810
And then we spent quite a while kind of landing on a concept that really

70
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,711
attracted us and kind of had enough.

71
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:03,043
And I think we ended up with a concept with quite a lot, quite a lot in it actually, in the end.

72
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,784
About four years of work in it.

73
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:13,926
It was supposed to be a sort of ambitious, you know, maybe year and a half project and four years later and, yeah.

74
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:19,587
We're now a studio of eight people, seven people, whereas we were a studio of two.

75
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:25,649
So it's been quite a long and complicating process getting to this point.

76
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:25,929
But.

77
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:29,538
It's done. It's actually done and it works.

78
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,579
And it's out there. People are playing it.

79
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,501
I find this very surprising still because it was...

80
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:35,921
It was quite...

81
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,103
It was a sort of idea that we thought might be possible.

82
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:43,605
And we weren't entirely sure that it was actually going to be

83
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,366
the sort of thing one could actually do.

84
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,707
We thought we were going to get halfway through it and then go,

85
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,748
Nah, this isn't working. We have to stop now.

86
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:50,068
So, yeah.

87
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,709
I know.

88
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:52,129
Yeah.

89
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,908
That's a bit of a surprise. I've got launch day surprise.

90
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:58,829
Yeah, ain't that always how it goes.

91
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,353
Real quick, before we jump in, I want to say now that we have a good quorum going here in chat,

92
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:06,515
if you have any questions for these two, please, by all means, drop them in chat.

93
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,477
Brian and I will relay them and it will be a big help.

94
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:14,241
Because like I said, Brian's got some mysteries to solve, so we need your good, smart questions,

95
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,423
preferably about game development, game design, and this game particularly.

96
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,016
Yeah, I mean this is launch day.

97
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:23,357
I mean, we were talking before the stream, it's late over there, it's about 10pm.

98
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,498
How are you guys feeling so far?

99
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:30,741
Literally just stepped in back into the office after going out for a launch dinner with the

100
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:31,381
whole team.

101
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,122
So that was nice.

102
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:33,942
Where did you go?

103
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,844
We went to a place called Al Kazbah, which is an Algerian restaurant.

104
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:39,184
Nice.

105
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,885
It's very personal.

106
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:41,946
Yeah.

107
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:42,826
It's a brand.

108
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:43,526
Definitely.

109
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,768
There's a location in the game, you can go to the moon where Leo is.

110
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,812
I grew up and there's a bar there run by a bartender

111
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,275
and that bar is modeled on,

112
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,177
I mean it's modeled on places in Morocco really,

113
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:00,540
but like it's modeled on this restaurant down the road

114
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,202
that we went to, as good as anywhere else,

115
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,464
like that's our closest local reference for that.

116
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,846
So I look very cool.

117
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,528
So, I think on brand place to go.

118
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,411
We already have a good question here in chat

119
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,152
and it kind of dovetails with what I want to get into,

120
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:14,472
which is,

121
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:20,409
You know, what's so striking about Heaven's Vault is the look and the spaces that you traverse.

122
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:28,293
This is, as far as I know, the first like really 3D navigatable sort of like game compared to you've ever made,

123
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:33,335
because the earlier games, they were all based on like choosing dialogue options and moving through interactive stories.

124
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,196
And there's a question here from Dainty Rhino who wants to know,

125
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:39,458
what's the purpose of these faded ghosts that appear whenever the character moves?

126
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:44,725
So the whole theme of the game is history and archaeology.

127
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:48,846
So we quite liked the idea that as an archaeologist,

128
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,347
while she's exploring these sites,

129
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:53,528
and maybe she's leaving her own footprint on the sites

130
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,630
as she explores them, because she's changing history herself.

131
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,291
So wherever she stands, whatever she does,

132
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,032
she leaves almost like a memory which fades

133
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:06,894
as she moves away again, as you saw just there.

134
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,835
So it's just to give that sense of history

135
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:14,341
sense of memories and creating a new history herself.

136
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:20,365
It's a funny thing, because we've been through a bunch of different takes on the animation

137
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:26,148
style over the course of the project. We've had a lot of different ideas and we've used a lot of

138
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:31,452
different variants of crossfading frames. And at one point we took those ghosts out completely

139
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:37,216
and we missed them. We just missed them. But the thing felt a little bit throwaway. It felt like

140
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,038
you were just... you know when you have a video game character and they're just...

141
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,768
buzzing around an environment.

142
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,309
They're just running from place to place

143
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,530
and they're just scooping everything up.

144
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,271
And they don't really exist in the world at all.

145
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,752
They're just kind of, like a mouse pointer

146
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:50,793
scrubbing across the screen.

147
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,734
And that's how we interact in 3D spaces,

148
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,335
and it wasn't quite heavy enough.

149
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,396
Like, you're supposed to be in this world.

150
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:02,158
So just that little thing that gets left behind

151
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:03,258
just gives you a note of,

152
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,799
you really were there.

153
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:11,229
and you can't, if you buzz around the level, then it looks like she's doing something crazy, which she is actually.

154
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,532
Every time we took it out, it kind of looked worse, so we kept putting it back in again.

155
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:18,573
Yeah, I mean those bits of feedback can be interesting that way.

156
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:22,516
I think to me, watching Brian play, it sort of resonates with the game's themes,

157
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:27,639
which seem to be this idea that spaces can be so many different things,

158
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,641
and they can be used in so many different ways by different people throughout time,

159
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,461
and people leave...

160
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:37,176
pathways right as they go about their lives and so you're seeing very in a very physical way and in a very like

161
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,136
uh, what seems like a resource

162
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,917
uh a lightweight compared to like, um

163
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:47,078
Something like in god of war where you can like actually see the characters footsteps through the snow and incredibly rich detailed

164
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:54,201
Like very expensive technology. Um, but here you have this like very simple reminder that where she is is like a place

165
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,161
In space as well as time. I think that's really interesting

166
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:58,002
um

167
00:08:58,642 --> 00:08:59,822
Oh man, there's so many good questions here

168
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,863
If you guys have a second clifton b has a question here

169
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,517
that is sort of unrelated, but I think it's fascinating.

170
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,838
How much prep work do you do before you jump into Ink?

171
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,340
And what tools do you use in your process

172
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,480
for, I guess, sort of narrative design

173
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,181
and implementing storylines?

174
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,322
We should clarify for those at home,

175
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,263
Ink is Inkle's game writing tool.

176
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:19,224
I believe it's available for other devs to use

177
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,805
because it's open source?

178
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:21,385
Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,326
It's open source, yeah.

180
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,086
Okay.

181
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,608
The whole point of Ink is that it's incredibly editable.

182
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:31,009
So we do not do any planning.

183
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,811
or prototyping outside of ink.

184
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:35,032
When I, if I want to write a scene,

185
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,053
if I want to write some dialogue,

186
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:37,573
if I want to start getting to know the characters,

187
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:38,574
I just write some ink.

188
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,595
And then as the structure gets more complicated,

189
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,156
you start taking bits of that ink

190
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,416
and maybe putting it somewhere else

191
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,197
or packaging it up in another wrapper

192
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,338
so that it can become part of a scene

193
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,179
rather than just a standalone bit of dialogue.

194
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,080
But you're just throwing scripts around.

195
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,801
So it's actually very, very quick and easy to do.

196
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,762
So all of this stuff has evolved and evolved and evolved

197
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:58,663
from very basic.

198
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:02,269
prototype scripts, the original kind of first third of the game,

199
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,851
but you're just about at the end of the first third here,

200
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,092
the kind of opening plot section.

201
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:10,456
And that was originally knocked out as a script in ink in one afternoon.

202
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,318
Like these are the basic beats that they will go through during that tutorial

203
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:13,578
section.

204
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:18,101
And that's just evolved into plates to become this 3d world within

205
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:22,705
environmental conversations and all the kinds of things that you do within that

206
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,987
world's sort of step-by-step-by-step.

207
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:25,487
So.

208
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:30,058
Yeah, I get quite dogmatic about this. We don't do any kind of planning.

209
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:33,159
We do things when we need to do it.

210
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,580
So if I need to work out the flow of a scene, I'll get a piece of paper and a pen,

211
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,681
and I'll draw a flowchart to help my brain work.

212
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,322
But we don't do any formalized process.

213
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:47,043
We don't have any kind of spreadsheet construction process or anything.

214
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,864
It tends to be whatever the level needs.

215
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:56,684
I think a nice thing about Ink is the way it kind of adapts to what your needs are.

216
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:02,786
So if some people like to really plan in advance and create flowcharts for absolutely everything,

217
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:09,049
then they can, and then they can fill in the boxes in terms of writing little snippets.

218
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,610
We try to make tools that kind of fit your own workflow, basically.

219
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,997
writing workflow is super ad hoc.

220
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:18,557
I mean, that's...

221
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,280
that's really familiar.

222
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,423
So, I mean, bearing that in mind, like,

223
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,765
how did you approach the

224
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,048
sort of conception and narrative

225
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,070
design of this game as a whole? You know, like, what was

226
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,052
your... like, because I'm fascinated as I

227
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,994
watch Brian play and as I look forward to playing

228
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:35,456
myself, like, this seems...

229
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,905
It's very difficult to construct.

230
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:43,927
It's a bunch of interlocking puzzles and interesting conversations and choices.

231
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,168
How did you go about structuring it from the beginning?

232
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:49,689
Was it really just you just started going and then kind of made it as you went along?

233
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:54,850
Or did you have a formal structure for how you create these narratives and branch them?

234
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,011
The goal of what we wanted to repeat

235
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,812
kind of had a clear image of that.

236
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:08,472
We changed the way that you walk around, but basically you can walk around and...

237
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:11,354
John, could you lean forward and start that answer again?

238
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,515
You suddenly lost it. You got really quiet.

239
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,096
I just turned my volume way up.

240
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:17,358
Yes, so...

241
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,841
I think when we started the project we had a very clear sense of

242
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:23,603
what the player would be doing in the world.

243
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,764
They would be walking around and interacting with things,

244
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:29,107
and then talking about things as they interacted with them,

245
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,648
and then as you walked to the next place you would be walking as you...

246
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,055
Sorry, talking as you walk from point to point.

247
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:36,416
That was kind of our core loop idea,

248
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,737
was walk and talks and interaction plots.

249
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:42,079
And then actually working out how to author that in Ink

250
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,460
was about a year's worth of work.

251
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,782
Because finding a pattern which allowed you to author it

252
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,463
flexibly enough that you didn't have to,

253
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,504
that you could do whatever you needed to do,

254
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,865
but that wasn't so complicated that you had to

255
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,586
constantly look up how to do it,

256
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,006
or break it the whole time.

257
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,147
Finding a right sort of balance.

258
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,849
for scripting it, that was a really long and difficult iterative process.

259
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,492
So I think we kind of had initial scripts within a couple of months, I guess,

260
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,233
that did do that.

261
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:17,076
They did the walking around and the talking, but they were a real pain to author.

262
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:18,176
They were too fiddly.

263
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:20,438
They were very, very fragile.

264
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:25,140
And over the course of the project, we slowly worked out

265
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:29,423
things that we were doing a lot of that we could extract into other ways.

266
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:29,603
So.

267
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,848
For example, the way the conversation in the game works.

268
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:38,270
Originally, conversations were tied specifically to rooms and things we were looking at,

269
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,791
because that's the easiest thing to do, right?

270
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,192
You go to somewhere and you have a conversation about it.

271
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:46,715
And what we have now is a system where they're walking around in an environment

272
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:51,518
that the game is feeding conversation options in from a bank of conversation that it has all the time,

273
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:55,740
which is triggered by the knowledge model that it's tracking in the game.

274
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,341
So what you know and what you don't know.

275
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:01,026
says well these conversations are relevant, these ones aren't, and all of that is sculpted in ink.

276
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,246
All of that is crafted in ink.

277
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:07,187
And yeah, it took a long time to build that structure and make it work.

278
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,808
I can't remember what the question was now.

279
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,391
It was a really complicated engine to build, but I think what we started with

280
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,912
was a very clear idea that it ought to be possible to build this thing this way.

281
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,553
We just had to find a pattern that allowed...

282
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:31,358
the author, the human being writing it, not to get totally baffled by what they were doing.

283
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,579
That's the major limiting factor.

284
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:40,820
Right to the bottom level, because I mean right from the very early prototypes we had

285
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:47,242
this idea that we could use the same text engine to basically not just produce prose

286
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:50,382
as we did on 80 Days, but produce line by line.

287
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:54,069
lines are basically an interactive film script.

288
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,071
So each line is either a scene direction like

289
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,293
show this camera shot, play this sound,

290
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:04,255
play this kind of sequence or it's actual lines of dialogue.

291
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,618
And then the engine takes these line by line

292
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:10,920
and presents them in a visual way.

293
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,182
And that never changed.

294
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,963
We changed the high level structure quite a lot

295
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,664
in order to fit the

296
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:26,097
the continually evolving game design, but that general approach stayed consistent throughout

297
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:32,301
even from right at the beginning when it was basically, it was almost a 2D game with like

298
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:40,167
static comic book panels where you made dialogue choices in a kind of static 2D comic book

299
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,089
panel and then it went from panel to panel.

300
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,593
But fundamentally, you know, John was writing in the same way then as...

301
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:54,660
he did towards the end, it's just that the whole game has changed in between.

302
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,702
I guess when we're making this stuff we have a really, we have an ongoing discussion the

303
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:03,963
whole time of what's in the game and what's in the ink, and we see those as two quite

304
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:04,644
separate themes.

305
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:09,586
So the ink is, should be in control of all the narrative stuff and all the presentation

306
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:13,187
stuff and all the sequencing stuff and all the stuff that wants to be flexible depending

307
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,808
on what the player might or might not have done.

308
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:22,247
stuff that lets you, so that when you get to the end of the project you can redraft it,

309
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:25,769
so that when you get to the end of the project you can make this particular line of dialogue not

310
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,551
actually appear under that specific circumstance because that's the sort of thing that Ink's really

311
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:35,996
good at. And then the game side has to cover all the things which are systemic, which we don't want

312
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:41,379
to have to bother authoring specifically every time. So like when you're talking to another

313
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:46,823
human being it drops into a two-shot which sort of goes over the shoulder between each character.

314
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,535
And that's within the game code because you don't want the ink to have to worry about that.

315
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:52,976
The ink doesn't even want to have to tell the game that that's happening.

316
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,438
The game just goes, oh, two human beings are talking to each other.

317
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:56,818
Time for a two-shot.

318
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:00,200
Which is kind of exciting because you can just write a load of dialogue.

319
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:02,503
without any scene instructions at all,

320
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,703
and it will present it in an interesting way in the engine,

321
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,884
which is kind of a magical process.

322
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:11,384
What's really great about that is then I can take a dialogue sequence

323
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,925
which was written for one location

324
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,225
and pick it up and stick it in another location,

325
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,745
and it will just work.

326
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:20,626
And plenty of times in the game where you can have the same conversation

327
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:23,647
with the same character in five, six different places in the world,

328
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,127
just depending on how you happen to meet them,

329
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,928
it doesn't really matter from our point of view at all.

330
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:31,543
Yeah, that's super interesting.

331
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,525
That's so cool.

332
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:34,185
That's magic.

333
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,126
That sounds like magic.

334
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:35,986
I'm sorry.

335
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:40,469
The idea that you can write a scene and then have the engine sort of programmatically figure

336
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:46,533
out the shot, reverse shot of it, and then not worry about, like, from a direction perspective,

337
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:47,713
that's so cool.

338
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:49,174
Yeah.

339
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,316
Well, it's incredibly liberating as well.

340
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:54,257
And, like, obviously games like The Witcher do this.

341
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,979
You know, games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey do this.

342
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,080
They have programmatic two shots.

343
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:05,965
they use to cover or like programmatic anims that are kind of brought in just to keep scenes

344
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,865
alive when they haven't authored something specific to override it.

345
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:12,326
And ideally you never notice that they're doing that, but I'm absolutely sure that they

346
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,006
are doing that.

347
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:19,327
We have the advantage of not having, because we don't have voice acting, we don't have

348
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:25,229
continuous animation, we can cut between procedural stuff and scripted stuff incredibly fluidly

349
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,749
without it being particularly noticeable.

350
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:29,750
So we can really push that.

351
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,859
It's a quite absurd extremes.

352
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,280
So you can have the same...

353
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,764
Yeah, you can have the same conversations with the same people in wildly different contexts.

354
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:41,165
And the game...

355
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,888
I'm curious, and before we move on to Greg,

356
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:48,650
did this game's design and development influence the design and development of Ink?

357
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:54,415
And if so, how has the language changed as a result of your work on Heaven's Vault?

358
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:02,769
It's kind of stayed remarkably static. We've developed it over time, but most of the major advances that we made in ink

359
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,650
happened at the very start of this project. It's been like one or two extra features that we've added.

360
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:08,371
Yeah.

361
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:14,452
It's worth noting that a lot of the design of Heaven's Vault comes from the design of Sorcery,

362
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,752
despite the fact that they're very, very different games.

363
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:23,054
A lot of what we're doing in Heaven's Vault is just taking something we prototyped in Sorcery and pushing it really, really far.

364
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:26,235
So, of course, we had basic knowledge modeling and...

365
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,657
scenes dropped in contextually if they happen to be relevant right now.

366
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:32,979
Heaven's Vault evolved entirely after that.

367
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:37,244
It's obviously used in specific places, but there were a few features like...

368
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:38,265
Lists.

369
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:39,246
Lists, yeah.

370
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:46,074
Ink has a data structure called a list, which I think when you first pitched it I had no

371
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,776
idea how powerful it was going to be.

372
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,651
And you were like, well, it's sort of this and it's sort of that.

373
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,891
And it sort of does both of those.

374
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,192
And I was like, we don't need that.

375
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:54,772
And you were like, yeah, but we can do it.

376
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,993
And now, like, I build everything out of this thing.

377
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,835
Programming speakers, basically they're enums or flags.

378
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,256
But they're so much more powerful than that.

379
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:10,077
They're kind of also a bit like mathematical sets.

380
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,998
And the way we use it is for state tracking.

381
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,959
So whether it's your inventory or...

382
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:23,447
all of the things that you know about or whatever, and we just track kind of pools of these facts,

383
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:29,848
essentially. Chris Remo did a talk at GDC this year about the fact system that they had in

384
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,129
Firewatch. I only caught the second half of it, I need to catch up on the Vault, but

385
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,410
I was going to entertain listening to it because we have a fact tracking system in

386
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,011
Heaven's Vault which has something like three and a half thousand facts.

387
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:43,929
And every single line in the game is sort of saying,

388
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,770
do you know these facts, but you don't know these facts,

389
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,190
in which case this line is appropriate.

390
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,271
This is how the whole system works.

391
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,111
Oh, yeah.

392
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,452
That's a lot.

393
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,813
It's fine, actually.

394
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,914
It's very, very manageable,

395
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:56,994
because they're all contextual.

396
00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:02,017
So you just look up ones that are relevant.

397
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:02,697
Yeah.

398
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:04,778
Definitely was a feature that we were building

399
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,338
originally using quite a hacky system,

400
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,479
kind of got wrapped into the language.

401
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:16,540
I don't know if we all remember, it's been a journey, but this question started sort of

402
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,324
out of a question about how you, how you sort of create the, how you, your process for writing

403
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,304
the narrative of this game.

404
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:26,647
Before we move on, I want to get the last part of CliftonB's question, because it was

405
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,267
kind of interesting.

406
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:31,950
They wanted to know, basically like they always have their narrative super solid before they

407
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,091
start implementing.

408
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:37,173
And they want to know, like, do you ever realize things you've missed after you've started

409
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,554
implementing a storyline in your editor?

410
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,127
How does that shape your game design?

411
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,367
Whether it's a game like this or a game like 80 Days,

412
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:49,090
like, how do you figure out what to incorporate in a game

413
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,811
even when you're, say, six months from ship

414
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:53,932
and you've already got most of the narrative written down?

415
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:54,492
Like...

416
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,854
Yeah, so the thing that the whole...

417
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,634
So this business of building a structure

418
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,296
where we write the ink and the game code processes it

419
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:04,736
was very difficult,

420
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:08,878
but the payoff for that is two weeks before we ship.

421
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:12,005
I was playing through the game and I found a scene that I didn't like.

422
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:13,186
I just didn't like it at all.

423
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:14,386
The dialogue was rubbish.

424
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:18,267
So I took half a day and I rewrote it entirely.

425
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,768
Every single line of it was changed.

426
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:22,809
The entire flow of that scene was changed.

427
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:28,571
And I just took the file, rewrote it, tested it, swapped it out, and then it was in the

428
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:29,772
game changed.

429
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,013
Like, we were already in beta testing at this point.

430
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:36,915
Like, we already, I think, had sent a code off of PlayStation's FQA process, you know.

431
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:37,515
Dangerous.

432
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:38,935
I didn't really like it.

433
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:44,571
in the process, but it isn't dangerous because actually it's very easy to test a scene in

434
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,853
isolation in ink and make sure that you're really very happy with it.

435
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:51,176
And actually there's no cost to it.

436
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,838
I don't need to talk to anyone else.

437
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:56,360
I don't need to talk to the environment people or the character people or the animation people

438
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,061
or anyone else.

439
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:00,964
Like, I can just go off and do that on my own and come back with it and say, yep, that's

440
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:01,244
better.

441
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,127
And we constantly do that.

442
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:07,850
So I think if Heaven's Vault has a good

443
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:13,249
story or it has good characters or have good moments. It's not because we planned things

444
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:17,532
cleverly in advance, it's because we planned something that was okay and we've got a really

445
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:23,556
good system for trading up. So every scene in this game has been traded up to make it stronger or

446
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:28,319
tighter or better. All the bits that we didn't need we cut and all the bits that could be

447
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:33,042
stronger we developed. And the freedom to do that as a writer...

448
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:37,856
Like film writers, script writers on films do this all the time.

449
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,739
They are constantly rewriting screenplays on the day of shooting.

450
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,720
That's normal in the film industry.

451
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,243
In the games industry, you're supposed to lock your script six months in advance

452
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:48,945
and still be happy with it by the time you ship.

453
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,286
And that's a hell of an art.

454
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:57,752
And yeah, breaking that assumption definitely comes with some compromises

455
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:02,475
in terms of the fidelity of what we can achieve, but the payoff in terms of the...

456
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:07,173
We're massively taking advantage of the fact that we're not fully voiced, we're not fully

457
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:07,593
animated.

458
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,393
So we're kind of...

459
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:33,744
we're able to pour all of our energy into refining the core storytelling.

460
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,549
It's a funny thing though, because people looking at it sometimes say,

461
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,532
oh well it would have been nice if it would be fully voiced.

462
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:41,795
But you go, you know what, actually, if it had been fully voiced,

463
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,519
it would have been a significantly worse script.

464
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:50,267
I also want to chime in on what fully voiced can mean for developers.

465
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:55,432
Or from the player's side, fully voiced often means like I'm often sitting, I can't read

466
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,575
the conversation at my own pace, I have to read it at the actor's pace.

467
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:06,524
And often there's some very, very great, you know, performances in there.

468
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:13,687
That like, I forget what I was playing. Oh yeah, it was Horizon Zero Dawn I was playing the other day and I was like resisting the urge to just keep

469
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:20,870
uh, to just keep um, skipping past cutscenes because I wanted to, you know, hear the drama of it, but

470
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,011
that's another thing that I don't think, I don't think, I don't hear it said aloud a lot, but like.

471
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:31,293
Yeah, we're always talking about this and um, I think you know there are solutions,

472
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:34,615
but the solutions are in the core game design. I kind of see that.

473
00:25:35,103 --> 00:25:39,645
Like the voice that you have to listen to occupies a small part of your brain,

474
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,706
but then the rest of your brain is left unoccupied.

475
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:48,208
And if you can fill it with other related gameplay, like, you know,

476
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:52,129
Firewatch and games in that kind of genre, you know,

477
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:58,291
it works because you're able to explore while communicating and listening to the dialogue.

478
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:01,933
If you only had to just sit and listen to the dialogue and do nothing else,

479
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,633
it wouldn't be as playable.

480
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:11,934
And so yeah, you could do a fully voiced Heaven's Vault, that kind of style of game, but you'd have to find ways of

481
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:16,215
occupying the rest of the player's brain while the dialogue is going on.

482
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:25,078
I mean, I think there's a... I don't know that I even agree with that entirely. I think there's a question of scope as well.

483
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:29,540
Like, the amount of information you can communicate in text that you read in your head

484
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,281
is just a lot higher than the amount you can communicate when you're doing...

485
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:39,237
voice acted stuff and it depends on what kind of story you want to tell and what you want

486
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:39,878
to talk about.

487
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:46,161
But like, delivering exposition through spoken dialogue is one of the worst things in the

488
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:46,701
world.

489
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:53,064
Like, films try to avoid it as much as possible because it's just deathly dull.

490
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:58,667
You can do it in prose much more effortlessly because people just read it and they grok

491
00:26:58,727 --> 00:26:59,307
it and it's gone.

492
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,596
and if you understand your medium, you can take advantage of that and you can do things with it.

493
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:10,364
And yeah, this idea that we should just be making the flashiest version of everything

494
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:16,111
so that didn't impact the content that you can deliver seems to me to be a bit wrong-headed.

495
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,254
That's the thing. As a writer, I'm very happy.

496
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:40,489
Their question is,

497
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:43,432
Have you met or contacted Jordan Mechner during the development process,

498
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:46,354
considering this has a Last Express vibes?

499
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:49,456
I haven't played Last Express myself, so I can't testify to that.

500
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,958
I wanted to ask you about the setting in general,

501
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:55,241
because there's a few key things beyond just sort of the

502
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,005
Asian, Middle East, Southeast Asian kind of vibe of the game.

503
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:00,625
It's also...

504
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:05,808
This very strange intertwining of a mystical and scientific world,

505
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:08,730
because you have robots that are dug up from the ground,

506
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,951
you have a nebula where people sail in it like the river.

507
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:14,474
This is cool. This is really cool.

508
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:18,096
And while I think it would be nice to hear if you did talk to Mr. Mechner,

509
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:24,160
I just want to know more about making this setting in a world where game developers

510
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,661
I feel like have to fight for interesting settings with every game,

511
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,223
or they risk feeling like a knockoff of some other game that's already existed.

512
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:34,949
So no, we've never spoken to Jordan Mechner.

513
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,772
But The Last Express is my favorite game of all time.

514
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,775
It's just an astonishingly good piece of writing.

515
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:45,617
And wonderful, wonderful concept.

516
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:53,523
It's funny how it's almost like luck that we ended up being similar to Last Express.

517
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,645
I know it's your favorite game.

518
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:58,227
In terms of the structure, I'm sure you took influence.

519
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,729
But in terms of the art style, it takes a lot of...

520
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:04,588
Well you could say it takes influence, we came from a totally different direction.

521
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:08,672
I think I remember a point when we were talking about this, and we tried this, and we tried

522
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:11,595
that, and we tried the other, and you were like, oh bloody hell, let's just do the last

523
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,216
experiment.

524
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:16,780
We ended up with this almost rotoscoped look.

525
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:22,045
So the setting, if you want to dive into how you cooked up the setting.

526
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:23,867
Yeah, the setting was...

527
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:30,998
hard actually. And when we started, we'd always worked on other IPs previously, so obviously

528
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:37,159
80 Days is an adaptation of an IP, and Sorcery is too, and Joe was very keen on making our

529
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:41,060
own IP, and I really didn't want to, because I knew it would be difficult.

530
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,461
Turns out it's a lot of work.

531
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:51,063
Yeah, turns out it's a lot of work. But I think the... it was a really long and torturous

532
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,403
process. I think we started with a few things that we were sure of.

533
00:29:55,032 --> 00:30:01,275
So we wanted the nebula, the rivers in space was a core idea that we started with, which

534
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:04,016
came from kind of landscapes that you were interested in visually.

535
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:08,599
Yeah, because we're just thinking that like usually when space is represented in games

536
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:16,223
it's kind of like this black void of emptiness and like hard steel, hard sci-fi, and we loved

537
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:19,824
that idea that you could create a version of space which is more like one of these

538
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:21,385
beautiful nebulas that you see.

539
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:28,425
see the Hubble telescope, it's beautiful, colorful, rich, and dense.

540
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:33,447
As you said, more like natural landscape of rivers and mountains where the mountains are

541
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,168
like big cloud banks.

542
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:43,331
Yeah and that coupled into an image that comes from Egyptian mythology of the gods sailing

543
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:49,214
barges through the rivers of stars, which is how they describe the way that Ra travels

544
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:50,314
across the sky.

545
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:55,866
That felt like a cool association to play with, but not necessarily a concrete piece of world building.

546
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,128
It didn't really help very much.

547
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:05,953
I think there was about maybe even a year where I would just wake up in the morning, try to do some writing,

548
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:07,854
and think, why are there rivers in space?

549
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,736
Why are there rivers in space?

550
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:12,238
And I would ask people in the office, why are there rivers in space?

551
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:13,679
They would say, oh, it doesn't matter.

552
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm like, no, I really think we need to know this.

553
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:21,064
And then at some point, I had an idea for why...

554
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,656
there are rivers in space, which I'm not going to share because it's a huge spoiler.

555
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:28,937
But from that, everything else followed.

556
00:31:29,057 --> 00:31:34,519
And then most of the rest of the building, of the setting, was trying to stick to a couple

557
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,779
of basic ground rules.

558
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:41,801
So I was hugely inspired by the work of Ursula Le Guin and Jean-Wulf Dye.

559
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:44,101
Rest in peace, Mr. Wulf, because I think you just passed yesterday.

560
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:44,862
Yeah.

561
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,162
Wonderful writer.

562
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:46,462
But they both...

563
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:49,603
Le Guin's stuff is incredibly empathetic.

564
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:49,863
Yeah.

565
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:50,183
Thank you.

566
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:50,563
Thank you.

567
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:50,943
Thank you.

568
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:56,952
and I love that, and very based around humans and what humans do and how they shape things.

569
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:01,036
And Wolf's stuff is not particularly empathetic, but one thing that he does very well

570
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:07,702
is that he tends to have one core magic in his world that then manifests in multiple ways

571
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:13,087
that the people in the world don't realize are the same thing, which is a really neat trick for

572
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:16,671
building a sci-fi setting because it makes everything feel connected even though everything

573
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:17,512
is also disparate.

574
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,831
So you get a sense of wonder, but a sense that it all comes from the same,

575
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:22,511
it somehow was cut from the same cloth.

576
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:22,992
Hmm.

577
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,933
It bridges the line between magic and science in a way.

578
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:27,374
Yeah, exactly.

579
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:29,255
Because the problem with magic is that it's arbitrary.

580
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:31,556
The problem with your kind of Harry Potter is,

581
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:34,357
well, next week Harry Potter might get a spell to do something else

582
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,738
completely random that you didn't know existed in this world.

583
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,580
And like, well, why doesn't Dumbledore just ask to win the game spell

584
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,460
and then everything's fine?

585
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,301
Um, and that's a problem.

586
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:47,934
If you want to kind of make your world compelling, especially if the player doesn't understand it and explore it

587
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:55,997
But if you if you lay out the like lots of technological rules in the way that Star Trek does you end up with this

588
00:32:56,057 --> 00:33:02,840
Incredibly complicated world. It's very inaccessible for people coming into it new. So ideally what we have is two rules

589
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,541
with interesting consequences and

590
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:11,023
So we try to do that. We try to make our world set up in a way that

591
00:33:13,803 --> 00:33:14,684
that would follow.

592
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:21,530
Everything in the world comes from these two technological ideas that we had, which kind

593
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,013
of come out in lots of different interesting ways, and then that led us to natural places

594
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:27,395
in the narrative, and then you think, well, how can I express this narrative?

595
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:31,779
And it all kind of twists around itself, and you bring in things which are interesting,

596
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:36,042
and you cut them to the charm, and there was lots of research that kind of inspired various

597
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:40,706
themes and moments in the game, and then you have to work out why they make sense.

598
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:43,206
It was horrendous actually, it was really hard.

599
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:49,810
Of course, you don't just have to build a world in the present, you have to create 5,000 years of history.

600
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:54,833
I resisted that for so long! For so long I was like, it'll be fine, we'll just make stuff up, it won't matter.

601
00:33:55,113 --> 00:34:01,597
And then I realised that I couldn't do it. I genuinely needed to know what happened in 3,500 years in order to write this location.

602
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,680
The signals are on the back wall there.

603
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,300
I am too.

604
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,762
Luckily, that's a very tiny... they're very tiny on that screen there.

605
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:17,505
Feel free to enhance our 720p broadcast to try and pick out a few pixels in the lower left-hand corner with our moderately okay encoding.

606
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:22,767
It's probably easier to just play the game, isn't it?

607
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:23,967
Yeah, it's...

608
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,908
It was a really long and...

609
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,850
difficult process. And I think one thing we've had,

610
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,514
we've seen a lot of reviews today and one thing that's been common across the reviews is people saying, you know,

611
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:38,077
they really like this world. It feels like a really fleshed out real world and that's

612
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,540
incredibly good to hear because it was really hard work.

613
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:44,103
But I think the thing that makes it hang together is just

614
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:51,850
we have tried to shade it back at all times and make sure that it does really genuinely make sense with itself. So

615
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,312
there's a lot of places where

616
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:57,955
in the game, there's like symbology that just works.

617
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,355
So at the beginning of the game,

618
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,736
you're introduced to this symbol called the Eagle and Sun,

619
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:03,617
which is the symbol of the empire

620
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:05,258
that was around in this nebula

621
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:08,859
before a cataclysm happened and it was destroyed.

622
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,081
And one of the questions that the game

623
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:14,622
never explicitly asks is what the hell is an eagle

624
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:17,423
and what the hell is a sun to the people in this nebula?

625
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,584
But I see answers to these questions

626
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,425
and they're in there and they make sense.

627
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,326
And like the fact that that tracks.

628
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,752
is not an accident, but it does make the world feel robust, even if no one ever talks about it.

629
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,553
Um, yeah.

630
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:37,515
Uh, John, I have a question as someone who's, I've done some work, you know, I've, I know that the

631
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:40,256
how the process of writing different kinds of games can go what?

632
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:48,170
It is very easy to fall down the trap of building out loads and loads of beautiful lore and knowledge and information about your game.

633
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:53,995
You are all lucky in that you have a game that wants to use that lore and knowledge,

634
00:35:54,615 --> 00:36:01,281
but how, when you only have so much time to make a game that needs to pay for your meal, your family's meal, how do you...

635
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,423
properly categorize...

636
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:07,326
You can make an argument that, you know, all the writing work you do, even if it gets cut, is worth it,

637
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,268
because it helps you do something else, but

638
00:36:09,588 --> 00:36:12,931
how do you make sure you're not, like, falling down a rabbit hole when you're in a space like that?

639
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:14,913
So, um...

640
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:19,036
I think it's actually the same as designing

641
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,939
interactive fiction in general,

642
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,681
possibly the same as designing games in general.

643
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,965
That you have to think as a player, and then you also have to think as a creator.

644
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:29,725
So you have to think...

645
00:36:30,261 --> 00:36:32,142
as a writer and you also have to think as a reader.

646
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,866
So as a writer I say, well I've got my lore and I've got all these things that I'm interested in and they're all really cool.

647
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:41,049
But as a reader, I don't give a damn about your lore at all.

648
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,051
What I want is the characters, the adventures, the motivation, the mystery.

649
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,432
I want to know what's happening next.

650
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:49,414
And if your lore isn't relevant to that, I don't care about it.

651
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:50,995
And I shouldn't care about it.

652
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,198
And there will be readers who do, but they're not the important ones.

653
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,281
The important reader is the reader who just wants to be told a good story and then go home.

654
00:36:59,121 --> 00:36:59,582
And the important...

655
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:05,158
player of your game, one who just wants to have fun. That's all they want to do. They just want to have something to do.

656
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,881
And by... you have to split between those two viewpoints all the time. Like, it's no good to go

657
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:16,003
away and write out a great big lore book and then be really proud of yourself because you've basically...

658
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:21,446
you've just entertained an audience of one and that's it. Like, you haven't done anything.

659
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:27,589
You've got to think about the performance the whole time. So I try to write as little lore as possible

660
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:29,110
all the time.

661
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:35,098
but be thinking about the way that scenes will play or what will actually happen in the game.

662
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,799
And then when I realize I don't know something, then I go back to the lore and I kind of

663
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,239
construct the lore that makes sense within that. And then I go back to the gameplay.

664
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:47,480
And flip-flopping between those two, you eventually reach a point where both are satisfied.

665
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,082
I think that's true of all of our designs, you know, like if we're designing the translation

666
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:57,582
game, we're thinking about, well, how does this work as a language, but how does this work as

667
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:59,043
a thing the player can solve?

668
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:04,388
And both of those things are fighting, and you're trying to find the tension, the balance between the two.

669
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:13,331
Because if you go too far one way, you end up with something incomprehensible, and you go too far the other way, you end up with something that's just trivial, and neither of those are interesting.

670
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:17,173
So I think that's the whole job.

671
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,714
Like, that's the whole job.

672
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,455
It's not... anyone can have ideas.

673
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:26,137
Like, really, actually, anyone can have ideas, and it's...

674
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,742
A question is how do you make ideas that you can play out in an interesting way?

675
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:35,423
Is that what we're doing?

676
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:37,624
That's what all of us are doing all of the time.

677
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:39,445
Yeah, no joke.

678
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:43,526
Before we move on, there's a question that dovetails very well with this, which is from

679
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:43,987
StatueSat.

680
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:48,708
They want to know how much background research on archaeology, history, etc. did you do

681
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:49,789
to help build these worlds?

682
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:53,050
That's a long look.

683
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:04,717
I don't know, I mean, you start with research, but you start with research that inspires you.

684
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:10,700
I'm not very good at researching for research's sake. I tend to like drop in and out of stuff.

685
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,483
So my starting point on this project was a 1960s book of archaeological,

686
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:21,846
of schlock archaeology called Citadels of Mystery, which goes through 12 archaeological sites and

687
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:24,248
comes up with some crazy theories about what they might be.

688
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:31,130
So it's like Machu Picchu was a test village in the mountains and it was built purely to

689
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,152
see if people could survive up there and they didn't.

690
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:37,535
This is not a very plausible theory but this is the theory in this book and it's brilliant

691
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:41,098
because it takes real archaeological evidence and it plays with it and it has fun and that

692
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:45,582
inspired me a lot and it's a superb book and I hugely enjoyed it and that was one of my

693
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:46,542
primary researches.

694
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:47,823
But to say that...

695
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,903
I just read this one book and wrote the game is also not true.

696
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:56,128
Like I know a ton of archaeologists. My dad is an anthropologist. I've met them all my life.

697
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:04,595
Yeah, like it when you end up bringing together a lot of sources that you didn't deliberately look

698
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:13,122
for because we chose to write this game for a reason, you know. And I think that goes

699
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:16,105
across the team as well. Like Tom used to talk a lot about religion.

700
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:20,071
Like that was something he was really interested in bringing to a sci-fi context and that's

701
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,552
definitely fed through into the game.

702
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:25,133
Right on.

703
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:28,395
There are more questions in the chat that are very, very good, but I have one that I

704
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:30,396
wanted to ask since the start, so I'm just going to throw it out there.

705
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:34,899
How tricky was it to put this into a 3D context?

706
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:38,861
This is your first 3D navigatable game.

707
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:41,662
Tell me a bit about how that went for you because it must have been...

708
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:48,657
tricky at best. Like, what engine and tools did you use to build these 3D worlds and like how did

709
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:54,319
you end up deciding how to build them as these kind of quasi-3D storybook spaces that they came

710
00:40:54,379 --> 00:41:04,842
out as? So we built it in Unity and we basically started from the point of, as I said earlier,

711
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:11,163
we wanted to make a 2D comic book essentially, but a dynamic interactive comic book.

712
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:17,620
and what that would mean. And part of the reason we wanted to do that is because we loved

713
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,505
2D character illustration because 2D character illustration can be really expressive.

714
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:31,212
So we wanted to draw our characters from lots of different angles so that we could dynamically

715
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:37,557
compose these panels and we constructed our environments in 3D. They were initially

716
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:40,391
a lot simpler than the environment's theatre,

717
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,933
because we wanted to create the sense of a background

718
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:47,637
rather than construct entire worlds in 3D.

719
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:49,179
But as we created this,

720
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:52,041
and we created the main protagonist, Aaliyah,

721
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:57,486
and we drew her from 12 different angles, her core pose,

722
00:41:57,706 --> 00:41:59,848
we just loved the overall effect

723
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,550
of moving the camera around in 3D,

724
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,971
because we created a...

725
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:09,951
a system that basically has a database of character frames and depending on the camera's

726
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:15,355
angle and certain tags that's been applied to her character, like whether she's in a

727
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:22,960
particular walk or a talk or some emotion, then it would pick a different overall body

728
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,264
frame and also paste a different facial expression over the top so we could get all of these

729
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:28,984
different effects.

730
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,867
And then yeah, the 3D basically...

731
00:42:33,573 --> 00:42:37,874
came out of that as we were experimenting with what you could do.

732
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:43,716
Because we wanted it to initially just be 2D comic book panels,

733
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:49,637
but then seeing the effect of all of that happening in 3D,

734
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,858
we just thought it looked really cool.

735
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:56,279
Interesting. I imagine...

736
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:59,200
Did that change the way you did your sort of...

737
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,220
how you structured the pace and flow of the game?

738
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:07,131
How much of what you might call level design went into this game, and how did the decision

739
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,953
to go full 3D change the way you structured it, if at all?

740
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:20,680
I think it massively changed things, because as soon as you go full 3D, you get the ability

741
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:27,005
to poke around in all of the little tiny corners of the level, just like any other 3D game.

742
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:31,648
You've been through an evolution to get to that point, because at the beginning...

743
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:36,038
We had a very limited amount of interactivity,

744
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:39,719
in that it was kind of a visual choice-based narrative.

745
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:42,420
So the narrative was really driving it.

746
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,900
There was not so much exploration at all.

747
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,341
You could only interact with whatever it gave you choices for.

748
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:52,802
But as we opened it up,

749
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:54,882
like we were talking for a while

750
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:56,483
about having 3D environments,

751
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,643
but maybe you have a completely fixed camera angle,

752
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:01,684
a bit like a point-and-click adventure,

753
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:08,266
...from that particular camera perspective, you could poke around these corners...

754
00:44:08,306 --> 00:44:09,868
...but it weren't fully interactive.

755
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:12,510
As soon as you can swing the camera all the way around...

756
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:17,235
...there is so much more scope for where you can go...

757
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:21,178
...what you should be able to interact with because it's right there.

758
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,721
That had an impact, right down into that!

759
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,072
script because then suddenly your branching narrative script needs to be able to cope

760
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:31,333
with the player who walks over to one side of the room and does one thing, walks over

761
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:33,874
to the other side of the room and does another thing, then walks back to the first side of

762
00:44:33,894 --> 00:44:37,595
the room again, which is not a branching tree structure even slightly.

763
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,215
It's something completely different.

764
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:47,138
Because in sorcery, like when we have waypoints on the mini-maps, we can easily just say,

765
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,759
we don't want you to go back in that room, so we'll just remove the choice to go back

766
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,740
into that room.

767
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,040
And we can directly.

768
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:55,893
push the player in different directions.

769
00:44:56,153 --> 00:45:00,034
Like, depending on how open or friendly we want it to be,

770
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:03,334
we can enable and disable choices to go in different directions,

771
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,735
but we're always in control.

772
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:08,315
Yeah, I mean, we do do that in Heaven's Lock.

773
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:11,596
We will quietly turn a door off over here if you're way over there,

774
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,316
but hopefully in a way that you never ever notice,

775
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,157
but you lose a lot of that focus.

776
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:20,678
So I think that you asked about level design,

777
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:21,558
and I think that's a really good point.

778
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:24,675
One of the things that really took me by surprise on the project was

779
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,157
there was a point when I realised we actually needed to do level design

780
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:30,938
and we needed to know what we were talking about with level design

781
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,240
which we hadn't originally intended to be a thing that we needed to know.

782
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:37,922
We were really lucky when we hired Laura Dilloway

783
00:45:37,962 --> 00:45:39,443
who's our lead environment artist.

784
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:43,325
We've done some level design on LittleBigPlanetPSP amongst other titles

785
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:47,708
and she was working at PlayStation at the same time as Walt.

786
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:52,600
And so we ended up in a process where I would kind of write a scene and say,

787
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,081
this is what I think the characters are doing in this scene.

788
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:58,823
And this is roughly what I think the geometry needs to be like to make that work.

789
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:02,745
And then she'd take it and turn that into more of a level design space,

790
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:05,587
a space with better vistas and better lines of sight and things.

791
00:46:05,647 --> 00:46:09,509
And then I would take it back and say, well, I think we need to put more time in here.

792
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,831
This bit's too quick, this bit's too slow, let's move around, that's too long.

793
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:17,474
And between us, we could kind of thresh out a 3D space in a way that the narrative was happy,

794
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,163
the 3D design of it was happy too.

795
00:46:20,323 --> 00:46:23,265
And actually, that process was brilliant.

796
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:25,567
And I think one of the things that was really nice about it

797
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,448
is that being a team of seven people,

798
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:30,250
like, we just sat either side of a table,

799
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,291
so the iteration time was incredibly fast.

800
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,193
So we were just bashing geometry around between us

801
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:37,435
and coming up with these spaces

802
00:46:37,535 --> 00:46:39,516
that kind of flowed in really interesting ways.

803
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:43,258
I think that, yeah, that's...

804
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:47,134
Something we hadn't expected to have to contend with, but actually it worked out really well.

805
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:51,296
But as level design go, it's a fairly simple problem compared to something, you know, like

806
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:54,658
a proper shooter game or an adventure game where you really have to think about all of those parts

807
00:46:54,698 --> 00:46:59,120
and all of those sightlines all the time. You do get a little bit more freedom in the way that

808
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,982
the game is made. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. We have about 10 minutes left, so if anyone has

809
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:09,165
questions, please get them in now or forever hold them. There is a really good one.

810
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:12,593
that will take us over into the archaeology system, if you have a minute,

811
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:14,233
because I want to know how that whole thing works.

812
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:19,115
And there's a good question here from devrsw, who wants to know,

813
00:47:19,155 --> 00:47:22,536
did you experiment with other difficulty modes around the translation stuff?

814
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:25,277
I've been playing a lot, and I wish the game had fewer clues

815
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:27,037
for those of us that love a challenge.

816
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:32,919
Nope, just the right amount of clues, thank you, from someone who also loves a challenge.

817
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,381
You went through about 20 prototypes of the translation mechanic.

818
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:47,270
of all sorts of different mechanics and all sorts of different ways of solving that high-level design of decrypting hieroglyphs,

819
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,771
which is the kind of thing we wanted to hit.

820
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:59,014
And generally speaking, the window of good game design there is incredibly tight.

821
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:04,276
Because if you make something which is too easy, where the player can brute force it,

822
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:07,518
or they can just make random guesses, or they don't have to do any work,

823
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:09,238
or there's no insight, or there's no structure.

824
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:10,795
then there's actually nothing to do.

825
00:48:11,315 --> 00:48:12,896
And we had a lot of early prototypes

826
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:14,977
where you just lobbed words into slots,

827
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:16,678
and then eventually Aliyah would say,

828
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:17,278
yeah, that's it.

829
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:19,819
And you'd go, okay, that was a complete waste of time.

830
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,521
But on the flip side of that,

831
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,742
it's extremely easy to make a problem,

832
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:26,722
which is far too hard.

833
00:48:27,022 --> 00:48:29,043
And in fact, the system we have right now,

834
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:31,544
it's very, very easy for us to give you a translation,

835
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:33,985
which is impossible for you to do.

836
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:36,727
We just use the more complicated words in the language.

837
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,448
And there's a lot of work that went into the game.

838
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:43,189
to make sure that it never does that, or it very, very rarely does that,

839
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,610
so that you don't just get translations that you have no idea about.

840
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,490
Because then the player just disengages and says,

841
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,110
well, I don't know, that could be anything.

842
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:55,171
A bit like I used to do in French class, you know, I'd look at something and go,

843
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,231
bof.

844
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:56,932
And that was...

845
00:48:58,192 --> 00:48:59,212
Bad memory, sorry.

846
00:48:59,992 --> 00:49:01,412
...complex.

847
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:03,913
Yeah, so...

848
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:06,573
I think...

849
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:10,641
If people are feeling confident about playing the translation game, then that's nice.

850
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:16,085
And if people are feeling that they could do better with the translations in the game, then okay, fair enough.

851
00:49:16,225 --> 00:49:21,769
But language has a problem, which is that it does get arbitrary quite fast.

852
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,372
Like, what a word happens to be is really just what it happens to be.

853
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:35,439
So it's quite difficult to make a challenging language puzzle in the sense that you might mean it.

854
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:36,579
Because...

855
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:42,619
actually the challenging becomes basically random or impossible very, very quickly.

856
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,862
And then it's not really fun at all.

857
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:52,407
We definitely rather err on the side of, you know, without explicitly telling you what

858
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:58,533
the words mean, just give you a great amount of clues to whether it's, you know, where

859
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:02,977
it's written, what the symbols look like.

860
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:08,485
or how a word relates to another word, whether there's similar symbols.

861
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:13,106
If from that you intuit something quite easily, then I kind of feel like...

862
00:50:13,346 --> 00:50:13,906
That's a win.

863
00:50:14,026 --> 00:50:15,067
That's a win, exactly.

864
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,748
Even if it feels slightly too easy, that's way better than the alternative.

865
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:22,889
I think the other thing that people need to realise is that it's a 12-hour game,

866
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:29,110
and by the end of the game there are long and complex and intricate words

867
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,791
that you'll be looking at with deep, constructional reasons behind them.

868
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:36,233
And the tutorial ramp is kind of gentle.

869
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:38,894
That's probably for the best.

870
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:48,079
So yeah, for people who want more challenges, I think there are plenty of challenges in

871
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:54,023
there, even if it's just look back through all of your translations and even for ones

872
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:58,685
where you know the words, can you work out why the word is the way it is?

873
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:03,403
Like, what is the construction there? How are the symbols put together to form that word?

874
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:07,284
Because there's a lot there to kind of decode.

875
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,105
I mean, I think for us, like, the...

876
00:51:09,545 --> 00:51:12,086
You know, it was a very iterative process, and one where we...

877
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:16,247
We settled on the translation mechanic after about a year and a half of work.

878
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:21,148
And after we found it, and we really found it from experiments,

879
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:23,649
we dug it out of the dirt, and we're like, wow, this works.

880
00:51:24,305 --> 00:51:27,266
And we tested it on so many people in so many contexts,

881
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:31,068
and it's held up for two years or something for us as being,

882
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,928
I'm pretty sure this is the one.

883
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:37,230
Like, I look at it, and I honestly don't know

884
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,111
how we could make it better at this point.

885
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:44,833
Because, like, yeah, it's remarkable.

886
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:46,894
Having seen the versions that didn't work,

887
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:48,855
it's remarkable how well this version works.

888
00:51:48,915 --> 00:51:50,356
Whether you like it or not is up to you.

889
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:53,017
But, oh my God, the other ones were a lot worse.

890
00:51:54,994 --> 00:52:00,918
Yeah, for sure. We're coming off to the end here. I always like to ask, and with this game more so than most,

891
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,842
how did you get the word out about this game to people that you thought would enjoy it most? It's

892
00:52:05,882 --> 00:52:11,125
such a tricky game to sum up easily or to very quickly give someone a sense of what they will

893
00:52:11,145 --> 00:52:16,689
be doing. So how have you gone about marketing and sort of trying to get this game in front of people?

894
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,612
Has it all been like YouTube, email, reviews? What's worked for you?

895
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:29,743
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, you know, step one is we have a PR agent who helps us in terms of like,

896
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:38,090
she has a specific focus on adventure games and shows she has a good amount of contacts in that

897
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:44,254
space, which helps. The other thing that helps is you write a really good game that everybody likes

898
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:49,338
and then you email them saying, do you remember that game you liked? We've made another one.

899
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:52,280
And I think that's pretty, pretty fundamental, actually.

900
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:58,098
It's also taken us a long time to work out what the hook of the game is.

901
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:06,246
We've been excited since the beginning about all the tonal aspects of the game, like characters, the world, the mechanics,

902
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:11,771
but it took us a while to find out, purely through experimentation and talking to people,

903
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:18,477
that it was the translation mechanic which really piqued people's interest.

904
00:53:18,797 --> 00:53:19,838
And so discovering that...

905
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:24,601
Getting that down and always making sure that when we talked about the game,

906
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:29,786
we made sure to mention we have an entire hieroglyphic language to decipher.

907
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,789
That just became the thing that we always mentioned.

908
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:35,872
Our one-line pitch for the game is an archaeological narrative adventure

909
00:53:35,892 --> 00:53:37,933
with an entire hieroglyphic language to decipher.

910
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,655
Right, I've said that far too many times.

911
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,159
and go, oh yeah, okay, a hieroglyphic language.

912
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:46,340
But a lot of me wants to say, oh yeah,

913
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,341
with this incredible, massively adaptive narrative

914
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,222
that totally responds to everything you do

915
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:52,442
that's completely non-linear,

916
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:53,883
that lets you explore this massive,

917
00:53:53,903 --> 00:53:54,663
where are you going?

918
00:53:54,723 --> 00:53:55,643
Why have you come back?

919
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:56,524
Why have you gone?

920
00:53:56,544 --> 00:54:01,046
And yeah, that's what carries the game.

921
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:02,806
That's what, if you enjoy the game,

922
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:04,507
that's probably what's making it good.

923
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:08,477
You need that initial hook to get people in.

924
00:54:08,497 --> 00:54:11,399
That's one thing that's been nice about reading reviews today, actually, is that a lot of

925
00:54:11,419 --> 00:54:14,902
them have gone, oh, there's this world and there's people and there's characters, there's

926
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:17,685
mysteries, and you go, yeah, all this stuff was there, you know?

927
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:21,048
It's not just the language puzzle game.

928
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:25,912
But I think that goes back to something that Mike Rose, who used to work for Garbage Pitcher,

929
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:28,494
said, which was, projects need a hook and a kicker.

930
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:30,576
And hook, and you have a kicker.

931
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:32,818
And our hook is the translation game.

932
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:33,698
And our kicker is...

933
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:37,897
the massively adaptive narrative with the interesting characters and all of that stuff.

934
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:42,298
And it can be really hard to package your game up that way because

935
00:54:43,138 --> 00:54:46,239
the kicker is probably the thing you care about and the hook is probably the

936
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:49,640
thing that you're kind of done with as the developer. Like you've got over it

937
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,661
by the time you're making the game. But it is a really good way to think

938
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:56,861
about explaining your project to people. Like

939
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,842
the hook is what gets their interest and the kicker is what makes them stay.

940
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:03,183
And the great thing about that is you can...

941
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:06,808
You can be constantly experimenting with that.

942
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:10,391
Every time you explain what game you're working on to a person,

943
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:12,332
you try explaining it in a different way.

944
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:15,875
You see what makes their eyes light up.

945
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:21,619
And we've totally found that since we found that way of describing the game,

946
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,461
then it's just been a question of, like, what have we done?

947
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,443
We've done posts on Imgur, we've done Twitter stuff,

948
00:55:27,463 --> 00:55:30,205
we've done interviews with the press, we've done demos, various things.

949
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:32,947
Some things have had traction, some things haven't had traction, but...

950
00:55:33,886 --> 00:55:42,757
in general, that those concepts, that hook concept has been, has always worked.

951
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:43,918
It's always been there.

952
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:48,324
Like when we've had success, it's always been the same hook and the same kind of payoff.

953
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:53,704
Well, I hope it works out for you guys.

954
00:55:53,804 --> 00:55:55,326
This game seems incredible.

955
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:56,947
I think we're just about done with our IHR.

956
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:59,789
Brian, did you have any burning questions you had to slip in here?

957
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:00,670
Chat, go ahead.

958
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,190
Toss some.

959
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:01,711
Toss.

960
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:03,933
We got a lot of love for the language system in chat.

961
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:04,573
I'll start that off.

962
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:07,015
Everyone from Kale Woodbridge to Supercon22,

963
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:11,419
thank you all for dropping by and sharing your love for Heaven's

964
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:12,300
Vault with these folks.

965
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,782
I guess for you guys.

966
00:56:17,904 --> 00:56:26,729
I've been asking a lot of developers lately because a lot of developers I've talked to have been building their companies and the future of their game-making lives alongside their debut games.

967
00:56:27,689 --> 00:56:34,793
You all are a few games in right now, you're not in the same place, you know how to build tools and recruit people and sort of do that.

968
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:37,315
There's a lot changing in...

969
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:42,780
Um, the world of game development right now in that there's a more pressure for games

970
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,724
The the making of the game to be as as much of an entertainment as much of the product I guess as the game itself

971
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:49,664
um

972
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:54,087
And while I wouldn't argue that every game developer has to jump on that bad wagon right away

973
00:56:54,688 --> 00:56:58,090
Um, someone in here was asking in chat was asking about updates for the game

974
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,993
and where what have you been thinking about in the way that like these kind of

975
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:06,436
Story driven games can exist with with a world. That's that's expanding

976
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:11,960
into games that are more persistent, which thankfully a lot of those games are still narrative and story driven.

977
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,202
It's thankfully not narrative or no narrative. It's how is narrative presented.

978
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:17,884
That's a question. There's a question in there somewhere. There's a question mark.

979
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:25,410
Yeah, I feel like I'm a bit of a dinosaur on the design of persistent evolving games because I

980
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,713
look at something like Heaven's Vault and like it's crafted, it's got a beginning, it's got a

981
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:33,657
middle, it's got an end. The idea of adding anything to it terrifies me because like...

982
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:38,122
The narrative sticks together right now, and if I add something to it, I'm really not sure

983
00:57:38,142 --> 00:57:39,583
if it would stick together anymore.

984
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:45,984
In a way, it actually is much more difficult than, say, 80 Days, because 80 Days is made

985
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:53,425
out of lots of little individual pieces that could sometimes call to each other and remember

986
00:57:53,465 --> 00:57:55,766
certain facts between certain cities that you visit.

987
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:59,307
But Heaven's Vault is so just like...

988
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,746
It's supposed to be tight.

989
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:04,387
Everything relates to something in the core plot.

990
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:08,390
So I feel like if we were ever to do an update for Heaven's Vault, it would have to be a sequel.

991
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:13,714
Whereas I still kick myself on 80 Days that maybe we should have just released a lot less of the game

992
00:58:13,854 --> 00:58:17,717
and made it a subscription game and then just New Cities and Journeys every month

993
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,738
because we totally could have done that.

994
00:58:19,758 --> 00:58:21,359
New Seasons. New Seasons. Yep.

995
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,921
Maybe that would have been a really great model.

996
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:27,463
Or maybe we would have just hated it within weeks. I don't know.

997
00:58:29,535 --> 00:58:35,357
Yeah, I think what I want to believe is that it's still possible for us to make games,

998
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:41,099
narrative games, that are so efficiently made that they sell enough, that they justify themselves,

999
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,201
that they don't need to be persistent games. We don't need to have people coming back every three

1000
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:51,643
months and paying another $20 for the next bit. We don't need three million players. We can get

1001
00:58:51,723 --> 00:58:58,046
enough players who are happy with their $1, their one-time purchase, that we're good, we're fine.

1002
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,999
That lets us make the kind of games that we actually want to make and craft the experiences we want to craft

1003
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:09,904
without having to try and bend the narrative into a shape that it doesn't want to be.

1004
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:12,686
Or make games that don't really end.

1005
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:18,570
I hate it when narratives don't have proper endings. It really irritates me.

1006
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:25,715
I can see that in most contexts, narratives are moving towards stories which don't end.

1007
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:28,839
Because then you could make another one.

1008
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,220
And like, Marvel are doing this right now extremely successfully.

1009
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,602
And George R.R. Martin's got his own solution, which is to just not write the end.

1010
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,023
Yeah.

1011
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:38,763
Wow.

1012
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,284
Working well for him.

1013
00:59:41,964 --> 00:59:43,585
But I don't want to have to do that.

1014
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:47,086
That was the sickest burn I think we've ever experienced on this channel.

1015
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:52,392
I hope he checks this game out.

1016
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:53,052
I think he'd like it.

1017
00:59:53,212 --> 00:59:54,173
He seems like a nice guy.

1018
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:58,996
For sure.

1019
01:00:00,257 --> 01:00:02,899
Yeah, before we go, I'll just let Supercon get the last comment in.

1020
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:04,340
How you did 80 days was perfect.

1021
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,462
The basic game was amazing and the updates for it made them even more happy.

1022
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:10,164
You somehow made a great game even better and

1023
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:14,707
Cable Woodbridge would like to say as a parent hooray for short finishable games

1024
01:00:17,248 --> 01:00:22,371
I will just add I guess like a keyword that stuck out to me there is efficient like having game making be efficient

1025
01:00:26,014 --> 01:00:28,695
Seems to be something that I think everyone is trying to figure out at all times

1026
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:33,839
And I hope I hope I hope that that I hope that heavens vault has struck that balance for you

1027
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,520
I cannot arbitrarily say if it has

1028
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:40,108
In some ways it has, in some ways it really hasn't.

1029
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:41,789
In that it took us four years.

1030
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:49,454
It's certainly a lot more efficient than if we'd done it in other ways.

1031
01:00:49,794 --> 01:00:57,399
I think this is the thing, we have made a 12 to 20 hour game that's full on narrative all the time,

1032
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:00,801
that doesn't have any downtime in it, and there's seven of us.

1033
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:03,003
And it ramped up from two.

1034
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,771
I still feel like that's relatively inefficient.

1035
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,481
With that, I will start wishing everyone adieu.

1036
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,424
Thank you all for joining us on the GDC Twitch channel.

1037
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:41,715
This is a place where we try to talk about the art and business of making games, and often where they intersect, just like we discussed in this moment.

1038
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,256
If you enjoyed this, we would love it if you clicked the follow button.

1039
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:50,197
We would love it if you checked out Heaven's Vault, which is the game we're streaming today.

1040
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:55,078
Because, you know, it's a cool game. We try to check out cool games on this channel.

1041
01:01:55,258 --> 01:02:01,760
And we try to always be talking with the developers and give you an opportunity to ask developers about how games get made.

1042
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:07,421
Because we're also GDC, we encourage you to check out the rest of GDC.

1043
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:11,282
We have the GDC Vault up open right now. You can go check out all the talks from GDC 2019.

1044
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:15,965
We have a YouTube channel where those talks also wind up, so you can go check that out too.

1045
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:22,150
And with that, John and Joseph, if they have any questions for you, where should they ask them?

1046
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,133
Twitter is probably the place.

1047
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:28,074
We also have a Discord server.

1048
01:02:28,254 --> 01:02:29,875
Oh yeah.

1049
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:31,897
I don't know how you find the Discord server.

1050
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:33,398
Go to Twitter and find it.

1051
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:34,759
Oh yeah, it's secret.

1052
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,961
So our Twitter is at Inkle Studios.

1053
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:44,569
And you can find us there and yeah, please do take a look at Evans Vault, it's on PC and PS4.

1054
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,211
As of today, mmm, mmm.

1055
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:51,034
I think PC from day one is the best day to play them.

1056
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:51,935
That's what I hear.

1057
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:54,076
For sure.

1058
01:02:54,096 --> 01:02:56,799
Alright, with that, everyone have a good day.

1059
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,240
You too, bye bye!

1060
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:00,581
Bye!
