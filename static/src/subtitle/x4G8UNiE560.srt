1
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,544
Okay, hello everyone, welcome.

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,965
My name's Joe, nice to meet you.

3
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:13,706
Thanks for coming to my talk, especially on a Friday,

4
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:14,966
that's really appreciated.

5
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,907
I'm gonna be talking at length about how to make

6
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:21,408
bored millennials play your text games

7
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,689
instead of shooting aliens in the head.

8
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,850
But before we begin, if you could please silence

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,171
any devices and small children you have with you.

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,852
And if you really enjoy my talk,

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,513
please fill out your evaluation forms.

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,077
If you don't enjoy my talk, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,743
So, text in video games. It all sounds a little bit 1977, doesn't it?

14
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,177
But as we know, text games have been making something of a comeback,

15
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:54,000
in no small part because of the rise of mobiles and tablets,

16
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,022
a great form factor for reading.

17
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:59,384
We're seeing text games everywhere, on PC,

18
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,526
and we, as a company, are even making, at Inkle,

19
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:07,048
we're making a text game for consoles.

20
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:11,711
So, a text game that you read on a TV on the other side of the room.

21
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:13,773
What could possibly go wrong?

22
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:23,787
So we're best known as a company for making two games, 80 Days and Sorcery,

23
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:28,609
each of which have hundreds of thousands of lines of words of interactive prose.

24
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,030
And we like to think that if we've done our job correctly...

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,491
then it will feel much more like a playing experience, not a reading experience.

26
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,132
People talk about playing our games.

27
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:46,553
And so if I have my UX hat on, which is the hat that I usually have on when I'm not programming,

28
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:55,395
I like to think that our primary goal is to make sure that every word is absolutely effortless

29
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:55,955
to read.

30
00:01:56,536 --> 00:02:00,476
If you think about the experience of browsing Twitter.

31
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:04,836
It's similar, you know, you're browsing Twitter, but you're still reading text.

32
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,839
People are reading huge amounts of text when they're reading Twitter,

33
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,703
when they shop online, even when they're watching a film with subtitles.

34
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:14,446
But they don't really talk about that as a reading experience.

35
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,828
And that's the way we think about our games as well.

36
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,633
The player goes on an adventure in which they happen to read quite a lot of text.

37
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:29,139
So we like to think of effortless reading as a combination of two things really,

38
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,141
and they're both very closely related.

39
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:35,367
Great writing, of course, and great UX design.

40
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,197
And those two things are really, really closely related.

41
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:42,098
A well-worded sentence or a well-structured paragraph

42
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,738
allows for a great user experience.

43
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,559
And I'll talk a little bit about the writing,

44
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,819
but I'm not a writer myself.

45
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,120
My co-founder, John, is sitting here in the front.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,001
He's the main writer of our company.

47
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,421
But my focus at Inkle is as a developer

48
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,322
and as a UI and UX designer.

49
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:07,384
So really this whole talk is going to be a nice bag of tips and tricks, some suggestions

50
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,988
on how to improve the text UX in your game.

51
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:20,735
But they all contribute to what I see as the two main pillars of what we do with our text UX at Inkle.

52
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,516
Focus and pacing.

53
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:27,220
Focus is making sure that the player isn't distracted in any particular moment.

54
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:36,027
It's making sure that there isn't anything that's distracting them from the main task that they're meant to be doing, of reading, assuming that reading is the main task.

55
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,369
Ideally, the player should never have to think.

56
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,990
the words simply drop into their brain.

57
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,570
And it's nothing to do with the player having to focus,

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,311
it's about the game being focused

59
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,092
so that the player doesn't have to do any work at all.

60
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,532
It's just effortless for them.

61
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,313
So to start with a quick example,

62
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,613
I'm a big fan of using very tiny amounts

63
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,874
of text in presentations.

64
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,574
It means that you're listening to what I'm saying

65
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,034
and not spending ages looking at the bullet points

66
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:03,775
on my slides.

67
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:11,149
But if I do want you to read something, I can be sure that if there's a small amount of text on screen, you'll definitely read it.

68
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,210
It's effortless.

69
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:19,436
But to give you a counter example, and I apologize if you worked on this game, here's The Witcher.

70
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:26,057
So on the surface, this looks like a really pretty screenshot.

71
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,058
The aesthetics are great.

72
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,380
The character art's lovely.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,922
Even the layout is kind of harmonious.

74
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,663
The icons are pretty.

75
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,925
There's really nice kind of color balance.

76
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:37,967
And I like all the icon design.

77
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,769
I even like the font choice.

78
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,111
But that's a wall of text.

79
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,792
Do you really feel like reading it?

80
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,013
You've popped open this book.

81
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,815
You see this wall of text, and you go, no.

82
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,017
I won't bother this time.

83
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:56,295
unless you're really trying. So, let's try a really quick redesign of just the text flow.

84
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:05,496
Okay, that's a good start. We've wiped the slate clean, no distractions. We're going

85
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:09,577
to start by revealing the title to the player, but just the title, and that will give it

86
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:14,958
a sense of significance. Oh, you just read it!

87
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:29,466
And so it goes on.

88
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,488
But what if the player doesn't want to read the text?

89
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,091
Go on then, we'll add a back button.

90
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,933
But we're definitely not going to draw any attention to it.

91
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,615
But maybe, but maybe, just maybe,

92
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,498
they'll actually want to, your players will want to read the text anyway

93
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:47,941
and not want to dismiss it because it's just boring in-game text content.

94
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:52,638
Of course it takes a little bit longer to design and build than a simple dialogue box,

95
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:59,765
but let's be honest, this stuff isn't rocket science, and if you hired writers in the first

96
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:04,950
place to produce really great text content, why not devote a little bit of developer time

97
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,792
to make it really pleasant to read?

98
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,827
So you might have noticed I've started to touch on pacing already.

99
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:17,150
After wiping the slate clean to remove all the distractions, I revealed a little bit

100
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,794
of text at a time initially, and then more and more, allowing players just a little bit

101
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:26,318
of acclimatization time, getting used to the fact that they're no longer juggling inventory

102
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,680
items and instead settling into a bit of reading.

103
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:32,898
Focus and pacing are really closely related, and in fact,

104
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:35,699
quantity of text is a really good example of that.

105
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,760
The amount of text that you show at a time

106
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,182
affects both the focus and the pacing,

107
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,743
and never more so than at the start of the game.

108
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,264
But other things that affect the pacing

109
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,705
are the timing of any text animations you have,

110
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,386
as well as the structure of the writing,

111
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:50,987
because the structure of the writing

112
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,008
is a really core part of the UX.

113
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:56,629
It affects the flow of how you consume the text

114
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,230
and the timing of how you read it.

115
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:05,918
So I'm going to focus on two main areas in detail,

116
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,440
and they kind of correspond to focus and pacing, respectively.

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,080
So I'm going to talk about typography and animation.

118
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:19,743
So great typography is really about reducing friction

119
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,184
and therefore improving focus.

120
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,964
choosing the right typeface, laying out the text really beautifully,

121
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:30,365
and with exactly the right spacing that makes it really clear to read,

122
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,465
and just at the right size, it's all important.

123
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,746
When choosing a typeface for text that the player is going to be reading a lot of,

124
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,087
the most important thing is readability.

125
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,147
And one aspect of this is legibility.

126
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:45,828
What's the difference between readability and legibility?

127
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,702
Well, legibility is how easy it is to make out the shape of the individual letters.

128
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:57,404
So to take a slightly extreme example, this fantasy lettering is perfectly legible.

129
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:58,844
You can see exactly what it says.

130
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:04,266
You can pick out every single character, and even in isolation, you'd know what that character is.

131
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:07,027
But would you want to read 50,000 words in it?

132
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,408
I certainly wouldn't.

133
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:09,508
It wouldn't be as readable.

134
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,954
And this is kind of an extreme example, obviously.

135
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:17,696
Even a game UI wouldn't use this font for 50,000 words of text.

136
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,277
You certainly wouldn't typeset an entire book in this typeface.

137
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:26,999
But game artists and designers seem continually tempted to push the boundaries of what's slightly,

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,341
just a bit too over-stylized, in my opinion.

139
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:32,622
You see it in practice all the time.

140
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:33,722
For example...

141
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:41,248
I love Elder Scrolls, by the way, and I love Oblivion, but this text is not designed to

142
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:41,729
be read.

143
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:48,294
This is basically just a prop in the world that happens to have some text written on

144
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:50,656
it to give you a sense of the tone of the world.

145
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:54,999
But I don't think anyone would really feel like this is really pleasurable to read.

146
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,487
The characters, yeah, they're tonally, they're beautifully kind of within the tone of Skyrim's world,

147
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:09,394
but it's just got that little extra amount of friction that prevents you from really getting drawn in.

148
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:14,559
I mean, some intrepid players, myself included, might really make an attempt to read some of it,

149
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,901
but it's just a lot of hard work.

150
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,454
Here's another example, this one from Oblivion.

151
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,696
Excuse me if the screenshot looks a bit low resolution.

152
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,938
So that, for example, this, if you

153
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,560
look at the initial on the second page, the stylized G,

154
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,741
that's beautiful.

155
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,723
I love illuminated manuscripts, and that's gorgeous.

156
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,925
But it just makes the text just a little bit harder to read.

157
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:41,507
Overall, the font isn't bad, but it's just a little bit

158
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,068
extra work.

159
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,230
So here's what I would do if I was going to change the font

160
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,991
and just play with the layout a tiny bit.

161
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:53,793
So what I've done is I've duplicated the text content on the right page onto the left page

162
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,515
so you can see them side by side.

163
00:09:56,376 --> 00:10:00,602
And obviously the first thing you notice is there's just less text on the left hand side.

164
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,064
So they're not totally equivalent.

165
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:03,245
You might think I'm cheating.

166
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:09,792
So what's the other things I've done? I've changed the typeface to a variant of

167
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:13,435
Caslon, which originates from the 18th century. Even if you don't know anything

168
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:18,100
about fonts, that'll just give an instinctive, slightly aged feel. And I

169
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,903
feel like it's got nicer proportions than other serif fonts

170
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:26,167
like Times New Roman. The main thing though is it's not quite so alien to

171
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:29,611
your eyes as the overly stylized version on the right.

172
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:35,316
And in fact, the most important thing about readability is familiarity.

173
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:39,343
There's nothing specific about an overly stylized font

174
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,186
that makes it hard to read necessarily.

175
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:44,312
It's just the fact that it's not familiar to your eyes.

176
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:51,401
I've also widened the margin, which really just gives the text a bit of room to breathe.

177
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:55,565
This allows you to really focus on the words.

178
00:10:56,586 --> 00:11:04,032
So the margins can really allow your eye to just concentrate on just the paragraph and

179
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:04,893
nothing around it.

180
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:10,332
But wide margins can also convey a sense of importance.

181
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,855
If you think about the way poetry is typeset,

182
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,800
it's kind of really narrow with huge margins that just gives it

183
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,422
this kind of air of confidence and importance.

184
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,946
And it can make a message just feel significant,

185
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,087
even if the words aren't.

186
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,671
How profound.

187
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,172
I've also had a lot of paragraph spacing.

188
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,175
You might have noticed I've also broken up that first paragraph too.

189
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:42,798
Playing with the structure of the writing is a core part of designing the UX.

190
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,305
And even if your writer isn't responsible for the UX ultimately, they are contributing

191
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:51,585
to it.

192
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,701
I've also indented the paragraphs.

193
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,522
I mean, this sounds like a really minor thing,

194
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,823
but anecdotally, on 80 Days, as soon

195
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:05,225
as we put in that indent on the first line of every paragraph,

196
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:07,686
it sort of acts as this little anchor

197
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:11,328
that lets you feel like you're not getting lost in the text.

198
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:13,889
And it helps you kind of skim, skim down.

199
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,213
I should say, this is, in general, a pretty contrived example.

200
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:24,557
If I was designing everything from scratch, I would almost certainly not lay it out on

201
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,620
the pages of the book, even though that feels very in metaphor with what the player is doing.

202
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:33,664
We'd probably do something like what we do on sorcery with pieces of paper that slide

203
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:33,804
up.

204
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:39,528
So what are my top five typography and typesetting tips?

205
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,242
We've already talked about typeface and the margins and paragraph spacing, which help

206
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,463
focus in on the text and give a sense of importance.

207
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:51,025
Next on this list is text size.

208
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,548
I could probably rant for an hour just about text size alone.

209
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:59,951
The number of console games that you see with this tiny, tiny, tiny text.

210
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:03,033
Probably because developers are just sitting next to their TVs.

211
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:06,135
That's definitely the way it was when I was working in AAA.

212
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:07,856
And they just don't care.

213
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,938
They can see the text, it's right next to their, they're sitting right next to the TV,

214
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,638
so they don't care.

215
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,460
Please don't do that.

216
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,324
As a rough guide, just take a look at film subtitles.

217
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:22,950
It's the most ridiculously simple UX in the world, but even subtitles on cheap DVD players

218
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,531
work fine.

219
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:31,096
If you're working on both mobile and console, a nice rule of thumb is that those screen

220
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:35,298
sizes are actually surprisingly similar if you take into account the view distance.

221
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:41,622
So the fonts are likely to be a bit more chunky than on PC, for example, where you can afford

222
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:42,463
to have a smaller font.

223
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:46,446
But if you're developing for PC and one of those other platforms,

224
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:51,691
you may as well design the console or the mobile UI first,

225
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,274
because then you'll be sure that you've got enough space on PC

226
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:56,115
and you won't squash it in at the last minute.

227
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:05,228
So a rough rule of thumb I would say for number of words per line, and this stuff is really

228
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:09,509
important, is that you should aim for around 5 to 15 words per line.

229
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,130
At the lower end you have an effect a bit like a newspaper column, which can actually

230
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,351
be really quite easy to read, because you know your eye doesn't get lost.

231
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:21,573
But as soon as you go over somewhere around 15, it just becomes that little bit harder

232
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,093
for your eye to scan back to the start of the next line.

233
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:29,670
I've seen a few narrative games on PC particularly that put narrative down at the bottom of the

234
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,413
screen in a tiny font and stretch it the full width of the screen giving well over 20 words

235
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:34,954
per line.

236
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,296
Sorry, which I don't mean to pick on you.

237
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:41,658
How many words is that per line?

238
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:47,541
I lost count around 30, and I know this is cheating because this is just subtitles, but

239
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,662
all of this stuff counts.

240
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:53,914
Finally, the text positioning.

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,715
In the same way as when you're reading film subtitles, you might find that when you're

242
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:03,916
reading, you sort of find yourself not being able to pay attention to the visuals quite

243
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:04,416
so much.

244
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:10,577
It's kind of splitting the player's attention, so ideally you want to try to place the text

245
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:14,418
contextually where it belongs next to the gameplay within the scene.

246
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,298
I know that can be difficult depending on the genre.

247
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,366
And finally, there's one more point that I'm making on this slide, and that's that you

248
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,949
can use the text brightness itself, or the color, in order to draw the player's attention

249
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,350
to what's important right now, what they should be reading at this very moment.

250
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,854
And while also showing the previous text for some context.

251
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:41,757
And this is definitely something that we did on 80 Days, and it really helped focus the

252
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:42,357
player's eye.

253
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:52,297
So all of these typography improvements can help with focus, they help the player concentrate

254
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:54,980
on the text that's important and helps them absorb it easily.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,305
And I've been showing some examples of some static pages of text, but one of the things

256
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:04,391
we've been most happy with at Inkle is the timing of the way that we reveal text, the

257
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:04,851
pacing.

258
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:13,773
So I like to think of focus and pacing a bit like harmony and melody in music.

259
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:18,837
Harmony is like the way that the text appears in a particular moment

260
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:23,340
and how you perceive it and how it looks on screen.

261
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,944
Whereas pacing is more like melody, it's how that text is presented over time as a sequence.

262
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,180
And pacing is critical right from the beginning of the game or right from the beginning of

263
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,281
a particular section where you want to present some text.

264
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:46,863
I think everyone knows that in the first few seconds or minutes you have the opportunity

265
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:52,424
to either capture your player or make them just feel that little bit of apathy about

266
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:53,484
what they're looking at.

267
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,905
Because text is boring, right?

268
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:02,699
Just as people judge books by covers or decide in the first couple of pages that a book doesn't

269
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,405
seem to their taste, you want to convince your players that your text isn't intimidating or boring.

270
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,111
So the first thing that we do when we do the pacing for text content is we break it down

271
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,132
to smaller digestible chunks like I showed earlier.

272
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:27,973
The BBC News website puts every single sentence on its own paragraph to make it a little bit

273
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:28,793
easier to read.

274
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:33,094
But being game developers we can play with animation timing and interactivity as well.

275
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,955
So this is really a matter of balance.

276
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:47,304
Showing small sections of text in isolation can help the player focus on those specific

277
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:49,005
words, slowing them down.

278
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,966
It forces them to pause and think.

279
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:57,529
Whereas, when showing a single larger section of text, assuming the player is already focused

280
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,391
on those words, it allows them to consume the content much more quickly.

281
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,380
Hang on, what?

282
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:10,147
Smaller sections slow you down and larger sections speed you up.

283
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:15,093
So to be clear, I'm talking about these sections in isolation,

284
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,657
when you have a pause or you have to press a button in order

285
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,798
to go to the next section.

286
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,981
So necessarily, inserting those gaps will slow the player down, and if it becomes too slow,

287
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:29,922
it can become boring or frustrating if the player can't read fast enough.

288
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:35,344
It can definitely be surprising. While working on Sorcery, we tried making a text-based action

289
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:39,806
scene by having little snippets like, you leap forward, or you make a dash for the door,

290
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:44,568
separated by choices. Sometimes that works, but we were surprised at how

291
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,748
having a rapid succession of choices

292
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:51,936
We thought it would speed the game up, but actually of course it slows it down because

293
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,279
it slows down the reveal of the content itself.

294
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:57,865
So what can I say?

295
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:00,208
Pacing is really, really hard to get right.

296
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:06,632
The only way you can solve this kind of thing is by testing and iterating.

297
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,654
Since pacing is inherently time-based, it's like animating a character.

298
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:17,375
You wouldn't expect a character artist to produce a character animation purely in theory

299
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:21,937
by inserting all the keyframes and just assuming that it's going to work.

300
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:26,758
They have to keep playing it back, keep trying it, going back and making small modifications

301
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,458
and trying again.

302
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,359
And that's what we do.

303
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,380
That's what we do as part of our core writing process.

304
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,481
and as we develop the writing in the UX hand in hand.

305
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:39,662
So I'd strongly suggest that you get your writers up and running with the game

306
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,603
and in the habit of playing as they write.

307
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:46,184
And it's also very platform dependent

308
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:49,605
in that depending on whether you're looking on a mobile screen

309
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,866
or on a console or on a PC, you're going to get a totally different flow.

310
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,908
So in a moment I'll show you some examples

311
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,168
and how the animation factors into this balance.

312
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:07,021
But first, we talked so far about splitting up the content into small sections,

313
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:08,781
but that's really only the short-term pacing.

314
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,543
In the long-term, the main thing you have to contend with is fatigue.

315
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,485
Imagine a book with paragraphs but no chapter breaks,

316
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,927
or a Kindle e-book with no page numbers or progress bar,

317
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:22,588
or a children's book with no illustrations.

318
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,050
So this is really dependent on the design of your individual game.

319
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:33,117
So far we've really been discussing focus and pacing across the span of just a few seconds,

320
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,663
so it's been applicable whether your game is purely text based or whether it's a game

321
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,246
that happens to have some text based sections.

322
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:45,546
If your core mechanic relies on reading text, then it can really help to introduce some

323
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:50,891
ancillary mechanics, whether text-based or not, just to break up the flow and give the

324
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:57,676
player a sense of contrast and a sense that every time they change activity, it feels

325
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:58,636
new and fresh.

326
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:03,560
And it's going to be satisfying each time they enter a new text section.

327
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:09,595
It can also help if you give the player control over when you switch this type of activity

328
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,136
or use it as a reward.

329
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:16,799
In 80 Days we used to have an identical flow to Sorcery in that when you arrived in a location

330
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,940
the story flow would just pop up immediately.

331
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:23,543
But as soon as we put it on the explore button suddenly that felt like a reward and there

332
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:28,366
was this much stronger motivation to just start reading because they clicked a button

333
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,006
and they wanted to see what the result was.

334
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:38,598
So putting the player in charge of the decision to read gives them a sense of ownership over

335
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:39,219
the content.

336
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,044
For longer sections especially, it can really help to give the player a sense of their overall

337
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:46,664
progress.

338
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:54,811
And for 80 days in Sorcery this wasn't really necessary because we like to just show small

339
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:58,393
sections but if you've got a longer text game that might really help.

340
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:03,733
On the flip side, you have to be careful though.

341
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,494
Sometimes when the players get past a halfway point,

342
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:08,395
being given the sense that they're nearly done

343
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:12,858
can cause them to rush and pay less attention to the text.

344
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,320
This is definitely something that happened in 80 days,

345
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,941
and it was exacerbated by the fact

346
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:18,301
that they were meant to be hurrying

347
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,842
as part of the main game mechanic.

348
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,703
Even though we paused the clock

349
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:24,145
every time you read a story section,

350
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:27,047
there was still this really strong instinct

351
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:28,968
just as you're getting closer to London to just...

352
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:33,050
just push a little bit faster and skim read the text.

353
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,212
So finally let's talk about

354
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,433
animation!

355
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,080
Good aesthetics can draw the player in.

356
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:48,226
Gamers are used to having their attention drawn in by eye-catching visuals, so some

357
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:52,911
pretty text animations can give them the feel-good factor before they get drawn in by the story

358
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:58,636
and make them feel like they're getting something high production that's worth their time, even

359
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,939
though the true value is really in the content.

360
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,561
To a point, of course.

361
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,302
But animation isn't all about aesthetics.

362
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:08,883
It can also be functional too.

363
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,704
And this is where things get really interesting.

364
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,605
So this is the story flow from sorcery.

365
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:16,286
When the player reads a choice,

366
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,607
their eye is down at the bottom of the screen.

367
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:19,887
And when they pick a choice.

368
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:24,997
The piece of paper that the choice text is written on slides up and joins the bottom

369
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:28,559
edge of the story flow above, and the body text is revealed.

370
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:33,741
So what this does is it actually leads the eye up from the bottom where the choice was

371
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,462
right up to where they're just about to start reading again.

372
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:41,604
And the animation is doing this for them, so they don't have to lose their place, they

373
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:43,745
know exactly where they're going to start reading from.

374
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,583
Similarly, this is the text flow in 80 Days, where we went a step further.

375
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:53,125
Often the choices you make are at the start or end of a sentence.

376
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:59,949
And when that's the case, the choice text itself can be reused and sometimes rearranged

377
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,170
slightly as body text.

378
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,313
So we animate it into place, and then animate the rest of the content in, word by word.

379
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:11,716
So how are we manipulating the pacing?

380
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,123
Our word-by-word animation is really quite quick.

381
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,625
The idea is that fast readers shouldn't be ever slowed down.

382
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:24,468
I'm a slow reader, my co-founder John is a very fast reader, my wife is a fast reader,

383
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:29,551
and so we just got to keep testing it with all different reading speeds just to make

384
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,573
sure that it's great for everyone.

385
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,395
You definitely don't want to have to hold down a button to speed up the text.

386
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:43,130
However, we do deliberately delay the appearance of the choices by less than a second, so that

387
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:48,453
the point the player is unconsciously deciding what to do next, they immediately start reading

388
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:52,155
the highlighted text and are discouraged from jumping straight down to look at the choices.

389
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:59,520
Also, the fade-in speed of the choices is slow enough that they don't accidentally distract

390
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,801
the player from reading the body text, which is what they're meant to be concentrating

391
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:02,901
on.

392
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:08,137
So every animation detail on a really fine-grained level

393
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:11,578
has the ability to either make or break

394
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:12,618
the flow of your story.

395
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,940
When you're testing, the most important thing

396
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,481
is to really just be hyper-conscious

397
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:21,802
of those tiny little moments where your eye is getting lost,

398
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,603
or whether you just have a little moment of apathy,

399
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:27,804
just for a split second while you're waiting, say,

400
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,005
for an animation to complete.

401
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:34,192
Our best aha moments have come when we've jumped into the game to test a feature,

402
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:38,377
and then realized that we'd forgotten what we were testing and ended up just subconsciously

403
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:41,862
just reading and playing the game and getting involved with the story.

404
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,225
That's when you know that the UX is working.

405
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:51,251
And so I'd like to show you one final example of one of the changes that we've made recently,

406
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:55,436
well a few months ago now, to our latest game, Heaven's Vault.

407
00:25:55,756 --> 00:26:01,243
In many ways this is just another tiny, subtle thing, but then I think the tiny, subtle things

408
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:04,647
is pretty much what describes UX in a nutshell.

409
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:09,972
Our interactive script engine produces character dialogue on a line-by-line basis,

410
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:14,136
which is then presented to the game. Initially we just showed one line at a time,

411
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:18,000
giving the player just enough time to read it before moving on to the next one.

412
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:21,444
Let me just show you a quick recording from the game's editor,

413
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,786
what that looked like when it ran in the game.

414
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,106
So, it's okay, the pacing is just a little bit sluggish here.

415
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,210
The problem is everyone reads at a different speed, so we can't really display the text

416
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,931
for much less time than that.

417
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:56,836
So the small fix we made was to allow multiple lines of dialogue to overlap and cascade,

418
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:00,359
so new dialogue bubbles can appear while old ones are still on screen.

419
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,542
Again, it's quite subtle, but take a look at another recording with this mode switched

420
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:04,702
on.

421
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:22,660
So this meant that the whole game actually sped up and it just felt so much more refreshing

422
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,200
to play it.

423
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:29,545
Also the previous text that's on the screen can help with a bit of context as well so

424
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,805
that's a nice bonus.

425
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:36,249
This tiny subtle tweak worked miracles for the pacing of the game overall and it's these

426
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:39,211
tiny little changes that can make or break the experience.

427
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:46,352
So what can I say? It's really, really hard, but you've just got to keep testing, iterating,

428
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:51,098
keep trying little subtle tweaks. Pay attention to those tiny fractions of a second where

429
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:55,643
you're waiting around for a little delay or an animation, or those tiny moments of apathy

430
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:58,686
when you look at a block of text that's just a little bit too long.

431
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,389
And when you end up reading absentmindedly, that's a pretty good sign.

432
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,331
And as one final side note, one thing that we find is invaluable when producing beautiful

433
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:10,872
dynamic UI is having just the right set of tools.

434
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:16,154
While working natively on iOS, we had access to Apple's core animation framework, which

435
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:21,117
is fantastic and basically is a big part of the reason why iOS itself has always had pretty

436
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:22,077
UI animations.

437
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,378
It's certainly what allowed us to build the text flow in 80 days.

438
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,784
So we've created a similar system when we moved over to Unity, and now we've open sourced it, and it's available right there.

439
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,907
So I hope some of you might find that helpful as well.

440
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:36,008
Thank you very much!

441
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:42,094
APPLAUSE

442
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,443
And we might have one minute left for questions, possibly.

443
00:28:53,786 --> 00:29:01,450
Hello. So can you talk a little bit about the typesetting and the pacing test iterations

444
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:08,014
when doing localization? So the truthful answer to that is that I'm afraid we've never been

445
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:14,637
able to localize our games for almost unrelated reasons that our text engine varies the text

446
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:19,160
on a word by word basis. So localization has been all that's impossible so far.

447
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:26,431
I started with a graphic design degree, then animation degree.

448
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,453
Now I'm in serious simulations for the military.

449
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:31,414
Well, I'm sure you know more than I do, then.

450
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,436
Well, I'm always flirting around UX design,

451
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:36,038
and I'm always wanting to get into it.

452
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,500
But then I kind of am and am not,

453
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,640
and I don't know how to get started.

454
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,182
Is there a UX design for dummies?

455
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:42,663
What do they have out there?

456
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:43,403
Where do I get started?

457
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:48,319
For me it was completely self-taught.

458
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,661
I've always been interested in graphic design and I've done the graphic design on our games

459
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:57,484
but to be honest I've only actually been doing it professionally for the time since we started

460
00:29:57,544 --> 00:30:00,245
our company so I've completely learned on the job.

461
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,907
Wow, okay I get that a lot but it seems the best way to learn.

462
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:05,048
Thank you.

463
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,149
Hello.

464
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:12,531
Do you have any ideas for in-game player to player chat or no?

465
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,918
I'd have to give that a lot of thought, I think.

466
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:19,621
I haven't ever thought about it, I'm afraid.

467
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,624
Okay, thanks very much.
