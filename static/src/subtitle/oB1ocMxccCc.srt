00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:09,345
Hello, my name's Brandon Sheffield.

2
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:11,827
I'm the creative director of Necrosoft Games

3
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:16,573
and also a researcher, writer, archeologist

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,135
kind of for digital eclipse.

5
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,758
And that's what we're gonna be talking about today.

6
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:28,766
So what I've been calling this thing, game archeology.

7
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:33,450
And that means I'm working on these big collections here.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,111
Like you've seen perhaps Street Fighter 30th Anniversary,

9
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,953
Samurai Shodown Neo Geo Collection, which just came out,

10
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,674
SNK 40th Anniversary Collection.

11
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,835
These are all collections by Digital Eclipse

12
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:49,716
of several games from

13
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:58,938
you know, within a certain framework. So SNK 40th Anniversary is all SNK's games pre-NeoGeo,

14
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:08,746
and we put this together kind of like a digital museum where you see all the steps along the way

15
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:12,269
for them getting from their early days to their popular days

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,913
with the necessary context. And in the case of Street Fighter, for example,

17
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:21,265
We've got 12 games in that collection, but we try

18
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:24,767
to contextualize them in their time period, how they advanced,

19
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:26,989
and do all of this in this sort

20
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:29,751
of digital museum presentation

21
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,913
with a mind toward preservation.

22
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:33,815
So what do I do?

23
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,337
I interview developers, take video,

24
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,719
and look for lost games and information.

25
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:43,832
then the whole team collects scans and other material

26
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,475
and makes sure the games run well and puts them all together

27
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:53,181
into this full package of games, museum, and context.

28
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,652
So, archaeological tactics.

29
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,593
I've been calling this game archaeology.

30
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,014
It's kind of a weird term considering.

31
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,914
Like, I'm not going to a dig site or something,

32
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:08,055
but I am digging into the past in a way.

33
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:09,675
So, it's almost appropriate.

34
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:13,237
These tactics vary depending on what kind of access you're given

35
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:14,957
by the company that has hired you.

36
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,185
So for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection,

37
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,386
we got lots of scans.

38
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,646
And Frank Cifaldi, who runs the Video Game History Foundation,

39
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:27,027
he especially also got more supplemental material

40
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:30,328
and put these things together into a nice timeline

41
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:34,789
and interesting presentations, like you see on the left there.

42
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,429
But we had no developer access.

43
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:37,690
So we couldn't do interviews.

44
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,770
And we had to piece together development histories

45
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,751
from existing interviews and other online sources,

46
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,572
then checking everything with Capcom.

47
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:46,733
as we went along.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,286
But archaeology isn't limited to just talking to developers, of course.

49
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:58,386
So since we couldn't do that, we had to kind of get more creative

50
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,607
and dig into the game archives.

51
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,690
So as I mentioned, there are 12 games on this collection,

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,092
but there was one variant that I really wanted to get in there.

53
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:12,075
Street Fighter II, the New Challengers, had a tournament edition

54
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:17,818
that linked eight players together across four arcade machines

55
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:23,522
in a specialized competition wrapper that has never been released at home ever.

56
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:31,028
and was frankly not that popular even in arcades when it was released. It just, it was, it took up

57
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:38,171
so much space in a game center that most places couldn't afford to even, they couldn't afford the

58
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:38,652
real estate.

59
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:45,541
So I kept bugging everybody to be like, we got to get this game in there somehow.

60
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:51,610
And the producer, Stephen Frost, managed to get permission to make this game available

61
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,796
using locally linked Switch consoles instead of arcade machines.

62
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,050
And so we were actually able to get this from Capcom,

63
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,471
put it in the game, put it in this version of the game.

64
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:09,132
And it's really just a small tweak on a beloved franchise,

65
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:12,232
but preserving these small experiences

66
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,353
that otherwise you would not be able to have,

67
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:19,174
that's really what it's all about, finding these minutiae

68
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:23,654
that people might have forgotten or couldn't experience today

69
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,555
and making that available.

70
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,064
Sometimes you get gray area access.

71
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:36,467
So for SNK 40th, that collection of pre-NeoGeo SNK GameWorks,

72
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:40,570
I couldn't talk directly to any developers that were still

73
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,253
at SNK or that were contracting for SNK

74
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:46,414
or even who they had the contact info for.

75
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:49,356
This may sound odd, but it was because

76
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,658
of potential legal liability.

77
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:52,659
They

78
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:58,077
Essentially, anything that these developers say would be reflective of SNK.

79
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:04,180
And since they didn't have them in the fold, they didn't necessarily want...

80
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,302
I mean, the people they had in the fold, they didn't want to say stuff and be on the record.

81
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:12,703
And then the people that weren't, they weren't part of the company.

82
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,564
So it was this whole kind of, what do we do?

83
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:23,945
What I wound up doing was finding a bunch of former SNK developers myself, and then I invited them to talk to me.

84
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:32,107
So to the left is Hiroko Yokoyama, who worked on Crystalis, Ikari Warriors, and a bunch of other stuff before going on to Video System.

85
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:38,469
And on the right is Yoshiaki Yoshino, who's SNK's original PR team all by himself.

86
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,845
sporting a tank shirt that he maybe made one or two of. He made those himself. He was the original

87
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:51,170
SNK fanzine creator. Zine for the fans, I should say.

88
00:05:54,053 --> 00:06:00,019
So how did we get their work into the game going from official to actually official?

89
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,703
So I don't work for SNK.

90
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,670
I'm a third party, so I can talk to whoever I want to talk to,

91
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,374
and they can say whatever they want to me.

92
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:13,241
SNK just has to then check whether what I discover

93
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:13,923
is correct.

94
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,972
Then once we have that kind of wrapped up,

95
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,172
they're satisfied with the work,

96
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,513
then they could hire them on as consultants,

97
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,354
sort of wrapping the whole thing up

98
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:24,995
in a nice little package.

99
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:27,336
We have the info,

100
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,877
and now they're on the payroll a little bit

101
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:33,238
so that everybody's got plausible deniability.

102
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:40,703
It sounds complicated, but with larger companies like this, especially in Japan, sometimes you need

103
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:48,769
workarounds because they're still operating under the old ideas where you couldn't talk to anybody,

104
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,252
you couldn't share information. And so in order to get around that, sometimes you have to get

105
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:58,917
even more creative. And this here is all of us standing in front of the SNK building after

106
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,077
everything kind of got wrapped.

107
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:05,480
and the special edition of the collection, which will be important again later.

108
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:13,185
Sometimes you're given full access, as full as you can get, which was the case with the

109
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:20,629
Samurai Shodown Neo Geo collection that we just released. That game has all the Neo Geo

110
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:24,471
Samurai Shodown games, including one that was never released before.

111
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:31,475
We were given thousands of scans of artwork from the team

112
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,637
because with the release,

113
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,718
before the release of Samurai Shodown 2019,

114
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:37,899
the big reboot that they did,

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,462
the group at SNK, the developers there,

116
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:46,585
wanted to kind of go back in time through everything

117
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,726
that they had done.

118
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:54,929
had done in the past and see what worked, what didn't work, and just sort of learn from what

119
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:59,090
they had. So they wound up scanning a lot of this stuff themselves. We pushed them to get some more.

120
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,452
And then I was able to go to Japan and do some documentary style interviews of several of the

121
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:12,114
original developers across Osaka and Tokyo. So pretty much anything I wanted to try was possible

122
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:12,894
in this case.

123
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:21,426
Here we have photos of the director, Adachi, in the top left, and then his team on the top right,

124
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:25,548
including two designers, Fukui and Tomita, who you see on the bottom left,

125
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:33,774
playing a 500 yen death match in Samurai Shodown 3, which maybe I'll explain in the text part of

126
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:39,518
this presentation. And there's a little presentation of some of the scans we got.

127
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,220
That's an early Samurai Shodown 2 stage, and we'll see the Street Fighter.

128
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:48,430
But this kind of work, it just doesn't make sense over video calls.

129
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,431
You really have to be physically there in the space, getting lunches and drinks

130
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:59,114
with everybody, because it brings to mind things that, you know,

131
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:02,056
otherwise they might not have remembered or thought of.

132
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:09,919
So walking around Esaka with the SNK developers, Esaka being the part of Osaka

133
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,460
where SNK is based.

134
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:18,128
you realize how much Neo Geo history there is just in these buildings.

135
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:24,654
Like the photo on the right there, that's on top of the bridge from King of Fighters 98,

136
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:30,199
the bridge that is in that Asaka stage. And we just use that for B-roll.

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,145
I'll give a more concrete example. There's a game called ASO, which was one of SNK's big

138
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,287
pre-Neo Geo games. It was a shooting game.

139
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,914
And their first office had a rice paddy next to it.

140
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,956
And the developers would pass by this rice paddy every day

141
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,037
and they would see these Kabuto shrimp.

142
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,699
They're like little armored ovals

143
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,641
that have a tail coming out of them.

144
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:00,664
And those were the inspiration for a ship in ASO,

145
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:01,364
a boss, I think.

146
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:03,904
This is that building.

147
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:06,545
And when I first saw this building,

148
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,926
it was on a whim of some of the developers

149
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,906
that I had gone to an izakaya with.

150
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,427
We had some drinks and then they were like,

151
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,667
yeah, you wanna see where we used to work?

152
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,647
Cause it's right around here.

153
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,248
So we walked over there, it was nighttime.

154
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,129
And, you know, they were talking about this for,

155
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:23,590
that they, you know, they worked on ASO in this building.

156
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,408
So I remembered, yeah, there were those shrimp, right?

157
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,510
I heard there was this rumor that there were shrimp

158
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,450
that inspired you to make this ship.

159
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,952
Where did that all take place?

160
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:35,873
Where was that rice paddy?

161
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,513
And they're like, oh, that's right where you're standing

162
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,754
in what is now a parking lot.

163
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:41,815
And it sounds really silly

164
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,117
because it's just a really minor detail in an older game.

165
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:50,041
But it feels kind of, it's kind of powerful to physically be in the place where all of this stuff

166
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:56,346
happened. Where, you know, you can kind of, you're standing with the developers who made these

167
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:03,813
decisions and had these thoughts. And, you know, you can go through what they were thinking and

168
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,576
what they were feeling under pressure to deliver something. They're like, oh, I remember this

169
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:13,421
the stupid shrimp that we pass by every day. And, you know, obviously.

170
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:19,566
20-something years later, it's all paved. There's no kind of rice paddies and stuff. But I don't

171
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:24,410
know, it makes me really feel like I'm an archaeologist finding out about these things

172
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,854
that otherwise people wouldn't have known. Like down the street, there used to be a vending machine

173
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:39,061
that was the last one in the whole area, like not just Osaka, but I think the whole prefecture where

174
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:48,004
you could get this old drink that some of the people on the team still like. So there would

175
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:52,946
be like a queue in front of this vending machine in the morning to see who could get this drink

176
00:11:52,986 --> 00:12:00,028
that was only sold in this one vending machine for many miles. I don't know. It's stupid stuff,

177
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:10,271
but I love it. So how do you get from no access to full access? You do that by building trust and

178
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:10,611
respect.

179
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:16,115
Again, it was really important that I actually went there to SNK.

180
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,877
I met their big boss, went out for drinks with developers and things like that,

181
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:22,098
because the rapport builds over time.

182
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:26,856
When I go, I plan at least three days of interviews because things

183
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,938
that folks have forgotten might be remembered the next day.

184
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,179
It might jog their memory.

185
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,462
And those after hours beers and things are incredibly important

186
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:37,544
to finding out things that people are maybe not supposed to tell you.

187
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,526
And then when they tell it to you, you have to figure out, okay,

188
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:45,430
is there a way for me to get this into the collection

189
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,192
without causing anybody any trouble?

190
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:51,856
But people trust you if you do good work

191
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,217
and if you represent them well,

192
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,439
and that gets you even further next time.

193
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,444
So as an example of this, I wanted documents

194
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,728
like the original versions of the scans that we got

195
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,050
for developers to kind of rifle through

196
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,993
in their interviews, in their on-screen interviews.

197
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,072
And I knew that at the SNK office there were documents

198
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,253
in this climate-controlled room.

199
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:22,535
This is where they were all held along with, like, packages

200
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,696
and old cartridges and just a bunch of stuff.

201
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,898
But my main contact at SNK is, like,

202
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,138
there's no way you're getting in there.

203
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:34,259
Because the guy who's in charge of it, he's really, you know,

204
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,460
he's a stickler for things.

205
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,460
He doesn't let people in there.

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,981
I've never been in there, he says, as somebody

207
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,281
who works in that office every day.

208
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,634
But I was like, you know, just send him an email.

209
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:50,918
Tell him that Brandon is here all the way from California and would just like to meet him.

210
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,400
And so he's like, you know, he's probably not going to work.

211
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,241
He like, it doesn't matter what your name is.

212
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,842
He doesn't know a lot of Western people.

213
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:00,123
He doesn't remember Western names and stuff.

214
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:02,205
I was like, just try.

215
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,946
So he tries, and the guy's like, oh, Brandon.

216
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,827
Sure. I'll come on down.

217
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,768
So he comes down.

218
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,867
And we shake hands and he's like, how you doing?

219
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:13,608
You want to come up and see what we got?

220
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,608
And I'm like, yes, please.

221
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:22,030
So we wound up with tons of documents,

222
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,891
these gorgeous originals for the developers to look through.

223
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:29,233
You know, people don't realize this, but like that,

224
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,873
the logo that you can see on the right there,

225
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,274
it's got a little layer of.

226
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:39,684
like tissue paper over it, but those logos, which I assumed were done

227
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,765
with a computer, you know, because they look like vector graphics.

228
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,105
Those were all done by hand.

229
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:49,186
And hand-drawn, hand-colored, I'm sure they used tools and stuff to assist them.

230
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:54,768
But the Samurai Showdown image that's being held above it, that's an oil painting.

231
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,709
This stuff is just like they should do an art show with it.

232
00:14:58,769 --> 00:14:59,709
It's amazing to look at.

233
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,110
And so, you know, in the middle there, that's Adachi, the director.

234
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,335
looking at these old documents and being like, oh, I forgot about this.

235
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,156
And it was exactly what we needed.

236
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:11,456
We really needed this stuff.

237
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,817
And so much came up that we wouldn't have known about otherwise.

238
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:18,638
But how did this happen?

239
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,038
Why did he let me up there?

240
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:24,579
That all comes back to this collection that you may remember from earlier.

241
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:26,760
So he's a package guy.

242
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,170
the guy in charge of this room.

243
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,494
He really likes well put together packages

244
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:34,196
and special editions and things like that

245
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,161
because that's what he's been kind of taking charge of

246
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,844
for SMK for all this time.

247
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,688
So in this collection, there is an art book.

248
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:48,145
And this was put together by Nipponichi Software.

249
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:53,947
And with the art book, it turns out there wasn't any extra budget for that,

250
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,047
but somebody needed to copy edit it.

251
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,368
Or rather, I felt that someone needed to copy edit it

252
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:02,568
because they were just taking some stuff from the museum and putting it into the book.

253
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:07,069
So I was like, all right, I'm going to copy edit it for free and make sure it's all correct.

254
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:11,370
But you just have to give me credit in the book and also give credit to the layout people

255
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,330
and whoever else worked on it.

256
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,101
But what actually happened was they only credited me.

257
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:19,645
In the back of the book, there's like this halo thing.

258
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:23,149
It's a memorial to me like I've died almost is what it looks like.

259
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,774
And so this package guy, he likes this package.

260
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,055
He looks through the art book.

261
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,898
He flips to the back and he's like, Brandon Sheffield.

262
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,179
I like that book.

263
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:37,168
And so he remembered my name because of this long,

264
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:41,770
straight chain of events where if anything had disrupted

265
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,850
along that chain of events,

266
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,331
we would not have gotten the documents,

267
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,571
which led to some nice moments in the video.

268
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,892
And basically that's how all of this stuff

269
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:53,653
is constantly working, like happy accidents

270
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,554
and capitalizing on those happy accidents.

271
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,475
These relationships are super important

272
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,956
because sometimes people just don't wanna talk.

273
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:12,517
We heard that Beep, which is a game store that specializes in arcade and old PC hardware stuff.

274
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,377
we heard that they had some SNK games that we didn't have access to.

275
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,321
And the manager told us to come over whenever we wanted and check it out.

276
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,603
So when I arrived, nobody wanted to talk to me.

277
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,966
They thought maybe I had been talking to the wrong beep Twitter account.

278
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,708
They didn't know what I was talking about.

279
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,089
They didn't know what I was asking for.

280
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,432
They just had no idea why I was there.

281
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:34,633
And they were like, please go.

282
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,599
I still love Beep, no shade on them, but they generally shooed me out of the store after

283
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:43,424
I had gone 300 miles to get there from Osaka.

284
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:46,648
But you know, you win some, you lose some.

285
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:53,487
So I want to dive a little deeper into this archaeology thing and take you with me on

286
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:56,309
three of my archaeological journeys here.

287
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:01,554
So this is Space Micon Kit, which is part of the Micon Kit series of games.

288
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:05,577
They're like brick breakers, similar to Breakout.

289
00:18:06,138 --> 00:18:10,522
And they're some of the earliest games that SNK ever made, definitely the earliest ones they put their name on.

290
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,301
All we had was two flyers, these two flyers.

291
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:17,903
We'd never seen the machine.

292
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:18,743
We'd never played it.

293
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,105
We'd never met anyone who had.

294
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,647
But another preservation organization

295
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,490
told us we might be able to find it in a warehouse way

296
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,952
out in Tatsuno, which is really in the middle of nowhere.

297
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,135
So I knew it was time to take a trip.

298
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,118
I started in Tokyo.

299
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,641
I was actually staying there with my friend Jake Kasdal

300
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:36,981
from 17-bit.

301
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,789
By the way, I don't live in Japan, so I have to capitalize on every opportunity I get when I get out there.

302
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,732
It's like, okay, I'm here, I gotta go.

303
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:47,836
So I started in Kyoto.

304
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:54,235
and had to take a local train, a bullet train, and a charter bus to get to this place.

305
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,197
You can see my general route here.

306
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:58,699
Tatsuno is very far away, very small.

307
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,761
There's actually a bigger Tatsuno that everyone assumed I was trying

308
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:03,222
to go to when I would ask questions.

309
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,465
You can also see I've circled Tokyo on the right there.

310
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,767
That's how far it is away from that as well.

311
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:13,391
It's far. So first, two trains to Nagoya.

312
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:15,172
Missed my bus by five minutes.

313
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:16,653
Had to wait an hour and a half.

314
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,435
Didn't have time to go to the book off.

315
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:19,135
Really disappointing.

316
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:26,728
Got on the bus and rode for hours across some real countryside Japan.

317
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:30,391
And I saw this incredibly spooky rundown school that you see on the right.

318
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,473
It's like straight out of a horror film.

319
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:33,153
It was amazing.

320
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:38,018
Made a quick stop at the bus-mandated souvenir location.

321
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:44,184
And then I arrived in Tatsuno, population 10,000, which for Japan is incredibly small.

322
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,933
And the proprietor of this warehouse we were trying to get to picked me up in his car.

323
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:53,076
And at first I was like, how's he even going to know who I am? How will he know to look for me?

324
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,859
But then I remembered, I'm the white guy, the only white guy in this town.

325
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,464
So we drove to the warehouse. And basically, every time I rounded a corner, I felt like I

326
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:11,009
was in a different period film. It was a pretty amazing place. And then we arrive here, Takai

327
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,029
Shokai, run by.

328
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,739
Takai-san, who has been doing this since his 20s.

329
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,101
He has one assistant that you can see in the back.

330
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:19,663
He's in his 60s now.

331
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:23,408
He's been doing it basically since the 70s.

332
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,850
Is that longer than 40 years?

333
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,170
Anyway.

334
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:31,920
Even here, I had to build rapport. It took a couple of hours of conversation and convincing

335
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:37,366
and a letter that I had brought from SNK, like a physical letter that was signed before I could go

336
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:41,950
back and check out what he had on offer. Every time I'd be like, so you got that thing? He'd be

337
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,754
like, let's talk some more first. So, you know, I kind of talked to him about how important it was

338
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:52,960
that he was, that he had all these games, that he was preserving them. I actually didn't realize it.

339
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,772
quite how much he had and how important what he was doing was until later.

340
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:02,874
But you know, eventually we got to where he said I could come and check stuff out.

341
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:06,155
So after all this, did he indeed have Space Micon?

342
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:12,057
He sure did. I got to play it. I got to see how it worked. Everything.

343
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:15,918
And so many things that we assumed about this game were wrong,

344
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:17,919
and it was absolutely vital that I played this.

345
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,631
Not only did he have Space Micon, he had tons of other, well, at least four other SNK games

346
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:27,655
that we didn't know very much about. On the bottom right, he's showing me a game called

347
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:33,161
Mahjong Gakuen. Nobody knows what this game is. There was almost no information on the internet

348
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:37,506
before I played it. There were rumors that it was a strip mahjong game, but actually it was just

349
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,829
totally tame, not very exciting.

350
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,630
regular old Mahjong, but there were some critical things that we learned about it

351
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,452
from being able to play it and see it there. On the left here, he's got a complete set of

352
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:57,195
Data East Deco Arcade system cartridges, they're tapes actually, that were given to him by the

353
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:05,297
owner, the former owner of Data East. It's just, he has a lot of stuff. This is just one small view

354
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:07,918
of what he's got. In fact,

355
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:12,816
He has drawers for every arcade game he's aware ever existed in Japan.

356
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,618
If he's got the board, it's in the drawer.

357
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,002
If he doesn't, he's still got a drawer ready for it in case he gets it later.

358
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:22,808
He has whatever flyers he's been able to acquire in that drawer.

359
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,850
It's a fantastic resource.

360
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:30,504
All of this led to just a few sentences about four games in the collection.

361
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:35,487
But with Space Micon as an example, we thought it wouldn't have a dumpable CPU and would just

362
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:39,610
be a collection of circuits and transistors like other early arcade games. We also thought

363
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,333
it would have a unique connection like so many games in like 1979 had.

364
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,450
But all of this was wrong.

365
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,111
It's regular JAMA.

366
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:50,312
It has a CPU that could be dumped and preserved.

367
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,814
We couldn't dump the game within the confines

368
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,075
of this collection, but without this trip,

369
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,697
every piece of information we had about that

370
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,739
and three other games would have been incorrect.

371
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,160
And also now we know Space Micon can be dumped

372
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,202
in the future, so it was absolutely worth it.

373
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,301
Let's do some more flat-footed detective work.

374
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:16,287
So, in the 70s, there was a popular song called Yosaku, about the difficult life of a woodcutter.

375
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:22,171
This song was so popular that several companies made arcade games about it. I didn't know exactly

376
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:26,894
how many, but I knew there were several. And including SNK, they made one. Now,

377
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:30,257
this game has never been dumped, and I was determined to find it.

378
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:36,090
So to find out how many games there were, let's go back to Takai Shokai's drawers.

379
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,814
I asked him how many Yosaku games were made and he's like, let's go see.

380
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,356
So we go up there, he brings me to the drawers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

381
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:45,698
There's 5.

382
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:50,081
Awesome. Like that information in itself is cool.

383
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,444
He didn't have the board, but he did have a flyer.

384
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:57,925
and I noticed some writing on the back so I asked to check it out and it turns out the game was so

385
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:04,406
unpopular and it lasted there for such a short time that a Game Center employee wrote instructions

386
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:08,327
for installing another game onto it before throwing it away. They were basically just

387
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:14,408
using it as scratch paper and after he tossed it Takai-san salvaged it and it turns out actually

388
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:18,229
that's how he gets a lot of got a lot of his flyers. He would just get whatever they were

389
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,029
throwing away and just keep it.

390
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:26,619
It was super important that he had that foresight 40-something years ago.

391
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,004
Later, I'm in Osaka in an area called Shinsekai with my friend Diamond Fight.

392
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,948
And Diamond says, hey, you want to check out this arcade that's only open twice per month?

393
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:39,370
And obviously, that is exactly what I want to do.

394
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,034
So we go to Kinako, which I did not get a good front picture of, sorry.

395
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:49,074
It's a mostly Western-oriented vintage game arcade,

396
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,315
which wasn't that exciting to me.

397
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,896
But since they have so many older games,

398
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,436
I thought they might know about Yosaku.

399
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,097
So I asked.

400
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:57,457
And they're like, oh, the wood chopping game?

401
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:58,438
That's promising.

402
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:00,699
He's like, sure.

403
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:02,960
Two months ago, I saw it down at Zarigani,

404
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,940
but I think it's gone now.

405
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,602
So this is exciting, because Zarigani is an arcade that is

406
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:12,603
in walking distance in Shinsekai, and so we went there.

407
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,441
There's no Yosaku inside, unfortunately, but we predicted that.

408
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:21,423
But the real unfortunate thing is it's an unstaffed arcade,

409
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,903
so there's nobody to even ask about this.

410
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:28,465
Diamond and I walked to all the other arcades in the area and asked about it.

411
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,185
And after by the time that.

412
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:35,127
shady dude in a smoke-filled strip mahjong themed den said,

413
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:39,392
listen buddy we don't all talk to each other. I realized I'd kind of hit a wall and should maybe

414
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:44,939
maybe just leave it alone for a little bit. I asked Diamond to check up on the place and

415
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:48,965
see whether he could find a staff member since he lives in Osaka but he never found one.

416
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:56,610
Later, back home, I managed to find someone on Twitter who was documenting or trying to

417
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,131
document every game that came through Zarigani.

418
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,352
So I got in touch with them and found out that, unfortunately, it was never SNK's Yosaku

419
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:04,792
at all.

420
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:06,273
It was the one by Wing.

421
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,214
And the fact is, they're all about chopping wood, so it's no wonder the guy in the first

422
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:15,495
arcade got confused anyway.

423
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,896
So there's no way to play Yosaku that we know of.

424
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:23,741
You can play a pirate knockoff, which is on the Epoch Cassette Vision,

425
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:29,231
or you can play an official SNK remake, which is incredibly hidden in this wild way where...

426
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:43,384
If you take the Neo Geo Pocket color game, King of Fighters Battle to Paradise, and put it into a black and white Neo Geo Pocket, it will launch a hidden remake of Yosaku, which is bizarre, but there it is.

427
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:50,791
Takai-san does not believe there's a single board left in Japan, but then that screenshot that I have in the upper left...

428
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,104
that is taken from a YouTube video. Somebody owns this thing and they won't tell me who they are or

429
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:03,747
what it is, how they have it. So unfortunately this is where the trail ends for me because

430
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:10,190
SNK 40th is out and without official backing I can't get permission to get these games,

431
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,811
but maybe someone else can follow my trail and find it.

432
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:25,466
So the search for Yosaku was a failure, but in between those failures, sometimes you find something totally amazing.

433
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:34,273
This is Koji Takaya, the director of Samurai Shodown 5 and 6, as well as Arcanaheart and a bunch of other big fighting games.

434
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:38,016
I got to interview him during the making of the Samurai Shodown collection.

435
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:43,340
And while we were talking, my friend from SNK and I got a notion to ask about Akaspeed.

436
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:50,356
That was the nickname given this mysterious version of Samurai Shodown 5 that had a red logo.

437
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:55,697
And there's a, what I'm showing here is a website that was dedicated to figuring out what this was,

438
00:27:56,577 --> 00:28:00,998
because it was basically legendary for 15 plus years.

439
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:05,539
It was on location tests for only a few hours, and almost nothing was known about it.

440
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,199
And there were only these six shaky screenshots.

441
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,160
So we asked Takai-san,

442
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:15,537
What is this thing? Have you heard of this thing? And he looked kind of shifty, but we pressed,

443
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:22,124
you know, I have an SNK person by my side who's saying it's okay, and so we start talking about

444
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,250
it. Turns out it was Samurai Shodown 5 Kanzenban, or Perfect Edition, a complete but unreleased

445
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,374
Samurai Shodown game, which had been pulled after those few hours of location test.

446
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:37,386
Short version of the story is SNK USA commissioned it

447
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:39,527
without permission from Japan.

448
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:43,050
And Japan was going through all these company shifts right then

449
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,012
between Arise and Playmore and trying

450
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:46,313
to get back to SNK again.

451
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:49,135
Anyway, we asked if he had it.

452
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,478
And weeks later, we get this.

453
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,581
Turns out one of Takaya's coworkers had it

454
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,343
on an old dusty hard drive.

455
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:03,009
This is him playing it to confirm that it is indeed the final ROM.

456
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:05,711
You can see the red logo there, which is why it was called Akaspi,

457
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:07,252
red samurai spirits.

458
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,695
So we got it, and we put it in the collection.

459
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:16,919
And now 15 years later, the final completed official SNK Neo Geo game

460
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,100
has been released.

461
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,502
This is a game that in the grand scheme of things,

462
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:24,384
nobody even knew existed, or they knew that something existed,

463
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:25,825
but they didn't know what it was.

464
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,627
And we were able to find this and release it.

465
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,463
And not only that, we're able to translate it, translate the story,

466
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,365
which is one of the main new things about it.

467
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,967
It becomes this link between Samurai Shodown 5 and 6

468
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:42,791
that just was gone forever otherwise.

469
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:46,754
And Digital Eclipse with SNK's blessing added the word perfect

470
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:49,075
to the title screen, which is what they intended

471
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,336
to do upon release anyway.

472
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,178
But that's a whole conversation for another time.

473
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:56,545
But this kind of thing is the holy grail of game archaeology.

474
00:29:56,745 --> 00:30:00,329
It's something that I hope I can keep doing for a long time.

475
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,492
This is exactly what we want.

476
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:11,350
out of this kind of preservation and museum-oriented curation of games and bringing that

477
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,532
to people that wouldn't be able to see it otherwise. But obviously it's not that easy

478
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:21,654
because finding and preserving these games takes a lot of time and often fails as you have seen

479
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:27,857
through my trials, or it succeeds through luck and perseverance, or you know it's all kinds of things.

480
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:33,157
Basically, you need to get people to talk about things they're not supposed to have or know about,

481
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:37,760
then get permission from the rights holder to get them to release those things or info to you.

482
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:43,324
And that's not even getting to the actual preservation or presentation part, which is not what I handle.

483
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,945
And that's what the rest of the whole team does.

484
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:47,087
And that's a whole other situation.

485
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:52,130
And unfortunately, without funding behind a collection like one of these ones that I've worked on,

486
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,673
there's no way to justify rights holders letting you have this information.

487
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,234
So you just get stuck a lot.

488
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:04,621
For example, we don't have the data for the Famicom version

489
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:08,004
of Guevara and, or, aka, Guerrilla War.

490
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:08,885
We know where it is.

491
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:10,046
There it is.

492
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:11,287
Those are the disks.

493
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,390
But we can't get it because we don't have an official way

494
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,231
to do it.

495
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:21,336
There's an unreleased Super Famicom RPG that I found out about.

496
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,899
It stars a popular character from a big company.

497
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,021
A former employee has the data.

498
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:30,648
but not even the current employees of that company remembered that this game existed.

499
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:36,430
Maybe very few people knew it existed at all. It's not like there's a finished ROM or anything,

500
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,112
but there's map data, there's illustrations, there's tons of pre-production work,

501
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,413
but there's no funding so we can't get it.

502
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:50,509
So to kind of wrap this up, what can you do to help?

503
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,853
Developers, save everything, steal important things

504
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:58,958
from work, keep them, give them to somebody later,

505
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,362
donate to the Video Game History Foundation, gamehistory.org,

506
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:06,946
and importantly for us, buy these collections

507
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,088
and convince companies that they should make more of them.

508
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:13,701
I really hope that Digital Eclipse can keep bringing these games to light for years to come,

509
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,584
and the only way that that will happen is if these games do well,

510
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:21,250
and if we can make more of them, and if you, you know, like, pressure Konami to be like...

511
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:28,036
let Brandon and Digital Eclipse make a Hudson collection. I want to make that. Tell SNK you

512
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:35,445
want a Neo Geo Pocket collection. I want to make that. So that's what would help the most. And

513
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:41,632
if you want to check out more stuff from me, we just had a game called Gunsport, which just came

514
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:41,852
out.

515
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:46,436
on Stadia if you want to check that out, my podcast Insert Credit if you want to hear more

516
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:51,760
stories like these and it's also with Tim Rogers and Frank Cifaldi. You can talk to me on our

517
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,765
forums, follow me on Twitter and that's it. Thanks very much.
