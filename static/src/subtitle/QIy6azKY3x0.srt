1
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:06,714
All right, hello.

2
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:08,195
My name is Robert Morgan.

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,098
I'm a game writer, and I'm a narrative designer.

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:14,541
And since last year, I'm also a digital dramaturge,

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,502
whatever that is.

6
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:17,623
I always start with a question.

7
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:19,885
And this year, the question is, how often

8
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,146
has this happened to you?

9
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:24,269
You're about six years old, and you're happily

10
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,971
playing an imagination game with a fellow player.

11
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:28,733
Pew, pew.

12
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:32,236
You shoot your opponent with an imaginary gun, fair and square.

13
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:34,469
except no.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,250
They tell you, no, you missed.

15
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:37,631
Fair enough.

16
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,493
This is a collaborative, imaginative space.

17
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:43,794
So this time, you take careful aim, announcing,

18
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:46,956
I take careful aim, and you shoot.

19
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:48,076
Bing.

20
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:51,338
They tell you their force field deflected it.

21
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,039
I'm seeing a lot of nods.

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,220
You're not playing it right.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,801
No, you're not playing it right.

24
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,821
I'm going home.

25
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:01,443
Yeah, I had an older brother, so this came up a lot.

26
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:08,092
Now, did their imaginary equipment include a force field a minute ago?

27
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:12,514
They didn't mention it, but then it wouldn't have made tactical sense to mention it, would

28
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:12,594
it?

29
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:16,876
War is deception, and today's six-year-olds have to grow up so fast.

30
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:22,270
Now in principle, digital games are supposed to resolve this issue, right?

31
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,693
We can all play in a space with stable, agreed-upon rules,

32
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:30,956
and an algorithm somewhere determines whether each bullet reached its target.

33
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:34,799
Except, of course, it rarely works like that in practice.

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,323
What I want to talk about today is what happens between these two systems of play.

35
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:45,246
Because in the last few years, I've been working somewhere between these two spaces.

36
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:50,210
I've been making augmented reality layers of digital narrative and gameplay

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,634
that are laid over the real world, in real venues and public places,

38
00:01:55,154 --> 00:02:00,418
with a mix of digital interactions and interactions with real-world puzzles and actors.

39
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,521
It's a state of play that's part arbitrary system.

40
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,766
and part consensus collaborative play.

41
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:10,607
Working out how to make narrative compelling in this space

42
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,187
has been a huge challenge.

43
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,788
But I believe it's a challenge we have to meet

44
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:19,289
because AR technology is already adding extra dimensions

45
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,930
of gameplay and story to real places

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,851
and to people's normal lives

47
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:27,012
because reality is cheap and plentiful.

48
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:30,253
The graphics are great and it rarely glitches out.

49
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:35,558
But reality is also notoriously poorly designed, with major balance issues.

50
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,663
Our players are increasingly accustomed to shifting between realities.

51
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:44,548
Today I want to talk about how to make stories that can shift realities with them.

52
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,405
Because there's no doubt that whether it's

53
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:51,588
internet of places, or hyper-local content,

54
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:56,431
or context-sensitive AR, or reality browsers, which

55
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,373
is the latest buzzword I'm trying to get going,

56
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:01,695
pretty soon the devices we carry or wear

57
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:04,697
will be able to direct us not just from our driveway

58
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:06,899
down the freeway to our destination,

59
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,381
but to a specific platform, and a specific train,

60
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,703
a specific carriage, a specific seat.

61
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:16,644
to a specific product on a specific shelf in a store.

62
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:20,225
And that's to say nothing of the promise of augmented reality

63
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:23,447
to allow us to tag content to the real world.

64
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,387
The appeal is obvious.

65
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:28,608
The time is coming where we'll have to deal with the fact

66
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,130
that we're increasingly able to customize our own level of reality.

67
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,556
It's a paradigm shift that I think will be at least as significant as the original smartphone revolution.

68
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:46,825
And my ambition is to start figuring out how to use these new paradigms to tell stories that happen to take place in the real world.

69
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,368
There's quite a lot of echo. Can everybody hear me okay?

70
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:50,396
Yeah?

71
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:51,176
OK, great.

72
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,096
So first off, a bit about me.

73
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:56,117
I started off my career as an assistant editor at PlayStation.

74
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,557
I ended up a lead writer and voice director

75
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:01,638
on Wonder Book, Book of Spells, and its sequel,

76
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,458
Book of Potions, which I wrote in collaboration with J.K.

77
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:04,819
Rowling.

78
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,779
It was an augmented reality title

79
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,079
that came with a real paper and cardboard book in the box.

80
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,000
And you showed the book to your PlayStation camera

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,940
while sitting in your living room.

82
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:17,861
And.

83
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,961
The first lesson that I learned about AR, the most important lesson really, the ones

84
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:28,003
that stayed with me ever since, is that not only is the player and the protagonist kind

85
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:32,004
of the same person when they're sitting in their living room with a magic spell book,

86
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:37,627
looking at themselves on a camera feed and watching themselves play the game, but it's

87
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:38,647
also that

88
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,783
You have to start asking players certain kinds of questions

89
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:46,648
in order to get them engaged more than they might otherwise

90
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,151
be getting engaged in a flat screen or traditional 2D game.

91
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:52,734
While players were first getting the grips with the book,

92
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,717
we had a voice prompt that prompted them to start interacting,

93
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,579
which asked us a question, a very simple question.

94
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,774
Are you a wizard or not?

95
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,816
It's a question everybody knows the answer to, because it's in the books.

96
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:18,038
Harry gets asked this very question at the end of book one.

97
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,159
But more importantly, a player sitting in their living room answering this question

98
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
is answering inside the fiction.

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,101
It turns an idle moment, an awkward kind of self-conscious moment,

100
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,942
into a moment of self-definition for the player.

101
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:32,883
And they define themselves.

102
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:39,879
Inside the fiction. It's a question that helps make space for them to put on their wizard hat and robe in order to participate

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,642
And in many ways I've been asking this same question ever since

104
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:48,247
Now I have either three jobs or I have one job in three parts depending on who you ask I

105
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,790
write games specializing in VR scripts most recently a fisherman's tale

106
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,412
which came out from Innerspace.

107
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:58,098
I consult on narrative and AR and VR for various people.

108
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,583
And for the last three years, I've been creative director of Playlines.

109
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:07,010
And we make location-based, interactive, augmented reality theater.

110
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,932
Or, depending on who I'm talking to...

111
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:15,096
Mixed Reality Digital Performance, or XR Enhanced Live Content,

112
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:20,579
whether it's AR or MR or XR or my new favourite, Merged Reality,

113
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,202
my goal has been to explore this hybrid medium, to experiment with AR's promise of delivering

114
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:31,285
digital layers of adventure that players explore by navigating what, for simplicity's sake,

115
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:34,947
I'm now calling the hard layer, that is, actual reality.

116
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:41,685
Our goal is to build a track record of making large-scale, narrative-led AR using cheap,

117
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:47,552
minimum viable technology, in this case, digital audio and real-world actors.

118
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:52,338
And I want to do it without waiting for the visual technology, the visors and the holograms,

119
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,421
without waiting until they're good enough.

120
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:58,583
to create complete and convincing digital fictions in the real world.

121
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:03,045
I want to build a track record now, so I'm certainly not going to slow down to wait for

122
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:06,387
the definitions of AR or VRXR or whatever else to catch up.

123
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:14,011
What we found is that in real-world AR adventures, where 90% of what the player experiences is

124
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:15,011
the real world...

125
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,527
Digital narrative works best when you deliver just enough,

126
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,128
just season it over the player's experience,

127
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,149
just enough to recontextualize the real world around them,

128
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,790
to make players relate to what they're seeing

129
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,511
and where they're standing and where they're going

130
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,291
in a more adventurous way.

131
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:37,173
In AR, you cannot tell the player

132
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:39,073
you are in the dragon's cave.

133
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,154
It just doesn't work.

134
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:45,445
But instead, we can give the player a story that takes place inside them.

135
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:50,967
We can tell the player you're being watched or just act normal.

136
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:54,308
As you'll know if you've ever said this to someone at a party,

137
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:58,230
you can completely change someone's relationship to the world around them

138
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,431
just with seasoning them with a little bit of story.

139
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,032
This is mixed reality.

140
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:07,736
And as you'll know if you've ever walked down the street imaginatively going pew pew,

141
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:12,505
or used a stick as a sword, or imagined enemies in the bushes, or Pokemon at the bus stop,

142
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:15,991
activating a little bit of imagination goes a long way.

143
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:19,162
Now, most important slide in the talk.

144
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:20,723
What does all this actually mean?

145
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,984
I have a video of our most recent installation,

146
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,485
which was at Future Storytelling Festival in New York.

147
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,186
It is a collaboration with a UK grime artist

148
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,047
called Harry Shotta.

149
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,148
This is a hip hop experience that turned any venue

150
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,150
into a story-driven nightclub experience.

151
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,451
Content warning, because of the nature of the content,

152
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,052
there is swearing, and although it is an anti-drug piece,

153
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:41,673
it has a reference to drugs in it.

154
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:43,534
Let's find out if the video works.

155
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,056
Please.

156
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,661
Hmm, let's see.

157
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:54,622
Hey.

158
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,303
Sound?

159
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,429
Now let me tell you about yourself.

160
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,730
You absolute waste man.

161
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:26,811
Hold on.

162
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,172
How you gonna lie to my mate?

163
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,852
You're the same old Lucas from the estate.

164
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:30,312
Hold on.

165
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:31,273
Sorry lad, sorry.

166
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,673
Yo, Ellie, Ellie, come back, come back.

167
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,754
Oi, just let me talk to her, let me talk to her.

168
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:35,774
As for you, player.

169
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,615
I see you've made your decision.

170
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:38,735
Goodbye.

171
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,845
Hey man what's happening? You don't look right. Talk to me man, you still shook from the fight.

172
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,467
Are you playing a joke? You wanna talk or you split?

173
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:50,270
That boy don't look right. Oi, come look at this!

174
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,623
So that was an installation of Future of Storytelling.

175
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:06,006
We were nominated with finalists for the Innovation

176
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:06,907
in Storytelling Prize.

177
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,730
It was an interactive layer of music and story

178
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,292
spread throughout a historic venue.

179
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:12,333
You explored rooms.

180
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,996
Characters in the audio layer would come and talk to you,

181
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:15,877
tell you where to go next.

182
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,819
And the character that you chose to follow,

183
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,380
the room that you chose to go to,

184
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:22,884
which storylines you chose to pursue by physically navigating

185
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:23,385
the venue.

186
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,368
determined what happened in the story and led to one of five different endings.

187
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,470
And as you saw, there are interactions with real-world actors

188
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,993
who exist both in the digital layer as a character and in the hard layer.

189
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,156
So in that case, players received through the digital layer a password

190
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:42,079
which they then gave verbally to a bouncer to be allowed into a VIP area.

191
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,902
Now at its basic level, players arrive at a venue, download an app,

192
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:47,843
plug in some headphones and start exploring.

193
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,485
We seed the venue with Bluetooth eye beacons

194
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:51,867
which we use to track the player.

195
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,158
much more accurately than GPS.

196
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,962
And so we can start treating where the player goes

197
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:59,646
as a story decision made inside the game layer.

198
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,529
We have a game engine running in the back end,

199
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,031
and we can track those decisions

200
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,535
and make sure the consequences of your actions

201
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:06,977
follow you through the story.

202
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,239
This is one of our narrative design diagrams.

203
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,461
Once we're able to deliver a story directly to the player like this,

204
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:15,703
we can start building up complex layers of interactive fiction,

205
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:18,244
which just happen to take place in the real world.

206
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:22,847
But in these experiences, the player's the site, the interface between fiction.

207
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:29,854
Once they're on board the narrative, the player gets to decide how much is fiction and how much is real.

208
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:35,339
And the story is there to help them along because some players need more help than others,

209
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,663
particularly if they're a bit self-conscious, if they struggle with the doofus factor.

210
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:41,926
The doofus factor.

211
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:47,236
Niantic themselves have identified that Pokemon Go potentially suffers from the doofus factor.

212
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,858
When your app has a critical mass, this can actually be a good thing.

213
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:55,280
Because seeing other people on the street being dorky, being visibly surrounded by our

214
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,001
fellow dorks is a really great feeling.

215
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,602
Welcome to GDC, by the way.

216
00:11:58,702 --> 00:11:59,922
How's it going, everyone?

217
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,365
It helps us all bring us out of our dorky shells.

218
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:06,048
But because in Playlines we use audio,

219
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,472
we're speaking directly to one player at a time.

220
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,554
And we often install our fiction layers

221
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:13,776
within busy festivals or public spaces

222
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,199
to add a dimension of story or adventure,

223
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:19,823
to create a population of engaged, exploring users

224
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,686
who see the same space in a more adventurous light.

225
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:27,211
But if we leave those players to get over the doofus barrier themselves without any help,

226
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:32,037
at best we're limiting the number of players who will get the most out of the experience,

227
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:35,841
and at worst we're excluding players who want to be part of it,

228
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:41,347
but who aren't primed to do the kinds of semi-imaginative play or role playing out on the street.

229
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:48,996
In conventional play, in conventional design, we think of self-consciousness as the antithesis of immersion.

230
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:53,902
The kid who does this, who keeps destabilizing the reality of collaborative play,

231
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:57,626
this kid is somehow worse than the kid who always has a deflector shield.

232
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,687
It's part of why Punch Drunk Theater, who created Sleep No More,

233
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,212
anonymizes their player audiences by putting masks on them.

234
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:09,878
It makes players feel more free to explore environments without social cost.

235
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,665
But in our installations, we found that achieving immersion in AR

236
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:19,949
It's not the same thing as chasing down and eliminating the player's self-consciousness.

237
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,693
Because we don't want to overwrite the player's identity, even if we could.

238
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:29,437
And the player's self-consciousness, yes, their shyness, is part of their identity.

239
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,940
It's a mistake to pretend the player isn't there,

240
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,004
because in AR, the most important reality you're augmenting is the player themselves.

241
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,016
Because, and if you've seen me speak before, you won't be surprised to learn,

242
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:43,938
that I think this is all about embodiment.

243
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:49,241
In my VR work, I argue that what's exciting about VR is not just who you're seeing,

244
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,002
but who you're being.

245
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:54,324
The player is radically embodied in a VR scene

246
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:56,525
in a way that they just aren't in any other format.

247
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:00,168
And so you have an opportunity not just to give the player something cool to look at,

248
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,009
but to show that the simulation looks back.

249
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:07,635
Because embodiment comes with a lot of powerful effects, including self-consciousness.

250
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:11,137
In VR, if you pretend the player isn't really present,

251
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,358
if they're just no more than an invisible flying camera,

252
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:18,460
then the player doesn't have any emotional or physical stake in the scene.

253
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,761
They literally have no skin in the game.

254
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:25,347
But in AR, the player's really standing in front of you.

255
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,310
And they really are wondering if you're going to embarrass them

256
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,391
or heckle them.

257
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:30,953
Their feet probably hurt.

258
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:32,755
And their phone is running out of battery.

259
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,116
And they're worried about Brexit.

260
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:38,301
Embodiment, the fact that they really are there,

261
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:41,905
that's what's keeping them feeling like it's all real,

262
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,367
maybe even a bit too real.

263
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,250
And if you exclude all that from your fiction,

264
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,172
it's a huge flashing sign to them that it isn't real,

265
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,372
that they don't have to emotionally engage.

266
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,894
This doesn't mean that players don't want to take part.

267
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:56,954
Players want to be part of your fictions.

268
00:14:56,994 --> 00:15:00,636
That's why it's called willing suspension of disbelief.

269
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:04,397
But it's a collaboration, and you have to meet them halfway.

270
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,272
So how do we design interactions which allow players to merge the two realities they're

271
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:10,773
dealing with?

272
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,934
Interactions that bring the player more into the fiction, no matter what they're feeling

273
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:17,996
when they're standing in the real world worried about the doofus factor.

274
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:22,098
Well, the easiest example comes from working with kids,

275
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,800
because kids are accustomed to shifting

276
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,282
between multiple realities and changing the rules.

277
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,484
But they're also generally not too good

278
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,805
at playing a specific character that you give them

279
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:33,847
and following the rules of that character.

280
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,168
They'll blow right through all of that

281
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:38,070
and expose exactly how much space your fiction leaves

282
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,591
for them and their real feelings,

283
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,293
especially boredom, especially self-consciousness.

284
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,475
This is the Dream Finder.

285
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:46,776
Anyone familiar with this character?

286
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,122
This is a costume character at Epcot.

287
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,939
He was part of a ride that was all about imagination.

288
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:55,881
The character was originated from one of my personal heroes, Ron Schneider.

289
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:59,324
And he wrote a book about the early days of the character in the 80s,

290
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,766
in the golden era of the autograph book.

291
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:05,850
Kids were coming up, and instead of interacting as a character,

292
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,551
instead of talking about imagination,

293
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:11,194
giving him a chance to work a little bit of character magic,

294
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,656
they just wanted an autograph, and then to go.

295
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:17,380
Because, by and large, kids want a safe,

296
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,302
Social interaction where they know they're not going to screw up.

297
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:25,886
Especially when confronted with somebody who's not only cool, but kind of intimidating.

298
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,727
The character has a bubble of fiction around them.

299
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,869
The character's trying to invite the kids in.

300
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:32,610
The kids were bouncing straight off

301
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,892
because they wanted a safe interaction behind the autograph book.

302
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:39,094
And so one day, Ron started asking kids,

303
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:40,796
what are you?

304
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,798
Why are you smaller than all of these taller people?

305
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,798
What's a child?

306
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,299
Explain to me what a child is.

307
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,389
It's one of my favorite pieces of interaction design ever.

308
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:52,310
It's banging.

309
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,973
Kids love answering questions that they know the answer to,

310
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,935
especially if an adult doesn't know the answer.

311
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:00,877
The dream finder takes the risk.

312
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,637
He looks silly.

313
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,318
He's already done all of the clowning.

314
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,341
So in comedy terms, the kid gets to be the straight man.

315
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,833
Through this question, the performer expands and opens the bubble of fiction

316
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:14,213
with an easy point of access for the kid.

317
00:17:14,553 --> 00:17:19,674
And it actually uses the player's own self-awareness to fuel their immersion,

318
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:21,935
because it asks them to account for themselves,

319
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:24,936
to explain their presence, to use their self-consciousness

320
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,236
in a way that is now suddenly in fiction,

321
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,677
in a way which encompasses the emotions

322
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:33,077
that normally would be disruptive to immersion.

323
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:36,038
And instead it makes those feelings part of the fiction

324
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:37,258
that they're participating in.

325
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,184
It's another way of asking a question which the player already knows the answer to.

326
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:46,990
They have a gut reaction answer ready to go, and that answer brings them further into the

327
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,491
fiction.

328
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:52,196
This is what I mean when I say that in AR narratives, in the real world, we have to

329
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:55,841
deal with the player and the protagonist as the same person.

330
00:17:56,582 --> 00:18:00,863
It doesn't just mean telling the player who they should be role-playing as,

331
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:02,203
giving them a persona.

332
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,504
We have to meet them halfway.

333
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:07,765
Their feelings, including their feelings of embarrassment or foot-hurting,

334
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,026
are hard for them to ignore, and we ignore them at our peril.

335
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:16,688
When we move AR and gameplay and narrative out into the real world,

336
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,028
onto the real street,

337
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,290
we can't demand total suspension of disbelief from our players

338
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,450
before we let them play the game.

339
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,744
Because in AR Lair, 90% of what the player experiences is the real world.

340
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,847
Much of that experience is their real selves.

341
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,171
There's no point trying to tell the player you're not playing it right.

342
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:43,816
Because when the player is the protagonist, what you're really saying is, you're not right.

343
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,599
You're saying, you're not in the right kind of body to play this.

344
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,060
You're excluding them.

345
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,001
You're denying them.

346
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:53,799
In AR, we can't try to overwrite who the player is,

347
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,440
any more than we can try to tell you

348
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,722
that you're standing in a dragon's cave when you're not.

349
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:01,165
In AR role-playing, you can either

350
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:05,388
deny reality to overwrite it, or you can augment it.

351
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:09,191
More importantly, you can either deny the player's reality,

352
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:10,712
or you can augment it.

353
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:11,673
You can't do both.

354
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:14,515
Augmentation is not overwriting.

355
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:15,176
It's addition.

356
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:16,737
It's cooperation.

357
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:21,257
Because asking players to ignore what's going on with them is asking them to ignore parts

358
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:22,118
of their reality.

359
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:27,762
That limits the amount of reality available to us as storytellers to augment.

360
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:33,687
And we're missing an opportunity to surprise the player by inviting and responding to feelings

361
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:34,868
they think they're hiding.

362
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,890
Feelings which normally don't have any place in fiction.

363
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,054
The same feelings that give a ring of authenticity to really good characters, like self-consciousness.

364
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:48,140
Suddenly, you're allowing them to be their own protagonist.

365
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:50,662
It's just like when the player says,

366
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:52,124
I have a deflector shield.

367
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:52,704
Bing.

368
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:56,588
There's nothing inherently wrong with that bit of imagination.

369
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,389
Suddenly introducing a deflector shield.

370
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,351
Oh, I guess we're in a sci-fi setting after all.

371
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:01,672
It's world building.

372
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:04,094
The player's imaginatively contributing to the play,

373
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,316
but the player came up with the shield

374
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,658
because they didn't want to get shot.

375
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,153
They role-played in order to get something they want.

376
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:13,215
And I think that can be a powerful thing.

377
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:16,759
That shows us how we can use what the player wants

378
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,623
to help them turn themselves into protagonists.

379
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,985
As long as we make room in the story

380
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,187
for what they're feeling.

381
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,890
Give them a way for their emotional journey

382
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,753
to be part of their hero's journey.

383
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:32,004
That doesn't always mean giving the player what they want.

384
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:35,387
And in fact, we've had success with embarrassing the player,

385
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,289
whether that's by giving them a hostile, rebuffing encounter

386
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,831
from an actor, or dramatizing a sexual encounter

387
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,432
in the toilets during a busy festival.

388
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:43,473
Not this one, don't worry.

389
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:44,754
That was fun, though.

390
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:48,417
But the fiction made space for those feelings.

391
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:55,169
So we're starting to figure out how players relate to digital narratives in real environments.

392
00:20:55,709 --> 00:21:02,015
But because of the doofus factor, that relationship to the narrative can all too easily be disrupted

393
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,737
by the social context around them, by other people.

394
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:10,802
But if you do it right, the presence of other people around the player can also enhance

395
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:11,662
their experience.

396
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,262
While you're trying to get players to feel adventurous in real world spaces, festivals,

397
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:21,485
public places, you also need to help many of them get past the worry, the chance, however

398
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:26,808
small, the fear shared by all nerds, really by anyone who plays imagination games, the

399
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,709
fear that they will be heckled by jocks.

400
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:35,232
So we had to work out how to make self-consciousness a virtue in our AR layers.

401
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:40,502
We had to find new ways of doing it, like giving our players the opportunity to look

402
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:42,448
cool in front of other people.

403
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,788
One of the ways we do this is to create FOMO,

404
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:47,769
fear of missing out.

405
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,210
There's nothing that creates FOMO like a velvet rope.

406
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,231
So you saw in the video our bouncer character

407
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,131
wearing sunglasses.

408
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,972
This is a character who not only provides

409
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,753
a gate in our gameplay, once the player has

410
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,634
found the appropriate password in the digital layer,

411
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:05,895
they can verbally give the password in the hard layer

412
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:07,595
and get access to the VIP area.

413
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,456
But that VIP area is not accessible to anybody

414
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:11,957
who isn't running our experience.

415
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:13,717
So in the middle of a busy festival,

416
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,358
we created a purely exclusive environment

417
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,959
that everyone who doesn't have one of our bright green Play

418
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:22,940
Lines branded pairs of headphones on looks at and goes,

419
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,801
those people know something that I don't.

420
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:26,282
How do I get in there?

421
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:28,082
And the only answer is that you have

422
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:29,423
to run one of our experiences.

423
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:32,604
Most of immersive theater is fueled by FOMO,

424
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:33,704
fear of missing out.

425
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:37,105
Because a larger possibility space than a single user

426
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:40,166
can see prompts replay and a sense of reality.

427
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:44,127
Hero moments, where the player gets a unique, visible place

428
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:47,630
in the immersive theater story, can increase engagement.

429
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,952
But sometimes it comes at the cost of immersion

430
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:50,913
for other players.

431
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:53,715
Because people begin to game your story,

432
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:56,838
to treat it as a vending machine for story moments.

433
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,821
And so after our players get through the red rope,

434
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:01,622
they enter a dance area.

435
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:03,244
It's kind of like a silent disco.

436
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:04,425
It's full of other players.

437
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:08,268
We move them from the end of their solo, unique,

438
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:12,650
Player directed, highly consequential journey in audio,

439
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,151
where we've been speaking directly to them.

440
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,532
And we suddenly move them out into a public space

441
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:18,673
where everybody is listening to the same music channel,

442
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:21,074
even if they're surrounded by different digital characters.

443
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:24,535
Because we like moving from the private to the public,

444
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,557
because it brings the players out of their shell even more

445
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:30,678
and gives them a community experience of the adventure

446
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:31,638
that they've just had.

447
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,934
Now, in his book about working and designing themed entertainment, Ron Schneider, the Dreamfinder,

448
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:42,697
he describes the history of arguably the first theme park, Coney Island in New York.

449
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:47,780
First, there was Steeplechase Park, a collection of rides and attractions with no particular

450
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,481
theming like a traditional fairground.

451
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:51,706
Then there was Lunar Park.

452
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:55,928
The rides told a story, like the Great Chicago Fire or Journey

453
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,849
to the Moon, but they were all jumbled together

454
00:23:57,889 --> 00:23:59,049
with no unifying theme.

455
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,811
In Ron's words, guests were slammed from one reality

456
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,491
to the next.

457
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:08,836
And finally, there came Dreamland, an architectural setting inspired by Arabian Nights.

458
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:14,778
And although it's kind of a cacophony of appropriation, it was a unified setting for stories and adventures

459
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,159
where the player didn't leave the setting as they moved from activity to activity.

460
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:23,601
And as AR allows us to start bringing gameplay into the real world, whether that's static

461
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:25,461
single room hologram experiences.

462
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:28,384
Site-specific installations like Playlines work,

463
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:32,007
or location-agnostic experiences like Pokémon Go,

464
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,050
I think we need to figure out how to create stories

465
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,112
that the player wants to help tell.

466
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,934
Open worlds of story content

467
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,236
that can guide players between locations,

468
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:44,699
between activities, whether that's their grocery run,

469
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,581
or a series of rides, or a series of escape rooms,

470
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,523
between different levels of reality,

471
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,385
without them ever leaving the story.

472
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,628
because it's a story that they're telling themselves.

473
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,332
Now, if you're a business owner,

474
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:03,094
does the proliferation of AR layers,

475
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,657
does the possibility of tagging your local environment

476
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:08,659
mean you'll lose control of your spaces?

477
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,642
Well, in the digital layer, yes.

478
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,132
Will people be able to graffiti over your commercial frontage

479
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:21,274
in some ways, at some levels, digitally augmenting things

480
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:23,215
in a way that you might never be aware of?

481
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:27,238
Yes, the idea of trying to stop happening

482
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:29,519
will soon be as old-fashioned as the idea

483
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:32,220
of trying to stop people taking photos in a museum.

484
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,802
You can try, but you're competing

485
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:37,783
with humanity's collective capacity for mischief.

486
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:41,205
And more importantly, you're missing a chance.

487
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:46,208
to understand what it is that keeps bringing people back to galleries,

488
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:49,069
even though they've already seen a photo of the Mona Lisa.

489
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,131
Because places, and taking people places,

490
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:55,033
and giving them experiences in places, really matters.

491
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:59,716
If you own a cultural space, you might be about to find you have little control of the

492
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:03,418
digital utterances which are starting to be inscribed on that space.

493
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:08,960
But there's also never been a more exciting time for spaces to become multi-context, with

494
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,823
different visitors and different audiences able to use the same space as a gig, a narrative,

495
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:20,325
a LARP, a scavenger hunt, a canvas, all seamlessly and simultaneously.

496
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:22,926
Does there need to be some control?

497
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:27,136
Yes, because no one has the right to walk down your street

498
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:30,081
and scroll a digital swastika on your house,

499
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:32,525
whether they do it in a layer or not.

500
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:38,288
But I think it would be a mistake to try to confine the tools,

501
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:43,509
to try to confine the ability to inscribe on the public digital layer

502
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:47,250
to official channels, to leave it in the hands of the self-appointed.

503
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,351
Because that would mean essentially handing over monopolistic control

504
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:56,312
of digital public space to the same monolithic structures

505
00:26:56,632 --> 00:27:00,373
that we handed over control of public public space

506
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,213
in the real layer to the highest bidder.

507
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:09,675
Advertising dominates our world, and pretty soon, digital layers that might contain advertising

508
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,756
will be available on every street corner.

509
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,837
But is that all that's going to be available?

510
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:19,520
The promise of AR, ultimately, is the ability to customize how we see the world.

511
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:25,644
But what we need to avoid is allowing this technology just to give more power to the

512
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:30,627
powerful, because there are already plenty of people who can pick and choose and customize

513
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:31,347
their reality.

514
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:37,087
Ultimately the promise of AR is for us to be able to leave each other notes in the margins

515
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:37,888
of reality.

516
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:42,730
But that makes it more important than ever to make those tools available to the marginalized.

517
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:47,853
Which is why I believe that learning to tell stories in this medium, the hardest medium

518
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:53,215
of all in my opinion, reality, is important because story is something that unites us,

519
00:27:53,616 --> 00:28:00,079
despite the fundamental separation caused by our inability to share exactly how we each

520
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:00,859
see the world.

521
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:07,043
Narrative is the universal language that we developed so we could compare notes about

522
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,723
our disparate experiences of reality.

523
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:15,025
And as soon as we start working with reality as our medium, we have a responsibility to

524
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:18,686
reality, because some people's realities are harsher than others.

525
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,199
In real life, everyone is their own protagonist.

526
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,601
But games and fiction generally define and specify

527
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:27,602
who protagonists are and can be.

528
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,743
We tend to see the same kinds of protagonists

529
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:30,884
coming up all the time.

530
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,425
But not everyone gets to be the kind of protagonist

531
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,046
we typically see in games.

532
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:38,628
In games, some people get to be more protagonist than others.

533
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:43,731
But in AR, if you exclude the kind of person the player is

534
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:46,012
from the story, then you're missing out

535
00:28:46,052 --> 00:28:47,472
on the opportunity to play with them.

536
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:51,055
And that's the only way to construct meaning in AR.

537
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:55,017
Brick by brick, emotion by emotion, back and forth.

538
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:58,839
In AR, the player is already embodied in your setting.

539
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,441
They're standing there waiting to be part of the story.

540
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:02,561
And if you don't let them,

541
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,223
if you keep insisting who they should be,

542
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,705
if you keep telling them that they can only play your way,

543
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:11,587
then you might find yourself six years old again,

544
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:13,528
playing an imagination game,

545
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,269
taking careful aim,

546
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,410
and firing your imaginary gun.

547
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:20,027
I'm finding there's no one there.

548
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:22,629
And that's where I want to leave it.

549
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,591
Thank you very much.

550
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:30,878
Anybody want to stick out?

551
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:31,359
Yeah, hi.

552
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:33,862
Hello.

553
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:34,803
Hello.

554
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,086
So I own an escape room, and I'm really interested in

555
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:39,027
Sorry, go right into the mic.

556
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,008
Can you hear me now?

557
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:40,289
Yes.

558
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:46,459
I own an escape room and I'm interested in integrating some AR into my rooms.

559
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,721
Do you feel like there's a space that's too small, a physical space that's too small for AR?

560
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:55,742
I think, it's a good question.

561
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:59,423
I think that's like asking, so the question was is there a space that's too small using

562
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:00,543
escape rooms as an example.

563
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:03,924
I think that's like asking if there is such a thing as too small a story.

564
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:13,020
And I think it's about this job of story is to effectively fill whatever the dimensions of the space is with the right amount of narrative.

565
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,605
So if it's like that Hemingway short story about the shoes, that's fine, too, you know.

566
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,047
So no, I don't think so.

567
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:29,474
And I think that AR is all about adding an extra dimension, whether that's threat or affection or warmth.

568
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:33,184
In principle, definitely not.

569
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:35,926
And it's an area that I'm interested in as well.

570
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:37,468
And I think there's a lot of potential there.

571
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:40,030
But I also think that one of the potential areas

572
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,012
where AR could contribute is actually

573
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,034
extending the dimensions of the space

574
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,537
digitally so that the puzzle and the story

575
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,500
might begin before you even get to the escape room

576
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,181
and follow you home to the train station.

577
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:53,243
Questions?

578
00:30:56,778 --> 00:31:00,959
I'm probably going to be doing a breakout after this if we don't get to everybody.

579
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,099
I don't know where the breakout room is, I'm sure I'll find out.

580
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,120
But just stick around afterwards.

581
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:05,900
Hi.

582
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,060
Hi.

583
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,621
You talked about Ron Schneider and kind of the theme parks and theme entertainment as

584
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,282
immersive entertainment and storytelling.

585
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,563
And I was wondering in your experience with AR, how much does the...

586
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:29,912
The design of the actual physical environment that you're in affects the story experience.

587
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:34,278
For you as a writer for AR, how much of it goes into...

588
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,890
I'm going to create an experience, how much goes into designing the actual environment

589
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,614
and changing that, and how much of it is in whatever digital layer you're working with.

590
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:49,236
So the question is, how much do we design the spaces and what impact does that have

591
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:50,597
on the digital layer of storytelling?

592
00:31:50,997 --> 00:31:55,340
Actually in practice, most of the jobs that we've done so far as part of Playlines have

593
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,263
been with relatively minimal set dressing, because we do it within existing spaces.

594
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:04,085
So we'll take a museum, or a cultural center, or a park.

595
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:09,067
And the idea is to not try to alter too much,

596
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,268
because I'm interested in recontextualizing

597
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,248
that environment.

598
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:16,589
So we use what co-founder Dustin Freeman describes

599
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:20,031
as reverse level design, where in conventional level design,

600
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,271
you have the beats, you have the story you want to tell,

601
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,292
and you build the environment.

602
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,913
We start from the environment, and we work out

603
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,934
the story from that place based on the opportunities

604
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:29,454
that we see.

605
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,775
Is there a natural fork in the environment for a decision?

606
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:33,755
Is there a cool landmark or a nice little?

607
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:37,779
Nook, we can talk players into to have an intimate experience.

608
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:41,082
So a lot of what we currently do is reflecting on that.

609
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:44,365
But that's also partly because those types of projects don't have the budget

610
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:45,887
for a lot of on site set dressing.

611
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:49,831
And also because they tend to be while creating an additional digital layer

612
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,013
while the site is also in normal use.

613
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:54,936
So we can't have too much of a physical footprint.

614
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:58,419
I would love to set dress full environments because I wanted.

615
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,520
I want to do Shakespeare in this format, you know?

616
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:06,763
But I think that will come as more spaces become interested

617
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,224
in putting this sort of thing on.

618
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:10,264
But again, this ties up with the idea

619
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:11,685
of doing it within an escape room, where

620
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:13,106
the more you can control the environment,

621
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:15,467
the more that you can reflect that back to the player

622
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,828
and get the player doing something specific.

623
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:22,370
But it doesn't have to work that way if the story fits

624
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,171
the environment correctly.

625
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:25,612
Does that make sense?

626
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:25,992
Yeah.

627
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:26,372
Thank you.

628
00:33:26,592 --> 00:33:26,812
Thank you.

629
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:28,900
Hi.

630
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:33,044
Sort of similar question, but you mentioned

631
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,427
some physical limitations people might feel while they're

632
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,270
playing, for example, their phone battery dying

633
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,471
or their feet being tired.

634
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,415
Do you factor any of those into the narrative

635
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,236
that you're designing?

636
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:45,516
Yes.

637
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:52,399
So if you're playing Pokemon Go and you see a Pokemon on the other side of a chain link fence

638
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:58,101
and you can't get to it, or it's up a flight of stairs and you happen not to be able to get up those stairs,

639
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:02,082
the game is still functioning as designed. That's not strictly a bug.

640
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:05,423
That's a bug of reality that has been ported into the game.

641
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,744
And so the limitations that people experience, whatever those are,

642
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:14,591
Trying to make sense of them and allow people to still access the story is really important

643
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:17,094
because otherwise you're just replicating the unfairnesses of...

644
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:24,621
So, I mean, it's a rather extreme example, but we've designed in storylines with parallel

645
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:31,344
routes to make the same route both accessible via the stairs and accessible via the elevator

646
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:35,106
and had slightly different content in the elevator or an Easter egg or something.

647
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:42,449
So accessibility-wise, we try to stick with what the venue can do and to enhance and add

648
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,911
richness and make that part of the experience.

649
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:48,573
I mean, the issue of the battery starting to beep,

650
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,496
I can foresee a time when we might procedurally

651
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:54,058
ping in a piece of audio that tells players

652
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,740
that their power pack is dying.

653
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:57,721
OK.

654
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:00,923
It's an interesting one.

655
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,965
That's worth further thought, I suspect.

656
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:03,826
It's a good question, though.

657
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,488
I'm afraid I think that's all the time that we have.

658
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:07,329
Thank you very much.

659
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,890
Fill out your speaker evaluations.

660
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,011
Have a great time.

661
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,772
And I'll find out where the breakout is.

662
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:12,113
Thank you.
