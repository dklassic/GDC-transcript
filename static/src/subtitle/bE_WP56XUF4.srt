1
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:16,975
I'm here to talk about interactive pacing. We're going to do it by talking about The

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:22,816
Last of Us Part 2. So, let's talk about pacing. And when I say let's talk about pacing, let's

3
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:29,418
not talk about graphs. We don't need these graphs. We don't need any of this at all.

4
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:32,979
Instead, the way I'm going to approach this talk is that...

5
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:35,633
we're gonna treat pacing like running.

6
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,374
So as the person going through a story,

7
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:42,195
you're the one setting the rhythm, the tempo,

8
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,176
the actual speed that the story happens.

9
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,836
We try to give that to the player in Last of Us Part Two.

10
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,857
And I also might maybe talk about one graph.

11
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,167
Like, just, just, just one, just this one in particular.

12
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,889
It's not really the same as the others, I totally promise.

13
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,691
But we'll kind of dig into that and you'll see what I mean.

14
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,294
But yeah, before I get ahead of myself, who am I?

15
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:04,916
So my name is Evan Hill.

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,798
I was a level designer at Naughty Dog,

17
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:08,739
working on Last of Us Part II.

18
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:12,563
Currently, I'm at Obsidian, working on Outer Worlds II.

19
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,624
I also did a bunch of other games,

20
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:17,287
but the main thing we're here to talk about, obviously,

21
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:19,648
is The Last of Us Part II.

22
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:22,349
And even more specifically, the museum flashback scene.

23
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,650
So this was one of the main things I worked on

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,610
at my time at Naughty Dog,

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,512
and one of my favorite things I've ever made, ever.

26
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:31,893
I think it really connected with people,

27
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,754
and I credit a lot of that to this approach that we took,

28
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,616
kind of allowing people to set the tone for themselves,

29
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:39,116
set the pace for themselves,

30
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:41,297
and the results kind of speak for themselves.

31
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,758
Shout out to Gene Park,

32
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:45,259
and I apologize for maybe ruining his shirt.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,101
But yeah, I just wanna kind of share this process,

34
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:54,662
this weird approach that I haven't really seen talked about

35
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:57,583
as much in branching narrative-focused games,

36
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,344
which has been a passion of mine for just decades.

37
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:02,505
So let's kind of get a quick overview.

38
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:05,345
First, we're gonna start with the where and why,

39
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:09,027
then we're gonna go into this three-part breakdown

40
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,087
of how the core content.

41
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,105
of interactive pacing and story kind of works,

42
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,526
and specifically in this level.

43
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:16,387
Then we're gonna dive into the extra spicy stuff

44
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,388
about what I call secrets.

45
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,630
They're a little different than what you might think.

46
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,211
And then I'm gonna cover a little bit of like

47
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,972
how I actually did it.

48
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:25,853
And then I'm gonna have an hour long talk

49
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,494
in the level design summit tomorrow,

50
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,736
if you want that but for an hour.

51
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,217
But let's jump into it.

52
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:35,740
First things first, where and why?

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:35,800
So,

54
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,388
As I kind of talked about before,

55
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,070
the goal with this level was to have

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,992
a player-tuned experience.

57
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:45,975
You figure out the rhythm that works for you.

58
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,618
I don't want to outstay my welcome for even a second

59
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:52,541
because given as we'll see what this level is,

60
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,383
if I overstay my welcome as a designer,

61
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,905
if we overstay our welcome as a team,

62
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:57,706
it's gonna just collapse like a house of cards.

63
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:58,407
It's gonna get boring.

64
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:00,509
So what do you need to do this?

65
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:00,729
Well,

66
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:04,340
That one graph I talked about.

67
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,122
This is a four-part story breakdown

68
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,464
that is really common in Asian literary traditions.

69
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:12,745
Ki, sho, ten, kets.

70
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,627
Real easy way to understand it is

71
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,648
it's the anatomy of interesting events.

72
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,550
It's really straightforward.

73
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,111
First, you have the introduction.

74
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:25,033
You let the audience understand what's going on.

75
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,894
You take those ideas and you develop them.

76
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,075
You set more stakes.

77
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,895
You add more complications.

78
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:32,916
You then take all of that tension, twist it about,

79
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,241
give it new stuff, rattle them around.

80
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,305
That's your climax, that's your payoff.

81
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:38,969
And finally, you have a conclusion.

82
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,156
Like I said, it's not too complicated,

83
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,657
but the best way to think about this

84
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,138
is not like those previous graphs,

85
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:46,680
like some kind of magic formula,

86
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,662
but as the anatomy of interesting events.

87
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,284
This works for analyzing everything from a baseball game

88
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:55,706
to a meet-cute between you and somebody else

89
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,327
to just what makes a good story

90
00:03:58,327 --> 00:03:59,328
that you wanna tell your friends.

91
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:00,929
Even a good tweet, even a good joke.

92
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:05,511
A good example of it being used in some places you might expect is like the Mario series

93
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,072
currently.

94
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,653
This is the cornerstone of their level design.

95
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:10,654
It's this four-part breakdown.

96
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:15,557
Mark Round does an amazing job explaining this more in depth on his channel, Super Mario

97
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:19,239
World 3D's four-step level design.

98
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,381
But yeah, me personally, the best place I learned about this format and this process

99
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:28,904
is from Manga in Theory and Practice by Hirohiko Araki.

100
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:30,585
Yes, that is a JoJo's reference.

101
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:36,845
But yeah, literally there's like a couple pages in this book that trump almost every book on writing I've ever read.

102
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,306
I'm not saying that lightly.

103
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,787
But uh, yeah.

104
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:44,510
Main thing to take away right now is we're not gonna be talking about this as a graph.

105
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,812
It is just the anatomy of interesting events. So going from that...

106
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:53,921
we can kind of understand that we're not just talking about optional content or side quests

107
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:58,785
or collectibles. This is something that's more fundamental to the moment-to-moment experience

108
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:04,511
that the player has. This includes things like how immersive sims allow you to approach

109
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:09,315
different situations, how puzzles work. Looking at the system we had, you get introduced to

110
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:13,719
mechanics, the mechanics complete and develop, you have an aha moment, you solve the puzzle.

111
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:16,002
It's very, very universal.

112
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,143
Even RPG leveling systems,

113
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,604
we're not talking about dialogue systems,

114
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,745
I'm talking about the fact that you get

115
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,146
that one piece of your build,

116
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,448
fundamentally changes the way you play,

117
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,468
move on to the next level.

118
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:27,751
So, even without challenging mechanics,

119
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,313
we can give the player tools to shape their experience.

120
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:34,616
And now, why are we focusing on this level in particular?

121
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:37,118
Why this specific part of The Last of Us?

122
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,378
It's a really brutal game, honestly.

123
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:40,979
It has some really amazing combat,

124
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,000
but we also cared a lot about creating

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,941
a lot of human moments,

126
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,542
things that focus on character and rhythm.

127
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,524
And I think the museum level

128
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,605
is where we took that the furthest.

129
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:56,487
So as an overview, this level has no combat or stealth,

130
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,787
doesn't use any of the core mechanics

131
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,448
that we had previously.

132
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,549
It's mostly dialogue.

133
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,170
And critically of all,

134
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,631
the reason I wanted to bring it up in this talk today,

135
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,532
it's totally linear.

136
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:09,474
for the most part, there's no branching story,

137
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,776
there's no alternate endings, and yet,

138
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:15,858
we still worked to, again, create this interactive

139
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,559
experience, this interactive pacing.

140
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,801
So the big goal for me, as I mentioned already,

141
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,183
was perfect timing.

142
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:24,584
I wanted to reward the people who wanted to linger

143
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,846
and enable the people that wanted to rush.

144
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:31,569
So we had to create systems so that both of these

145
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,991
radically different spectrums of players

146
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,372
could have a compelling time.

147
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:36,953
How do we do that?

148
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,385
Oh, jumped the gun.

149
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:43,367
The first and most critical part

150
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,968
is what I call focal points.

151
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,930
These are the important and unmissable parts

152
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,590
of your experience.

153
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,673
Literally, your, whatever it is, leveling system,

154
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:56,956
level, story, moment, combat encounter,

155
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,738
should be complete with all of these

156
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:00,879
and literally nothing else.

157
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,881
Anything in addition to these,

158
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,662
if it makes the story worse,

159
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:06,703
it needs to be added to this list.

160
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:11,880
and finding out which one of these moments work

161
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,342
and how to build these moments goes back to this anatomy.

162
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:16,404
So we're gonna go through an example

163
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,225
of what these moments were in this level

164
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,286
and kind of roughly talk about

165
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:20,387
how it fits to this structure.

166
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:24,290
So for those that maybe don't know or need a refresher,

167
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,974
the flashback level starts three years in the past.

168
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:30,035
Joel is just...

169
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:30,955
messing with Ellie.

170
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:34,376
Like they've taken out and gone into the wilderness.

171
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:35,796
He has not explained why.

172
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:36,797
It's her birthday.

173
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:40,298
She starts asking what the hell his surprise is gonna be.

174
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:44,819
And in response, he shoves her into the river.

175
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,100
Which is extra shocking if you played the first game

176
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,541
because we have not established that Ellie can swim yet.

177
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,022
So as the player, you are now underwater

178
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,362
and we teach you the swimming mechanics

179
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,142
in the game that we added.

180
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,123
And as that big twist.

181
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,872
You know, set up, develop, twist.

182
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:02,233
Ellie already learned how to swim.

183
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,154
She's actually great and you're totally safe.

184
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:07,296
And then they just quip at each other and continue on.

185
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,737
That's the first kind of arc.

186
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:12,559
The next part is you move further into the forest

187
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,880
and Joel does actually reveal

188
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,941
what his big ass surprise is gonna be.

189
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,743
Turns out, it's a fucking dinosaur.

190
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:21,424
He has brought Ellie all the way out

191
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,826
to the remains of the Wyoming National History Museum

192
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:28,048
and her brain just fucking explodes.

193
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:31,283
They then get to explore the museum.

194
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,483
And as we're kind of going to dig in,

195
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:35,805
that's where a lot of this really interactive stuff comes in.

196
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,765
We did not want that part to be too long

197
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:39,346
or too short for the player,

198
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:43,288
so that when the final payoff happens, it's going to land.

199
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:46,429
Like Joel, in addition to just taking her here,

200
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,170
knows about her love of space

201
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,331
and has gotten a recording of the Apollo launch.

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
and then hands it to her into the middle

203
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
of an authentic space capsule.

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,621
And she gives her this perfect moment where,

205
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:00,641
yeah, she can imagine that the world's

206
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,542
gonna be a better place,

207
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,082
that it's gonna go back to the way that it was.

208
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,122
They both get to share in that.

209
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:06,142
They both kind of align in that single moment.

210
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:09,523
Again, set up, develop, pay off, conclusion.

211
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:14,024
And then finally, because Ellie is also riding this high,

212
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,984
is really generally curious,

213
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,365
she wants to see more of this museum,

214
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,945
this amazing place that Jill's taken her.

215
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:26,067
Unfortunately, uh, she winds up getting lost in the last annex, totally alone, gets attacked

216
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:30,469
by a boar, and then also finds a bunch of graffiti referring to the fireflies, the one

217
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,831
thing that they're still not really talking about. And the relationship starts to unravel

218
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:42,155
from there. Again, setup, develop, twist, payoff. But as we pointed out, this is just the

219
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:47,818
high level beats, this is the most condensed that this story is. You know, as I told it

220
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:48,998
right there, it's not...

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,522
it's fine, like you guys get it, but, you know,

222
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:53,263
I don't see anybody crying.

223
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:57,386
So, how does the player seek out more?

224
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:00,148
How do they add and kinda season this experience

225
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,970
with more of what they want out of it?

226
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,148
And that brings us to prospects.

227
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:08,329
So prospects are these exact added things.

228
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,270
For other games it might be like side quests

229
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,312
or optional encounters, you know, dungeons.

230
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,392
Like a Skyrim prospect would just be a dungeon.

231
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:19,054
But the most important thing to take away

232
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:21,094
of what a prospect is in this format

233
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,455
is they're clear options.

234
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,696
These are not hidden things.

235
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:28,337
These are not special things you have to search for.

236
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,178
You can see them, you get them.

237
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,178
You give the player a bite.

238
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,893
and then let them decide how many to take.

239
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,774
The idea is, if you have a set of prospects,

240
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:37,715
they all should take the same amount of time.

241
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,456
Doesn't matter if it's about 10 seconds

242
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,357
or an hour of content.

243
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,598
The player needs to know what they're getting into

244
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,339
in order to do this thing that we're talking about,

245
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,380
season their experience.

246
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,881
All of you have probably done similar things.

247
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,462
Like, everybody's playing Elden Ring right now.

248
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:51,663
You can look at the map and be like,

249
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,865
all right, cool, that's a boss fight.

250
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:54,885
I'm gonna go somewhere else.

251
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,207
But in this level in particular,

252
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,288
we tried to showcase this as best we could.

253
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,828
So early on in the museum,

254
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,749
we just have one little skeleton,

255
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,209
one dinosaur to mess with.

256
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,890
You're able to walk up, you see and interact.

257
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,790
Ellie has a little quip, Joel has a response.

258
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,911
Great, you could also skip this.

259
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:16,931
That's why we put a second one in the next hallway.

260
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:19,572
Again, you can interact with it.

261
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:21,893
Ellie does a little quip, Joel responds.

262
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:22,333
Great.

263
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,013
And then you turn the corner and you see this.

264
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,915
a whole cornucopia of these weird little moments.

265
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:31,056
And by that point, without having to say anything,

266
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,777
without a tutorial, without anything else,

267
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,418
as a player, you're able to look at this

268
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,380
and be one of two things.

269
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,663
Cool, moving on, or I will do every single one of these.

270
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,232
And that's what we allowed for,

271
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:48,793
like everything that seemed interesting,

272
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,595
everything we felt that needed to be said or could be done,

273
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,876
we just piled on and on.

274
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:55,458
And even more importantly though,

275
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,580
is for those first group of people,

276
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,402
you can have whatever opinion you want about them,

277
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:01,523
it's also clear how to move on.

278
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:04,305
There's this big staircase in the back,

279
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,827
when they walk up, they really like make it clear,

280
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,388
like, oh, hey, we're moving to something else.

281
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,890
And then we also put a hard valve,

282
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,832
a hard level design term where you can't go back

283
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,273
to just signal.

284
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,511
Hey, once you move past here, there's no backtracking,

285
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,171
there's no nothing, or should you wanna go?

286
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:24,513
So again, you give the player a byte,

287
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:25,853
you let them decide how many to take.

288
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,514
And kinda going back to our format,

289
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,675
this is kinda the first half of the equation.

290
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:34,236
You know, I'm setting the player up, I'm developing it,

291
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,556
we're stretching that second part

292
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,857
to be as long as they want.

293
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,298
You know, it goes right up until the point

294
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,538
where you get to say like, eh, I'm done.

295
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:43,539
Alright, like, this is cute, but what else you got?

296
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:46,783
And that comes to the second half of the graph,

297
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,423
where we answer the other question

298
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:49,544
that kind of comes with this format,

299
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,324
which is, cool, we've got prospects,

300
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:53,925
but how do you keep it from being repetitive?

301
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:56,465
Like, I'm literally telling you to be repetitive.

302
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:57,986
Be consistent.

303
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,966
Okay, it's kind of boring.

304
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,787
So how do we spice that up?

305
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:06,533
That's where these things I'm calling threads come in.

306
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:08,454
Like, it's a bad name, I don't know.

307
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,776
But the main thing I wanna talk about

308
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:14,917
is how it uses this ancient tool

309
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,178
used by an illustrious group.

310
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:16,538
Improv actors.

311
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,659
What we need to do when we're dealing with prospects

312
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,040
is yes and the player.

313
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,743
Anytime you interact with one of these things,

314
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:28,444
anytime you go about this, there should be,

315
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,785
again, we don't wanna be predictable,

316
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,426
there should be a decent chance.

317
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,747
that we're gonna take it, we're gonna run with it,

318
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,450
we're gonna yes and it, and we're gonna throw it back.

319
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,634
It's pretty straight forward, again, believe it or not,

320
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,958
this is kinda similar to what we're talking about already.

321
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,660
You take the player action, you react to it,

322
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,823
and then when you build a thread,

323
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,085
you expand and you throw it back.

324
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,803
So, yeah, like I said, same formula we've been talking

325
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:53,544
about here, but it's that back half, it's that extra layer

326
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,684
where the player's like, oh, cool, this is gonna be

327
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,465
a 30 second interaction, oh wait, it's a 40 second

328
00:13:57,465 --> 00:14:00,286
interaction, oh wait, that's a joke, oh my god,

329
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,286
this is memorable suddenly.

330
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,027
So yeah, it's the back half of this graph.

331
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,827
The yes and prospects.

332
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,328
So let's look at some examples in the level.

333
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,669
So one of the early prospects we kinda give

334
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:12,869
is the fuckin' hat.

335
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:16,230
Simple thing, seems a little innocuous,

336
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,850
Ellie picks it up.

337
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:24,379
She says equip, Joel reacts, great. You know, she thinks it looks great, he thinks it looks

338
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:31,286
lame. But then, we also let you mess with it. All of a sudden, like you see this

339
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:36,852
interactable, you kind of ask yourself like what the fuck is this? No, no, no, no. Yes.

340
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:41,877
Yes and. Yes and Joel hates it.

341
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:50,146
Yes, and you can put the hat on Joel as well.

342
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,348
Yes, and he then gets into it

343
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:56,950
and just delivers a super wholesome moment

344
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,533
that you only get if you lean into them.

345
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,674
You only get if you engage with the prospects.

346
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:03,375
We reward you.

347
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,276
We take in and listen and say like,

348
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,557
all right, cool, I see what you're doing.

349
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,399
I'm gonna add, I'm gonna react, I'm gonna yes and.

350
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,171
And this works for moments and connections, big and small.

351
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,012
It brings that sequence to life.

352
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,872
You know, everyone listening around,

353
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:19,753
like you heard laughter there.

354
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,714
Like that's the thing that we're talking about.

355
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:22,834
It's that little bit of surprise,

356
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,556
that little bit of twist that goes it from being repetitive

357
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,097
to something interesting.

358
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,118
You know, so like some small examples are like,

359
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,859
as you're talking, Ellie and Joel can just start talking

360
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:33,839
about Jurassic Park.

361
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,560
And it just keeps developing until like,

362
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,761
oh, they're actually gonna watch this movie.

363
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,842
You know, he promises her.

364
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:40,682
They move on.

365
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,930
You can actually sit in the space section

366
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,672
and just have Ellie fire truck or fire hose about space

367
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:51,974
for like six different interactions and just keep going.

368
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:56,456
And again, it doesn't have to be these big moments.

369
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,317
Brings the sequences to life.

370
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:01,738
It's this back half of the structure.

371
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:02,699
Can we take it further?

372
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,540
How do we ratchet this up to 11?

373
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,402
How do we make these types of moments really stick out?

374
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,583
That's where we get to secrets.

375
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,279
These are the mold breakers.

376
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,201
So threads build off of prospects.

377
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:17,563
You think you know what you're getting into,

378
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,324
we kinda give you 50% more.

379
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,245
It's a good way to think about it.

380
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,607
This stuff just catches you by surprise.

381
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,548
This is the stuff that does not follow a pattern,

382
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:28,852
does not actually sit with what the player's expectation is,

383
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,874
and it's how you make something memorable.

384
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:32,935
They're memorable departures.

385
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,656
These aren't hidden collectibles.

386
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:38,619
These are just twist on twist on twist.

387
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,596
It makes the player feel like anything's possible if they lean in.

388
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:46,640
The other thing to be kind of careful about is, like, these are not the focal points.

389
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,583
Do not be afraid to let the player miss it out. If they care, they'll hear about it.

390
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:55,847
Like, these need to be moments that are big and interesting, but can be completely optional.

391
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:59,157
do not need to be a part of the story.

392
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:01,738
So like a really clear example that I'm

393
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:02,859
not only just really happy about,

394
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,720
but like how it came about was great,

395
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,681
was the first time we showed the leads,

396
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,582
one of the early mock-ups of this level,

397
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,523
one of them just chimed in, first millisecond.

398
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:11,744
Can I climb that?

399
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:12,744
And then we did.

400
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,825
And this is something that like I'm sure

401
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,047
even a lot of people who play the game

402
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,628
might have totally missed, but have heard about.

403
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:23,670
Like the constant reaction I always see with this

404
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,071
is like wait, what, you could do that?

405
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:25,691
What the fuck?

406
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:32,409
has this whole interaction, Ellie's able to get on top, she fuckin' jumps down, uh, and, yeah,

407
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,271
for the people that engage with it, they're, they're on cloud nine, they're, they're like

408
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:41,712
what the hell else is here? For the people that didn't engage with it, if they still liked it,

409
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:44,393
they come back and they're like, wait, what the fuck else is there?

410
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:49,528
you know, but it's also smaller things, like Ellie can find this mirror in the bathroom and

411
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:54,009
then we just give you this whole freaking mini game where you're able to just pose her face and

412
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:58,930
look like a doofus because you just get to be her for a moment, you get to mess around. You

413
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,211
actually get to find out that, oh hey, you can put hats on Joel, there's an achievement for

414
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:06,792
that. And you know, and then this is kind of like the, the, the borderline between them,

415
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:11,452
Fred, Threads and Secrets, this is like a little hat moment. Um, you know, other small

416
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,553
things like you can find this pallet off in the river.

417
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,982
She quips at Joel like, oh hey, let's write on this.

418
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:19,063
Like, totally optional.

419
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:23,005
But yeah, the main goal is like it makes players

420
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:23,866
feel like anything's possible.

421
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,867
It keeps them from just kinda condensing down

422
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:31,450
and just consuming your content like it's predictable.

423
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,592
But that's all nice.

424
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,853
I've given you guys a good framework.

425
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,414
How do?

426
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:40,335
How do we find these moments?

427
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,536
We talk a lot about scripts and planning and structure,

428
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:43,956
but.

429
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,280
In my decade of doing this,

430
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,322
the only thing I can honestly say is just iteration.

431
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:53,305
Like, it's writing, we're telling stories,

432
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,246
good writing is rewriting.

433
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:57,468
And specifically the approach of Last of Us,

434
00:18:57,468 --> 00:19:01,031
we kind of took the approach of storyboarding

435
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,452
more than script writing.

436
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,594
And if anybody here knows about storyboards,

437
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,295
they also kind of know how rough they can be,

438
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,477
and that's a really critical part of why they work.

439
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:11,620
This is an example of a storyboard from Knives Out.

440
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:17,443
Soak it in.

441
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:20,986
They did not care about making this look good.

442
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,127
They just wanted to know

443
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,729
if this would be interesting or funny.

444
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:28,292
And hey, that scribble's pretty funny.

445
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,034
And this, this like extends to a lot of other media.

446
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,815
Like, guess who drew this?

447
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,658
Look, look at this mess.

448
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:37,120
This is by Hirohiko Araki.

449
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,442
This guy's been in the Louvre.

450
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:42,404
This is how he sketches his ideas out.

451
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:47,861
You wanna see what the dinosaur looked like the first time I put it in?

452
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:48,302
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:48,302 --> 00:20:02,992
This is what one of the leads looked like and said I wanna climb it.

454
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:03,412
And so we did.

455
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:06,967
And all of this is really critical,

456
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:09,228
because we didn't know if this moment would work.

457
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,509
I had no idea whether we were even gonna keep this dinosaur

458
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,810
or all these other things.

459
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,531
I wanted to get it done in 20 minutes and just show someone.

460
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,892
And after putting it in front of them,

461
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:17,912
seeing they wanted to climb it,

462
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,393
I'm like, all right, cool, we can move forward with this.

463
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:20,754
This is doable, this is workable.

464
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:23,695
This is something we can put this much effort into

465
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:29,618
instead of spending a couple months and then deciding, eh.

466
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,119
But that's the generative part.

467
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,940
But how do you also, like,

468
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:34,867
I don't know, vibe with it.

469
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,148
How do you build that iteration?

470
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,648
How do you discover stuff?

471
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:39,049
And that's where I think, like,

472
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,390
another thing we don't talk about enough is inspiration.

473
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,393
So for me, working on this project was a huge challenge.

474
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:48,734
Like, there's none of the guardrails

475
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,135
that we normally feel as designers.

476
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:52,016
No core combat, no nothing, all dialogue.

477
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:54,517
And I got super lucky,

478
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:57,558
because then I suddenly found the work of one Naoko Yamada.

479
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,821
This is a Japanese anime film director.

480
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:03,742
She is...

481
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:08,024
Just a master, she's on par with Hayao Miyazaki.

482
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:08,885
Not mincing words here.

483
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,328
She mostly works with Kyoto Animation

484
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:14,752
and all of her films are the kind of subtle,

485
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,215
beautiful stuff that makes me cry every fucking time.

486
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,213
And if you even like my work a little bit,

487
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,794
check every single one of these things out.

488
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:22,334
I'm dead serious.

489
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:26,857
But another thing we were looking at too was Firewatch.

490
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:29,299
Again, had a really similar structure

491
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,339
to what we were doing.

492
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,800
So just the fact that I'd interacted

493
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,701
with this game years ago,

494
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,882
I was starting to chew on this problem,

495
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:34,622
I was able to break down like,

496
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:38,295
oh hey, this kind of interactive pacing is what they did.

497
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:41,037
Like I could decide to kind of live in a moment

498
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:42,357
or do these types of things.

499
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:43,598
Didn't do any hard branching.

500
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:45,799
We didn't need to have a big payoff.

501
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,441
Just these little things that let you kind of

502
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,662
linger in a moment really add a lot.

503
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:54,725
And then the final thing is like in addition to,

504
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,386
it's like okay, we know what we're trying to do.

505
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,527
We know where we're getting our input.

506
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,888
How do we get this on the page?

507
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:03,530
How do we actually figure these moments out?

508
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:06,822
Honestly, we just kind of improv'd it.

509
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:10,224
The way we worked was we would have a short outline,

510
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:13,185
I would do something horrible like that dinosaur

511
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:17,927
we did earlier, and we would literally act it out

512
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,628
together as like a strike team.

513
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:23,699
Yeah, no, I wish I had footage of this.

514
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,100
They would never let me show any of this.

515
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,862
But we're talking like, when you get hit by the boar,

516
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,563
me or one of the leads would literally like,

517
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:32,444
tumble onto the floor, roll around,

518
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:34,465
like, ah, it's gotta feel like this.

519
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,967
Just to see if these rhythms, if these emotions are valid.

520
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:38,987
Like, if we're able to sell it,

521
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,808
then maybe we can get the player invested into it.

522
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,970
If I can't sell it, if I can't make it interesting,

523
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,831
even with like, all my energy,

524
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:48,273
like, maybe it's a bad beat.

525
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:48,873
Maybe it doesn't work.

526
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,371
And then that feeds back into like,

527
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,691
oh, we're using all of these tools,

528
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,072
like we're using improv and, you know,

529
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,312
finding out what works for us by looking at other media.

530
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,193
And we just gave it to the player.

531
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:03,094
Like, that's the other way to think about it.

532
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:04,074
Like, find what works for you.

533
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,995
Like, don't worry about copying my formula

534
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:08,155
or looking for graphs,

535
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,216
but just get in tune with what makes it fun for you

536
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:14,477
and then try to make that thing happen to the player.

537
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,158
We're interactive, like we can do that.

538
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:20,079
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

539
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:22,528
It looks like we're actually gonna have some time

540
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,290
for questions, which I'm really excited about.

541
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,471
But yeah, follow me on Twitter.

542
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,752
We've got a website and stuff.

543
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:30,955
Also have some stuff on the horizon on the side,

544
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:33,437
doing some audio drama with some cool people.

545
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,579
And yeah, check out my stuff on Outer Worlds too.

546
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:38,221
And also watch Liz and the Bluebird,

547
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,623
and The Silent Voice, and The Hakey Story.

548
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:42,304
They're all real, real, real, real good.

549
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:45,046
We do have time for questions.

550
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:08,413
Hi, great talk.

551
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,334
Thank you.

552
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:16,095
So, I want to know about prospects in relation to threads and secrets, because

553
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:22,217
prospects, threads, and secrets all have like some aspects that are in common, in

554
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:26,218
that they are like, for instance, a thing in the environment that you can walk up

555
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:31,799
to and press triangle on, but all prospects should be roughly the same like

556
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:33,243
Size?

557
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:34,103
Correct.

558
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:38,244
So does that mean that if you have too many threads,

559
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,385
threads and secrets can break the size rule,

560
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,105
so does that mean that you can screw your like,

561
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,306
bread flour ratio up by having too many threads

562
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,927
and secrets and not enough prospects?

563
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,087
Absolutely correct.

564
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,708
Like, that I think hits to the core of the balancing act.

565
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,428
And like one of the things that like I can't solve for,

566
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,369
you can solve it for your content as it comes to it.

567
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,949
But that's exactly what we're kind of getting to.

568
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:00,710
Even back to the key shot and cats.

569
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:03,787
the big part is that unpredictability.

570
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:04,888
You want a little bit of it.

571
00:25:04,888 --> 00:25:07,729
You want a little bit of consistency with your prospects.

572
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,709
But then if you're just threading all your prospects,

573
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,050
you're just back to having prospects.

574
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,231
You're just doing the same thing over again.

575
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,131
You have a list of sidequests

576
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:15,872
of all equal length, size, and weight,

577
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:18,413
and it doesn't feel good.

578
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,613
But yeah, finding that ratio,

579
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:21,294
I can't give you like a rough estimate

580
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:22,114
or anything else like that,

581
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:24,095
but no, what you said is you're on exactly

582
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:26,116
the right wavelength to be asking those questions.

583
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:27,137
Cool, thanks.

584
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:27,677
Hello.

585
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:33,383
Thank you very much for the talk.

586
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:34,183
Thank you.

587
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:36,865
I'm curious, as a level designer,

588
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,906
I do a lot of work like this.

589
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:41,888
Maybe you're gonna cover this in your talk tomorrow,

590
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,329
so maybe this is a good segue to come back to that.

591
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:45,410
Come to my talk tomorrow.

592
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:45,850
Sorry.

593
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:49,957
How do you build this in the earliest stages

594
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,317
when you're stubbing it out?

595
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,878
You showed that one image.

596
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,759
This whole thing is full of moments

597
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,381
that essentially won't sell the way they will

598
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:01,522
in the finished product until way at the end of development.

599
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:04,004
How do you actually stub in things like the hat

600
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:05,084
and things like that early on?

601
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:08,166
Do you use storyboards or title cards?

602
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,286
What do you use?

603
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:12,308
So we would normally get this kind of jank

604
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:13,368
in-engine walking around.

605
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:17,710
And then as I kind of touched on, we would just act it out.

606
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,091
Like, I'd use my physicality, we, like, I would play Joel,

607
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:24,073
one of the leads would play Ellie or vice versa,

608
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:27,074
and we would try and, like, feel out the dialogue and just talk through it.

609
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:30,215
Like, the hats literally just came from a stupid joke I did,

610
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,016
where I was like, oh, you know, maybe she finds a stupid hat,

611
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:35,257
oh, maybe she puts it on a saber-toothed tiger.

612
00:26:35,257 --> 00:26:36,698
It got a really big laugh that I wasn't expecting,

613
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,758
and then all of a sudden I'm like...

614
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:39,932
okay, we're gonna do this.

615
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,014
And yeah, from there, in the talk tomorrow,

616
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:45,215
we'll kind of dive into what are the next steps

617
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:47,797
of like how do you actually build a playable prototype,

618
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:48,678
how do you shift that to production,

619
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:51,600
how do you polish something like this,

620
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,842
and all of the processes and stuff in that iteration cycle.

621
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,904
The big answer for that is have a really,

622
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,965
really competent team and keep them on track

623
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,707
and it can work out.

624
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:02,827
Cool.

625
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:03,968
Thanks.

626
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,317
Hello, my name's Ethan, I'm a narrative and level design student.

627
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:12,157
That's my voice, that's weird.

628
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:12,257
Um...

629
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,239
So, um...

630
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:17,141
If you're able to talk about it,

631
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,383
can you talk about any, like, components of this story

632
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,305
that you all tried that didn't work,

633
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:22,646
and why those didn't work,

634
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:24,847
and why they didn't end up making it in the game?

635
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:27,309
Oh, you mean, so stuff that got cut,

636
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,211
or just didn't work out?

637
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:29,251
Um...

638
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,113
I think, like, somewhat vaguely.

639
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:31,393
Um...

640
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:33,254
So, like, the other flashback that I worked on,

641
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,436
the one where Ellie and Joel go to, um...

642
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,111
the hotel and then fight the bloater.

643
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:41,552
Um, initially they were gonna find the strings.

644
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,233
Like they, they're like, oh we're gonna set out,

645
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:45,454
we're gonna try and like find these strings,

646
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:48,295
it's gonna be a metaphor for repairing our relationship.

647
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:49,856
And then we dialed it back.

648
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,657
When both for scope, of like, oh hey,

649
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:53,318
like this is a whole third of the level

650
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,238
that we don't wanna make.

651
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:55,939
And then right when we were asking that question,

652
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,520
we're like, oh they don't find the strings.

653
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,822
That means they don't repair their relationship.

654
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:03,316
it spirals out.

655
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:06,279
So it was actually like a thing where cutting that element,

656
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,422
we then looked through our story framework and analyzed it

657
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:10,563
and said like, oh, all of a sudden,

658
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,045
this actually makes it better, this developed.

659
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:16,968
So like cutting down the rhythms in the outline stage,

660
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,630
like we didn't get very far.

661
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,331
We kind of got to like the playable prototype

662
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,852
of like the music store.

663
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:23,694
A couple of times we looked at it like,

664
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,956
this is too much, this is too complicated.

665
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,278
Cut it, level's now two thirds as long.

666
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:32,661
And the reason we went really fast and forward with that

667
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:34,863
was because we realized, oh hey,

668
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:37,084
makes the story work better.

669
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:40,066
Awesome, thank you.

670
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:40,807
Hello.

671
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,268
Hello.

672
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:44,869
I'm Paris.

673
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:47,111
You talk a lot about unpredictability.

674
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:51,377
And I'm curious how you balance unpredictability

675
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,218
with player intentionality,

676
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:57,059
making sure that players are doing actions

677
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,240
for a reason that they actually know of.

678
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,802
And especially with The Last of Us,

679
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:04,802
it's like I see a prompt

680
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:08,264
and I might not necessarily know what that leads to.

681
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:09,324
So if you could speak to that.

682
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:13,483
Yeah, so we kind of covered it a little bit in this talk.

683
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:15,925
The initial two exhibits that Ellie kind of sees

684
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,766
in isolation, that's exactly what we're attempting

685
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:22,889
to do there, where neither of those have big threads

686
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:24,550
attached to them, there's no big yes and,

687
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,012
and by doing two at once, we're simultaneously

688
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:29,933
letting the player, like, oh hey, you can skip things,

689
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:34,375
oh hey, these things are of all equal size.

690
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:39,899
and it keeps us from like lowering the amount of people that go without touching anything

691
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:44,922
before they get to the main room. So again, it's it's a light touch there, but in general

692
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:48,524
like that's where that four part structure you can kind of break down and understand

693
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:53,667
with. It's like that development part, uh that first half of like setup and development,

694
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,189
that's why you kind of want to do it in order. That's where like you don't just want to go

695
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,911
big twist, big twist, big twist, cause they didn't, they weren't expecting anything.

696
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:04,297
Cause the unpredictability, the subtle part of it is,

697
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:07,358
it needs to happen after they start forming predictions.

698
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:10,860
So you do the things that set their expectations first,

699
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,281
and then you do the crazy stuff.

700
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:15,322
And like that constant flow back and forth

701
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:17,503
is what generates that feeling of story,

702
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:21,225
of like experience, the ahas, the oh shits, or the oh no.

703
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:21,525
Thank you.

704
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,565
Hello friend.

705
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:22,946
Hello.

706
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,683
I have a question related to secrets and threads,

707
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:33,006
secrets in particular, because you said

708
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,707
that it's OK if people miss them.

709
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:39,092
And I guess I'm wondering if after the fact,

710
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:40,813
how much data collection or studying

711
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,596
did you do to basically get an idea of?

712
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:48,882
for particular secrets, what percentage of players actually found them and how did that

713
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:53,548
impact your mental model for how you approach these kinds of things in the future of like

714
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:57,653
I want to go into a secret but last time I did only 20% of the people found it. Do those

715
00:30:57,653 --> 00:31:02,459
things kind of factor into your decision making? That's just more of that.

716
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:07,853
Yeah, so uh, it kinda comes out in iteration. Uh, we did a lot of playtesting on the game and

717
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:13,820
say for example the dinosaur climbing, uh, I forget what the exact number really was, but we

718
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,045
in conceptualizing like this, we're honestly happy if like 10-20% of people got it. Like

719
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,801
and we just ate that content scope.

720
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:25,042
We felt that like having that quality was there.

721
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,423
Now there were times in play testing

722
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:28,524
where that was not the number that we were hitting,

723
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:30,104
so we would do things like

724
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:31,985
increase the affordances around that.

725
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:34,906
Some like just basic level design getting thrown at it

726
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,367
where we made it more clear,

727
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,687
we made it look more like a ramp,

728
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,968
we highlighted it more,

729
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,928
we had Joel walk by it more to just kind of.

730
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:43,880
nudge and nudge and nudge until we felt it was like

731
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,741
a little more consistent.

732
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,603
I don't know the final ship numbers,

733
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:50,025
but yeah, when we did a Game Maker's Toolkit on this level,

734
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,946
like one of the common comments was like,

735
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:53,207
wait what, you can climb the dinosaur?

736
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:53,368
And yeah.

737
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:55,429
It looks like we might be out of time everybody,

738
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:57,251
but I think I'll be in the wrap up room,

739
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:57,991
and yeah, thank you so much.

740
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:58,272
Thank you.

741
00:31:58,272 --> 00:31:58,452
Thank you.

742
00:31:58,452 --> 00:31:58,652
Thank you.

743
00:31:58,652 --> 00:31:58,892
Thank you.

744
00:31:58,892 --> 00:31:59,232
Thank you.

745
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,533
Thank you.

746
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,093
Thank you.

747
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:00,454
Thank you.

748
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:00,994
Thank you.

749
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:01,334
Thank you.

750
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:01,635
Thank you.

751
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:07,039
Thank you.
