1
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,288
So thank you for coming.

2
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:10,670
And this is me.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,611
I'm Cecile.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,372
And I'm an introvert.

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:17,154
I've been working in the mobile and gaming industry

6
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:21,917
for the past 15 years or so at King, at Gameloft,

7
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:27,580
and being based in different locations in Asia, Europe,

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,121
Latin America.

9
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,942
And I've worked on dozens of games.

10
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,625
But the reason I'm here today is because I

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,625
didn't want to share my room.

12
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:45,097
Last year, King held its annual internal event, King for Market, where the whole company meets

13
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:51,980
in one location and exchanges in best practices and network and have a great time.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,122
It's a much anticipated fun event and I love it.

15
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,323
And each time I've attended, I've loved it.

16
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:04,307
But in events such as these and in a similar way, events such as GDC as well,

17
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:07,748
I feel drained by the constant buzzing of people.

18
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:11,574
networking and socializing with everyone.

19
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:14,296
It uses up a lot of my energy.

20
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:18,679
And such events like this, you often have to share rooms.

21
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,902
And without true privacy, it's difficult to fully recharge

22
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:27,285
your batteries, how lovely your roommate is.

23
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,327
So I volunteered to be a speaker, because that is how I

24
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,928
would get to have a private room.

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,493
And what a better topic than the reason why I volunteered to be a speaker in the first place.

26
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:40,713
And here I am today.

27
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:50,697
I'm going to try and use this time together to give some insights and examples of typical behavior of introverts,

28
00:01:50,697 --> 00:02:03,443
and how to identify them, embrace them, and at the end, some tips on how maybe we can create a better environment for everyone.

29
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:10,941
I want to start by mentioning the TED Talk and the book from Susan Cain, Quiet, which

30
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:16,886
I watched a year ago or so, which was truly inspiring and which blew my mind.

31
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:24,653
I recognized myself so much in her experience about being an introvert and it really resonated

32
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:24,993
in me.

33
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:34,286
MBTI test, I mean personality test, and I was only starting to understand what

34
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:34,626
introvert

35
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:38,488
meant, what being an introvert meant

36
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:41,669
and getting more information and watching that talk and

37
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,931
reading Quiet really helped me to get some more insights of

38
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:52,733
how it truly worked. And I also learned that one-third to one-half of the population

39
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:57,855
identifies as an introvert to some degrees because

40
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:58,435
introverts...

41
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,538
You don't have to be like a full-on introvert.

42
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:04,100
You have all shapes and sizes.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,583
But one third to one half is quite a big number.

44
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,144
And I was very surprised by that,

45
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:14,167
especially considering that there was not

46
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:18,470
a lot of awareness until recently about what it was.

47
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,294
So what exactly is an introvert?

48
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:26,196
And the first thing I learned is that it's actually

49
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,497
a biological difference.

50
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:33,684
It turns out that the brains from introverts and extroverts behave differently.

51
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:39,346
And one difference relates to how the brain reacts to dopamine, which is a chemical in

52
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:46,008
the brain which controls the motivation to achieve goals or to earn rewards.

53
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:53,430
Both introverts and extroverts have the same amount of dopamine in their brains, but the

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,131
difference is in the reward network.

55
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:05,962
the brains of extroverts is more focused on the dopamine reward network and it explains

56
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:11,765
why they are maybe more motivated for things like such as money or social status.

57
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:19,289
And on the contrary, the reward network in brains of introverts relies more on acetylcholine

58
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:25,152
which focuses on more inward rewards such as attention, learning, and memory.

59
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:28,753
And they basically feel less excitement from surprise and risk.

60
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,512
And that's also the reason why introverts are more comfortable in a quieter environment,

61
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:41,514
while extroverts thrive in a stimulating and social environment.

62
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:48,416
It also explains why introverts need to recharge their batteries by spending time on their own,

63
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,578
or with a very small group of people that they trust,

64
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:57,320
and that quieter environments are where they are at their best.

65
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,156
So one thing to clarify also is that being an introvert doesn't mean that you're shy

66
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:10,721
or that you're anti-social, it's just how you get your energy and where you get it from

67
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:15,484
and also what happens after the stimulation.

68
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:22,128
And that being in a social environment will mean that you need to recover from it.

69
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:25,950
I don't know if you've ever heard the concept of an introvert hangover.

70
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,985
But which means that after an event such as GDC,

71
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:34,291
for example, I'm going to need to spend some time on my own

72
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,194
just to go back to myself.

73
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:39,839
And in similar situation, introverts might be.

74
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:47,591
tend to dislike small talk, especially in a social networking situation, like what am

75
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,072
I going to do with all those business cards, you know?

76
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:53,433
And making lots of contacts might not mean a lot to them.

77
00:05:53,433 --> 00:06:00,955
But social networking is a reality of the professional life, so maybe putting yourself

78
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:07,696
an objective of making one or two contacts with which you can have true, meaningful conversation.

79
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:13,491
can be enough and then they can take the pressure off themselves so that they've achieved their goal.

80
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:21,277
And another thing is that a lot of introverts like myself might actually feel guilty for

81
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:27,422
not being able to engage as much in social activities as and as naturally as extroverts

82
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,704
do or for wanting to be alone.

83
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:35,788
They might feel that they're not putting enough efforts to fit in and they are failing.

84
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:41,506
in some way at social events because they just want to go home early.

85
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:47,751
And this is a bit highlighted by the fact that our modern institutions tend to highlight

86
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:55,957
extrovert behaviour as the good way of being, you know, being cool and comfortable in social

87
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,300
situations and to teach us that this is how success is achieved.

88
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,103
That extroversion is a strength and that introversion is a weakness that you need to overcome.

89
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:09,134
which I don't necessarily think is the best message to give to all of us.

90
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:16,638
As a child, as a student, as a young woman entering the work environment,

91
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:23,661
I've always thought that there was something wrong with me in some way,

92
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:28,344
and I never really managed to be quite the person that society wanted,

93
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,745
that I felt society wanted me to be.

94
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,435
And preparing for this talk, I went through my school records

95
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:39,197
and to see what teachers were saying about me at the time.

96
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:44,881
And they all said that serious student, she works well.

97
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,643
But they would flag that I had one big flaw.

98
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:51,285
And that was that I wouldn't participate enough in class

99
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,686
and I was too quiet.

100
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:57,450
And I always felt that it was a bit unfair because

101
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,989
I would, if I were asked, I would answer,

102
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,909
I would have healthy relationships with my classmates,

103
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,570
I would behave well, I would do the work.

104
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,631
The only thing that I wouldn't do would be to raise my hand

105
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:16,533
and draw attention to myself unless absolutely necessary.

106
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:22,995
And does this mean that I wasn't good enough?

107
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,715
I'm not sure it does.

108
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,496
I was just displaying an introvert behavior.

109
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,213
that is quite common among the population.

110
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:34,255
But school taught me that was a weakness.

111
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:40,919
Another example, I remember one summer I was

112
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,142
about 14 and I was in language immersion holiday,

113
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:49,524
spending a few weeks in a family in Ireland

114
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:50,445
to practice English.

115
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:54,553
And for me, holidays meant books, lots and lots of books.

116
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:58,134
I had to have a big suitcase so that I would have enough

117
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,575
to last me for the whole of the holidays.

118
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:05,257
And I'll just comment that airplanes' weight luggage

119
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,557
policy are not meant for introverts.

120
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:13,599
And I've done quite a few holidays like this as a teenager.

121
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,560
Being in a foreign family has its challenges.

122
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,341
You're living with strangers.

123
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,762
You may or may not speak the language well.

124
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,546
and they just have a different culture.

125
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:25,867
It's so different.

126
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:29,190
And this family, they had four kids,

127
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,653
and it was the noisiest house I had ever been in.

128
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,755
My own home was a very quiet one.

129
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,075
But I loved it.

130
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:40,399
These people were warm, welcoming, and interesting,

131
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,301
so I actually had a good time.

132
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:45,684
But me being me, at night, you know,

133
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:46,825
when it was time to go to bed,

134
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,487
well, I would go and read my book.

135
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,542
And in the morning, before getting myself ready for the day,

136
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,003
I would read a little bit.

137
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:59,784
And if there was a moment during the day

138
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:01,425
when I didn't have anything special to do,

139
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,006
I might probably take my book and read.

140
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:07,088
And then one day, I get a call from my parents

141
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:10,890
asking me if something's wrong.

142
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,531
Wrong?

143
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,252
No, nothing's wrong.

144
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:15,352
Why do you ask?

145
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:22,982
The family actually had phoned my parents to say that there was a problem, that I wasn't

146
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:28,105
socializing, that I was rejecting them, that I was avoiding them.

147
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:32,848
And to them, how I behaved meant that there was a problem.

148
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:36,630
And they felt really, really bad that they felt that way.

149
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,896
because that was the least of my intention.

150
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:45,039
And so I left my books for the rest of the holidays

151
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,422
and I tried to spend as much time as I could with them,

152
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,643
like I was on social duty, you know,

153
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,444
and like waiting for some signs,

154
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,166
be like, is it okay for me to go to bed now?

155
00:10:55,166 --> 00:11:00,230
And when I think back about that experience,

156
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,751
I think it's a bit of heartbreaking

157
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:05,653
because it's just that we didn't understand each other.

158
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:09,440
We didn't know that I was behaving normally

159
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,661
and they were behaving normally.

160
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:17,003
And what also blew my mind when I listened to that talk

161
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,684
from Susan Cain is that she recalled an example

162
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,985
from her own childhood, which was actually very similar,

163
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:27,727
where she had to put her books to have fun with others.

164
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,393
And it's only when I listened to her that I realized that I hadn't done anything wrong during that holiday.

165
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,994
I had just been me.

166
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,696
And Susan Cain had done the same, and she was fine.

167
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:43,338
And that meant I was fine, too.

168
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:49,742
I think knowledge and awareness is really what makes a difference for us to have better relationships together.

169
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:56,986
Upon my research for this talk, I listened to lots of stories from people, you know,

170
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:59,448
telling how it is to be an introvert and whatever.

171
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:03,334
And there's one particular anecdote that came coming back,

172
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:06,997
and that a lot would confess that at work,

173
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,199
when they really wanted to be alone

174
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,621
and needed time for themselves,

175
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:14,523
they would go to the bathroom,

176
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:18,626
the only place where they could achieve true privacy.

177
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:21,268
And so now it's my turn to confess on stage,

178
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,409
you know, like at work,

179
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,932
I go to the bathroom when I just want to be on my own.

180
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:31,087
I don't have a bladder problem, nor any other kinds of problems.

181
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:42,003
I just want to be in a place where I can turn myself, my senses off, and just recharge.

182
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:45,765
And one can argue that, you know, why the bathroom?

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,686
You know, that's not the nicest of places to do that.

184
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,486
And yeah, I agree.

185
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,607
But in the work environment, and especially

186
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,048
in this era of open spaces, this is the only place

187
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,709
that you can be truly on your own.

188
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,949
You don't have a glass wall.

189
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:02,870
You don't have someone who's going to come knocking

190
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,651
on the door and saying that they need the room, hopefully.

191
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:10,572
And no one finally finding you, you know,

192
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,793
to ask you that something that they've been meaning to ask.

193
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:13,790
forever.

194
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:20,197
And the noise and the lack of privacy of an open space can be overwhelming.

195
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:26,324
And it is important for introverts to find spaces where they can recharge their batteries.

196
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:27,725
In some companies,

197
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,631
they do cater for that need and you can have some private spaces or some small non-bookable

198
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:38,853
rooms that you can go into. Or you can just work from home remotely without it being a

199
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:45,216
fuss at all. And I think these are good solutions to make introverts feel more comfortable.

200
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:51,259
Not only is it better for introverts, you know, for them to be better, but it also means

201
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,960
that they will be more productive and efficient because

202
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,882
because they feel better and that they are in an environment in which they can be at

203
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,244
their best.

204
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:07,687
And it appears that it's, oops, that's not supposed to be that slide.

205
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:17,572
It appears that the modern world has forgotten the value of alone time and that in several

206
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,653
religions you have

207
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:27,280
someone going on a journey in a wild and deserted nature and then coming back with a ton of wisdom that they then share with the world.

208
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,282
Buddha, Jesus, Maume, you've got lots of examples like this. And

209
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:33,484
even Superman

210
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:38,848
has his own fortress of solitude, right? And

211
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:44,491
it's only after he goes there and spends a significant amount of time alone,

212
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:47,393
you know, learning from his crystals and stuff, that he

213
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:54,912
truly becomes able to embrace his potential, his powers, who he is, and that he is ready

214
00:14:54,912 --> 00:15:00,215
to save the world from all the threats that are coming.

215
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:05,078
So what does your own fortress of solitude look like?

216
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:14,543
And this is my message to introverts. Allow yourself to find it and to tune in to this

217
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,791
to this space that is there for you and find that wisdom

218
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,994
that is there only for you and that you can only find

219
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,055
if you spend time within yourself.

220
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,938
And then come back and share it.

221
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:31,001
And to leaders, recognize the introverts in your team

222
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,903
and let them have that time because if you want

223
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:36,586
the best of them, if you want them to be able to

224
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:40,609
give you those unique, creative solutions

225
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,011
that only they can find, you have to give them

226
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,872
this environment.

227
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:54,842
In our work world, group work is very important.

228
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:55,562
We do a lot.

229
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:58,703
And collaboration is important.

230
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:01,864
And everyone, whatever their personality types,

231
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,684
need to be able to work in a group.

232
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:07,946
And introverts absolutely can be part of a team

233
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,886
and work in a group project.

234
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,527
But then again, that's not necessarily

235
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,027
when they will be at their best.

236
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:22,138
they might be not as comfortable expressing themselves in a large number of people.

237
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:29,600
And how can we set an environment to get the best of both worlds? And there are things to

238
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,542
take into consideration. There are a number of studies that show that people tend to follow

239
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:42,324
the person who speaks the loudest in a meeting, that is the most eloquent, that is able to present

240
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,505
their idea the best.

241
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:47,323
But that doesn't mean that their idea is indeed the best.

242
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,585
It just means that they presented it better.

243
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:56,829
And so how do you make sure in your team

244
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,612
that you focus on the best idea rather than on the idea that

245
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:02,653
is presented best?

246
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:09,457
And an example, in meetings, in brainstorming,

247
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:11,858
you have ways that you can avoid that.

248
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,019
And at the end of the

249
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:20,871
of the presentation I have some tools for that.

250
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:28,037
As I mentioned before, introverts and extroverts have different brain chemistry, and there

251
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:35,584
is also some, it has also an impact on what path the thoughts take inside the brains.

252
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:40,849
And the path for extroverts is shorter than the path for introverts.

253
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,568
And what it means is that for introverts, the thoughts come in,

254
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:47,171
and then it's analyzed, it's going this place of the brain,

255
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,392
this place of the brain, and then you

256
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:51,734
think about all of the multiple scenarios that can happen

257
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:55,597
or not happen, discard them, and there's a lot going on.

258
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:58,320
And you need for all of that to be done

259
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,721
before you can actually react.

260
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,422
So there are good things about it,

261
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,643
and there are bad things about it.

262
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:10,169
The good thing is that it allows you to think very deeply

263
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:10,870
on a topic.

264
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:17,097
The bad thing is that the reactivity is not as fast.

265
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:26,939
So how do you ensure that you get the best of introverts in a situation so that you give

266
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,760
them the time to process the information and actually come back with the answer?

267
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:46,416
I remember once having a discussion about a profile that we were hiring for a position

268
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:52,921
and someone said that one of the requirements for the person to be hired was they needed

269
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:57,345
to be outspoken because otherwise they would get eaten in meetings.

270
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:02,128
And that was a very puzzling comment to me.

271
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:09,504
in the meeting is not necessarily where everything happens.

272
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:11,725
You hear what's being said,

273
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,787
and then the loudest and most outspoken person

274
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,708
is gonna take a fair share amount of time,

275
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,690
and to get most people to see their point.

276
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,614
And then people go away to do whatever is their thing.

277
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:29,276
But what the introvert might do is then go back after,

278
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,457
like a couple of days later,

279
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:33,359
and say, speak to this person or this other person.

280
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:38,036
And then you might get an email afterwards saying,

281
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:42,239
oh, well, we didn't take into account this and this thing.

282
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:48,362
And so we slightly changed the outcome.

283
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:52,945
My point with this is that introverts might not

284
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,526
win the battle in a meeting.

285
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,327
That's for sure.

286
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,810
But that doesn't mean that they cannot win the war.

287
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,572
And it's important to focus.

288
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:08,889
when thinking about hiring, about what is the result that you want to achieve rather

289
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,150
than how you want it to be achieved.

290
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:19,113
Introverts are statistically less likely to be chosen for leadership positions than extroverts.

291
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:25,276
And it is curious though because introverts can make great leaders.

292
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:31,458
They tend to be more careful in their approach and to be less likely to take oversized risks.

293
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:36,696
And also there was a study that showed that in some situations,

294
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:41,198
a better outcome with introverts leaders was more likely,

295
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:46,200
because they would be more likely to let the teams run

296
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,121
with their own ID, rather than be excited by what

297
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:53,923
the team is doing, and then maybe not giving them

298
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:58,045
the space to be able to do whatever they're doing.

299
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,766
And Ghandi or Rosa Parks are examples of introverts

300
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,226
to become.

301
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:06,419
great leaders and they did not take the lead for the pleasure of being in the spotlight.

302
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:12,183
It might have been a bit reluctant, it might have made them uncomfortable, but they did

303
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:16,426
because it felt right, they didn't see a way around it, and they did it brilliantly.

304
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:22,070
And there lies a point though, introverts tend to keep their souls to themselves.

305
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:29,455
They have great ideas and maybe they are thinking things through very deeply.

306
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,977
but they fail to share it.

307
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:34,978
And they have a lot to bring to the society,

308
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:40,119
but they don't express, they don't necessarily express it.

309
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:44,159
And maybe because of that also, people misunderstand them.

310
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,000
And I have an example of my own life

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,401
that made that very, very clear to me.

312
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,221
I've been taking some accent softening classes.

313
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,862
Yeah, I'm French, you probably couldn't tell,

314
00:21:57,862 --> 00:21:59,182
but those classes were...

315
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:03,105
well worth my money.

316
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:09,927
And in the group, the teacher gave us an assignment.

317
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:14,388
And we were to pick a celebrity speaking with an RP accent

318
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:18,889
and impersonate them by copying a speech or interview

319
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,410
that they would do.

320
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,230
And I chose an interview from Emma Thompson

321
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,812
when she's commenting about getting a star.

322
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:31,199
on Hollywood Boulevard, and she's being witty and silly,

323
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,719
and it's extremely funny.

324
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,200
I will spare you my impression of Emma Thompson

325
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,280
because that is not the point.

326
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,321
The point is that as each people in the class

327
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,622
did their own impersonation of their own celebrity,

328
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:47,242
and we would each give each other feedback,

329
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:51,083
and I went last, obviously, it was a volunteer basis.

330
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,963
And I did my bit.

331
00:22:55,387 --> 00:23:00,550
And I was very surprised by the feedback I got.

332
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,891
None of it was about my accent,

333
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:07,753
probably because it was perfect.

334
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,214
But what they said was,

335
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:12,115
wow, who is this person in front of me?

336
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:18,178
So much energy, it's like, you were so vibrant, you know?

337
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:19,399
I didn't know you had that in you.

338
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,840
I was like, well, I was acting, thank you.

339
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:27,953
for the compliment, but also I was surprised because,

340
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:30,454
I mean, when I was participating to these classes,

341
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:33,876
like I was engaged, you know, like I was listening

342
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:37,397
and like in my head, you know, lots of stuff was happening.

343
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:40,819
But I, it's only when I got this feedback

344
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,240
that I realized that all of this was happening

345
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,542
inside my head and that no one else was aware of it.

346
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,743
And it really hit me.

347
00:23:51,288 --> 00:24:00,910
that if I don't show what's inside, well no one is ever going to see, no one is ever going to know me,

348
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:07,232
truly, because it doesn't show. So that is my other message, like let it show,

349
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:18,174
let it show, and I had a great pun that I forgot, but it is important, it is important.

350
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,555
And so

351
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:23,475
There are three takeaways from this talk.

352
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,777
One is embrace your need to be alone,

353
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,599
go on that journey, find your fortress of solitude,

354
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,301
and get that inner wisdom, and then share it.

355
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:36,623
The second one is adapt good work

356
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:39,045
to cater for both types of personalities.

357
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:43,628
And the third one is let it show.

358
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:47,570
Show your inner world to everyone around you,

359
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,331
not all the time.

360
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:53,960
but when you feel comfortable once in a while.

361
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,321
And I also wanted to share, and this is my last bit,

362
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:01,981
little ideas how to create environments

363
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:03,742
for all personality types.

364
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:07,562
The first one is create awareness

365
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:08,643
with personality types.

366
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:12,603
So for those who went to the Quantic Foundry talk,

367
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:16,864
you know, it's not necessarily perfect.

368
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:21,540
completely accurate, there are different degrees.

369
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,421
But what I think is great is to create a conversation

370
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,003
about what the tendencies of your team are

371
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:29,305
and to discuss them.

372
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:32,987
And don't just do the personality test

373
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:35,688
and then forget about it, but follow up,

374
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:36,489
continue the discussion.

375
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:42,292
The second point is to put everyone on the same level

376
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,734
so that they can have the same chance to express together.

377
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:46,415
For example,

378
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:51,989
video conferences, having a room full of people and one person alone on their

379
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:55,910
screen. I have been in that situation a lot of time. It makes it so much more

380
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:04,111
difficult to participate. If everyone is on the same level, it removes some

381
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:07,892
barriers to speaking out. In brainstorming, I think that's a very

382
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:11,253
well-known one, but I will tell it anyway.

383
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:14,373
Start by giving some time, like 10, 20 minutes

384
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,795
at the beginning where people write their ideas

385
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:18,756
on Post-it in silence.

386
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:21,317
And only then, once everyone's done,

387
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:24,560
then do you share them so that every idea gets a chance

388
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,620
and you have time to reflect.

389
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,183
And the ideas are not influenced by others.

390
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:34,546
If you have a meeting where you really want

391
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:37,708
to get feedback from people, consider sharing the agenda

392
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,670
and the material, like a pre-read material ahead.

393
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:47,156
so that people who want to be prepared have a chance to do their research before the meeting.

394
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:52,680
And you can start the meeting by asking people what topics they want to be discussed

395
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,023
so that you can make sure that it does get discussed.

396
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:02,006
Say no to back-to-back meetings frenzy.

397
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:06,950
So my own schedule has looked like that, you know, and I know that no one likes it.

398
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,712
You know, introverts, extroverts, no one.

399
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:10,232
But...

400
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:14,646
What I think is that this tells you when you have to think about what.

401
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,867
You know, there is no time for creativity.

402
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:20,968
There is no time for finding your energy or anything.

403
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:25,791
So just consciously say no to such a schedule,

404
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:32,534
but say yes to flexibility, working remotely and not as a favor,

405
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:38,416
but just as something that, you know, is normal for people to do,

406
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,097
to be able to work at their best.

407
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:46,945
And in your open spaces, create some private spots

408
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:49,567
where people can go and be on their own.

409
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,809
And the last point would be,

410
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:57,472
make time for pauses and silences.

411
00:27:57,472 --> 00:28:04,056
So that people have time to digest what you're saying

412
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:06,577
and come up with the answer

413
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,319
that they have inside themselves.

414
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:09,639
And that's it.

415
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:10,994
Thank you.
