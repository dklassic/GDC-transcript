1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,326
Hi guys, I'm Anguel, and this is my show and tell for Potionomics.

2
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,517
So, about us.

3
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:24,122
Um, you know, I'm responsible for characters, animation,

4
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:27,786
I listed myself as pipeline overlord because I like making up funny titles.

5
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:33,351
Um, but basically my job was to hire Emily, the person below me in the picture,

6
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,353
to do my work for me, for the most part.

7
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,996
And, uh, I mean, you know how it goes, right?

8
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,297
Uh, management.

9
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:41,904
It's a good role.

10
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:45,726
No, but, um, so...

11
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:47,347
So, Emily is responsible for animation,

12
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,089
but also a certain amount of concept art.

13
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,049
I just want to recognize that,

14
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:51,390
because she's a great illustrator.

15
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:53,652
About Voracious Games,

16
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:56,213
the way Jati approached me

17
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:58,014
when I was at GDC about,

18
00:00:58,214 --> 00:00:59,475
I guess, seven years ago now,

19
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:00,496
in that picture,

20
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,377
was he mentioned that it was

21
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,058
either starting a video game company,

22
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,679
or he was going to go play Pro Street Fighter.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,721
And I liked that setup.

24
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:12,321
I really liked that background for the founding of the company

25
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,746
and the starting of our first project.

26
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:18,770
Anyway, so the game itself, Potionomics, right, the titular thing we're here to talk about,

27
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:24,895
was inspired by Recettear, Little Witch Academia, and a hunch that character matters.

28
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,718
Um, that's nice to hear, right?

29
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,274
So by the end of it, we ended up with about 3,000 animations, give or take.

30
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:39,179
I can't guarantee that every single one of that last 247 is actually being used, because

31
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:44,223
there's always some spillover, but we got through quite a bit, and we got an Annie nomination.

32
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,158
Yay, nice and concise.

33
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:39,699
So the first thing that comes up is that we really care about philosophy, I guess,

34
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,300
Doesn't necessarily mean like reading philosophers and stuff, 

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,865
but more so it means having guiding principles and concepts

36
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:50,949
that let everybody have a common understanding of what the gut check is.

37
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:56,877
So like it's really, really important that rather than telling you that

38
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,654
you need to make a straight line,

39
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,442
you have a tool to make straight lines

40
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:05,354
and you understand which ones are supposed to be straight or otherwise, right?

41
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,814
Like in the case of straights and curves, for example.

42
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:14,671
So like, the rules and guidelines aren't a structure, but they tell you what the structure

43
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:16,232
is supposed to look like, right?

44
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:22,216
They're a schema in your head for imagining what's gonna be that currently isn't.

45
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:27,787
Sorry if this is like weirdly abstract, but I do like to talk like this, and this is part

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:34,332
of how we communicate in the context of like our meetings in terms of trying to, if it

47
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:38,876
feels like things are running away, reestablish what it is that we're actually talking about

48
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,377
in a very, very simple way.

49
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,620
And I'll get back to why this matters in crits later.

50
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:44,883
But so...

51
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:49,466
The title itself, Show & Tell,

52
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:51,681
is because I liked Show & Tell as a kid,

53
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,969
but also because showing versus telling is like a fundamental adage

54
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,048
and kind of principle and guiding philosophy of animation.

55
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,796
And it's one that we thought about quite a bit at the start,

56
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,758
and in school we were taught a version of it,

57
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:07,907
which was what verbs do you give the player, right?

58
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:12,130
So it's like you let them show the actions and the...

59
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:13,822
Events in the game

60
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:17,060
using the verbiage that you provide to them in the form of gameplay mechanics

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,158
So, you know, every good thesis is worth subverting and flipping

62
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:28,208
around and questioning and saying, like, well, do we have to show versus tell?

63
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,434
Or what if telling is showing?

64
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:36,159
What if it's what is the thing we're trying to do is show just emotion and conversation

65
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:41,433
and some kind of back and forth dialogue that feels not like they're just talking,

66
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,866
but that they're having some sort of authentic emotional exchange.

67
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:51,079
So yeah, if the characters managed to talk about their feelings,

68
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,097
maybe we get to show the telling and kind of shortcut some things.

69
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:59,588
Because all of this is leading towards like the economics in Postionomics, right?

70
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,384
I mean, the economics of the animation,

71
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,216
which is that we kind of chopped off a lot of it.

72
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:14,518
And yeah, so let's see the other thing I wanted to hit before I go on to the next slide was.

73
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:19,864
The qualitative versus like quantitative differences.

74
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,374
Again, this is just about when...

75
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:30,321
When you discuss something, it gets really hard to talk about these abstract ideas, so

76
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:35,123
you always want to have some way to thread them to specific parameters that are on screen,

77
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:35,870
right?

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,831
Like you're making a kind of abstract assertion

79
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:42,906
that you think moving a parameter on a character's

80
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:46,708
rig one way or the other actually means something regarding their emotion.

81
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:51,530
And I'll have some examples in a later slide about exactly what that looks like, but I

82
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,771
just wanted to put that conceptually out there.

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,095
So the other the other kind of starting ideas we had

84
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:06,254
or that I had when we kind of initiated the project was that.

85
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:10,009
Doing all these animations is going to be pretty hard, you know.

86
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,711
Maybe we can trade the footage length of animation

87
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,753
for packing in more character.

88
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:22,056
Maybe if we don't have to do, like, let's say, the anticipation,

89
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,538
then we have more time for the follow-through and the settling, right?

90
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:26,958
In, like, the most simple terms.

91
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,941
And moving, like, beyond that,

92
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:33,142
I think it's worth thinking about...

93
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,711
principles as things that you can exchange.

94
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:40,152
You don't have to adhere to them,

95
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,692
because if you really want to be creative,

96
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,853
you have to be willing to both see and acknowledge

97
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,874
and utilize those principles when they're useful

98
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,815
in pursuing your kind of on-screen goal,

99
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,576
as well as abandoning them the second that they provide

100
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,977
too much friction and start to get in the way.

101
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,678
It's important to be sensitive to that.

102
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:58,518
And that's where the.

103
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,831
Abstract understanding comes into play

104
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,195
because that abstract understanding is what lets you understand

105
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:09,988
whether it's going in the direction that you're actually trying to proceed.

106
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:15,361
Yeah, and then another really important idea was this

107
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:18,625
whole thing about like that the game is in the players head, right?

108
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,571
No matter what we're showing on screen or computing behind the computer screen,

109
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,836
the game itself is sort of like.

110
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,752
Mirage like experience, right?

111
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,923
Because even if in the moments you're very tied to the things that are happening,

112
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:34,670
the inputs and the outputs and all the mechanical interactions.

113
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,073
A large part of the experience of the game is just your memory of

114
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:40,419
what you took away from it, right?

115
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,039
So in reality, most of it, especially over time,

116
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,232
as you get further and further away from the experience in question, right?

117
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:50,548
That like point in time when you played the game

118
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,928
Most of your experience with the game is just some kind of memory reconstruction

119
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:57,928
based on a few lingering data points of

120
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:01,202
what you think you experienced when you were actually playing the game.

121
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,621
You know, that's really important when you're trying to be creative

122
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,214
and come up with wacky new poses,

123
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:09,716
because eventually you start running out of ideas.

124
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,357
It gets tough.

125
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,822
So before we get towards animation principles themselves,

126
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:20,280
I just want to cover that I think also another really important thing

127
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
for appeal and appealing animation

128
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:26,951
is the models and being willing to spend an inordinate amount of time scrutinizing things.

129
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,472
And from...

130
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:32,712
I guess like an intersectional perspective of disciplines, you know,

131
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,511
like I spend a lot of time drawing.

132
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:36,511
I've done all my anatomy studies

133
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:38,355
and

134
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,676
I'm not sure there's really a way to skip past that stuff

135
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,437
Unfortunately, I wish I wish there was a bit of a shortcut but

136
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:52,118
Nah, it's probably a good solid like five years of regular life drawing in my opinion

137
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,659
anyway, I really do think it makes a massive difference because

138
00:08:57,024 --> 00:09:00,426
The easiest way for me to encompass it is the idea of draft in sculpture.

139
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,810
Right, so draft is about the depth and the volume that you manage to represent.

140
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,790
And it's,

141
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,834
it's like, it's one of those things that when you

142
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:12,135
know how to recognize it, it's easy to spot.

143
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:16,239
But when it's missing, it can be hard to identify that that's exactly what's missing or what the

144
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,680
what the delta is there.

145
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,142
But draft in particular, and having good volumes,

146
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,704
affects a lot about your ability to move.

147
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:29,182
The controllers and everything is deforming the mesh along curves and arcs rights.

148
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,637
It's like if you want the animation to be on arcs,

149
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,652
but the components within your rig are moving linearly.

150
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:38,390
You're kind of always going to be fighting some sort of janky on screen paths

151
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,263
when you think about what the viewer is seeing inside of the 2D template, right?

152
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:48,848
Because ultimately, unless you're doing VR stuff. I'm not talking to you guys.

153
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,882
We're talking about a flat-ass canvas, right?

154
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,924
At some point it comes back to this little rectangle

155
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,126
and there's some kind of relationship between any element on screen

156
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:02,908
and the edges. And so that means it's all contained in that canvas.

157
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:08,662
And so, yeah, keeping it on arcs and doing all that nice appealing stuff,

158
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:11,741
getting the fluidity, is

159
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:16,458
extra difficult when you haven't exercised the discipline

160
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,990
to make sure that it adheres to those things in its own structure.

161
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:23,519
One more thing I'll say about it.

162
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,657
I didn't mean to dwell on this one for so long, but also,

163
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:28,288
it's important to remember that like...

164
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,376
The state that any, especially any organic thing that you're modeling is in,

165
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,295
is the outcome of a bunch of processes.

166
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:37,776
No thing is actually static.

167
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:40,880
And so the volume of your jaw

168
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,779
is something that has been pushed into that volume by various forces,

169
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,802
by the forces of your bone growth that grows according to a certain logic.

170
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:54,905
And it doesn't matter what the details and the science-y bits of that logic are.

171
00:10:55,605 --> 00:11:00,026
The more important thing is that you can identify that it's different for one segment versus the other.

172
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:02,823
So that when you're representing anatomical features,

173
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:06,590
you understand how to resolve them as they start pushing against each other.

174
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,495
Because that's where a lot of these things I find fall apart

175
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:14,049
when people try to make models that are appealing but also flexible.

176
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:18,711
It's very easy to want to cheat things to the way the sculpt is being presented,

177
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,371
but then as soon as you start moving it, it becomes an absolute nightmare.

178
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,511
That's why in our sculpting guidelines, the whole...

179
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,452
The whole bottom section is just retopology guidelines,

180
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:33,854
stuff about where polygons go and how they should look.

181
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:39,235
And all of these rules basically have a falloff

182
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,456
from the characters' heads and hands, which

183
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:43,456
are the highest resolution in all respects.

184
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,357
We pay the most attention to them in animation.

185
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,678
They have the most joints in basically all the characters.

186
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,958
They get the most polygon detail.

187
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,099
And then it radiates outward towards.

188
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,461
The other things we don't include on screen very much,

189
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:58,724
and that we don't really utilize to emote, right?

190
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,225
Because the primary emotion is always

191
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,667
coming through the relationship between the head, face,

192
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:07,771
and hands, and whatever they're trying to signal using those.

193
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,815
Actually, I pretty much already covered this part

194
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:15,458
regarding articulation and the thing.

195
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:17,880
I forgot that was on this slide.

196
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:24,747
Yeah, basically good rigging interfaces allow you to maintain those curves and arcs

197
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,517
that you're trying to make.

198
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:31,551
I'm a huge proponent of trying to make everything compute.

199
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,837
Everything move in FK manners, right?

200
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:41,216
I mean, that's like a common thing, but I'm just like a massive stickler

201
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:45,453
and I really believe that like nobody is enough of a stickler on this

202
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:49,168
because you can always spot where animators are trying to.

203
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:52,308
Cheat and use linear interpolation when they shouldn't.

204
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,830
So now finally getting to the animation principles themselves, right?

205
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,671
We have, like, the classical principles on the left,

206
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,811
and then the ones we were left with on the right.

207
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,452
We basically crossed off everything on the list

208
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,253
because there was too much to deal with.

209
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,235
The big conceit was, uh...

210
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:12,316
Actually, it's funny to me, like, looking back at these,

211
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,397
seeing what the original...

212
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:17,338
how the original principles prioritize things.

213
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,477
Right, putting squash and stretch at the top

214
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:25,101
shows me that one of their main concerns was the physicality and the physical plausibility,

215
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:31,322
which I guess when you're trying to discover animation for the first time.

216
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,318
That's probably one of the biggest challenges on your mind.

217
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:37,999
But for us, we kind of started from the bottom with appeal

218
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,561
and felt like maybe that one should be up at the top

219
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,322
or close to it.

220
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,743
And in our version of the principles,

221
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:48,024
we write both character and appeal because

222
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:53,926
Again, they have some, this is part of that territory of like conceptual abstract differences.

223
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:58,347
Which one is the most important can vary at any given time.

224
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:04,509
Whether we go with prioritizing just something that looks appealing in a sort of abstract

225
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:05,850
sense of appealing shapes.

226
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,234
or we don't do that and sacrifice the appeal a little bit to maintain character,

227
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:15,144
usually has to do with the gameplay priorities, right,

228
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:19,681
of what exactly we're trying to give as feedback to the player.

229
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:24,459
Because every one of these emotes is attached to some card or action

230
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,933
or game state for the character.

231
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:32,853
And so ultimately the success in communicating the emotional label

232
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,535
that we never actually put on screen, right?

233
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,477
Like, we don't say that the character's sad.

234
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,799
They just say something and they look sad.

235
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,162
So there's this, like, conceptual gap

236
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:46,666
that you're trying to get the player to understand and bridge.

237
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:50,449
And yeah, you basically do that using...

238
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,345
by negotiating all of these principles.

239
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,767
And for us, it's character, pose, and appeal,

240
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,650
or like the holy trinity, right?

241
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,792
Pose is our main, main tool.

242
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,654
Everything I try to break down into pose,

243
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,637
I'm like a big believer in pose-to-pose animation.

244
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,827
I don't know what they were talking about with straight aheads

245
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,260
I'm not about that stuff.

246
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,835
Lay the poses down.

247
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:17,805
We went so far as to basically block out the entire game in pose, right?

248
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:22,468
Like every single animation existed as a single static frame initially, and it was expected

249
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:27,592
to communicate that state and that action without any motion, right?

250
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,915
Static should be good enough. If you don't, if it didn't pass that bar, it probably just

251
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:36,698
wasn't that good of a pose. And actually, that's gonna...

252
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:44,858
get into the trademark poses right if it's that good of a pose you should feel comfortable

253
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:49,983
enough putting like a brand on it and saying oh TM that is that character right this is

254
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:53,847
unique to that character no one else is really going to approach that kind of posture that

255
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:58,932
orientation. Luna's a really fun one because like with the four arms you can do all sorts

256
00:15:58,992 --> 00:15:59,032
of.

257
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,215
creative, unusual combinations with what she is

258
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,577
occupying herself with, right?

259
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,278
It's always fun to give characters business,

260
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:10,420
but Luna gets to exercise maximum business,

261
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,561
which also fits with her character.

262
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:17,805
Then Quinn's TM pose, that was one we hit pretty early on,

263
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:22,548
just that sense of defeat and disinterest, I guess.

264
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,171
Whereas then Anubia is a character who is cute

265
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,152
and she knows it and she exploits it.

266
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,562
And Baptiste is just always feeling himself. Good for him.

267
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,453
Yeah, so ARCs. I want to shout out ARCs.

268
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:42,854
They're the greatest of the original principles, aside from character and appeal.

269
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:45,569
I think ARCs are like...

270
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:51,492
It's one of those things where people talk about it incessantly, but I feel like somehow

271
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:55,935
we still don't talk about it enough or we haven't come to like a good, concise way to

272
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,176
communicate the concept.

273
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:03,320
Because like, so here in this example, you can see some of my shitty notes that I drew

274
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,702
over one of Mint's animations.

275
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:09,624
And I put these on screen this way because I wanted to make it clear that like, you know,

276
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:14,008
All of that drawing skill doesn't go into good drawings on top of these things.

277
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:18,412
It goes more into good selections of these abstract shapes, right?

278
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:23,576
Like if you look at that green shape that's formed on the middle mint, right?

279
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,910
That sort of inward squishy shape

280
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,842
is something that appears anywhere something that is extending.

281
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,665
So in terms of like squash and stretch, to come back to that principle, I think...

282
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:40,230
A lot of the times, I guess maybe one of my issues with the baseline principles

283
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,918
in thinking in terms of the 12 classical principles,

284
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,542
obviously nobody's super dogmatic about adhering to them,

285
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,652
but it's easy to get into that mindset and start adhering to something

286
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:56,670
just because it was said, right? That idea gets into your head

287
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,651
and you start thinking about your conventional understanding of it

288
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:03,371
versus a subtler, more abstract understanding of it.

289
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:09,554
So in this case, right, that stretching shape indicates that Mint, as she's stretching outward,

290
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,159
should bring her hands inward

291
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,315
because that creates an FK motion inside of the rest of the motion, right,

292
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,063
the FK motion around her elbows

293
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:21,798
versus just trying to stick her hands out using the IK interpolation

294
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:26,879
that you're not supposed to use. You're not allowed. I'm not going to let you.

295
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:31,941
Oh, and another little note in terms of posing is...

296
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,271
You know, so one of the principles we struck off was overlap and follow through.

297
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:41,473
But to some extent, again, we can cheat overlap back into the poses

298
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,395
by spending so much time on these key poses.

299
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:48,697
I drew a little indication there of the shape of the hands

300
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:51,298
to have the fingers kind of dragged behind.

301
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,620
So if you're thinking about how to stick,

302
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,322
how you can cheat one principle into another,

303
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,183
I think that's often a good place to start

304
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:01,844
coming up with...

305
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:12,029
new ideas or at least options in terms of how to address something in an economical

306
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,390
and limited fashion.

307
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:24,907
If you think about South Park, for example, they're not doing a whole lot with those characters.

308
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:30,868
It's just about the kind of energy, the amplitude, and...

309
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:36,520
Yeah, that's pretty much it. They just use timing and I don't know what else.

310
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,622
I guess things move on arcs because they have to.

311
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:48,774
So another principle that we came upon was kind of coming back around to solid drawing.

312
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:52,536
So this is one that I think gets sacrificed a lot in video games.

313
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:57,099
And it's often a topic, you know, something that we struggle with, or we put a bunch of

314
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,321
work in some little feature to massage a tiny little transition between some states that

315
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:01,441
are...

316
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,362
Otherwise difficult to resolve.

317
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,324
But yeah, it is a real thorn in the ass, that one.

318
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,905
And I think my favorite example is just Ragdolls.

319
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:14,826
That's why I put this, I think it's from a mod actually,

320
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,906
but just this GTA screenshot

321
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:20,067
because I've always found them hilariously uncanny.

322
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,188
But also really inspiring

323
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,449
because if players can accept that kind of jank,

324
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,990
then probably they can accept us not having the first half of the animation

325
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,450
on every single animation of the game.

326
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:38,173
And so in terms of like the solid drawing concept,

327
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,688
the other thing I want to emphasize, because we also wrote every frame of painting,

328
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:45,139
we like to talk about things that way. We'd like to talk about

329
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:51,191
you know, maintaining the appeal and the solidity of the drawing of the character on all frames.

330
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:56,695
I think, especially in game animation, sometimes there's such an emphasis on the physicality

331
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:01,259
of things because that's usually most of what's giving feedback about gameplay parameters

332
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,348
that.

333
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:08,705
People tend to get really carried away, I think, with breaking rigs down, right?

334
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:14,148
With this sort of belief, actually, a previous speaker mentioned it, that small jitters in

335
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,449
motion won't be detected, but I think they really will be.

336
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:24,652
I do think they do something in regard to how people read it in their minds.

337
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,554
And again, how they basically save the memory of what they think that they saw.

338
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:33,059
Right, because we're always playing with illusions to some extent.

339
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,993
And that's also one of the reasons that

340
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,919
animations kind of start in the middle of the action in potionomics is because,

341
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:44,515
well, if they didn't quite catch the beginning, maybe they'll fill in a little extra for us, you know?

342
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,815
And it turns out they do.

343
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,426
So yeah, so coming back around to animation principles and crit, this is also another

344
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:59,669
place I would say that any kind of background in drawing or general art is super, super

345
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,490
useful because it can be

346
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:07,386
difficult to get good feedback and input on things

347
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:10,814
if you're mired in technical language and jargon

348
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:14,058
that isn't easily recognizable or easily explainable

349
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:17,137
to somebody who's less experienced in the profession,

350
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:20,346
but they can have a lot of very useful insights and observations

351
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:22,346
on how people express themselves.

352
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,422
And if you're trying to replicate character, that's really the most important part,

353
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:29,403
rather than the jargony bits of all the principles that you're dealing with.

354
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,442
And so, you know, in that interest, as much as I talk,

355
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:39,642
we tried to kind of minimize the active vocabulary of what parameters we're talking about.

356
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:43,357
And actually, I don't like that that.

357
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:46,634
Twitter one is there. I'm going to get back to that one.

358
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:52,110
Okay, so in terms of feedback and acting and ideas and emotion

359
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,414
acting it out should be compulsory. Okay, thanks man.

360
00:22:56,414 --> 00:23:01,052
Acting it out really should be compulsory. I think every animator should just be like.

361
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:05,312
sent to the gulags if they don't have time to live life

362
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:07,796
and explore things, explore some kind of expressive

363
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:12,683
type of movement, you know, dancing, athletics,

364
00:23:12,784 --> 00:23:13,765
I'm not joking here.

365
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,969
Like, I really think it makes an...

366
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,652
It's an instrumental difference, right?

367
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:20,173
When Emily started working on the project,

368
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,655
she started snowboarding, for example.

369
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,738
And all of these little things give you new opportunities

370
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:27,861
to recognize interactions between people

371
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:30,524
and context within which they interact and emote.

372
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:32,286
So let's get to that kind of stuff.

373
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,087
The illusion of consciousness.

374
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:40,036
So, you know, the illusion of life is the original one, but to me, the kind of more

375
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:44,660
important thing isn't just life, because that's like the first bar, right?

376
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,824
Is that something is alive, breathing, but like when it's conscious, then you want to

377
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,225
know what's on its mind, right?

378
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:51,346
What is it thinking?

379
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,348
And that's when it's able to have emotions.

380
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:57,472
And I use the picture from RoboCop of...

381
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,855
of Cain's brain there with the googly eyes.

382
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,618
because that's kind of how I imagine this stuff on the most base level

383
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:08,159
And I also find things like these heat maps kind of useful to think about

384
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,955
in term of where does the feeling resides within the character.

385
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:19,438
However, you know, all of these science-y little factoids are great and useful, but

386
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,501
it's important to remember things like, for example, anger and happiness and love and

387
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:27,944
pride, if we look at them all from the chest up here, they look identical, right?

388
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:28,485
So again, you don't

389
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:32,066
You don't want to get too stuck on any of these kinds of rules that you create or find

390
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:37,668
for yourself, especially anatomical references, scientific references can be very slippery

391
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,570
slopes especially if you think that you understand the material in question and then you start

392
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:48,012
applying it very rigorously and find yourself down some weird, wacky, uncanny path way,

393
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:50,113
way after you can change course.

394
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:55,137
So here's a few of the initial explorations of Sylvia,

395
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,840
kind of trying to search for her TM attitude.

396
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,803
I'd say the top middle one is around when we hit it.

397
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:04,386
We also did get one contract animation from a friend of mine

398
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:06,408
that was very informative,

399
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:10,311
but lost somewhere in the history of our files, unfortunately.

400
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:20,714
So these are the first, some of the first successful anims that got splined out of the poses, right?

401
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:24,665
These are some really core explorations we did,

402
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:28,200
because at this point we got to start thinking about not just the body language

403
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,281
of Sylvia or of one of the other characters,

404
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:32,056
but what is Sylvia's body language like

405
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:35,726
when she is trying to represent the body language of another character, right?

406
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:38,688
Which things does she observe and retain and...

407
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,489
reflect from whatever she learned from the other character,

408
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,390
because the kind of fundamental progression mechanic in the card games

409
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,931
is that you pick up different kinds of arguments you can use in haggling

410
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,871
from these other characters you interact with,

411
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,732
and part of that involves understanding something about their emotional journey

412
00:25:56,752 --> 00:25:59,892
and them as a person, and that's kind of what enables Sylvia

413
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:03,413
to imbibe that knowledge.

414
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:06,314
Oh man, I gotta stop breathing on this.

415
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:12,456
Yeah, OK, so now we can touch on the body language parameters really quickly.

416
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:15,142
How many minutes do I have left? I think I'm like right at the end, right?

417
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,862
OK, awesome, let's just blast through it.

418
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:19,462
OK, body language parameters.

419
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,583
For me, the most important thing is to remember that

420
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:24,547
everything is pointing at something at all times, right?

421
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,517
Especially the face and hands, right?

422
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:28,627
These are your big communication tools.

423
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:29,683
They're very articulate.

424
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:32,110
They've got a lot of little features and we as human beings

425
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,209
are very sensitive to all the little nuances and changes in the shapes, right?

426
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,189
So.

427
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:43,386
then moving beyond that and kind of reconnecting to the idea of the central nervous system.

428
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:47,749
The other thing I like to think about is basically what kind of torsion the spine is going through

429
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,553
and where that puts the head, chest, and hips in terms of what they're pointing at,

430
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:57,496
because it gives a lot of kind of contextual clues for characters.

431
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,223
that you can utilize to think about subtext in their body language, right?

432
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:06,553
So for example, some characters are going to be maybe

433
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:09,344
more prone to covering their stomach, right?

434
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:14,455
Or covering their chest, or how is it that they, if you think about the heat maps,

435
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:19,480
what is their reaction to where the energy or heat is sitting in their body during that emotion?

436
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,944
Just because they're feeling the same temperature

437
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,866
fluctuation in their body doesn't necessarily

438
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:27,469
mean that they physically react to it the same way.

439
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,351
Some of them may react to it directly.

440
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,233
Some of them may want to not indicate

441
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:32,174
that they're feeling that.

442
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:36,959
And that basically comes from where things are pointing at.

443
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:39,402
We tend to think in terms of, is it pointing?

444
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:41,703
at the other character or away from the other character.

445
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,543
And if it's pointing away from the other character,

446
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:45,543
what is it pointing at?

447
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,724
Is it pointing at something here?

448
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,124
Is it pointing at something there?

449
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:49,864
Is it pointing at something in the past?

450
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,625
Are they thinking about something in the future?

451
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,165
Or are they imagining something?

452
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:55,385
And further, you can consider, you know,

453
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:58,266
does the character in question look up or down

454
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,706
when they imagine something, right?

455
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,087
How, what is their emotional connection

456
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,728
to the thing that they're imagining in their mind?

457
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:06,628
And that's...

458
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:13,072
That's what I was referring to earlier in terms of having simplified geometric parameters.

459
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:17,736
Because when you make the conversation less about the timing of something and more about,

460
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:23,841
OK, does this character want to wave directly at Sylvia?

461
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:27,103
Or are they more casual about how they wave at Sylvia?

462
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,026
Does that make sense?

463
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,495
Because then you can think about the actual, like, it's just a change of angle, right?

464
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:36,897
That's all we're talking about at this point.

465
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:43,462
But we're able to kind of tie it more directly to the kind of emotional connection or lack

466
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:49,227
thereof, and again, the subtext layers of which emotions we're talking about with any

467
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:51,449
given component of the body.

468
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:57,608
Um, eye lines also. Lines, arrows. Like I said, everything is pointing at something.

469
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:01,652
Uh, I really enjoy these expressions from Boss Finn.

470
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:04,755
Um, but yeah I pretty much already explained this one.

471
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:08,699
Uh, no rake hands. Please. God, for God's sake.

472
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,463
Don't ever, ever just grab all the controllers and rotate them together.

473
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,305
The human hand doesn't function that way.

474
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:19,035
I would recommend Bridgman. I'm a big fan of his.

475
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:24,620
I think one of the most important things is to understand how to simplify hand movements

476
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:28,984
and to think of them in fewer surfaces than you actually have, right?

477
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:31,447
Because there's a lot of little bits to hands and fingers.

478
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,949
They can be hard to manage, I understand.

479
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,513
But, you know, simple geometry can get you through it. It can help you.

480
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:43,806
Let's see, final ones.

481
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:49,052
Okay, so one other thing I wanted to point out about Silhouette.

482
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:50,234
It's like a pet peeve of mine.

483
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:51,595
People like to talk about Silhouette.

484
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:52,516
We're over.

485
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:57,875
Okay, okay. People like to talk about silhouette, but they don't think about internal silhouettes.

486
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:05,198
So in this case, you know, we have Baptiste holding a mic there in the middle, and the

487
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:09,260
initial thought is to maybe bump his elbow out so that you can see it in the literal

488
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,582
sense of the silhouette edge of himself. But if you really understand that the context

489
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:18,384
of this is for him to show the mic and make the mic clear, then the more important thing

490
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:21,966
is the angle and placement of the microphone rather than where his elbow is.

491
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,367
And that isn't really breaking out of his physical silhouette,

492
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:28,748
but really it gets its own silhouette by virtue of color contrast

493
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,729
just within the space of his chest.

494
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,230
So it's important to think about it in a graphic nature.

495
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,170
And that's it.
