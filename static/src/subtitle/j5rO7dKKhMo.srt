00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,523
Hi, I'm Ed Zobrist.

2
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:10,844
I'm the head of publishing for Epic Games on Fortnite,

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:15,567
as well as Spy Jinks and Battle Royale.

4
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:18,348
Right off the bat, though, I'd like

5
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:20,249
to talk about what we're not going to talk about.

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,590
We're not going to talk that much about Battle Royale.

7
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:32,100
Some, but from a marketing standpoint, it's actually not as interesting intellectually

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,281
for what we did as what we did with Save the World.

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:40,644
So we're going to focus more on Save the World, which is our PVE game that preceded Battle

10
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,204
Royale that we launched this summer.

11
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,747
I'm also not really going to talk a lot about numbers or metrics.

12
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:55,329
First off, there are probably some analysts or competitors out there, and I'm not interested

13
00:00:55,349 --> 00:01:00,491
in divulging more information than I have to, but really it's because this presentation

14
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:07,893
is more about principles and ideas that we use to launch Save the World and why we diverge

15
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:12,075
from what is really sort of conventional business practices for major publishers.

16
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:14,375
So to give you a feeling for my background,

17
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:18,057
I was basically classically trained as a marketer.

18
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:21,718
Coming out of Wharton, went to General Mills Consumer

19
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,680
Products, and eventually went to Mattel, the Walt Disney

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,761
Company, then to Universal Games,

21
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,642
then Sierra Entertainment, which became Activision Blizzard.

22
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,903
So I'm pretty well-grounded when it

23
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:37,844
comes to traditional marketing, as well as how major publishers

24
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,465
operate and launch games.

25
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:45,381
But in spite of that kind of background,

26
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,942
that's not at all what we did for Save the World.

27
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,543
And I want to give you a little insight into that.

28
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,764
And for you indie developers, which

29
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:55,925
is really what I'm here for, I used to also do indie

30
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,006
development, I'm trying to give you

31
00:01:58,046 --> 00:01:59,847
a sense of how you could think about the world

32
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,348
and apply some principles to what you're

33
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,328
doing when you launch a game.

34
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,330
And you don't necessarily have to follow the same recipe

35
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,711
that the big publishers are following, or even that we

36
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:10,312
for that matter.

37
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:14,645
All right, so let's first set the stage for what was going on with Fortnite.

38
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,667
We started development in 2011.

39
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:20,927
That's right.

40
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:22,287
Seven years ago.

41
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:25,789
Survival game, action building,

42
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,450
had a cover for Game Informer in 2014.

43
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,511
And I just want to give you a flavor

44
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,412
of a video that was given to Game Informer back then in 2014

45
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,773
to give you a sense of where we were at that time.

46
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:52,026
Fortnite is an action building game that is heavily focused on exploration, discoverability, obviously building.

47
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,908
There's shooter aspects to it, there's RPG and progression aspects to it.

48
00:02:56,182 --> 00:03:00,446
When players first get into the experience, the absolute raw thing is that they're going

49
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,848
to be masters of what we're considering the home base.

50
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:08,532
This represents sort of a group of heroes that have undertaken the task of saving the

51
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,273
world from the oncoming storm.

52
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:15,157
Our storm is our mysterious force in the world where the monsters come from.

53
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:19,860
They start out with their base and then they move into the sort of action aspect of the game,

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,042
which is they spawn into the world, they don't have any equipment,

55
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:26,544
they immediately have to get tools, they have to get weapons,

56
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:31,588
they have to get resources so they can build, and there are gates in the world that the players

57
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:34,890
will be closing because those are the things that tie the storms to the world.

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,971
And if they can shut the gates...

59
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,693
they can push back the storms and push back the monsters.

60
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:42,135
So they're basically taking terrain back one area at a time.

61
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,577
And then hopefully they interact with their friends and be like,

62
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:47,879
okay, we both have home bases, like, let's link them together

63
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,221
and the benefits from both our bases help us together as a group.

64
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:54,803
And that, to me, that cooperative nature of the primal building,

65
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:58,966
like, you know, I never built forts alone when I was in the woods as a kid.

66
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,187
That was something you did with your friends.

67
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,048
Same feeling in Fortnite. Like, let's get together.

68
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:05,611
We will work as a group to build these giant forts and fight the bad guys.

69
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:10,993
For us, the way we build is super new, the ease of use of the building system.

70
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:16,135
So I can't build Mordor or, you know, the Starship Enterprise. I can't.

71
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:20,316
So I think because people will feel like they're awesome and creative from the very beginning

72
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:25,738
without necessarily having a lot of artistic talent, Fortnite's gonna really feed to that.

73
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,799
There's a lot of really awesome building games that we love and that we play all the time,

74
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,781
and I feel like we're riffing kind of on that zeitgeist where we're like,

75
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,401
let's take it to the next level.

76
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:40,524
Although Helms Deep is a great fight to have, but it happens like what do I do in between that?

77
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:46,087
Well, the truth of the matter is you explore the world, you get resources to bring back to the structure that is the permanent one.

78
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:51,230
But since you can access building anywhere, you can use those tools however you wish.

79
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,513
And so making some quick strongholds that you can just hold up into for during the storm and just weather it, that's what you'll do.

80
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,896
But you know, the truly majestic version of it is back at home waiting for you.

81
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:04,138
People are going to get the experience of Fortnite this year. It's going to be free.

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,906
And I think, you know, that's awesome.

83
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:10,192
It's a great way to have a conversation with.

84
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:13,683
with players because they're not obligated to like it.

85
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:14,924
So we have to do our jobs.

86
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,325
We have to be awesome game creators to say,

87
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,006
it's worth your time to play this game.

88
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:19,927
And I think we've done that.

89
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,768
We looked at the people that were doing it really well

90
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,110
and we're saying, we could do it that way.

91
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,071
There are ways to have our game be free

92
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:28,552
and have it be fair.

93
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,614
Our game is definitely not pay to win.

94
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:33,376
It is just an experience to have fun.

95
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,317
We know that the more that people play

96
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,578
and the more people play, people will buy into it.

97
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:43,029
Like, I mean, if you like it, there'll be something about it that you'll want to spend some money on.

98
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,691
And if you don't, that's fine too.

99
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:51,435
Of course, you know, it's business, but it's also one of passion.

100
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,417
We're going to do things really smart and super fair.

101
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,621
We're going to start making a cool game that gamers want to play and then everything else will fall out of there.

102
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:03,102
We feel like Fortnite is a conversation with our players.

103
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:05,883
We want them to tell us what they want,

104
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,364
because we're gamers too,

105
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:11,765
and we recognize that, hey, we're just a few people.

106
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,126
We don't have all the right ideas,

107
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,226
and we know that a lot of players out there

108
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,587
have a lot of really cool ideas.

109
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,128
What we would love to see is a game

110
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,588
that lasts for years and years and years,

111
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,889
and ends up somewhere we don't even expect,

112
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,390
because that makes it interesting for us.

113
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,030
The team's really excited,

114
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,831
so the sooner we get it out there, the happier I'll be.

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,740
OK.

116
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,602
Pretty good marketing.

117
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:38,583
Game Informer supporting it.

118
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:41,264
Would have been great if we had launched in 2014.

119
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:47,088
But we didn't.

120
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,711
The issue then became, when we finally

121
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,052
did get around to launching, or start

122
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:54,433
thinking about the launch, we started

123
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,234
thinking about the launch planning in 2016, 2017,

124
00:06:56,434 --> 00:07:00,256
knowing we were going to launch sometime that summer, mid 2017.

125
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,737
So, from a marking standpoint, we had a couple of issues that we had to deal with.

126
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:10,047
One was this sort of indifferent perception about the game.

127
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:11,751
It had gone through a long delay.

128
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,089
And we'd also described it all along as free to play,

129
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,970
and that's how it was designed as a game.

130
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:18,872
It's going to be a free to play game,

131
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:22,935
which led it to a certain sort of play system

132
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:24,577
associated with it.

133
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:27,779
It was also a somewhat unusual game.

134
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,862
It's sort of the mishmash of a bunch of different genres.

135
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,124
So it wasn't that easy to really grasp

136
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:37,207
or describe what it was in a short, pithy statement.

137
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,540
And finally, we were going off to launch in that summer of last year,

138
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,202
but we knew we weren't quite ready.

139
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:49,307
We knew it still needed tuning, it still had features that needed to go into it.

140
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,010
But we also wanted to start getting feedback,

141
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,494
because we needed some players, more players playing it in a live environment

142
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,695
to help us guide the...

143
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,558
the ongoing development to get us to that free-to-play state that we ultimately desired.

144
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:08,819
So we decided we were going to go a route that's very common on PC but very uncommon on console,

145
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:12,320
and that is we're going to call it free-to-play, or call it paid early access.

146
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,861
And everyone who knows Steam and PC knows what early access means,

147
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,942
but it's a little bit more of an alien concept when it comes to console.

148
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:29,149
The, but in our mind that was a way to signal to the players that it wasn't quite finished,

149
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:33,791
wasn't quite done and that what they were experiencing was going to ultimately change

150
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:40,233
and evolve on its route to becoming a free-to-play game. But we were paid. We were paid Early Access.

151
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:45,135
Partially we were paid because we wanted to make certain we had a really qualified

152
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:48,776
group that was coming in to give us feedback on the game.

153
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:56,190
And when we choose the price points, we probably, as a company, could have made a lot more money if we just started at $60.

154
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,672
The product itself looked like a AAA game.

155
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:06,294
But just ethics, just general stances, is just not the right thing to do for players.

156
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:10,115
If people wanted to come at a lower price point, we were going to let them come at a lower price point

157
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:15,277
because it wasn't really ready as far as we were concerned, therefore we'd offer the lower tier.

158
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:17,898
But if someone wanted to, you could go for one of the higher tiers.

159
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,720
and you would get even more loot and starting goodies.

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,642
And by the way, those prices, they were set around to deliver to the players

161
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,664
the equivalent plus a little more of what if in the free-to-play mode

162
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:34,186
you had spent that much money, the kind of things you would have acquired early on.

163
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,666
So it was our way of calibrating it

164
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:40,388
to get a sense of what the gameplay mechanics were going to be like when we started to tune it.

165
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,922
All right, now it starts getting a little more interesting.

166
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,388
A couple key milestones that a lot of big publishers

167
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:59,551
go through are they typically have a big cinematic trailer.

168
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:00,932
And you guys know who I'm talking about.

169
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,794
They have a gameplay trailer, and then they announce,

170
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,416
oh, here's the date we're going to launch.

171
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:06,837
Go to the stores, pick us up.

172
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,653
And I've come up with my sense of just a rough industry

173
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,713
standard of what most big publishers would

174
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,014
have done around the time frame, with the cinematic,

175
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,514
say, coming 12 to 18 months in advance.

176
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:22,215
And then gameplay trailers, I should use plural,

177
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,656
start coming out around four or six months in advance.

178
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,316
And then about two or three months

179
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,797
before the actual launch happens, they announce it.

180
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,377
They start a big pre-reg campaign.

181
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,677
And the machine kicks in leading up to the launch.

182
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:34,838
So here's what we did.

183
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,772
We actually didn't lead with the cinematic trailer.

184
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,473
We had one, I'm gonna show it to you in a little bit.

185
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,635
It's beautiful, but we didn't lead with it.

186
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,856
We started with the gameplay trailer,

187
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,818
and we announced the date of our ship

188
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,119
at exactly the same time, seven weeks in advance.

189
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,822
And then eventually the cinematic came along

190
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:57,904
about three weeks before the actual launch occurred.

191
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,327
So let's look a little more deeply at those.

192
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:03,088
We're seven weeks before launch.

193
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,458
We announced it at press release just before E3.

194
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,439
We're dodging the tornado of E3.

195
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:11,020
We know that we have got a lot of ground.

196
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,021
We've got to recover for the game because

197
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,281
of that indifferent perception.

198
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,301
And we have baggage.

199
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,722
So we want to launch or announce at a time

200
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,983
where we can get the max amount of attention

201
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:24,525
and not get overwhelmed by all the storm of E3 coverage.

202
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:26,026
We put out our website.

203
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,292
And then we put out a gameplay trailer.

204
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,994
Now remember I said the game is a little unusual.

205
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:34,377
It's a little bit not conventional and it requires you to

206
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,099
actually think a little bit more about how you play the game

207
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,101
because it doesn't fit a neat, tidy description.

208
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,043
So we did two gameplay trailers.

209
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:45,186
We did one real short one, 30, just because that's the norm

210
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,887
so people didn't have time to watch it.

211
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,729
But we also put out a really long one.

212
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:49,990
And I'm going to show you the long one

213
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,751
because it gives you a sense of

214
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:55,815
the things we thought were important that we had to start conveying to the players.

215
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,756
and also a sense of where the game had evolved

216
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,396
from that first trailer I showed you,

217
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:01,737
and the game did evolve,

218
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:04,578
not just in terms of gameplay and art,

219
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:07,739
but it frankly evolved as far as Epic's,

220
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,201
basically, its video services capabilities.

221
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:12,801
We put together a much more polished

222
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,363
and better trailer, in my mind,

223
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,003
on gameplay,

224
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:19,904
and the whole video,

225
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,845
the whole area of video within Epic

226
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,226
has just been a huge, huge progression over the years.

227
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,166
So let's take a look at that.

228
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,289
If you're out there, we need your help.

229
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,450
The storm came. The monsters followed.

230
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,111
They took everything. Our towns, our families.

231
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,171
The few of us left are in serious danger.

232
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:54,332
Now, it's time to fight back.

233
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,954
All we need is a leader.

234
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:01,774
And that's you.

235
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:11,192
Sure, it'll be dangerous. I mean, yeah, there's monsters. A lot of monsters.

236
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:18,216
But we've got massive forts.

237
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,657
Killer traps.

238
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:22,779
And piles of loot.

239
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,041
If we stick together, they don't stand a chance.

240
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:31,344
This is our world, and it's time to take it back.

241
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:40,808
The world of Fortnite is filled with places to explore and loot to scavenge.

242
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:46,271
Collect building and crafting materials while traveling across landscapes where no two are ever the same.

243
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,676
You never know what you'll find, or where you'll find it.

244
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:58,100
Make sure to go inside buildings. Searching can pay off.

245
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:04,524
Everything you collect can be used to protect yourself or help the survivors out there who need you.

246
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,637
For protection from the storm, you and your friends will need to build forts.

247
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:14,499
Use a variety of building pieces to keep enemies at bay and make a strong defense.

248
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,780
Edit mode lets you customize pieces to fit your needs.

249
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,081
Make doors or windows.

250
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,522
Or get more creative.

251
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:27,683
Stronger materials like stone or metal will give your fort more staying power.

252
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:32,945
Being able to build on the fly lets you respond to threats quickly and adapt when you need to.

253
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,998
You didn't make all this just to watch it get knocked down!

254
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:40,860
Defend your fort the way you want.

255
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,161
Build sniper towers if that's your style.

256
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,445
Or use all of the powerful traps you've crafted

257
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:50,966
to make a maze of death that'll do the dirty work for you.

258
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,429
When monsters do take a bite out of your defenses,

259
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:58,311
you can repair and reinforce them during the heat of battle.

260
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,413
Keep an eye out for weak spots, because the enemy sees them too.

261
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,460
Use your imagination.

262
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,242
Build the ultimate fort and use it to withstand all the bad things the storm will throw at you.

263
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:16,646
With what you've harvested, you can craft hundreds of weapons, from melee to heavy arms.

264
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,008
Make traps to set up the perfect surprise attack.

265
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,370
Or use gadgets that will help you and your team.

266
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,983
Manage your resources well and you can be fully prepared for whatever is headed your way.

267
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:41,727
Your friends will help you succeed. Each hero is a specialized version of one of the basic types.

268
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:49,191
Constructors, Soldiers, Outlanders, and Ninjas. Each hero you collect comes with individual

269
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:54,134
advantages that fulfill different roles on your team. Of course, constructors are skilled at

270
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:58,076
building forts, but they also provide valuable crowd control.

271
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,153
Primed for combat, soldiers bring grenades, as well as the big guns.

272
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:05,975
And sometimes, the biggest guns.

273
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:11,860
Outlanders are the best at harvesting, and have some unique tools at their disposal.

274
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:15,924
All that and a mean right hook.

275
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,987
Finally, there are ninjas.

276
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,949
Great for melee, and really into throwing stars.

277
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,132
They're good for getting into and out of trouble quickly.

278
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,329
Collect cards to get heroes with different skills.

279
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,753
More heroes equals more abilities at your disposal.

280
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:36,755
Get your friends together for a well-rounded team.

281
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:40,318
Cooperation can make all the difference.

282
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,459
The people need you.

283
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,861
Rescue survivors and give them a home.

284
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:46,003
Defend them with everything you've got.

285
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:47,905
Don't seek shelter.

286
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:48,705
Make it count.

287
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:01,231
Part of that video was also driven by research.

288
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:05,213
We wanted to confirm, it was no surprise, actually,

289
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:07,675
that there are certain things that gamers had to know

290
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:09,496
was inside the game before they would consider it.

291
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,539
For this style of gamer, things like we showed a skill tree,

292
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,240
because a lot of people wanted to make certain

293
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,782
that's how the game is played, or that we had classes.

294
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,082
So that's why we tended to dwell

295
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,024
on a lot of the different elements of the game,

296
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:22,545
to make certain people understood

297
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,366
the depth associated with it.

298
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:25,927
All right.

299
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,994
Two weeks go by, we've just done E3,

300
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:31,735
we've come out with the gameplay trailer,

301
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:34,597
and we start a program called Search for Survivors.

302
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,878
A lot of people talk about our influencer programs

303
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,859
that we run at Epic, but this is the first time

304
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,560
we've tried it on a major scale.

305
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:46,062
Our Search for Survivors program was essentially us

306
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,743
teaming up with a whole bunch of YouTubers,

307
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,745
and we would space them out, so a few every week

308
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,906
would come out with new videos, they're sponsored.

309
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:00,750
And the idea was that their viewers would watch these videos

310
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,911
and if they went and they clicked through to pre-register,

311
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:07,715
they would also get a banner that was unique to that influencer

312
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,776
that they could use in the game.

313
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,398
The game has banners inside of it.

314
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:16,923
They could use it in the game and they would end up getting special loot as well

315
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:21,867
if they had signed up through our Search for Survivors campaign.

316
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:27,655
Plus, this is all tying back to the website for the pre-register program,

317
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:33,197
as in almost compendium-like way, as more and more people signed up for pre-registration,

318
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:39,020
we had a higher and higher level of extra group of loot that was given out to anyone.

319
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,842
Anyone who pre-registered, as long as the numbers kept going up.

320
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:46,104
So let's take a peek at one of those influencer videos.

321
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:55,399
What's up everybody H2O Delirious here. We are playing a game called Fortnite. It's an awesome game. I've already played it

322
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:58,742
I played it with Ohm. I played it with Vanoss. I played with a bunch of people already

323
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:05,648
But this game is just me and Ohm goofing around making a massive base of our own. I hope you enjoy it

324
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:09,411
I'm gonna leave a link in the top of the description for you to click it if you are

325
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:12,894
Interested at all in the Fortnite game, so please click it for me

326
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:18,818
Anyone who signs up through the link will be granted custom banners which will be one of my own and it will be added on

327
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:23,921
The 21st of July if the game gathers enough survivors, which is you guys for pre registrations

328
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:29,845
There will be additional items a lot for you for pre registering on the game. That being said, I hope you enjoyed the game

329
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,026
Peace out everybody and goodbye

330
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:36,789
Welcome to fortnight. Um, welcome. Welcome

331
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,582
Part of this also was a very conventional device's trial.

332
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:46,645
We really would love to have had some sort of trial device

333
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,407
so people could play the game, do their own hands-on.

334
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,828
But remember, we're a co-op PVE game

335
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:52,929
which requires a lot of players.

336
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,471
So it's not very easy to do a trial device

337
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,712
prior to the launch of that kind of game.

338
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,954
Except just before, and we did have a Head Start program.

339
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:07,320
So by using YouTubers and Influencer, we're basically simulating what it feels like to play the game.

340
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:12,885
So we accomplished it in a different way than actually doing a trial device.

341
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:24,535
Alright, I've talked about the cinematic and how we didn't launch it until just before launch.

342
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:26,217
Three weeks before launch.

343
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:31,457
We debuted exclusively at the Rischi Teeth Convention in Austin.

344
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:34,538
Now, this was an ideal setting for us.

345
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:39,481
These are the folks that did the red versus blue videos.

346
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:44,483
And this is an audience that has a really high affinity for quality cinematics.

347
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:48,845
So they were naturally gonna be receptive to seeing what we had to offer.

348
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:56,420
And Rooster Teeth also has a decent network for getting out the word about what's going on

349
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,922
to their group of players, so we thought that was great.

350
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:04,126
And they're frankly just a blast to work with as well.

351
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,328
So here, let's look at the cinematic.

352
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:31,375
Alright people, let's search this dump and get out of here ASAP.

353
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,857
Dump? What's wrong with the Durr Burger?

354
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:39,300
Yeah, it's got everything. Garbage, rats, severe structural damage.

355
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,822
Some people just can't appreciate fine dining.

356
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:49,963
Did you hear that?

357
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:51,604
You got nothing to worry about.

358
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:52,405
Trust me.

359
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,486
I've got the heightened senses of a ninja.

360
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,827
I am so sorry.

361
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:57,408
Hey, hey.

362
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:58,288
It's okay.

363
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,549
We're gonna get you out of here.

364
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,529
Oh, thank you.

365
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,531
We thought you were more of those things.

366
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,293
Monsters are coming.

367
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,255
Looks like we're staying put.

368
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:10,575
Right.

369
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:11,136
All right.

370
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:12,556
You two stick with me.

371
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:13,337
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:14,458
Let's get to work.

373
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:48,449
We're here.

374
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,509
I guess meat is murder.

375
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:49,909
Ugh, you're killing me, man.

376
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:50,909
Okay.

377
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,769
Let's head to the roof for evac.

378
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,550
Aside from the part where we almost died,

379
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,930
that was amazing.

380
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,030
Hey, don't mention it.

381
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,691
It's all in a night's work.

382
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:06,492
All right, guys.

383
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,992
Who's up for pizza?

384
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:13,533
Oh, yeah! Pizza!

385
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,033
Reorder now and get a four day-

386
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,328
OK.

387
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:18,948
So you get the idea.

388
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:20,088
Pretty high quality video.

389
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,229
I mean, this is a further, yet another way for us

390
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:27,510
to just re-emphasize the quality of the products

391
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,270
that we were making and bringing.

392
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,150
And again, this is three weeks before launch.

393
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:35,711
So very, very soon thereafter, we would be selling the game.

394
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:41,912
July 25, we launch.

395
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:45,293
We had a minor, small Head Start program

396
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:46,373
where some people got in early.

397
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,817
We launched it mainly with digital advertising, so important to note.

398
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,238
We didn't use TV to do it.

399
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,980
Decided we didn't need it, actually.

400
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,342
We had a Twitch Viral Quest program.

401
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,943
And for those of you who don't know what this is,

402
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,185
it's when a streamer

403
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:07,389
completed a quest online to someone who had a Twitch account.

404
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:13,721
It was linked to our accounts. We knew through their Epic account that they had been watching someone who had completed it,

405
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,643
and they would get a special quest inside the game.

406
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,345
So we're actually tying you back to what was going on in the game.

407
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:23,787
That whole Searcher Survivor program activated, the banners went out,

408
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:27,490
the loot went out to people who had participated in the pre-reg program.

409
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,354
We also had retail support from Gearbox.

410
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:32,914
We didn't originally plan to do retail,

411
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:36,415
but late along the ways, we were talking with Gearbox

412
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,775
and decided to go for it, and I just had to give them props.

413
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,416
And at a really, really tight timetable,

414
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:43,976
Gearbox was able to get a retail program in place.

415
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:47,537
And then we had Sony and Microsoft Store Placements

416
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,117
to help us with the actual launch.

417
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:54,378
And everything depends on whether or not you do all this

418
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:55,458
for whether or not it works.

419
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,529
It frankly exceeded our expectations.

420
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:03,212
It laid the groundwork for the game to continue to grow

421
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:06,934
as it marched on to its free-to-play status, which we'll do this year.

422
00:26:06,954 --> 00:26:10,937
I'm happy to say the retention is high and here we are

423
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:13,959
over six months later

424
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,542
and our audience is larger now than it's ever been for Save the World.

425
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,663
Not just for BR, this is for Save the World.

426
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:23,645
So for us it's worked out extremely well.

427
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:33,271
Okay, here's why you probably really came here a little bit about battle royale now talk a little

428
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:33,891
lot little on it.

429
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:43,417
About 2 months to develop it launched in September 26 so let's let's do some math.

430
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,319
Save the world the P game.

431
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:49,199
launched July 21.

432
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,721
This comes out September 26, so yeah.

433
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:56,403
We started working on this just about the time

434
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:58,084
Save the World was coming out.

435
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,646
And it was the Unreal Tournament team

436
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:05,048
that popped over to pick up the charge

437
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,670
for us to basically put, originally what we thought

438
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,893
would be a PvP version inside of our PvE game.

439
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:20,776
Then things changed as we got really close to launch

440
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:22,556
and we'd already started marketing it

441
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:26,378
as if this PVP mode, Battle Royale,

442
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,959
was gonna be inside of Save the World

443
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,620
and people, as far as we could tell,

444
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,340
we saw an uptick in sales, we're beginning to buy

445
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,481
Save the World and expectation of being able to play it.

446
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:37,806
we changed our mind.

447
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,608
We decided that this would work better

448
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,891
if it were a free to play game

449
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:45,315
and separated it out from Save the World,

450
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:47,077
even though it's just still one client.

451
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:49,439
You could just go directly in to play Battle Royale

452
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,781
and you wouldn't need to go through

453
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:55,747
the Save the World purchase gate in order to play it.

454
00:27:56,552 --> 00:28:00,395
So if any of you are from a deal very much with first party

455
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,436
or console manufacturers,

456
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,659
you can imagine how difficult this was

457
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,740
in two weeks time to get through it.

458
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,623
The marketing staff at Epic probably worked

459
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:13,764
about 14 days straight, no weekends, no anything,

460
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:15,626
trying to make the transition points

461
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:18,928
and pivot into our ability to launch it as a separate game.

462
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,430
And ultimately we did.

463
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,928
That's another example of where I think we obviously have a little bit of an edge.

464
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:29,231
We are still a very nimble developer by mindset.

465
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,755
I think I doubt any major publisher really could have pulled off this kind of pivot in

466
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:35,958
the kind of time that we ended up doing it.

467
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:43,210
But there are a few interesting, I said the most interesting thing from marketing as far as I was concerned had more to do with Save the World,

468
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:50,874
but there are a few interesting things with BR and I want to show you a sequence of videos that gives you a flavor for

469
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:56,097
how we've evolved and how we think about Battle Royale over time.

470
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,498
So first we're going to take a quick look at the launch trailer.

471
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:21,435
And as you can see back then we're also still talking about the Save the World SKU.

472
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:29,041
What I want you to think about when you look at that video is it's a pretty action-packed

473
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:29,442
video.

474
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:38,148
It really has a feeling like it's geared towards players who may be more competitively oriented.

475
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,611
And originally, that's what we thought we needed.

476
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:43,073
We saw the landscape out there and we said,

477
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,655
OK, well, we need to be more hardcore.

478
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:49,657
About three weeks into the game,

479
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:51,658
we had started to get some traction.

480
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,619
It was going well.

481
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,821
We held a company meeting at Epic.

482
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:56,482
And as part of the company meeting,

483
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:58,083
we just put together a video

484
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,644
to help support the company meeting.

485
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:01,805
And that video,

486
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:04,087
which is showing influencers playing the game,

487
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:05,307
worked really well.

488
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,856
and was received so well we decided,

489
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:09,957
you know what, we're gonna use it when we announce our,

490
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:11,858
we hit a 20 million user mark,

491
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:13,859
and that was in the beginning of November.

492
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,940
But to me, this was the turning point actually

493
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,261
for how we started thinking about what was the tonality,

494
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:23,722
what was, this is where we really started to find our voice

495
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:25,282
for the Battle Royale brand.

496
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:27,943
So I'm gonna show you the 20 million video,

497
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:30,004
but remember it actually was created

498
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:32,665
about three or four weeks before this video

499
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:35,546
came out to the public as part of a company meeting.

500
00:31:58,552 --> 00:32:16,169
Yeah, so the company meeting version just didn't have all those slates.

501
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,633
It was just the trail of the influencers on a reel.

502
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,883
So when I say turning point, this video is different.

503
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:30,025
It has this feeling, sense of just the sheer joy.

504
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:33,209
There's almost this sort of playful aspect

505
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,352
to what was going on and how much fun people

506
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,415
were having with the game as opposed to being

507
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,817
more focused on the sort of core

508
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:41,639
and the competitive side on it.

509
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,223
Immediately after this one we started to pivot and started to change the way we were thinking about it.

510
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:51,426
And we came out with a new video for

511
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,509
something called the bush in the game, this is something you hide inside of.

512
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,852
It's consumable, you pick up, you hide yourself as a bush.

513
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:03,575
So it started to shift the way we presented

514
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,978
the game to the players. So let's take a peek at that.

515
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:23,785
OK, really short, quick, it's because it's for one of these updates that we do.

516
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:28,249
We made that video, but you can tell it's starting to become different than the earlier

517
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,251
videos from before when we were more serious about it.

518
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:35,754
And so for the full evolution of feeling what the progression was like, let's look at what

519
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:37,216
the most recent video is like.

520
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:38,837
This is for C4.

521
00:33:57,857 --> 00:34:09,943
So that pretty much sums up where the brand sort of evolved to as far as the way we were talking about it and presenting it to players and you know largely driven by the way that they were reacting to the game itself.

522
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:17,306
I have a couple more VR videos that I think are interesting.

523
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,070
The next one is 50 v 50.

524
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,698
What's interesting about this is that we launched it

525
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,061
at the VGA Awards.

526
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:26,686
I don't want to say launched it literally.

527
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:31,449
When Donald Muster went up on stage to talk at the VGA Awards,

528
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,051
the moment he went on stage, we threw a switch.

529
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:37,593
And this mode, he demoed the video you're about to see.

530
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:39,514
And the mode went live at the time,

531
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,875
because we have a little bit of a flair for the dramatic.

532
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:45,177
And the mode just was incredibly popular.

533
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:45,758
It did really well.

534
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,627
It's going down.

535
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:57,260
I should mention that if you're not familiar with the battle royale, typically it's played

536
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,601
100 players going down to either one single person or single squad.

537
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:07,282
This particular mode allowed the 100 players to be split into 2 groups.

538
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:08,383
50 v 50.

539
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:13,624
And the battle was whichever was the last man standing on one side of the 50.

540
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:19,945
And of course we've recently come out on mobile.

541
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,038
Sorry if you guys haven't been following that.

542
00:36:22,538 --> 00:36:25,219
So here's the trailer we've been using for a mobile.

543
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,421
In this case, we were, it's funny,

544
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,862
the engine is so good at rendering,

545
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:34,865
and the mobile version looked really good on screen.

546
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:36,226
We had to be really careful that people,

547
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,367
when we were visually showing what was happening,

548
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:40,689
understood it was actually on a phone,

549
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:44,771
and they weren't just seeing yet another Fortnite video.

550
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:46,072
Oh, here we go.

551
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:26,829
By the way, if any of you are curious, we are doing this as an invite event on iOS only

552
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:31,852
because it's mainly about us wanting to throttle our CCO.

553
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:36,235
We're so popular, we're very careful about how many people inside the game so we don't

554
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,276
overstress the servers.

555
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:44,961
All right, let's talk back to this timeline and what I consider actually the real purpose

556
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,782
of today's talk.

557
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:52,769
So if you look at this, you start to think about, well, why?

558
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:57,472
Why would we scale this down to such a short time frame,

559
00:37:57,552 --> 00:38:00,273
concentrate that marketing to happen in a very narrow window

560
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,835
versus other companies which will do it over a much,

561
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:05,057
much longer period of time?

562
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,898
And I'm not saying they're wrong.

563
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,099
It clearly works.

564
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,781
That's how all the big major publishers launch their games,

565
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,702
and they are clearly successful.

566
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:17,104
For us at Epic, though.

567
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,932
We're sort of an engineering driven culture,

568
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:26,454
and a lot of this comes down to just the basic logic

569
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,775
behind what's going on, and the basic theories

570
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:30,056
and principles being applied.

571
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:32,056
That's why I'm saying that for a lot of you indie developers,

572
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:33,537
if you think about a lot of the principles,

573
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:35,418
that's what you really ought to be thinking about

574
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,618
when you're trying to do marketing.

575
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,979
And you see those basics I have down there,

576
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,161
is just gain awareness, communicate key benefits,

577
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:43,221
have some call to action.

578
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,503
It's really all it ultimately boils down to.

579
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,904
It's not about time, it's not about scale,

580
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:51,305
it's not about how big your marketing programs are.

581
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:54,327
Yeah, a lot of you can't pull off, even we pulled off.

582
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,389
But as long as you're focusing on those elements,

583
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:01,391
you can do similar kinds of things tailored to yourself.

584
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:03,772
Now, for those long periods of time

585
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:05,813
that major publishers do it,

586
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:07,414
and I think they'll continue to do it,

587
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:15,790
A lot of it is driven by the fact, in my mind, that historically retail has been such a huge portion of their programs.

588
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:24,757
And it became a way for them to get a lot of retailer excitement and interest in the game in advance.

589
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:30,702
They could start planning their retail merchandising programs, they could have big orders for selling at launch,

590
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:34,346
they could have big signage, they could have lots of SKUs on the shelves when they launched.

591
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:39,719
But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn't really mean anything to know

592
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,822
something 12 or 18 months out in advance.

593
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:46,649
Do you think our cinematic came in three weeks before was any less effective

594
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,114
than somebody who saw a cinematic 12 or 18 months before?

595
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:56,162
because we weren't really retail focused other than the gearbox element of it,

596
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:58,585
and we're more digitally oriented in our sales,

597
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,890
it wasn't relevant to us about driving a lot of retailer interest.

598
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,892
So a lot of things that other companies would take into account,

599
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,015
we didn't, chose not to take into account,

600
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:10,439
because we thought from a user standpoint that really wasn't...

601
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:16,441
meaningful and we wanted to be as impactful with the resources we had in terms of the launch.

602
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:20,851
So that's part of the why we concentrated it down so tightly.

603
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,491
So you can see we had a lot of the same ingredients

604
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,432
that big publishers use.

605
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:30,615
We just baked it in kind of a different way,

606
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,116
tailored to our needs.

607
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:34,798
And in my mind, that's part of what

608
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:37,220
I would hope you guys look at when you're

609
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,221
thinking about your launches.

610
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,043
That if you can just bake it down

611
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:43,045
in a way that's really specifically designed

612
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,686
for what you're trying to accomplish.

613
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:48,728
you're going to have a lot more ability to have success within your world.

614
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,770
You don't have to have a huge, huge, huge boost like we did,

615
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,872
but you can still be successful if you just stick to these really core principles

616
00:40:56,292 --> 00:41:00,735
and not be as obsessed with some of the templates or the recipes that,

617
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:05,377
that a lot of the other companies follow. All right. Well,

618
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,538
we're question and answer period. But before we do that,

619
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,820
I got a one other call out. Kylie, can you stand up?

620
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:12,548
This is Kylie.

621
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,429
Now, I just walked through a marketing presentation

622
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:17,469
for how we think about things at Epic.

623
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,030
If any of you out there are in marketing

624
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,011
or know folks in marketing that think

625
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,711
they might like this kind of approach, we are hiring.

626
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:27,752
So please reach out to Kylie after the presentation

627
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,913
and we'd be happy to entertain any application you have.

628
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:33,814
All right, who's got a question?

629
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:48,354
Hi, I'm a big fan of the Save the World game.

630
00:41:48,454 --> 00:41:52,398
I thought the Twitch integration you guys did for Save the World was really interesting.

631
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:55,862
Just wondering if you could kind of talk more about that, what your goals for that were?

632
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:57,163
Do you feel like it was effective?

633
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,026
Yeah, for the Twitch integration?

634
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:03,486
Yeah, prior to that we hadn't done as much with Twitch.

635
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:07,811
We had been focusing primarily on YouTubers.

636
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:15,221
And, you know, frankly our videos on YouTube are astronomically high these days in particular.

637
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:17,544
But with Twitch...

638
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,072
It was... And if you guys have followed our own...

639
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,514
You know, like the... Even for Battle Royale,

640
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,956
we only broke into the top 10 in the last...

641
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,839
four months, or three or four months with any regularity.

642
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,181
We didn't start off that high, it just sort of built over time.

643
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:36,085
But for Twitch, it was really a way for us...

644
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:39,989
It was a neat trick, in a sense, being able to pull it off.

645
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,732
But for us, it was really more about building

646
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:45,034
that relationship with the streamers

647
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:46,636
and having something fun for them to do

648
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,458
and to work with them.

649
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:51,341
And that sort of partnership we try to have

650
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:55,064
with the influencers is a big component

651
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:56,486
of what we're trying to pull off.

652
00:42:57,026 --> 00:43:00,167
It was a little bit gimmicky to actually to what we did.

653
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:01,207
So will we do it again?

654
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:03,788
Sure, if we would do it again as long as, you know,

655
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:05,949
the influencers wanted to get behind it and do it

656
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:08,570
and work with us on it, so we'd be happy to.

657
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,671
But this is sort of an example of where we consider this

658
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:12,631
more of a partnership.

659
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,872
And frankly, if it hadn't gotten a lot,

660
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:16,292
much traction from the influencers,

661
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:18,893
they don't want to, aren't as eager to participate,

662
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:20,373
of course we could pay for it,

663
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:21,634
we could buy for it if we wanted to.

664
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:23,394
We probably wouldn't have done it.

665
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:30,655
I was always curious if the monetization system in Fortnite was mainly created so that you

666
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:35,959
could market a soft launch in the Western audiences by having a paid-for game and then

667
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,840
going free-to-play for the Asian markets.

668
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,581
Was that a consideration at all in any of this?

669
00:43:40,802 --> 00:43:41,603
No, not at all.

670
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:47,287
We are, by the way, should I be repeating these questions or is it okay?

671
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:50,370
It's okay?

672
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:53,782
Did they say to repeat them or not?

673
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:54,542
Yeah, repeat them.

674
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:54,862
All right.

675
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,163
Let me repeat it as best I can.

676
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,624
You tell me if I'm saying it wrong.

677
00:43:57,944 --> 00:43:59,905
You're asking about the monetization system

678
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:03,167
and whether we were strategically

679
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:06,129
thinking long term about the Asian implications of us

680
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:06,910
doing it this way.

681
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,691
Well, first off, some of you may know that we are,

682
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,093
Tencent is a large equity owner, has a large equity

683
00:44:13,113 --> 00:44:14,254
stake within Epic.

684
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:15,995
We consult with them regularly.

685
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:18,556
They're well aware of everything we're doing.

686
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:22,279
They give us plenty of advice.

687
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:23,300
We don't always take it.

688
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,082
But there's a lot of close collaboration with it.

689
00:44:27,823 --> 00:44:28,904
I can unequivocally say no.

690
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:33,427
We were not considering the Asian implications

691
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:36,109
of anything we were doing as far as the monetization system

692
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:37,690
was going at the time.

693
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,212
When we do get to the point that we're extrapolating...

694
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,535
going free to play and making a bigger push into Asia.

695
00:44:44,577 --> 00:44:48,401
We may have a separate approach for what happens in Asia.

696
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:52,166
Unlike Battle Royale, we might have unique clients around it,

697
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,348
but it wasn't part of our thinking at all.

698
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:55,209
Thank you.

699
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:04,953
Hello. So an important part for the strategy for Fortnite is to pay a lot of attention about the trailers.

700
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:11,916
If you have to share a little bit more details for us, when we should produce the trailer,

701
00:45:11,996 --> 00:45:17,738
what kind of important points we have to pay attention to when we did the trailer?

702
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:19,599
What's the major point?

703
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,259
Okay.

704
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:24,271
Yeah, the question is about for the trailers we did,

705
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:28,553
about what we considered important for building it in,

706
00:45:28,613 --> 00:45:30,054
and was there a question about timing too?

707
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:30,794
I wasn't certain.

708
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,715
Yeah, it's right.

709
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:33,976
Okay, so help me.

710
00:45:34,036 --> 00:45:36,937
I showed you a lot of different trailers, quote-unquote.

711
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:38,358
For the launching, for example.

712
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:39,418
Go on, okay.

713
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:43,880
So, the two trailers, one was the cinematic

714
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,601
and one was the gameplay trailer, right?

715
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:52,268
Again, we did this, so we started seven weeks in advance for the gameplay and then three weeks for the cinematic.

716
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,274
Having gone through this experience once...

717
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,832
If we got, tried to do this again,

718
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:00,413
I might try to do it over four weeks.

719
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:03,796
I don't know if even seven weeks we needed necessarily.

720
00:46:03,816 --> 00:46:06,738
It's really about trying to build as much of a bang

721
00:46:06,778 --> 00:46:09,099
as you can in a short amount of time

722
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:11,301
while it's still top of mind to the people.

723
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,482
So that's about the awareness part, right?

724
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:17,045
So it's the awareness, it's communicate a key benefit,

725
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:19,306
and then this call to action.

726
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:21,868
I think that with,

727
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:25,389
It depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

728
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:28,011
You remember when we did that long form gameplay trailer?

729
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:31,493
We had specifically, we were trying to convey depth.

730
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:33,714
There were a lot of what was happening in the game,

731
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,076
and also that explaining some of the complexity of the game.

732
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:39,818
So we went out of our way to go deeper into it,

733
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:42,439
knowing that we could have made that more brief,

734
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:45,060
we could have made it tighter, we could have made it sexier, more entertaining,

735
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,402
but it really wasn't the point of that particular trailer.

736
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:49,863
And we did cut one that was 30 to do that part of it.

737
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:58,192
The cinematic trailer was solving it for a completely different issue.

738
00:46:58,573 --> 00:47:02,559
The cinematic trailer was, yes, it's telling narrative and telling some of the backstory,

739
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,906
which we felt was important, particularly what was essentially an RPG, but it was also a...

740
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:11,988
clear feeling of quality.

741
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:14,049
There's something about that trailer that just says,

742
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:15,129
oh this is a quality game.

743
00:47:15,189 --> 00:47:17,210
This is a very well crafted,

744
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,530
a lot of thoughts gone into this.

745
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,751
And look how much care and effort

746
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:24,471
they put into this trailer and that halo effect

747
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,352
would probably spill over to what we were doing

748
00:47:27,552 --> 00:47:28,272
with the product.

749
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:32,753
So I can't give you a specific answer to your situation

750
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:33,633
other than to say,

751
00:47:34,033 --> 00:47:36,394
just try to think of a tiny handful of things

752
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:37,874
that you think are really important

753
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:38,915
that someone needs to know.

754
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:43,936
and sort of boil it down into whatever you put in that trailer.

755
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:49,258
I can't tell you how many times that I've seen trailers from other companies or indies that come out

756
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:52,999
that to me are, they're overdone, they're trying to do too much.

757
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,820
Just pick a few simple things and make them important and big

758
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:59,801
because people just can't remember if you do a lot of stuff inside them.

759
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:02,962
So just stay simple, that's the other advice I would give.

760
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:03,943
Thank you.

761
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:05,803
Okay, sure.

762
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,882
Hey Ed, thanks a lot for sharing the insights.

763
00:48:09,122 --> 00:48:11,383
My name is Gene, I'm with Starladder.

764
00:48:11,603 --> 00:48:14,324
Well, I'm a little bit skewed since I see the world

765
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,205
and gaming through competition mainly,

766
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:18,046
but that's the question.

767
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:20,527
For me, it's a no brainer that in the marketing campaign

768
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:21,627
for this particular game,

769
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,226
there should have been some kind of an element of competitive play.

770
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:27,929
Hey, you've got a team, compete, there is a ladder.

771
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:32,372
There's all sorts of different things, you know, play one team versus another team.

772
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:34,654
And I'm just curious why you didn't use that thing,

773
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,617
eSports and competitive play for launching the game.

774
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:44,322
And is there on the books somewhere plans to include that thing in the Fortnite?

775
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:52,677
The question is, why didn't we use eSports as a marketing lever during the launch?

776
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:56,139
Specifically for Battle Royale, obviously Save the World, we couldn't have done that.

777
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:04,283
But for Battle Royale, and then what is the future for the game for eSports?

778
00:49:06,064 --> 00:49:08,645
On the first topic, remember we built this thing in...

779
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:14,293
Two months I would say that it was it took everything we had

780
00:49:14,393 --> 00:49:17,475
just to get a PV period component in.

781
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:22,362
On the topic of eSports, obviously it's very big, it's very topical,

782
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:27,205
but to us that's a major, major undertaking.

783
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:28,926
It requires a great deal of thought.

784
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:33,548
We could never possibly, for where we were at that moment in time,

785
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:37,890
been even a remote consideration for the actual launch.

786
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:41,872
We are doing things with, you know, we do have some custom servers going off.

787
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:45,974
At E3 we are going to effectively have a Pro-Am tournament.

788
00:49:47,335 --> 00:49:49,917
But as far as the future on the eSports stuff,

789
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:55,581
it's something that's under discussion and we're not really ready to talk about it yet.

790
00:49:56,842 --> 00:49:57,102
Okay.

791
00:49:57,222 --> 00:49:57,482
Thanks.

792
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:05,728
So you had a lot of different videos and you had some for really small events like just releasing the C4 and stuff like that.

793
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:09,008
I'm wondering if there's any consideration for over saturation of videos

794
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:13,409
or is it just like as many as you can crank out that makes sense?

795
00:50:13,629 --> 00:50:15,430
Yeah, that's a great question.

796
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:21,231
I mean you could ask a similar question about basically our content cadence because the videos are tied to the content.

797
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:24,551
The more recent ones, like the C4 are coming soon.

798
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:27,992
Whenever something new is coming into the game we make a video.

799
00:50:28,032 --> 00:50:28,992
Now, they're relatively short.

800
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:31,254
So they don't take a lot up from that.

801
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:35,979
But I think the audience has begun to expect them and assume that there will be something.

802
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,445
It helps us shape the personality of the game somewhat by doing them.

803
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,328
Just actually putting something C4 inside of the game, that's...

804
00:50:44,748 --> 00:50:47,351
If you think about it, that's such a dry idea.

805
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:49,473
It's just an explosive piece, so there's nothing really...

806
00:50:50,635 --> 00:50:53,078
inherently entertaining about that.

807
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:56,123
So we build an entertaining little vignette around it

808
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:57,826
to just help with some of the more

809
00:50:58,527 --> 00:50:59,608
the branding and personality.

810
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:01,551
You could find C4 in a lot of different games,

811
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,175
but I don't know if it would jump out at you the way

812
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:05,998
that we could really do it without one.

813
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:09,401
Again, as far as the Cadence goes, they're pretty short.

814
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,143
If they were really long, I think you'd be right,

815
00:51:11,283 --> 00:51:15,407
but these are pretty short and meant to live for that week

816
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,528
that that new item's out.

817
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,851
I think that they don't have a long shelf life.

818
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,332
I don't think that weeks later,

819
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,254
and it really runs back, and we'll go back

820
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:25,916
and look at our bush video at the time.

821
00:51:26,637 --> 00:51:33,161
So the nature of Epic is such that we can make videos pretty quickly,

822
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:37,344
like the C4 or the Bush video, things like that,

823
00:51:37,645 --> 00:51:40,987
we can do in less than two weeks with our video team.

824
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,849
So it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part,

825
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,271
but we think we're pretty good at it,

826
00:51:46,631 --> 00:51:50,234
so we just like to sort of exploit it since we consider it a competitive strength.

827
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,813
Hi, I'm Shiloh from China, from a game company.

828
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:06,397
Usually the marketing department always focuses on the...

829
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:10,379
They know the newest trend and information from the marketing.

830
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,021
And R&D department always focuses on the game.

831
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:19,525
So, which department first decided to change the gameplay of Fortnite?

832
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:24,557
The question is how basically,

833
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:27,079
where inside the company,

834
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,922
I'm guessing you're talking about Battle Royale.

835
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:30,462
Why you put it in.

836
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:32,804
Where inside the company the ideas for,

837
00:52:32,905 --> 00:52:37,529
that led to us doing the PvP Battle Royale mode came from?

838
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,492
There's a third area in our company

839
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:42,813
beside the two you mentioned.

840
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:45,355
You're effectively in a Western parlance

841
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,757
would have been describing marketing,

842
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:48,078
publishing and development.

843
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:52,388
product development and an epic and that's a strategy team.

844
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:55,889
And so there are people that focus more on strategic issues

845
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,750
and they do spend a lot of time looking at trends

846
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:03,312
and a whole variety of factors that are considering.

847
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:08,295
The actual germ of the idea really came more from the strategy side.

848
00:53:08,455 --> 00:53:12,138
But it was just immediately adopted by everyone.

849
00:53:12,178 --> 00:53:16,721
We really badly wanted to have a PvP version inside of the game.

850
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:23,886
So it didn't take a lot of discussion for senior management to decide,

851
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:27,028
it's like, okay great, no brainer, you got a PvE game, you're a multiplayer,

852
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:29,170
let's go make a PvP component to it.

853
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:35,938
So everyone in your company just decided to change to PvP mode, right?

854
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:37,920
Well, change, add. We didn't change.

855
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,302
Oh, you mean add, yes.

856
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:40,644
We added it to the game, yes.

857
00:53:41,244 --> 00:53:41,805
All right, thanks.

858
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:44,588
Hi, can I help you?

859
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:47,392
Hi, so my question is about...

860
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,661
how did you guys picture who your players were

861
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:55,822
back when you first started developing the game?

862
00:53:56,542 --> 00:54:00,143
And then, who do you sort of see them as now,

863
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,423
and how did you go through that transition

864
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:04,804
of understanding your players, your player base,

865
00:54:06,024 --> 00:54:08,685
from the beginning and who they are now?

866
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:11,105
And then also, is that different

867
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,046
for Save the World versus Battle Royale?

868
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:25,613
That's a great question. The question is about how we were gauging the essentially the characteristics or demographics of the user base for what was.

869
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:31,439
Save the world until we decided to launch the battle royale mode and then became battle royale as well.

870
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:41,956
We have a, basically we were doing a series of closed beta

871
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:46,000
slash closed alpha tests leading up to the launch.

872
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:51,044
And we were periodically either having focus groups

873
00:54:51,144 --> 00:54:52,305
or sending out questionnaires and

874
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:58,588
And querying the user base basically about what they liked and what they didn't like.

875
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:02,331
And we had a series of these over time that happened.

876
00:55:02,351 --> 00:55:06,474
So we got a very strong sense over time of how the game was evolving.

877
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:10,077
How the player base was adjusting to how we were evolving the game.

878
00:55:11,038 --> 00:55:16,243
And it really was just a lot of time spent talking to them as we went through that.

879
00:55:16,323 --> 00:55:22,408
When we know that, you know, we have a kind of a fanciful kind of cartoony look that's kind of fun,

880
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:26,032
but at the same time the game is kind of serious in terms of gameplay.

881
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:31,437
It's got a lot of very, very deep systems inside of it that harken back to, you know, just big, big RPGs.

882
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:36,741
So we knew that we were appealing to a blend of people who wanted RPGs,

883
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:39,002
as well as people who wanted something sort of mass-market,

884
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:41,765
you know, pick up and play to some degree.

885
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,867
And, you know, I mentioned that we're still early access.

886
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:46,208
We still don't consider it finished.

887
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:50,171
We still think we've got a lot of work to do on the game to get it to the proper state.

888
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:52,052
So that's evolving all the time.

889
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:57,997
Battle Royale as a free separate mode, I mean, it's obviously exploded and become huge.

890
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:04,211
Yeah, we have a certain percentage that will play Save the World and we're happy with that,

891
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:07,196
but a large percentage of them will probably never play Save the World,

892
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,599
because it's just not the kind of game they like to play.

893
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:14,366
They're really into playing competitive shooters and that's all they want to do, which is fine.

894
00:56:14,686 --> 00:56:15,327
It's fine for them.

895
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:25,158
So for them, they do have a very different demographic characteristic as far as how they interact and how we think about them as well.

896
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,264
Right now they're so lopsided in terms of their size and it's so big that it's sort of dominant.

897
00:56:30,284 --> 00:56:32,526
It's interesting, I didn't really talk about it.

898
00:56:33,412 --> 00:56:36,273
too much in my presentation, but if you think about it,

899
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:40,814
we are in a very interesting branding position

900
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:43,415
because we have this, what is called Save the World.

901
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:45,656
And by the way, we didn't call it Save the World

902
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:47,116
until Battle Royale came out.

903
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:49,897
Until Battle Royale came out, it was just Fortnite.

904
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:52,958
There was no notion, the word Save the World didn't exist,

905
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:55,399
but we had to create it because of Battle Royale came out

906
00:56:55,739 --> 00:56:57,540
so we could distinguish between the two.

907
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:05,426
So and we got to do some branding you know tidying up about the brand hierarchy because it's a little bit a walk because of

908
00:57:05,446 --> 00:57:07,087
coming out with that rail.

909
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:14,749
But we effectively treat them as all part of this sort of fortnight family with with some adjustments for whether it's

910
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:18,530
dealing with the P.V.E. save the world or whether it's dealing with the battery.

911
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:21,651
I'm not certain I answer your questions as close as I can get to it.

912
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,421
I think there's one additional element there that I was more curious about, which is

913
00:57:26,961 --> 00:57:30,803
what is that type of person who is interested in battle royale?

914
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:34,924
Is that the kind of person who's sitting down and playing 40 hours a week,

915
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:40,226
who's like, I want to be the best and be the most competitive type player?

916
00:57:40,246 --> 00:57:42,006
I get what you're saying.

917
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:44,607
No, first of all, you can't get to the size we're at

918
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:47,608
if you're just too tightly focused as you describe.

919
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:49,309
We are kind of...

920
00:57:50,263 --> 00:57:52,044
pop culture and mainstream at this point.

921
00:57:52,144 --> 00:57:54,285
We know that we have a broad range of people playing

922
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:56,626
in terms of ages and also in terms of sexes.

923
00:57:56,646 --> 00:57:59,967
There's lots of women that play Battle Royale.

924
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:04,909
So I'd say, it's funny, as a marketer,

925
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:08,010
I love to actually drill down to very specific demographics,

926
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,751
but it's pretty broad, it's pretty wide.

927
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,231
We are just so large, we have to,

928
00:58:11,772 --> 00:58:13,732
it can only be explained by something that sort of

929
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:15,913
transcends a lot of what you're describing

930
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,194
as far as those segmentations.

931
00:58:18,908 --> 00:58:19,573
Alright. Thank you.

932
00:58:19,593 --> 00:58:20,016
Alright.

933
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:21,487
You're up.

934
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:28,466
It seems like there's an opportunity to leverage Battle Royale to get more players into Save

935
00:58:28,486 --> 00:58:28,786
the World.

936
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:32,768
So for example, in Save the World you have three different tiers that you can purchase.

937
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:38,932
And the $150 tier has this really badass ninja that I can't use in Battle Royale.

938
00:58:39,492 --> 00:58:44,936
And it seems like maybe to get people more embedded in the Save the World game you could

939
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:50,339
offer quests or things that you can unlock in Battle Royale for playing a certain amount

940
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:50,419
of...

941
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:51,260
I don't know.

942
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:53,396
save the world gameplay.

943
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,857
Right, right.

944
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:57,339
The question is about whether or not we will be

945
00:58:57,819 --> 00:59:06,407
or should be doing more cross mode itemization or mechanics

946
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:09,009
or reasons for going back and forth between the two.

947
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:09,849
And we do do a little bit.

948
00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:12,492
Some of the skins exist in both of them.

949
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:15,955
It's something we talk about periodically.

950
00:59:15,995 --> 00:59:18,176
And I'm happy to bring it up again, by the way,

951
00:59:18,216 --> 00:59:19,357
with the dev team.

952
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:26,370
The specific one you refer to is what's inside the high impact.

953
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,371
I don't think we've talked about that one quite some time, so we probably would.

954
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:33,772
We don't have a fundamental philosophy on this at this time.

955
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:39,253
We do worry a little bit about the confusion that happens between the two.

956
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:43,735
And sometimes when we have done things that they cross between the two, we've gotten feedback

957
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:47,676
that people got confused about what that meant or whether it was or wasn't.

958
00:59:48,196 --> 00:59:51,397
So it's something I don't have a good answer for you because we haven't.

959
00:59:51,497 --> 00:59:53,498
decided what a good answer is on that one.

960
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,864
And I was curious about, so last year I remember reading a story about Bluehole commenting

961
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:07,688
on your Battle Royale event, or game mode rather, launching, and I was curious if you

962
01:00:07,728 --> 01:00:11,710
saw a huge increase of player numbers due to the free publicity?

963
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:18,642
I don't know if I should comment on that one directly,

964
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:23,104
but I think you guys are welcome to go pull up

965
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,724
something called Google Trends if you want to,

966
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:30,126
and go look and plug in a few key terms

967
01:00:30,787 --> 01:00:33,087
around the time of what you describe,

968
01:00:33,147 --> 01:00:34,548
and you can draw your own conclusions.

969
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:36,209
Fair enough, thanks.

970
01:00:38,049 --> 01:00:38,770
Any more questions?

971
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,230
All right, we're running out of time,

972
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,031
so thank you very much.

973
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,611
Again, remember to come talk to Kylie

974
01:00:42,911 --> 01:00:45,092
if you'd like to talk with us about marketing.
