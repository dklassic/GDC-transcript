1
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:10,430
My name is Erica Pinto, and I am the lead narrative animator at Santa Monica Studio.

2
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:16,835
Just a heads up, this is going to be an interactive session, so for those of you watching online,

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,278
I recommend you get a partner or a group together to get the most out of this session.

4
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:24,042
If you're really not feeling very social right now, you can feel free to write down your

5
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:28,225
responses during our audience's activities, but I do hope that you guys will participate.

6
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:32,890
Also, be forewarned, there are some light God of War spoilers during this talk.

7
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,239
As I mentioned, I am a lead artist.

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,102
God of War was actually my first project

9
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:41,443
leading a team of animators.

10
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,124
So how did I get there?

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,627
Well, I got my start in the game industry

12
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:49,010
fresh out of school at the UCLA Animation Workshop.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,811
Go, Ruins!

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,774
And I got an internship at Electronic Arts Los Angeles

15
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,496
on the Medal of Honor franchise.

16
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,359
Bobby Coddington, who is now Animation Director

17
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,340
at Insomniac, was my mentor at the time.

18
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,824
And he taught me a lot about how to become a good game animator,

19
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:05,685
such as how to make a good run cycle,

20
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:07,506
how to work with start and end poses

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,808
and get them all to match up, all that fun stuff.

22
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,469
But Bobby was also my first example

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,170
of what it means to be a good lead,

24
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,072
about staying positive under stressful conditions,

25
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,514
about being very passionate about your art,

26
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,555
but also being passionate about helping others succeed.

27
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:26,738
With each successive project, I learned valuable lessons

28
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:30,140
from all of my leads, what to do, sometimes what not to do.

29
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,620
So when my last lead left to pursue a personal project,

30
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,602
my managers came up to me and asked

31
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:38,203
if I wanted to jump in and take the reins.

32
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,226
I wasn't quite sure I was ready to be a lead,

33
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:42,687
but I did want to help people,

34
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,868
and I wanted to help our production run smoothly,

35
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,789
so I said yes.

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,052
I quickly learned that there's a big difference

37
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,653
between watching what other leads do

38
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,055
and actually doing the job yourself.

39
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:55,497
A lot like learning to be a good artist,

40
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:57,838
it takes a lot of practice to be a good lead.

41
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,038
So what are we going to talk about in this session?

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,141
Well, there are dozens of books, there's video series,

43
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,282
there's workshops, there's entire organizations

44
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,883
dedicated to becoming better leaders,

45
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,825
and I have about 45 minutes, give or take,

46
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,446
to cram all of that information into your heads,

47
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,387
so everybody get your pens, and your pencils,

48
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:17,788
and your laptops out, are you guys ready?

49
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,409
Yeah.

50
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:19,930
No, I'm just kidding.

51
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,636
But what I am hoping is that by talking about

52
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,618
my leadership experience on God of War,

53
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:29,000
you all can get a sense of some of those leadership muscles

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,901
that you can start building and flexing

55
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,622
in addition to your artist muscles,

56
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,504
which are probably already pretty swole.

57
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,646
These will be concepts that you can

58
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,448
and should dive deeper into to prepare yourself

59
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,069
for a leadership role if you're interested.

60
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,952
Let's kick it off with a little bit of an icebreaker.

61
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:48,494
What does a lead artist do?

62
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,417
So I'm going to ask you guys to just shout out stuff.

63
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,278
Oh man, I'm sorry, I have all sorts of crappy stuff in there.

64
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,602
I'm going to delete all that.

65
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:02,163
That was from my practice run.

66
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:11,328
Feel free to redo all that stuff if you want to, but go ahead and talk and I will try to

67
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:11,768
put it in.

68
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:12,969
Anybody have a suggestion?

69
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,250
Cry?

70
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,692
I will put that here.

71
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,373
What else? Go ahead and speak up. Not all at once.

72
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:25,774
Inspire. That's a good one.

73
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,376
I heard someone else.

74
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:30,157
Hmm?

75
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,519
Document. Yes, that's very good. Document.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,241
Delegation. That's good as well.

77
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:40,643
Establish an art style.

78
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:44,706
Typos.

79
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:46,307
All right.

80
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:49,798
Have a vision, that's good.

81
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,802
Nurture, nice.

82
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,186
Communicate, very important.

83
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,127
I'll put that there.

84
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,810
Be a good listener, that's good.

85
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,054
Critique.

86
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,319
Challenge.

87
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,445
Be candid.

88
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:28,006
Nice.

89
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,917
Shield your team from stress from above.

90
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:38,997
Yes.

91
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:43,161
Shield your team from stress from above.

92
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,022
Enable excellency.

93
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:44,622
That's a good one.

94
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,673
All right. Any last-minute ones?

95
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,295
Problem-solving. That's good.

96
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,176
Where can I put that?

97
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:55,537
Maybe over here.

98
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,960
Show empathy.

99
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,045
Coordinate with game design.

100
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,409
Promote alignment. That's a good one.

101
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,390
Let's see where I can put that.

102
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:18,287
All right, I'm gonna cut it off.

103
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:20,009
This is a pretty good list we've got going here.

104
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,293
Let me go back to my presenter view.

105
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:26,955
All right, so for myself,

106
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,877
I tend to break down a lead artist's work

107
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,159
into five main concepts here.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,561
Communication, which someone mentioned.

109
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:35,203
Organization.

110
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:37,465
Inspiration.

111
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:39,827
Accountability.

112
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,069
And creativity.

113
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,822
I'm gonna break down these concepts a bit further

114
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:48,084
throughout this presentation, starting with communication.

115
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,145
So for those of you who haven't played God of War,

116
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,005
there is a giant snake in our game,

117
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,406
and you have to learn to talk to it.

118
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,107
And Kratos comes up with a very interesting method

119
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:58,707
of communicating with this snake.

120
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,248
So I thought that was a good example

121
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:03,589
of figuring out how to get your department running smoothly,

122
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,110
collaborating with your team,

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,791
and communicating your needs to other departments.

124
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,231
The first thing I learned as an artist

125
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,032
was how to get out of the groove.

126
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,629
As an artist, it's very easy to shut yourself in the studio,

127
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,811
put your headphones on, keep your head down,

128
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,313
and focus on a task.

129
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,034
This is actually encouraged for artists

130
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:23,116
because often they need to focus for hours at a time

131
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,178
to get really in the groove and get things done.

132
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,261
But as a lead, you have to be aware

133
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,042
of what your team is doing around you.

134
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,025
So it's time to get those headphones off

135
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,407
and figure out if there's any fires happening.

136
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,614
This may come at the expense of your own focus,

137
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:40,715
but it does benefit the needs of others

138
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:43,356
and helps you maintain a big picture of what's going on.

139
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:46,357
You can better guide your team to do their work well,

140
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:49,599
such as demonstrating a combat move for your animators.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,781
The next thing I learned is that leads

142
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,703
often need to get away from their desk and visit people.

143
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,758
There are lots of benefits of being in a studio

144
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,838
versus working remotely.

145
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,780
Communication goes more smoothly

146
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,561
when you can see people's facial expressions,

147
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,643
when you can use gestures to demonstrate what you want.

148
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,065
You can have one-on-one conversations

149
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,546
going back and forth with each other.

150
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,869
And sometimes it's easier to demonstrate at someone's desk

151
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,050
than trying to write up a detailed email

152
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,612
with screenshots and all that stuff.

153
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,833
So just get away from your desk.

154
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,043
Now at Santa Monica Studio, this can be kind of difficult

155
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:25,724
because half of our team is upstairs

156
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,106
and half of our team is way downstairs.

157
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,927
So often people don't want to make the trek

158
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,488
because it's just so far.

159
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:34,369
Why can't we just use Instant Messenger, right?

160
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,890
But it really is worth it to make the trek.

161
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:39,312
You get more communication going

162
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,593
and you get a little bit of exercise

163
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,374
and who doesn't need more steps on their Fitbit, right?

164
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,907
Now if you need to talk to a lot of people,

165
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:49,508
you could run up and down the stairs

166
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,049
going individually to everybody's desk

167
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,190
and hope that they're available and around,

168
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,792
or you could just schedule a meeting with everybody

169
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:56,633
and get them all together.

170
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,576
The benefits of this are that everybody gets to prep

171
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,197
for the subject that you're going to discuss

172
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,458
and be in that mindset to discuss it.

173
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,641
Plus everybody hears the same thing at the same time

174
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,702
so there's less room for misinterpretation.

175
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,766
On God of War, we tried to group our meetings

176
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:13,847
to certain days of the week,

177
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,268
such as Tuesdays and Thursdays.

178
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,189
That way, on the other days of the week,

179
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,590
people could stay in the groove and keep their work done.

180
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,732
Now, we have a bunch of people gathered here,

181
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,873
so I'm going to go ahead and start an audience activity.

182
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,595
I'm going to throw a couple instructions up on the board,

183
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,256
so go ahead and wait until I'm done talking

184
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,977
about all the bullet points until we start talking.

185
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:36,039
It's a pretty easy one, just interview your neighbor.

186
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,840
So turn to someone next to you and ask them their name.

187
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:41,536
Ask them why they came to this panel.

188
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,439
And ask them to talk about someone in their life

189
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,880
who was a good leader.

190
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,723
Take good mental or physical notes

191
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,005
so you are really listening and remembering the responses.

192
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,267
And feel free to exchange business cards

193
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,688
or contact info if you so choose.

194
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,150
That's part of communication as well.

195
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,191
If you're going solo this time around,

196
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,633
feel free to write some notes to yourself

197
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:01,573
about point number three.

198
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:02,935
All right, let's get started.

199
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,676
So what have we learned about communication?

200
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,771
It doesn't have to be scary.

201
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,733
It's as simple as just turning to someone next to you and saying hi.

202
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,996
And if you mess up or stumble a little bit, that's fine.

203
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,817
Messing up is still better than saying nothing.

204
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:18,460
I mean, we're not mind readers and we won't know what you have to say unless you actually

205
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,781
say it.

206
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,222
So don't bottle it up inside you.

207
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,464
Just keep talking to each other.

208
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:26,347
One of the worst things that could happen to a team is that communication breaks down

209
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,970
and people just kind of go into their own corners and work on things without communicating

210
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,410
to each other.

211
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,511
So keep talking.

212
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:36,186
The next concept I'd like to talk about is organization.

213
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,207
This is one of the characters in our game.

214
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,788
He's a shopkeeper, and he loves to keep all his tools

215
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,869
nice and clean and his workshop nice and tidy.

216
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:46,691
And as a lead, a little bit of OCD can go a long way as well

217
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,992
to getting your team to run like a well-oiled machine.

218
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,544
A big part of organization is time management,

219
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:55,525
and a big part of time management is getting good estimates.

220
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,467
Now, every artist is asked how long they need

221
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:59,247
to get their art done.

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,008
That wasn't a new concept for me,

223
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,189
but the shell shock was figuring out

224
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,589
how to gauge the speed of all my other team members.

225
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,151
So, you know, you would go to each of their team members

226
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,271
and be like, well, how much time do you need for this task?

227
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,513
But the problem is, you don't wanna pressure them

228
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,913
to give you better numbers,

229
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,934
to try to get them to do their work done faster.

230
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,715
What you're trying to do is get an accurate sense

231
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:20,215
of how long the.

232
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:24,438
the time is going to take them because that's going to help you plan out a proper schedule

233
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:28,359
and figure out how to mitigate crunch if you can avoid it if possible.

234
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,802
Make sure to plan for unknowns and setbacks because you know stuff's going to go wrong

235
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,782
or stuff's going to need to get changed.

236
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,323
You're going to have to start over for some things.

237
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:43,746
I've heard about 20% buffer can be a good rough estimate just to tack on to every task.

238
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,708
And remember that little stuff takes time too.

239
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,549
A very small task that might be a half hour here,

240
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,391
five minutes there, half a day here,

241
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,153
all that stuff can add up over a long production

242
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,255
such as God of War, which took several years.

243
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,977
So if you're not keeping track of that little stuff

244
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:02,059
and planning for it in your unknowns and your buffers,

245
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,980
then that can come up to bite you later.

246
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,944
Be honest with yourself and with your producers.

247
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,826
If you see that the scope of your work is getting big

248
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:11,927
and too big for your team,

249
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:15,850
start having those hard talks about cutting things.

250
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:17,347
or increasing your head count,

251
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,628
definitely don't fudge the numbers

252
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,629
because you're really only setting up your team

253
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,370
for crunch or for outright failure.

254
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,873
On God of War, we did a pretty good job

255
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,574
of keeping track of our 100 plus cinematics.

256
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:33,635
And we kept track of all the progress in Shotgun.

257
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,797
We broke down each of the production phases here

258
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,778
and we were able to tag when things were being worked on.

259
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,780
What we didn't do such a good job of

260
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,861
was estimating how much time

261
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,361
each of those tasks was going to take.

262
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,297
or how much time it actually took when it was finished.

263
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:51,179
Yeah.

264
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,904
Where we really failed was in keeping track

265
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:55,925
of all those little things.

266
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,887
We had a lot of small animations

267
00:11:57,907 --> 00:12:00,190
which we called points of interest, or POIs,

268
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,413
which were not big, full cinematics.

269
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:03,815
It might have been just a small thing

270
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,098
like Freya constructing a magical bridge right here.

271
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:10,473
But add everything up together, and it became way bigger,

272
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,255
and it just went way out of scope,

273
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,396
and we ended up having to cut all of these.

274
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,998
You can see we just didn't do them,

275
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,078
and that was pretty sad.

276
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:24,424
So, we really want to collect data with those estimates.

277
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,786
There's different kinds of tracking software you can use.

278
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:28,767
We use Shotgun.

279
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,393
You can use Jira, you can use Handsoft,

280
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,174
whatever option works best for your team.

281
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,196
But the trick is just getting everybody to pitch in

282
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,937
and give their estimates and give their actual time spent.

283
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,499
Because real data is going to lead

284
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,960
to better estimates down the line.

285
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,861
And that's gonna help you with your scope planning.

286
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,803
This can usually be like a producer's work,

287
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,984
but as a lead, you can set a good example

288
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,925
and send reminders to your team, put in your own estimates,

289
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,566
just make sure everybody's doing it.

290
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:58,885
And it doesn't have to be every five minutes

291
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,906
or down to the minute.

292
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,948
It can be kind of rough, like in hours,

293
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,048
but it really does help.

294
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,752
As I mentioned, we weren't great on God of War

295
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,013
about collecting that data,

296
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,454
so after the project was over,

297
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:10,995
we went into Perforce,

298
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:13,677
and we started looking at our Perforce history,

299
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,279
just seeing when the dates were,

300
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,460
when a file was checked in,

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,281
seeing the notes of what people did

302
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,063
when they did a certain scene,

303
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,965
and we kind of took a sample set and tried to.

304
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,807
take our best educated guess based on the revision history notes for how long it might

305
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:28,728
have taken to do this.

306
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:33,390
It wasn't super accurate, but it was still a better baseline than doing nothing.

307
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,092
And now we have some rough estimates for planning out our next project.

308
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,413
Beware of burnout.

309
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,455
You know, it's one thing when you're only responsible for yourself and your own personal

310
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:49,097
well-being and your health, but it's another thing when you have a team relying on you

311
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,438
to establish a reasonable schedule and scope.

312
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,376
So really keep an eye on the health and morale of your team.

313
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,817
We had a pair of talented animators

314
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:59,498
who kept staying up till one in the morning in the office,

315
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,239
despite me telling them to go home.

316
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,859
Well, whose fault was it?

317
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,040
Were they just perfectionists, staying late,

318
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,621
noodling on everything with all their passion?

319
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,682
Or was it maybe that because they were so fast,

320
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,443
I piled on too many tasks on them?

321
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,944
Maybe if I'd had a better sense of the scope,

322
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:16,005
we could have talked about cutting down their work a bit,

323
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:17,846
or maybe hiring more people

324
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,687
so that they could go home at a reasonable hour.

325
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,414
The next thing in organization that helped me

326
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,675
was just keeping tidy.

327
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,797
And this was something I never thought about

328
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,758
when I was in film school,

329
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,479
learning how to use spreadsheets.

330
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:32,160
Woo!

331
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,241
But when you're a lead,

332
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,223
learning some office software can really help you

333
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,705
with asset lists, estimates, order forms,

334
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,706
all that fun stuff.

335
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,488
So take some time to learn something like Excel

336
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,990
or Google Sheets, or whatever's gonna work best for you.

337
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,192
A bonus is, as an artist, you can make them look pretty.

338
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:49,433
That's fun.

339
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,969
Documentation, super important.

340
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,292
Take time to write down your team's best practices,

341
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:02,475
your workflows, your tutorials, et cetera.

342
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,779
This will, one, make it easier for new hires

343
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:06,639
to hit the ground running,

344
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,663
and also serve as a handy reference during crunch.

345
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:12,565
When we were in the midst of production,

346
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,287
the animators had something they called

347
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,949
the buttery smooth checklist.

348
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,380
Because we didn't have any cuts in God of War,

349
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,401
we had to make sure that every animation

350
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:23,324
traveled smoothly from gameplay into a cinematic

351
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:23,904
and back out.

352
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,285
And everything on this checklist,

353
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:26,066
I mean, you don't have to read it,

354
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:27,868
but it actually helped the animators

355
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,169
before they exported anything

356
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:31,210
to make sure that when they exported it

357
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,171
and put it in the game engine,

358
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:33,652
there was the least amount of pops

359
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,853
and troubleshooting we had to do.

360
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,976
This was very crucial to the success of our no-cut camera.

361
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,472
All right, let's try a little organizational

362
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,372
audience activity.

363
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:45,514
I'm gonna ask you guys to do a little flow chart,

364
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,095
a quick and dirty three-step workflow of your position.

365
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,856
Where does your work come from?

366
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,118
If there are any students, your work might come

367
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:54,438
from a teacher or something like that.

368
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:56,479
What work do you do?

369
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,301
And who do you send your work to?

370
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,802
For example, as an animator, I get my work

371
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,163
from the writers, they give me the scripts.

372
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,244
I talk with the level designers to figure out

373
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,765
where my cinematic's going to take place.

374
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,093
I work with my director of photography

375
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,534
to figure out the staging of the scene,

376
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,696
and then we shoot it, and then the animator takes it

377
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,457
and assembles it all together and animates it

378
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:17,357
and makes it look awesome.

379
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,020
We then export that and send that to our implementation team.

380
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,341
We send that to our lighting team, effects, and audio.

381
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,522
I mean, this is a pretty generalized workflow,

382
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,463
but you guys get the idea.

383
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,625
So go ahead and make your own flowchart,

384
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:31,326
and then share it with your new best friend

385
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:32,486
and colleague sitting next to you.

386
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,829
Some final takeaways about organization.

387
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,291
Really, everything that you're doing

388
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,712
is helping you get the big picture

389
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,193
by understanding your flow,

390
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:44,174
your place within the production process,

391
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,896
and also learning just how much time

392
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,979
each of those steps take, so you can run smoothly.

393
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,842
On the cinematic team, we've charted out,

394
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,263
like I mentioned, that was a general workflow,

395
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,345
and this is really our full pipeline here,

396
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,888
and it really looks scary, but what it's doing

397
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,849
is it's helping us identify our handoffs

398
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,130
between all the different departments.

399
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,944
It's identifying any potential pain points

400
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:11,206
and figuring out areas where we can work simultaneously

401
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,447
across disciplines to save time, such as right here.

402
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,889
So that's being really, that's really beneficial for us.

403
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,351
I'd like to take a quick moment just to talk

404
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,372
about outsourcing since this is becoming more

405
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,233
and more common in AAA game studios.

406
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,474
And it was definitely a skill that I had to learn

407
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,895
on the fly as a first time lead.

408
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,356
First up, get to know your vendors.

409
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,357
Every studio is different.

410
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,919
Some like to take your work and really run with it

411
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,619
and get creative.

412
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:38,444
Others prefer very specific direction from you

413
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:41,367
so they can get their work done to your specific advice.

414
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,351
Some are good at working at a variety of tasks,

415
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,033
and others are more specialized little boutiques

416
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,875
that are really good at doing one thing in particular.

417
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,698
Some like to present their own schedules to you,

418
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,701
and some prefer to work with you to establish timelines.

419
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,104
So just get to know your vendors.

420
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:02,570
Learn how to give very specific and detailed feedback

421
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,392
because it can be harder to communicate across time zones

422
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:06,773
and across different languages.

423
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,176
So really use images, videos, Skype calls if possible.

424
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,719
Here's an example of one of our outsourcing notes

425
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:16,642
where we listed a very specific time frame and a note

426
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,044
and drew on top of a still frame

427
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,266
so people got a good idea of what we wanted from them.

428
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:26,498
Also, time management becomes even more crucial

429
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:27,618
when working with outsourcing.

430
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,679
Because when you're dealing with your internal team,

431
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,279
you sit next to them, you see them every day,

432
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,439
it's cool, you're communicating.

433
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,840
But with your outsource team,

434
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,520
it can be easy to lose track of them.

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,261
You might forget to send your feedback in a timely manner.

436
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:40,762
You might forget to check in

437
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,202
and see if they're blocked by anything,

438
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,023
if they have any roadblocks and they're stuck on work,

439
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,343
and they might not have communicated with you.

440
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:48,403
So don't leave them hanging.

441
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:49,564
Make sure you keep track of them.

442
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,406
What helped us was having an outsource coordinator

443
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:55,007
because he really kept those lines of communication open,

444
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,948
would give me reminders, would help make sure

445
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:59,069
that our assets were sent out and come back

446
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,510
in a nice, smooth manner.

447
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,731
So he helped us a lot.

448
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,653
All right, moving on to inspiration.

449
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,115
This is all about keeping your team members

450
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:10,155
motivated and growing.

451
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,597
Probably not the way that Kratos does it.

452
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:16,879
What you should do is be a source of positivity.

453
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,601
Because let's face it, stuff's gonna happen

454
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,522
that there's gonna be decisions made

455
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,882
that your team doesn't like, that you may not like.

456
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:26,803
You may have to scrap some work.

457
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,103
You may have to start over.

458
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,324
There's gonna be tasks that nobody likes to do.

459
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:32,584
There's gonna be things that make you just wanna rage out.

460
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,626
But what happens is that your team members are watching you

461
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,746
and they're gonna gauge how you're feeling.

462
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:41,787
So if they see that you're frustrated

463
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,167
or worried or complaining,

464
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,088
then they're gonna see that as permission

465
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:45,808
to act out as well.

466
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,570
So be a source of positivity.

467
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:50,893
I know this is very cliche.

468
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,674
I've actually already heard this a few times

469
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:54,736
at this conference, but fake it till you make it.

470
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:57,259
You know, it might seem disingenuous

471
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,661
to put on a happy face when you're actually upset,

472
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:01,803
but this really does go a long way

473
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:03,404
to boosting your team's morale if they see

474
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,847
that you're keeping pushing forward even under stress.

475
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,830
It also can actually help prevent your own negativity

476
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,253
from spiraling into something larger than it needs to be.

477
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,088
Now, if you're really feeling upset,

478
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,309
you just don't feel like you can hide it under a happy face,

479
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,950
then find an outlet to let off your steam.

480
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,131
You know, talk to your producers or managers,

481
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,592
or just find a friend that you feel like

482
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,833
you can talk to them about, and just let it out.

483
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:28,294
Or find an activity to do.

484
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,255
I like to sing in a choir.

485
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,417
When I was at UCLA, our choir director's motto was,

486
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:36,018
leave your baggage at the door.

487
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,219
You might have had a worst day in the world,

488
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,260
but when you come to rehearsal,

489
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,260
you leave that at the doorway,

490
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,641
and you come in, and you put on a smile, and you sing.

491
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,745
Now, I mean, part of singing is that you're performers,

492
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:49,327
you're acting, you know, so it might seem a little fake,

493
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:50,428
but by the end of rehearsal,

494
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,590
we actually were all genuinely feeling better,

495
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,551
and we would leave with a genuine smile on our face.

496
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:56,993
So having that outlet is very important.

497
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:01,196
Ah, feedback.

498
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,318
You could do a whole talk just on feedback.

499
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:04,879
In fact, people have and are doing that.

500
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,442
It falls under inspiration because giving good feedback

501
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:10,103
can really help keep your team motivated.

502
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,911
Something that's good for feedback

503
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,891
is just getting to the point,

504
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,672
because you are an expert in your field,

505
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:19,952
and you are responsible for the end result

506
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,313
being shipped to the rest of the world.

507
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,994
So don't lose your feedback amongst too much fluff.

508
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,255
Now as an animator, we love to use our bodies

509
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,995
to demonstrate feedback, as you remember

510
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:29,256
from the beginning of my slides.

511
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:31,377
It's very direct and to the point.

512
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,418
We even have a box full of prop weapons

513
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:37,259
near our desks for very important research.

514
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:37,919
Yes.

515
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,128
Now, getting to the point means being honest,

516
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:44,530
but not putting people down.

517
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,833
Because again, your team is looking for someone

518
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:48,894
they can turn to for help.

519
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,576
And if they feel that you're just gonna yell at them

520
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,657
or whatever when they come to you,

521
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,078
then they're not going to come to you.

522
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,880
And then how can you help them?

523
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:57,942
So don't be belittling.

524
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,144
Be encouraging.

525
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:06,344
When you're in art school, you get graded on your work,

526
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:07,825
and if you do really well, you get an A,

527
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:08,866
and that feels awesome.

528
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,407
And in the studio setting, it can be harder

529
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:13,648
to come across that kind of positive reinforcement.

530
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:16,049
So make sure you call out the good stuff,

531
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,891
especially for your young people who are just out of school

532
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,632
and may be struggling to adapt to the work environment.

533
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:25,507
On God of War, we had an intern who, during reviews,

534
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,947
would end up getting a lot more notes

535
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,728
just because he needed more experience.

536
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,468
But I always made sure to point out what he did well

537
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:32,889
and gave him lots of encouragement.

538
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,710
And he ended up taking on some of the most ambitious scenes

539
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,370
on our project and just did an amazing job.

540
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,491
So that was awesome.

541
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:42,872
Finally, follow-up.

542
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:44,692
Some artists can be introverted.

543
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:45,872
I mean, that's why they're artists.

544
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,673
They want to express themselves through their art

545
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:48,993
and not talk about it.

546
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,601
So just stop by their desk,

547
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:53,082
make sure they're going in the right direction,

548
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,602
and let them know that you're there for them.

549
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:56,682
Let them know that they can ask questions,

550
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:58,223
they can give their own opinions,

551
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,823
and you will be a good listener and listen to them.

552
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:04,484
And don't forget to request feedback, too.

553
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,524
Especially as a first-time lead,

554
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,125
you probably have very little idea how effective you're being.

555
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:12,065
It can feel kind of awkward asking for advice,

556
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:14,486
but it's important to get your team to be honest with you.

557
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,946
You can show them that you care about them enough

558
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:17,746
to want to be better.

559
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,641
You can also talk to your producers or managers

560
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,022
and see how you're doing from them.

561
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:25,504
This is really about inspiring yourself to keep growing.

562
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,266
Now this is a little scene from God of War,

563
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,747
probably the only time in the game

564
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,288
where Kratos asked for advice.

565
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,150
I'm gonna go ahead and play that video for you.

566
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:37,173
I mean, I get angry at you sometimes, but.

567
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:37,813
Do you?

568
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:41,396
I mean, sometimes, yeah, a little.

569
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,378
When are you angry?

570
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:45,399
What?

571
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,320
With me.

572
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:54,688
Oh, I guess sometimes when you don't think I can do something, but I can.

573
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,593
You see Kratos asked his son for advice, like, when do you get angry with me?

574
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,994
Why, why am I making you angry?

575
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:02,334
You know?

576
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:06,257
And if he hadn't asked, then he wouldn't have known how his son is trying so hard

577
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:09,600
to prove himself to his father, to show that he is grown up enough and he can

578
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,881
handle some more responsibility.

579
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:14,084
So that was really cool moment that I thought was cool.

580
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:20,704
So remember that artists come in all different kinds.

581
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,365
This is our animation team, pretty diverse.

582
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,468
And understanding what they love to do

583
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:29,430
lets you let them work on what they're passionate about.

584
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,511
So give them what they wanna work on.

585
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,513
But also remember to push them out of their comfort zone

586
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,934
because that's really gonna help them grow.

587
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:38,456
Okay, I'm not gonna make you guys

588
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:39,577
do an activity right now.

589
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,018
This is more of a take home test.

590
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,097
called Inspire Your Team.

591
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:46,477
I'm gonna give you kind of a role-playing scenario

592
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:47,737
where you have a team of artists,

593
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,658
and your job is to keep them happy

594
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:51,498
and figure out ways to challenge them

595
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:52,298
and keep them growing.

596
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,459
Your first team member is a scrappy new kid,

597
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,739
fresh out of school, ready to soak up information

598
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,960
like a sponge, and needs more experience.

599
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Then you've got your seasoned veteran,

600
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,120
those game people who've been in the trenches

601
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:06,721
for over a decade, they know all the ropes,

602
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:08,421
maybe they're a little bit jaded, you know,

603
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:09,901
but they wanna do the work.

604
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:10,741
They're in it to win it.

605
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:16,947
You've got that super fast insomniac who comes fresh from another AAA studio,

606
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:20,350
is really fast cranking out assets, but ends up working themselves to the bone

607
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,352
and refuse to go home even at one in the morning.

608
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:24,353
How do you keep these people happy?

609
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:25,854
How do you challenge them?

610
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:29,597
How about someone who comes from film or television?

611
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:30,979
They're super good.

612
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,481
Their stuff is such high quality and they give great feedback to everybody,

613
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:37,724
but maybe they've got some extra difficulty working with the game engine.

614
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:42,156
Your final team member is an indie jack of all trades.

615
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:43,417
Maybe they came from commercials,

616
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:44,958
maybe they came from indie games.

617
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:46,659
They know a little bit about everything,

618
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,059
they love wearing lots of different hats,

619
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,960
they love to branch out and experiment,

620
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,462
but maybe they lack a little bit of polish and focus.

621
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,623
This is your team, so do a little bit of role playing

622
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:57,944
and think about how you might help them,

623
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,365
keep them happy and help them grow.

624
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:02,747
I'll leave this up here for just a second

625
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:03,667
in case you wanna write it down.

626
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:10,149
All right.

627
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,134
Inspiration is really about learning to speak

628
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:15,435
each of your teammates' language.

629
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,217
Everybody thinks differently.

630
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,401
So if you can figure out how your team members think,

631
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:23,585
you can help them stay motivated and happy.

632
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,830
You can tailor your feedback and help them stay motivated.

633
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,053
On God of War we had a series of meaty scenes, cinematics featuring stunts and big creatures,

634
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,874
all that cool stuff that animators love to get their hands into.

635
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:40,036
My task was spreading them out amongst my team.

636
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,117
So I would go to each of them and ask them what they wanted to work on.

637
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:45,959
while also keeping in mind their experience levels,

638
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,501
their speed, what they're passionate about,

639
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:50,302
and made sure that in the end,

640
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,624
everybody got at least one big meaty scene.

641
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,445
That helped keep them happy,

642
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,167
and it also helped keep my schedule happy

643
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:57,848
because I wasn't piling all the big scenes

644
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:58,648
onto one animator.

645
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,193
All right, accountability.

646
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,736
This is about taking ownership of your impact

647
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:11,978
on your team and on your team's impact on the game.

648
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:17,065
Because the decisions that you make affect other people.

649
00:27:17,645 --> 00:27:19,886
They affect your teammates, they affect other departments.

650
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,066
Especially your downstream departments.

651
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,187
So make sure you always keep them in the loop.

652
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:26,148
That's getting back to communication again.

653
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:29,349
Here I'm speaking to our dialogue coordinator, Leilani.

654
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,450
Audio is actually a very important downstream department

655
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,771
for cinematics, so we need to make sure

656
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:36,432
they always had what they needed from us.

657
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:39,113
Most often it was just play blasts of our cinematics

658
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:40,854
with the time frames or the time code on it

659
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,254
so they could properly sync up the sound.

660
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,779
but keep your downstream departments in the loop.

661
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:49,542
Set the bar for quality.

662
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,585
You've trained your whole career to know what looks good,

663
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:54,846
so make sure you can set expectations

664
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,227
for what you want from your team.

665
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,429
Because when your team understands what's high quality,

666
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:00,390
what you want from them,

667
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,692
that helps them function more autonomously,

668
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,693
that helps them take ownership of their own stuff,

669
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:06,735
and that helps your team run more smoothly,

670
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,336
even if you have to step away, like I did.

671
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:16,519
I went on maternity leave right before alpha, which is probably the worst time in the world

672
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:19,762
to have a baby while you're trying to wrap up your game development.

673
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:26,247
But what I did was I met with all my producers and my senior animators and discussed how

674
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,869
I was going to hand off all my stuff.

675
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,333
I wrote up some detailed current state documents for all of my unfinished work to help transition

676
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,235
all of those scenes off to other owners.

677
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,457
And I was able to step back in after a few months

678
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:41,338
and see that work had progressed pretty well while I was gone.

679
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,920
In fact, later on in production, when one of my contractors

680
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,042
had to leave midway, he ended up doing the same thing for me.

681
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:51,063
He gave me a detailed current state document

682
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,324
for each of his unfinished scenes

683
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:54,785
so that I could make a smooth transition handing it off

684
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:55,765
to other owners.

685
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:58,006
So that was a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling.

686
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:03,449
Yeah, accountability.

687
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,234
Nobody's perfect, but don't sweat it, you know.

688
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,536
But do talk to people, own up if you mess up.

689
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,638
And work to fix the problem.

690
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,340
Your team members will respect your honesty

691
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,801
and your commitment to grow with them.

692
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:17,683
But don't dwell on it.

693
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,424
I mean, most times people,

694
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,786
everyone else will have moved on before you.

695
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:24,449
So don't let it eat you up inside, really just let it out.

696
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,270
Like when you make a crappy drawing,

697
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,652
just toss it out and move on to the next one

698
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:29,533
so you can get to the good stuff.

699
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,511
Part of accountability is also making sure

700
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:37,913
that your voice is heard and your team's voice is heard

701
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:38,873
since you represent them.

702
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:42,295
Now we know, artists are usually the cool kids

703
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:44,416
in the back of the room doodling on their notebooks.

704
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:47,438
But as a lead, you don't wanna sit in the back.

705
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:49,739
So take a seat at the table.

706
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,580
Don't let other people make decisions

707
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,961
that affect you and your team

708
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,302
without your opinion being heard.

709
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:56,622
So be visible.

710
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,124
Come prepared to those meetings.

711
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,174
Be aware of the subject matter, make notes,

712
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:06,136
bring questions, be an active participant.

713
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,738
This has the benefit of making those meetings more engaging

714
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,540
and then you don't get bored and start watching the clock

715
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,181
and start doodling your sketchbooks or whatever.

716
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:18,324
Go to bat for your team.

717
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,725
Remember, your team members are counting on you

718
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:21,466
to represent them.

719
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,708
So make sure that you get what you need

720
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:25,229
for your team to work well from others

721
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,630
and give back to the other departments as well.

722
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,668
This is a little bit more of an introspective exercise

723
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,649
you can do on your own time.

724
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,710
Sort of a personal accountability checkup.

725
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,571
First off, pledge to speak up at meetings.

726
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:41,812
Like actually take out your calendar,

727
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:43,473
find out when your next meeting is,

728
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:44,794
and write down that pledge.

729
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:45,794
Like really write it out.

730
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:49,076
I pledge to speak up at this tech art meeting

731
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,497
and maybe take some notes,

732
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,537
like what am I gonna say at it,

733
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:52,497
what questions am I gonna ask?

734
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,138
Like make a pledge.

735
00:30:56,791 --> 00:31:00,132
If you haven't synced up with your downstream departments in a while, set a date to sync

736
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:00,432
with them.

737
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:04,774
Ask them what you can do to help make their jobs easier.

738
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:12,437
Finally, write down a name or two of people that you maybe need to own up to.

739
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:14,577
Some you want to talk to one-on-one.

740
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,638
Figure out when you can schedule it.

741
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:20,339
It could just be like a casual walk around the parking lot or a coffee break or something,

742
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,680
but you know, be open.

743
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,460
Take some time.

744
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:28,060
Remember that when you are accountable to others,

745
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:29,802
they will be accountable to you.

746
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:31,243
That old golden rule.

747
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,848
Finally, and perhaps most importantly as artists,

748
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:38,749
creativity.

749
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,831
This is all about finding that delicate balance

750
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:44,273
between all that leadership stuff we've been talking about

751
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,234
throughout this whole session,

752
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:47,756
and finding time to do what you've trained for

753
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:49,037
your whole life as an artist.

754
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:53,240
Of course, don't try to do everything yourself.

755
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:59,067
It's tempting to think of lead artists being able to solve all the biggest problems, doing

756
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:01,867
all the biggest art tasks, taking everything on yourself.

757
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:03,448
Just don't.

758
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:07,929
You're going to be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of work to be done, and you'll have

759
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:10,329
no time to achieve that high-quality bar that you want to set.

760
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:15,230
You might get so bogged down in leadership stuff that you have no time to work on art

761
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,610
at all.

762
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,751
Or conversely, you might be focusing so hard on doing really good art that you're letting

763
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,292
your team down and not being a good lead.

764
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:25,634
So get some help.

765
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,356
Let your producers or managers or other leads

766
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,717
help you out and give you advice.

767
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,661
Remember to trust your team to take ownership

768
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,822
so that everyone else gets a chance to shine as well.

769
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:39,825
Art school is really about honing your skills

770
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,326
and becoming a master of your craft,

771
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:43,808
while leadership is about helping others

772
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:44,688
unlock their potential.

773
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,333
That being said, do take some time for yourself.

774
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,634
because you are still an artist.

775
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,337
So tell your producers this is an important priority

776
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:56,698
for you and schedule accordingly.

777
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,001
Find a few juicy tidbits to keep.

778
00:32:59,922 --> 00:33:02,285
For me, this actually works best during pre-production

779
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:03,326
where I have a little more time

780
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,848
before I'm wrangling a very large team.

781
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:06,830
I get to jump in the mo-cap suit,

782
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,833
I get to do a little pre-production stuff,

783
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,154
start assembling scenes.

784
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:11,436
It's a lot of fun for me.

785
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:16,084
If it helps, you can schedule some me time in your calendar,

786
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:18,885
actual blocks of time that you put in Outlook or whatever

787
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:20,065
so you can focus on your work.

788
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:21,986
That way you don't get booked for meetings

789
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:23,926
and you can actually get in the groove for a little while.

790
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,447
That way I was able to animate Freya's turtle friend there.

791
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:30,108
And a few other things.

792
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:34,269
Take some time to geek out on all that new stuff.

793
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,950
Follow cool artists on Twitter and Instagram.

794
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,170
Read up on the latest tech and trends.

795
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,691
Share it all with your teammates.

796
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:44,010
Our industry is changing and moving forward every day,

797
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,511
and you don't want to get left behind.

798
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:49,274
Geeking out on the new stuff might also spark your own ideas

799
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:49,975
to move forward.

800
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,757
So it's about inspiration and creativity.

801
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,180
So let's geek out a little bit.

802
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,043
Share something awesome with your partner

803
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,605
that you've seen or want to see at GDC,

804
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,586
or anywhere that you've seen it.

805
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:05,927
Also, thank your partners for being awesome, too.

806
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:06,808
Go ahead.

807
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:07,909
All right.

808
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,467
Let's wrap it up.

809
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,549
What does a lead artist do?

810
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:20,695
Communicate, organize, inspire, be accountable, and create.

811
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,697
I mean, I'm not gonna go through all these bullet points.

812
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,598
Again, this is basically my entire presentation.

813
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:26,980
This is just a slide for people to take a picture of

814
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,421
or whatever in case they haven't been taking notes

815
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,122
throughout the production.

816
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:32,765
I'll leave it up a little bit.

817
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,466
But let's think back upon that initial exercise we did.

818
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:47,209
Ah, you might notice that they fall

819
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,430
into those five categories.

820
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:50,972
So I think that's pretty cool.

821
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,795
Ah, it's like I did it on purpose.

822
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,259
A little bit of last minute advice.

823
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,222
Ask yourself, do you want to be a lead?

824
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:06,904
Leadership is not for everybody.

825
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,203
It's not a very glamorous job.

826
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:11,003
It's more like a service job.

827
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,463
You are working for other people.

828
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,284
It's not about seeking the lime knight.

829
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,244
It's about, again, helping other people

830
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:17,165
achieve their potential.

831
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,285
So take some time to discern which growth path

832
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:21,546
you want to follow in your career.

833
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:24,487
You might find that you prefer to be a specialist

834
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:25,207
rather than a lead.

835
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,687
But if leadership is something you actually feel

836
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:30,348
very passionate about, then just remember

837
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:32,629
that your first time can be kind of overwhelming.

838
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,229
But that's normal, it's okay.

839
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:35,995
What can you do about it?

840
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,416
Find a mentor.

841
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:39,317
Think about that person in your life

842
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,479
who you felt was a really good leader and talk to them.

843
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:45,422
Or find other leads or people in your industry

844
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,042
you can talk to.

845
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,844
Remember that failures and successes

846
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:51,185
are both powerful lessons.

847
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:52,606
So keep practicing.

848
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,768
You can even practice leadership before you become a lead.

849
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,150
In fact, many leads get their roles

850
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,291
because they were already showing leadership qualities

851
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:01,312
before they were asked.

852
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,792
Finally, remember that every lead is different.

853
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,855
And that's not a bad thing, because every team is different

854
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,378
and the needs of your team are going to be dependent

855
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:13,641
on what you guys are doing at any specific time.

856
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:15,903
So what are your personal strengths

857
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:18,066
and how can you be the best leader?

858
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:20,368
Thank you very much.

859
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,712
We have some time for Q&A if you're interested.

860
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,434
You can come up to one of the microphones there.

861
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:41,822
Please state your name for the record.

862
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:43,427
Oh, hi, I'm Andrew.

863
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:43,907
Hi.

864
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,129
Thank you so much, Erika, that was an awesome presentation.

865
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:47,190
I actually had a question for you.

866
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:47,530
Okay.

867
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:48,812
Potentially a bit of a tough one.

868
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:50,293
You mentioned a little bit, right?

869
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:52,976
At some point, like you're, for example,

870
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:54,317
you're not gonna know if like an artist

871
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:55,618
is at the studio at 1 a.m.

872
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:57,500
because they just really wanna make this one thing cool

873
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,722
or because you messed up at some point.

874
00:37:00,363 --> 00:37:03,686
And it's kind of tough because the way you mess up

875
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:07,009
as a lead impacts people in very non-trivial ways.

876
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,732
and especially sort of going through that first time experience, maybe have some advice

877
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,434
for people on how do you deal with letting people down sometimes?

878
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:21,617
How do you deal with letting people down sometimes, especially as a first time lead?

879
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:25,045
I think the important thing is being honest,

880
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,285
just letting them know, look, this is my first time,

881
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,226
I could use your support and help.

882
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:33,967
And again, being observant and just letting yourself see

883
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,067
what's going on around you.

884
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,487
I mean, if you don't catch it in time

885
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,588
and you do let someone down,

886
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:39,288
make sure you follow up with them,

887
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,849
make sure you follow up with your producers or whatever

888
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:42,929
and let them know what happened

889
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:47,310
and just make sure you can take notes or whatever

890
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,710
and document what happened

891
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,030
so that next time it comes around,

892
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,851
you're better prepared to handle the situation.

893
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:53,635
Just being honest.

894
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:54,815
Fair enough, thank you.

895
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:56,896
Over here.

896
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:58,176
Oh, hey.

897
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:58,736
Hi.

898
00:37:59,096 --> 00:37:59,657
Oh, that was loud.

899
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:00,397
What's up?

900
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:02,437
Yeah, I was just wondering,

901
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:06,418
how do you deal with giving feedback to specialists

902
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,939
that might be more skilled than you

903
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,599
in a very specific field,

904
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,100
and you know that the asset is not living up

905
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,601
to the quality standards that you want,

906
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:18,302
but yeah, trying to give feedback to them.

907
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,846
Hmm, that is a tough one because again,

908
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,248
the lead is not necessarily the best artist in the room,

909
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:27,929
but it is someone who has the bigger picture

910
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:30,570
and the context of what's going on in the project.

911
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,951
So what you can do with your specialist is just say,

912
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,092
you know, what we need from you right now

913
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:37,433
is going to help serve the project as a whole.

914
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,760
and all of our team together, and we're in it,

915
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,641
focusing on the game itself,

916
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:43,662
and not necessarily on this one asset.

917
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,964
So just keeping a bigger picture and working with them.

918
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:48,045
And also just keeping in mind that, yes,

919
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,506
that they may be more skilled than you,

920
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,387
and you respect their quality and their talent

921
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:53,328
and their effort and their time that they've put in.

922
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:54,769
Thank you.

923
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,550
Hello, my name is Danny.

924
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:58,231
Hi, Danny.

925
00:38:58,751 --> 00:38:58,971
Hi.

926
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:00,852
My question is about,

927
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,855
how do you balance between keeping people happy,

928
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:07,987
and giving them harsh feedback.

929
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:09,209
Mmm.

930
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,801
How do you balance between keeping your team happy

931
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,746
and giving them some harsh feedback?

932
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,939
because sometimes people don't want to hear about it.

933
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,540
That's true.

934
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,600
And I think that comes back to the inspiration topic

935
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,201
about knowing your teammates and knowing what

936
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,121
affects them the best.

937
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:30,582
You may find yourself speaking to different people

938
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:33,122
in different ways because everybody reacts differently.

939
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:35,643
So if you need to give someone harsh feedback

940
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,183
and you know they might take it personally,

941
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:39,043
just make sure you acknowledge that.

942
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,824
Like, look, this isn't anything personal.

943
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:41,624
This isn't about you.

944
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:44,287
This is really about focusing on the game

945
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:45,488
and how we can make the game better.

946
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,389
And if you don't agree with me, that's fine.

947
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,630
We can agree to disagree.

948
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,711
But at this point, we need to get the game shipped.

949
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,552
And I feel like we want to have a unified vision

950
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:57,253
going forward.

951
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,253
Thank you.

952
00:39:59,393 --> 00:39:59,633
OK.

953
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,034
Hi.

954
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:04,655
So I'm a little bit confused about what

955
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:08,537
is the difference between becoming a lead artist and art

956
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:08,937
director?

957
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:13,667
Ah, that really depends on the studio you're at.

958
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,110
At Santa Monica Studio, the lead artists

959
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,312
are more responsible for kind of the day-to-day processes

960
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:21,374
of working with the team and checking in with them,

961
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:22,916
make sure they have everything they need to work.

962
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,558
Our art director is kind of one step above the leads,

963
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:27,119
and they communicate with the leads

964
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:29,401
and make sure that they're meeting one-on-one

965
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:30,603
with the creative director

966
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,304
and the other directors in the studio

967
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:34,226
and really getting that super big vision,

968
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:35,767
and then they communicate that down.

969
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,822
to the leads who then communicate that down to the artists.

970
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:41,584
So it's really kind of a waterfall effect of,

971
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:43,705
so that the creative director doesn't have to go

972
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:44,786
to each person individually,

973
00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:46,047
they can talk to the directors,

974
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,608
and then they can spread that information out to the leads.

975
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,169
Okay, thank you.

976
00:40:51,245 --> 00:41:11,332
Hi, I'm Miriam. How do you manage a super small team? Let's say you have only two to three artists in the room and it's a very small independent game studio that may be currently be having some issues with ego. So how do you manage that?

977
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:15,353
Oh man, ego. That's the elephant in the room.

978
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:22,794
I think especially with smaller teams, sometimes it can be difficult having kind of a leadership

979
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,916
thing versus everybody being on equal ground.

980
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:29,058
And currently my team is pretty small because we're in a stage of production where we're

981
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,159
not ready for a full team.

982
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:35,423
So I think it is more about speaking to everybody on their own level and showing respect to

983
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:35,823
each other.

984
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:41,927
I think, again, you're trying to keep the focus on the game and not your individual

985
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,488
needs and wants and figuring out what is going to help.

986
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:45,982
this game come together.

987
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:51,425
And I mean, just being honest with each other and, you know, sometimes it takes getting

988
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:55,767
out of the studio sometimes, just having some chats outside of work, just to get everybody

989
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:58,269
feeling more comfortable talking to each other.

990
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,109
Thank you.

991
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:02,691
Anybody else?

992
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:04,152
Okay.

993
00:42:04,432 --> 00:42:04,612
Hi.

994
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:05,433
Hi.

995
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:10,375
So, as a lead, I know often you have to make really, really tough choices.

996
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:15,939
One that's probably either way is really harsh.

997
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,962
And what is the toughest choice you've ever had to make as a lead?

998
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:23,926
And as of now, like, do you think you made the right choices?

999
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:27,009
Something that's like quickly, oh, I have to make this choice, right?

1000
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:27,289
You know?

1001
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:31,293
What is the toughest choice I've ever had to make as a lead?

1002
00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:32,414
Oh, gee.

1003
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,978
I think for me personally, it's been about.

1004
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:40,015
hiring and figuring out who the right people are

1005
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:42,217
for your team, because those are the people

1006
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:44,258
you're going to be working with for a long time.

1007
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:47,080
So making sure you make those right decisions.

1008
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,462
And that's, you don't always know, just from an interview,

1009
00:42:50,662 --> 00:42:52,743
what you're going to get, but you try to gauge

1010
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:54,785
as best as you can and if you can give them a test.

1011
00:42:55,265 --> 00:43:00,048
You know, and gosh, in terms of production,

1012
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:03,170
probably the hardest choice is when we have to let things go

1013
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,831
or tell someone that they have to start over

1014
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:07,093
because it didn't work.

1015
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:10,223
And no one likes to have their work thrown out,

1016
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:12,784
but you try to just sit down with them

1017
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:14,505
and then tell them again, it's nothing personal,

1018
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:17,906
and just let them say this is for the good of the game.

1019
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:21,888
Do you feel at that point, do you feel like maybe

1020
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:25,030
you failed to get direction in the beginning,

1021
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,451
or that's usually how just reiteration works?

1022
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:34,154
I think just, yeah, knowing that it is part of the iterative process and letting everybody

1023
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:38,015
know that, yes, this is, you know, it's not like art school where you do a project and

1024
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:38,935
you get a grade and you're done.

1025
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:43,256
It is about iterating and making sure that, you know, it is to the highest quality we

1026
00:43:43,276 --> 00:43:44,037
can before we ship.

1027
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:44,717
Okay.

1028
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:45,197
Thank you.

1029
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:45,517
Yeah.

1030
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:45,797
Thank you.

1031
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:48,378
Hello.

1032
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:49,358
My name is Shannon.

1033
00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:49,978
Hi, Shannon.

1034
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:55,040
I was wondering, what are some ways that you evaluate your own success as a leader and

1035
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,460
manager?

1036
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,161
How do I evaluate my own success?

1037
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:04,019
I think for me, the best part, well, at the end of each project, we do a post-mortem.

1038
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,560
So that's when I tell them, hey guys, write down everything that went well and everything

1039
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,620
that did not go well, and let's talk about it and figure it out.

1040
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,841
And I try to get them to stay honest and give me that feedback.

1041
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:21,802
And what really helped me feel good was at the end, some of my contractors, as they were

1042
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,323
leaving, they said, hey, you were a really good lead.

1043
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:25,043
Sometimes it's as simple as that.

1044
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,163
Just someone coming up and saying, hey, you did a good job.

1045
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,946
So I think that's important to also say to other people,

1046
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:31,646
is telling them that they did a good job too.

1047
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:32,947
Thank you.

1048
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:37,468
Hi, thank you for the talk.

1049
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:38,348
I'm Miguel.

1050
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:38,969
Hi.

1051
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:42,370
And my question is, when there are too many ideas

1052
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,471
on the table, more or less, how do you coordinate

1053
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:48,932
so that the amount of information overload

1054
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:52,633
actually does not bog down the production of the project?

1055
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:53,693
For example, there are many ideas

1056
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,333
of how things should move or something.

1057
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,656
Like, how do you just condense everything

1058
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,779
into just getting to one solution?

1059
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,801
Let me see if I understand.

1060
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,845
You're wondering, when there's too many ideas on the table,

1061
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,707
how do you make sure that you can move forward

1062
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,028
in a right pace and everything?

1063
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:14,572
I think when you're in a meeting, just setting goals for yourself like this is a one-hour

1064
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:17,675
meeting, let's throw everything on the table, but by the end of the hour, we should narrow

1065
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,836
it down to what we really need going forward.

1066
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:24,100
Or if it's something where everybody's emailing each other back and forth, I know you should

1067
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,601
do it like this, I know you should do it like that.

1068
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:30,064
I mean, that's where, as a lead, you have the authority to step in and say, okay, we're

1069
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:30,905
going to nail this down.

1070
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,227
Maybe I'll talk about it with the other leads and I'll get back to you guys.

1071
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,889
You know, it doesn't have to end right here.

1072
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:36,389
We can...

1073
00:45:37,393 --> 00:45:38,934
We'll make the decision and let you guys know.

1074
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:41,215
I mean, sometimes you can pull rank like that.

1075
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:43,416
Okay, thank you.

1076
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:45,597
Hello.

1077
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:46,917
Hi.

1078
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,819
So, let's say you have a person under you.

1079
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,640
And I mean, of course, game is about reiteration, right?

1080
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:56,782
So how if you've given a task to somebody below you,

1081
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:59,803
and then after several reiteration and critique,

1082
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:02,364
the work is still really off the mark,

1083
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:05,506
and the time is running out, so what do you do?

1084
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:07,414
That is a tough one.

1085
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:10,755
What do you do when someone's reiterated time and time again

1086
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:12,756
and it just isn't quite hitting the quality bar?

1087
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:16,517
I think, first of all, you have to acknowledge the work

1088
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:17,718
that they have put in so far.

1089
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:19,218
So make sure you let them know,

1090
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:20,919
I appreciate all the work you've put in.

1091
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:22,659
I feel like at this point,

1092
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:25,000
we should talk about other directions we can go.

1093
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,941
And maybe you're just very tired

1094
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,601
and let's see if we can put you on another task

1095
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,622
and maybe get those creative juices flowing again.

1096
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:32,562
Maybe we'll pass this off to someone,

1097
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:33,783
just have them quickly wrap it up.

1098
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,075
and get you working on something new that, you know,

1099
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,217
I'm sure you're tired of doing it six times,

1100
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:39,719
you know, let's give you something new

1101
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:40,479
to challenge yourself.

1102
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,681
Okay, thank you.

1103
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:45,369
Are we good?

1104
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,130
Not one more, okay.

1105
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:47,990
Hi.

1106
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,391
Hi.

1107
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,471
Two small questions.

1108
00:46:49,992 --> 00:46:53,033
First one, what the amount of artists

1109
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:56,195
you consider healthy in your team

1110
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,157
to keep the balance you talked about?

1111
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:01,098
Like to be a manager and to keep,

1112
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:04,280
you know, looking new stuff in the industry.

1113
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:09,078
Oh man, what do you consider like a good team size to lead?

1114
00:47:09,218 --> 00:47:11,780
So for example, five artists is okay.

1115
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:14,442
Actually, I think five is pretty good.

1116
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:16,043
You know, I was just at a talk where they were talking

1117
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,385
about a study that was done about ideal team size

1118
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:19,766
and I think the study said 4.6 people.

1119
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:27,358
At the peak of production, I had seven animators under me, and it was a little tough.

1120
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:31,421
I think five would have been nice, but I think I was able to get to seven.

1121
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:36,545
It really is about how you manage your time, and if you feel like you can handle scheduling

1122
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,446
enough time to get to each person individually.

1123
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:40,667
then I think you're doing a good job.

1124
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:43,447
But it's really about seeing how underwater you feel

1125
00:47:44,047 --> 00:47:45,848
for the amount of team that you have.

1126
00:47:46,368 --> 00:47:47,548
Depends on the project as well.

1127
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:48,589
Okay, thanks.

1128
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:53,590
And the second one, what if you have a batch of work

1129
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,191
not interesting, like fixing bugs, for example,

1130
00:47:58,311 --> 00:48:01,372
from outsourcers, and you have a great team

1131
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,893
of different specialists, skilled offshore,

1132
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:09,928
So how would you how would you motivate them?

1133
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,984
The question was, what do you do when you get tasks that is not very interesting and

1134
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:18,986
you have a bunch of specialists that you want to make sure that they're happy?

1135
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:24,510
For me, if it's a big task, rather than trying to take someone down for a long time, I might

1136
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:28,674
say, okay, everybody, we're going to do this bug fixing, everybody take five bugs and let's

1137
00:48:28,694 --> 00:48:30,295
just get it out of the way as quickly as we can.

1138
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:34,398
That whole many hands make light work thing, because then everybody's in it together, everybody

1139
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,200
can kind of complain to each other and then say...

1140
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,116
Oh, I've got to do bugs.

1141
00:48:38,156 --> 00:48:39,717
But then everybody gets done at the same time,

1142
00:48:39,757 --> 00:48:41,619
and then we can move on to the next fun thing.

1143
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:43,660
OK, thanks a lot.

1144
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,140
Thank you.

1145
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:49,525
All right, if there's no further questions,

1146
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:51,166
I'd just like to do a quick plug.

1147
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:54,548
We have a couple of cinematic-related talks

1148
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:55,369
coming up this week.

1149
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:57,130
First on Wednesday, Doria Razzi is

1150
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,413
giving a talk called Creating a Deeper Emotional Connection,

1151
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:02,054
the Cinematography of God of War.

1152
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:03,655
And that's going to be a really deep dive into.

1153
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:06,977
the staging and composition and cinematography for our cut scenes.

1154
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:10,619
And on Thursday I'm giving a talk called Keyframes and Cardboard Props,

1155
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,921
the cinematic process behind God of War, and that'll be just kind of an overview

1156
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:17,803
of everything from script all the way to screen, everything that we went through

1157
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:20,324
to make sure that our cinematics worked with no cuts.

1158
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:22,525
Thank you again very much.

1159
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:25,687
We are hiring.
