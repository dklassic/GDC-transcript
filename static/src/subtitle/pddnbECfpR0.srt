1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,193
Hello, so how's everyone doing today?

2
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:08,737
Cool, that's good.

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:12,322
Okay, so first, can you please put your phone on silent?

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,466
And a quick reminder, there's reviews at the end of session.

5
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,270
Please fill them out because it let us know how I did.

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:19,830
Okay, great.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,192
So, thank you for showing up for my talk,

8
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:24,214
Porting a Real-Life Castle into a Game When You're Broke.

9
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:26,856
I'm Joseph, and I'm a Technical Designer at Wordvoid.

10
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,039
So, a little bit of background.

11
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:32,582
Wordvoid is an open-world puzzle exploration game,

12
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,165
and it focuses on historical locations of the world,

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,786
and we try to incorporate the rich history

14
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:37,987
of those locations into our game.

15
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:43,668
So I was working on the Bimlo site, and if you're not familiar with that site, it's the

16
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,910
home of the Phoenician, one of the most ancient cultures.

17
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:50,034
It's consisted of traders, and it's believed that they invented the alphabet.

18
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:54,618
So the city itself is located in Lebanon, and it's over 10,000 years old.

19
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,104
So what's interesting about the location

20
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:00,385
is that multiple civilization went through it,

21
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:03,547
even the Greek, the Roman, and the Crusades.

22
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:04,948
And speaking of the Crusades,

23
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:07,409
that's when the castle was built using Roman ruins.

24
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,310
Now the castle itself is fairly recent

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,671
and it's just 800 years old.

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,651
and I had to scan it for my game.

27
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,912
So I was promised a funding that kept being delayed

28
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,293
and I decided to just go out and do it

29
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,914
with whatever equipment I can find, and it worked.

30
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:25,315
So this talk is a reflection about why it worked

31
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,456
and what I used, and hopefully it will help you

32
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:28,737
scan your own castle into your game.

33
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,519
Okay, so the first approach that I took

34
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,659
was to draw from reference.

35
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,100
So I had a few photos of the castle,

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,860
and I tried to draw it,

37
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,922
and I started to get really decent results,

38
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:41,362
though.

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,001
The problem is it wasn't until a few months later

40
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,562
that I realized some dimensions were off.

41
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,323
Like for example, there was a bridge for the castle

42
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,804
and in the game it barely fits one character.

43
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,786
And in real life, it also barely fits one character

44
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,887
and his horse and his personal marching band.

45
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:57,647
So that was nice.

46
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,370
Okay, so that's why I decided to just measure the castle.

47
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,931
And so I took a measuring tape and I went there

48
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,252
and measured every single rock of the castle.

49
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,533
Took me around two days, nine packs of Oreos,

50
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:11,314
and I did it, basically.

51
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:14,117
So yay.

52
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,438
OK, luckily on the last day, I just

53
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,719
remembered there was an app called 123D Catch.

54
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,759
And that app was just grab your phone,

55
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,900
take a few photos of an object, and you upload it to the cloud.

56
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,460
It will generate a 3D model for you.

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,341
So I was like, sure, I can take a quick spin around the castle.

58
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:31,782
So I did that.

59
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:35,723
And I used Recap, and I got this blob.

60
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,657
So this blog is actually really interesting

61
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,719
because even though I cannot use it in my game,

62
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,180
it showed me that 3D scanning is probably a good way

63
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,261
to actually approach this.

64
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,162
So I started doing some research

65
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,163
and I found out that it's named photogrammetry.

66
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:52,266
And well, I got really in-depth into the subject.

67
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,329
So to be clear, this talk will not cover photogrammetry.

68
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,690
It's not a introduction to photogrammetry,

69
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,692
though if you're interested about knowing more,

70
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:02,453
I wrote an article called

71
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:04,114
Everything You Need to Know About Photogrammetry.

72
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:05,382
I hope.

73
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,085
And you can check it out.

74
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,727
Though if you're not familiar with the topic,

75
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,289
it's really simple and it's just taking multiple images

76
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,592
of the same model, and if you have enough overlap

77
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,293
between your photos, the software will generate

78
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:16,994
a model for you.

79
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,938
So I started doing some research, joined some group,

80
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:22,880
and I found the Facebook 3D scanning group,

81
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,162
which I highly recommend you join.

82
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,164
And it's filled of industry veterans

83
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,785
that's more than happy to share their experience.

84
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,298
And on that note, special shout out to Jeffrey N. Wilson

85
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,679
who actually helped me figure out this list of equipment

86
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,779
that I needed for my project.

87
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,420
And first I needed a DSLR, some accessories,

88
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,541
a drone, and a special rig.

89
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,842
And this rig is used usually for capturing the environment

90
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,662
in order to remove it later in post-process.

91
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:49,344
So let's see how we can actually reduce the cost

92
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:50,864
of every single one of those equipment.

93
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,101
First, let's check out the camera.

94
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:55,924
And since the camera is around,

95
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,990
well a decent one for photogrammetry can cost up to 3K.

96
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,798
There's actually, you don't need a very expensive camera

97
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,820
and this is a living proof and this scan is done

98
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,501
by Milos Luka and he's an active member

99
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,262
of the Community in 3D Scanning Facebook group.

100
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:11,963
And what's impressive about this scan

101
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,544
is not the level of detail he achieved,

102
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,466
but it's actually that he used a camera at the SLR,

103
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,487
the Canon 550D, which is not one

104
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,527
of the highest end cameras.

105
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:21,989
He also used an adjustable lens,

106
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,170
and to compensate for the lack of resolution,

107
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,611
what he did, he took more photos.

108
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,352
He actually took 436 photos of a single door.

109
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,362
So, and he used RealityCapture.

110
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:35,584
So you don't need an expensive DSLR

111
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,025
and most of them will just work.

112
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,527
Some people even use their phone, for example.

113
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,588
Just save in the highest settings

114
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,370
or save and run when possible.

115
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,311
If you can't buy it, rent or borrow.

116
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,693
And also, you can always post-process your photos

117
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,535
which will help you get better results

118
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,856
and will boost the quality.

119
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,938
So I used DX Optics, you can use Camera Raw

120
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,558
or Lightroom too.

121
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:04,049
So as for the accessories, so fixed lens will probably

122
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,152
give you a sharper result, but you can use an adjustable one.

123
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:09,694
Just make sure you pick one focal length and stick to it

124
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:11,035
during the entire session of the capture.

125
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,277
And it's decal because you're going to need a lot of photos.

126
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:18,221
And this one is actually obvious, but well, before my

127
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,723
battery camera never drained, and it wasn't until I went to

128
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:23,205
scan the castle when it did, so always get an extra battery.

129
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,427
Luckily, the security guard over there was kind enough for

130
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,049
me to let me charge my battery.

131
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,289
but I did lose a couple of hours.

132
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,830
Of course, you need a tripod and a monopod

133
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,591
for more stable images, and a remote.

134
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,952
Well, it's $2, so get it anyway.

135
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,533
And basically, for the remote,

136
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,235
well, basically, when the camera cannot get to some,

137
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:46,856
when you want to take photos of some areas

138
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,577
that you can't really reach the camera,

139
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,097
you can use a remote, and it's really useful.

140
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,899
As for the drone, it will definitely make your life easier,

141
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,419
though I did not use one,

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,200
and it's because I couldn't afford one.

143
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:00,287
The drone I needed was a DJI Inspire,

144
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:03,088
it cost around $3,000, but now you can get similar result

145
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,370
by just getting the Mavic Pro, which is $1,000.

146
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,372
So if you can't get one, here's how to probably

147
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:09,812
do a scan without it.

148
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:13,295
And the first thing you wanna do is just scan the floor

149
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,777
and then go one level over it, scan the second floor,

150
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,698
and then take a loop from the second floor

151
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:19,939
where both floors are showing.

152
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,100
And if you look at the picture at the top right,

153
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,042
you can see both ledges of the two floors showing,

154
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,943
which helps the software actually align

155
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:27,683
those floors together.

156
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,050
So how do you scan the roof?

157
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,393
Because the roof, there isn't anything on top of it.

158
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,376
And what you need to do is use ground control points.

159
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,238
And ground control points are basically points

160
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,460
that you specify manually on multiple images.

161
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,641
It will help the software align it.

162
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,973
Though, once you have a point on the roof,

163
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,074
it's not actually visible from downstairs,

164
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,874
so how do you actually find a good reference point?

165
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,935
And in my case, I got lucky, there was a pole.

166
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,956
I also don't know why there was a pole,

167
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,457
but there is one, so yay, that's great.

168
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:00,938
So look for those features,

169
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,618
if there isn't any, try to put one,

170
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,439
and it will help you manually actually align the roof.

171
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,700
Or get a drone, if you can.

172
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,890
As for the special rig, I did not use one

173
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,651
because I don't have Amazon in my country

174
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:14,232
and it's really expensive to buy one that's already built.

175
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,714
So I'm glad I didn't use one because later at GDC

176
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,015
there was a talk called Photogrammetry

177
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,136
and Star Wars Battlefront and they mentioned a technique

178
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,397
where they used object normal space,

179
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:28,479
object space normal map, and basically it's useful

180
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,940
for removing the light without any equipment.

181
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,041
It will give you similar results so that's great.

182
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:37,364
So as for the software, since I was using 123Dcache,

183
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,904
I looked for the Autodesk solution

184
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,265
and I found something called Remake.

185
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:43,225
And Remake is actually free if you use the cloud

186
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,466
and you can upload up to 125 images.

187
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,006
Though if you get the professional version

188
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:51,107
for $30 a month, you can upload up to 150 images

189
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:53,887
and you can also do some offline processing.

190
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,648
Though Remake didn't give me a lot of controls

191
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,369
on the process itself and basically that may

192
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,169
or may not be something that you want in your project.

193
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,103
So I look for the other software, which is the most commonly used back then, and it's

194
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:08,985
called Agisoft.

195
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:15,617
And Agisoft is only $180 for a license, and it has a limited amount of photos it can handle.

196
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,063
Though actually unlimited with an asterisk,

197
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,865
because the more photos you have, the more RAM you need.

198
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,887
So if you're going to scan a castle,

199
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,928
and imagine you need around 4,000 or 6,000 photos,

200
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,352
you're going to need probably around 512 gigs of RAM.

201
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,454
And that's going to be a very expensive server.

202
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,275
If you want to use a ground control point,

203
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,496
you need the professional version.

204
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:38,437
So that's an extra $3,500.

205
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,257
So solution can be quite expensive.

206
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,704
And that's when I looked for RealityCapture.

207
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,048
And RealityCapture is 99 euros per month.

208
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,651
And it's actually really fast,

209
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,013
much faster than RealityCapture.

210
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,194
And what's interesting about it,

211
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,737
it can run on almost any laptop or desktop,

212
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,459
as long as it has an NVIDIA GPU.

213
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,423
And it can handle an unlimited amount of photos,

214
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,645
no matter the amount of RAM you have.

215
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,215
The professional version, sorry, the promo version

216
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:11,582
will probably just handle up to 2,500 images

217
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,547
while the yearly license will handle

218
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,529
unlimited amount of images.

219
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,875
So if you're scanning multiple castles during the year,

220
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:21,436
I would highly recommend you invest in a yearly license.

221
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,056
Though if it's a one-time project,

222
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,018
then you can also consider Pix4D,

223
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,579
which is $350 for one month,

224
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,080
but it can also give you a similar result.

225
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,521
And although all of these software

226
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,242
don't give you the same result out of the box,

227
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,883
if you invest your time in every one of them,

228
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:37,583
you can actually get the same result

229
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,704
just by tweaking some settings.

230
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:40,765
So as for the PC.

231
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,672
For the PC, well according to my testing,

232
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,954
these are the recommended specs that I found out.

233
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,475
GPU, well you can use an AMD,

234
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,916
but if you want to use the RT-Capture,

235
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:53,699
you need an NVIDIA, so NVIDIA is a safe bet in this case.

236
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,321
I had some issues with MeshLab for VRAM

237
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,822
that's less than four gigs, so get one with four gigs.

238
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,424
For the CPU, you might need i7 or Xeon,

239
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,785
and in order to make that decision,

240
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,988
Now that i7 is limited to 64 gigs of RAM,

241
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,669
though RealityCapture for example,

242
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,831
prefer faster cores over more number of cores,

243
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:15,293
while Agisoft prefer more cores

244
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,734
because you have to disable some of them

245
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,175
if you have more GPUs and more RAM.

246
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,857
So, it depends.

247
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:25,440
As for RAM amount, I found 32 gigs to be a safe bet.

248
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,381
I did find some issues with 16,

249
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,223
but most scan will actually work with 16.

250
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:30,724
Unless you're scanning in CASL,

251
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:33,505
then this number won't actually really help you in Agisoft,

252
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,966
but other software actually works great.

253
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,691
As for the hard drive, well, you can get an SSD,

254
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:39,811
but it's really expensive.

255
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,873
So just get one that has small capacity

256
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:42,973
to run the software on it,

257
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,975
and you can store your photo on an HDD.

258
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,757
And the thing with HDD is that it's not expensive,

259
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,378
and it will just probably add some time

260
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:52,919
to the first processing layer,

261
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,861
which is loading the images into memory.

262
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,203
Okay, and please don't use a laptop.

263
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:05,168
I mean, I totally ignored my own advice and I used my own laptop actually because I was broke,

264
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:10,632
but you shouldn't. I mean, okay, also most of the advice I give, I actually broke all of

265
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:16,057
them, but you shouldn't. Great. So I mentioned that I went scanning the castle and it

266
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:21,421
worked, but actually there was a long period of preplanning and practicing before that. So if

267
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,764
you had never scanned before, start by practicing. For example, for me it was the rock in

268
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,045
my living room that I started scanning.

269
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:30,861
and took a few images, tried to take less, take more,

270
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:31,602
see what happens.

271
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,966
And yeah, then you can ask yourself,

272
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,088
how much resolution do I need?

273
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,430
Do I really need all the information?

274
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:39,692
For example.

275
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,848
If the wall is offsetted by 10 centimeters,

276
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:44,549
are you an archaeologist?

277
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,630
Do you need that huge amount of precision?

278
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,011
Or are you a game developer and you don't really care?

279
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:50,692
Do you need all the details

280
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,113
or will it be covered in the textures?

281
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,974
And those questions will actually define

282
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:55,114
how much photos you will take.

283
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,235
You can probably take six photos for one wall

284
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,436
or 50 photos for one rock.

285
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,918
Okay.

286
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,570
So also you don't have to scan everything

287
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,290
in high resolution.

288
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,871
Just look for some features like the textures.

289
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,711
If you want a texture, focus on that.

290
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,372
Some modular pieces, and even in that castle

291
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,452
where nothing is modular because it's really old

292
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:17,692
and every piece is not identical at all

293
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,793
and nothing is symmetrical, I still found some pieces

294
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,513
that are coming to the architecture of that time

295
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,933
and I focused on those.

296
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:28,454
So for example, the stairs, the window, or the ceiling.

297
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,014
Okay.

298
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:31,975
So for the pre-planning.

299
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,821
Then you have to imagine how are you going

300
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:35,782
to capture your photos.

301
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:38,362
So first you want to take a huge loop around the castle.

302
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:40,603
So I'm drawing the loop right now,

303
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,304
it doesn't update in real time, okay.

304
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:44,804
And this is the first loop,

305
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:46,585
we'll just cover all the details of the castle

306
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,545
and make sure everything is visible in all the photos.

307
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,186
Though it's not enough, you have to take a second loop

308
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,127
that's closer and covers more details.

309
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,327
So one second.

310
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:57,828
Okay, and that's a closer loop.

311
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:00,909
Though the thing is, there's a hill over here.

312
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,546
So you can't really take photo from here

313
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:07,228
and you have to climb all the way to this point.

314
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,810
Though the problem, there are some spikes,

315
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,271
so that was challenging and it covered

316
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,172
most of my field of view.

317
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:16,215
There's also a bridge underneath over there.

318
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:22,039
And some tight passages that you have to also compensate for.

319
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,833
And also not to mention the sun is not your friend.

320
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,453
Even if you're shooting in a cloudy day,

321
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,794
a small sun shifting can actually ruin your entire scan.

322
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,735
So the better way to approach this is not taking a loop

323
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,515
because taking a loop can take up to 10 minutes

324
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,555
and in 10 minutes the sun can change a lot.

325
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,996
So instead you want to scan each element individually.

326
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,556
So for example you scan the first tower,

327
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:45,857
then you scan the wall, then you scan another tower

328
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:47,337
and you sort it into folders.

329
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,598
Because just in case that happened,

330
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,479
you can always just manually align those elements.

331
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,359
But if you took a loop and it doesn't close,

332
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,761
then it doesn't gonna work out really well actually for you.

333
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,502
So that's something to consider.

334
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,663
So as for the interior, and this also works on the exterior,

335
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:03,844
don't take panoramic images.

336
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:05,445
And panoramic images are basically

337
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,686
images that you take in place, so don't do that.

338
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,327
Walk while you capture the photos,

339
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,628
because this will generate a lot of errors.

340
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,730
And I took many panoramic images, so just knowing.

341
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,948
Okay, so when you want to scan some tunnels,

342
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,729
it's really hard to move inside of tunnels,

343
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,050
so make sure to grab a photo,

344
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,730
and then take one step forward,

345
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,691
grab another photo, and keep moving on forward.

346
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,052
Though if it's the stairs, for example,

347
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,172
direction actually matters,

348
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,493
because you want to go up the stairs and not down,

349
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,653
because you want to see the steps in the photos.

350
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,578
Another issue that you might face is dark tunnels,

351
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:44,279
and in this case, some areas can be much darker

352
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:47,100
than the other, and when capturing with a tripod,

353
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,240
you can probably change the shutter speed,

354
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,520
but that can backfire too,

355
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,821
so you have to be careful with this one.

356
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,781
But it will help you get more dynamic range

357
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,742
and more points to actually align the images.

358
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,963
So speaking of alignment, once I captured all the photos,

359
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,243
I put everything in RealityCapture and hit align,

360
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,563
and I got a big blob.

361
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:09,505
So the problem is I didn't actually take a screenshot of

362
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,807
that blob, and when I tried to recreate this process just to

363
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,250
take a screenshot of it, I got good results.

364
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,095
OK, so I know each software actually improves with time,

365
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,958
and that will get me to one point, which is whatever I

366
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,580
mentioned right now was taken a year ago.

367
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,003
So you have to do your own research, because

368
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:26,764
they change a lot.

369
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,576
Okay, though there are still some errors,

370
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:32,037
like if you can check out the red areas over there,

371
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:34,018
you can notice that some walls

372
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,759
are magically appearing somehow.

373
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,522
And the way to fix it is you split it into components.

374
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,923
So RealityCapture has a nice feature

375
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:45,745
when you can align a group of photos,

376
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,426
create an element, and then align that element

377
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,067
to another element.

378
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,648
And that way you can see which photo is not working,

379
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,729
remove it, and reduce the error.

380
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,191
And of course you can save them in organization,

381
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,572
well, yeah, use a naming convention, not like I did.

382
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:05,694
Okay, so, and then whatever doesn't align,

383
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,275
you can always use some ground control point

384
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:07,895
and align them.

385
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:09,856
And you can end up with this,

386
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,757
and what's interesting about this is that,

387
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,097
see those points?

388
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,758
This is actually me standing there and taking a photo.

389
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:19,293
So that's around 4,000 photo.

390
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:19,934
That's nice.

391
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,861
OK, and this is the end result.

392
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,840
And then you create a Polycrunch version

393
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,840
and you put it in the game engine,

394
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,280
and now your gameplay programmer

395
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,461
can actually work on the gameplay,

396
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,841
while your artist can slowly start replacing the pieces

397
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,342
with more better looking one.

398
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,243
And if someone was taking notes during the presentation,

399
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,523
yeah, I'm sorry, I actually took notes for you

400
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,664
and I've written an article, so you can check it out.

401
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,725
It's called Scanning a Castle Inside Out with No Budget.

402
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,574
Okay, so how much will it cost you?

403
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,458
So if I want to scan a castle today,

404
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:55,542
probably I'm gonna need a drone, $1,000,

405
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,906
a camera, $300, camera accessories,

406
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:01,714
a PC, reality capture, and a Photoshop or DX optics.

407
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:04,746
and that will give you a total of 12K.

408
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,187
How much it cost me, 70 bucks.

409
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,968
And the thing is, I did not use a drone.

410
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,209
I borrowed a camera.

411
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,230
Camera accessory, I didn't actually buy all of them.

412
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,251
The PC, I actually won my laptop

413
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,432
and also huge shout out to Milos,

414
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,513
who actually volunteered to process the data for me

415
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,414
on his server, so I didn't actually have a processing server.

416
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,396
Reality Capture was in open beta when I tried it,

417
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,916
so I got it for free for commercial use

418
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,897
and the X-Optics, I used a trial.

419
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:29,957
So.

420
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,679
That's how we reduce the cost.

421
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,260
And it's about finding opportunities.

422
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:37,802
And how do you find opportunities?

423
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,603
Well, if you're at GDC, that's a good step.

424
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,085
You can also join the 3D scanning Facebook group,

425
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,005
ask questions over there.

426
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,227
Go to events, make friends.

427
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:47,828
And for example, if a software doesn't really

428
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,190
does it for you, you can just try to contact the developers

429
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,431
and try to work something out with them.

430
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,112
And always stay up to date.

431
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,894
Like for example, if you were following DXOptics,

432
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,675
you would know that they released the previous version

433
00:17:58,715 --> 00:17:59,896
for free for the next few days.

434
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:02,315
So that's useful.

435
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,058
And okay, great, you scanned the castle.

436
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:07,079
Now what?

437
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:10,402
And the thing with castles is that it's one billion polygons

438
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,384
so good luck finding a software that can open it.

439
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,626
So the first step is to probably take,

440
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,189
to polycrunch it to 15 million in RealityCapture

441
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,029
because like I mentioned,

442
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,511
you don't need that much resolution.

443
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,501
Second step, remove all the details.

444
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:27,043
It's really distracting and it's really tempting

445
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,804
to keep everything, but you have to remove it

446
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:31,585
because you're gonna become really overwhelmed really fast.

447
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,926
And then split the castle into pieces

448
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:36,887
and then create a schedule.

449
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,149
And for example, if let's just say you need three days

450
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:43,610
to create one piece, give it five days, just in case.

451
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,271
Otherwise, you're really gonna become overwhelmed.

452
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:51,340
Though you still end up with 2 million polygon piece

453
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,701
and you still have to work with it.

454
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:54,802
And I struggled a lot with that process

455
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:56,022
because I couldn't find a software

456
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,203
that can handle the huge amount.

457
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,224
And the thing is, you don't have to handle the huge amount.

458
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,966
The old method that we still use still work really well.

459
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,187
You just need to find a way to translate them

460
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:07,648
into the new polygon.

461
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,585
An example, for example, you want to UV a model

462
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,747
that's one million polygon, and probably 3D Max

463
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,608
from why I cannot open the software, ZBrush,

464
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:18,830
may or may not actually work, and the best way to do it

465
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,991
is just reduce it into a lower polygon, UV that,

466
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,792
and subdivide and reproject the details,

467
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,174
and that's actually gonna work really well,

468
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,955
because the small distortion are not really visible

469
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,437
in texture, so you can get away with it.

470
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:34,678
And speaking of old method, you can always block your model

471
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,459
and remove even more details, because

472
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:39,834
they are still distracting and you don't need any of those.

473
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:42,135
And this will help you actually figure out the volumes

474
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,296
and which pieces you want them to become modular.

475
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,177
And yeah.

476
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,679
So if this is your first time doing that,

477
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,580
I would highly recommend you perfect the process.

478
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,462
So imaginary topology can take up to two hours to finish.

479
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,582
Okay, so maybe invest a week or two,

480
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,584
but understand the process, perfect it,

481
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:01,448
because that's the only way you're gonna become better at it

482
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,491
and it's gonna become really fast in time.

483
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:05,213
So don't be perfectionist,

484
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,918
because no one's gonna notice, basically.

485
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:09,258
That's it.

486
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,760
Okay, also invest in your textures.

487
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,140
So my castle is made out of rocks.

488
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,662
So if I spend one month creating this really nice

489
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:19,043
procedural generated shader of rocks,

490
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,725
then that's great, it's okay, I can budget that.

491
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,707
And if you're interested about the process of doing that,

492
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,648
there's also another article you can check out

493
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:31,029
and it's called The Workflow of Creating Game-Ready Textures

494
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,250
and Assets Using Photogrammetry.

495
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,491
Okay, so once you become really comfortable

496
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,613
with that workflow, you can actually do

497
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,455
some interesting stuff, like take this European statue,

498
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,596
separate the properties of the statue

499
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:44,897
from the properties of the material,

500
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:46,918
and then do some transmutation work

501
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,640
and get a Middle Eastern statue.

502
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,222
And if you're interested in knowing how I did that,

503
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,044
I actually wrote an article, but it's not posted yet,

504
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,265
so you have to follow me basically in order to get it.

505
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:57,246
Sorry.

506
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,888
Okay, and here's a long list of free softwares

507
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:01,469
that you can check out.

508
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:05,553
And my advice is basically just do it

509
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,894
because it took me around six months to scan the castle.

510
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:10,095
Now in my defense, I had to learn everything from scratch,

511
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,516
but I could probably have done it sooner

512
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:14,557
if I just went out and do it from the first place.

513
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:19,672
And if you ever actually scan a castle or do something else,

514
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,814
remember to take some time to go back to the community

515
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,815
and thank them because probably someone helped you.

516
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,277
And speaking of that, a big shout out to my mentor, Nada,

517
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,299
the two industry veterans, Milos and Jeffrey,

518
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,060
our archeologist, Hassan,

519
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,142
and my aunt who let me borrow her camera, Samia.

520
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,423
I will also recommend that you join

521
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,084
the 3D scanning Facebook group,

522
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,306
and a special shout out to the American University of Beirut

523
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:44,648
who sent me to Austria to see a 3D scanning conference.

524
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,836
So if you have any questions, you can catch me

525
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,137
in the wrap-up room after the talk

526
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,037
in the North Slower Lobby by the elevators.

527
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:53,958
You can check out all the articles by going to my website,

528
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,819
Wordvoid, and checking out the devlog section.

529
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:57,599
If you have any questions, you can post them

530
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:00,680
underneath the blog post, and you can just ask me

531
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,540
on Twitter directly, and I'll be more than happy

532
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,281
to guide you and set you on the right path.

533
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,822
Okay, so yeah, I'm done.

534
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:09,282
Thank you.

535
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,470
So any questions?

536
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:28,257
So for your retopologizing, are you using Topagon

537
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,298
or what program?

538
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,459
Okay, so I'm actually using three softwares

539
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,261
because apparently when you have 3D scanning,

540
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,342
you're still gonna find a mesh that has some issues.

541
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,123
So sometimes I use Remake.

542
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:42,726
I polycrunch the model, or sometimes I use 3D Max

543
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:43,946
and I also polycrunch the model.

544
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,507
I also use instant meshes sometimes,

545
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,667
and I will also polycrunch the model

546
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:50,848
and do some retopology and generate a quad mesh,

547
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:52,288
and apparently it's four.

548
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:54,289
And I use also ZBrush sometimes,

549
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,870
and ZBrush has two process, Dynamesh and the ZRemesher.

550
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,750
ZRemesher, yeah.

551
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,491
Right, so for ZRemesher, you can just do some retopology,

552
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,431
but it's gonna become a really low-resolution model.

553
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:05,891
Then you have to subdivide it,

554
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,252
and then reproject the details

555
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,332
from the high-resolution model,

556
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:09,312
and that's how you get it.

557
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:10,776
All right, cool.

558
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,626
Oh, and also feel free to use a combination.

559
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:15,352
OK.

560
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:23,780
I just wanted to say, if you don't have anyone you can borrow cameras and lenses from, there are

561
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,641
plenty of places on the internet that will rent high-end cameras for fairly cheap on the order

562
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:32,162
of like tens to $100 a day. So if you need drones and cameras, that might be an option as well.

563
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,923
Right. My aunt had a camera, so I was like, hey, can I borrow your camera?

564
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,824
Just saying, if you don't have an aunt, you know.

565
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:43,885
Okay, cool. Any more questions?

566
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,104
Okay, great. Okay, just don't forget to fill out the reviews after the talk, and I hope you enjoyed everything. Thank you.
