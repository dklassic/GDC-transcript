00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:08,273
Without further ado, welcome to Beyond Game Design.

2
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,534
So my name is Richard Carrillo,

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:11,495
I'm a game director at Ubisoft Toronto,

4
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:13,536
and today I'll be discussing what I consider

5
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:16,698
to be one of the greatest challenges in this profession.

6
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,179
And that challenge is working

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,580
with the other developers around us,

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,043
passionate developers who will analyze every design,

9
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:25,643
they will pitch alternate solutions,

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,545
they will question every direction.

11
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:29,866
And for designers, this can lead to a lot of frustrations.

12
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,547
And I want to do this talk

13
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:37,092
Because a lot of times I've seen those frustrations become bigger conflicts on the team

14
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:42,257
So how can we as designers embrace that passion that they have and channel it to make the best game possible?

15
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:44,839
Instead of fighting against it and that's what I'll be talking about today

16
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:51,606
This talk looks beyond the hard skills beyond game design to explore the soft skills that I believe every designer needs in order to build

17
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,428
A positive design culture on the team

18
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:55,710
so but first

19
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,259
I've been in the industry for 14 years.

20
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,819
In that time, I've been lucky to be a part

21
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,680
of five major different studios.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,681
Each studio was filled with honestly amazing

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,561
and talented people, and each had

24
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,942
a completely different design culture.

25
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,803
And what I mean by design culture is

26
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,684
they all have different ideas on what designers should own,

27
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:15,265
the design process to get approvals,

28
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,146
and also who should be a part of that process.

29
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,166
So all of these experiences have helped me

30
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,128
to really solidify the design culture I promote on my teams,

31
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:23,608
and that's what I wanna kinda show you today.

32
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,930
Also, in these 14 years, I've been really lucky to be a part of some amazing projects.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,756
I've learned so much from these teams, and especially the latest we've shipped at Ubisoft

34
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,298
Toronto, Starlink Battle for Atlas.

35
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:38,120
And I want to talk a little bit about that game,

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,560
just because I do take some examples

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,622
from that development process and put in this presentation.

38
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:44,543
So I want to make sure you guys have a good idea

39
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,143
of what that game is.

40
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,364
So Starlink is an open-world action-adventure game

41
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:50,645
set in the massive star system called Atlas.

42
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,386
In this game, you'll be battling against

43
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,887
an ever-growing enemy threat called the Forgotten Legion,

44
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,028
who are taking over each planet.

45
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:58,489
So in short, it's a vehicular third-person shooter

46
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,550
with a simulated enemy invasion

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,211
that spreads across the star system in real time.

48
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,452
And I'm not sure if that cleared things up,

49
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:04,972
but I hope it did.

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,362
So for now, back to the soft skills.

51
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:08,902
Oh, went too far.

52
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:12,066
So the main question for today is how do we build

53
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,108
a positive design culture in our teams?

54
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:15,689
And before we can really understand that,

55
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,491
we need to understand all the day-to-day interactions

56
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:19,233
that are maybe problematic that lead us

57
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,394
to a negative design culture.

58
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,796
And hopefully I can convince you

59
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:22,877
that that's not what we want.

60
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:26,202
I call these problems negative mindsets.

61
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,563
So negative mindsets are the interactions we have

62
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:31,544
with developers around us that sort of push them away.

63
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,264
And I think it's safe to say that almost everyone

64
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,424
in this room is guilty of these

65
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:35,285
at some point in their career.

66
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:38,265
And I'll go through some of the most common examples,

67
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,046
and if you leave this talk with anything,

68
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:41,266
I hope it's that you catch yourself

69
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,547
whenever you say some of these or even think them.

70
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:45,867
The first one.

71
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,228
I'm the designer, let me do my job.

72
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,417
So this is honestly one of the biggest examples

73
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,738
that quickly builds that divide in the team.

74
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,720
This is my job over here, that's yours over there,

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,101
you stay over there, I got this.

76
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,562
I've even interviewed a designer once

77
00:02:58,562 --> 00:02:59,803
who used this as their reasoning

78
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,144
for wanting to leave their current position

79
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,165
at their current studio.

80
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,286
They felt that every time they pitched a design,

81
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:06,127
other people on the team would give feedback

82
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:08,169
and say certain things and pitch other designs.

83
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,130
And I'm thinking, yeah, the nerve of those people,

84
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,111
you know, wanting to have an input on their project.

85
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,472
So when you have this mindset,

86
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,813
what you're really telling the person is,

87
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,174
what you're saying doesn't matter.

88
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,935
Only what I say matters, I'm the designer.

89
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,977
And it coincides nicely with our second one, I know best.

90
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,439
Now this one's usually thrown around

91
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,980
when the designer can't convince the other person

92
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,541
of their point.

93
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,842
But this is also something a parent says to their child.

94
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,324
And just when the child grows up,

95
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:35,345
they realize the parent's just been

96
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,805
winging it the entire time.

97
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,386
So just like with a parent, when you say this,

98
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,028
what you're really saying is, I know best, you know nothing.

99
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,762
You haven't really seen fireworks until you witness a junior designer say this to a 20-year

100
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,669
vet engineer.

101
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,692
That's an exciting time.

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,641
Give me feedback, not designs or solutions.

103
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,001
I've seen this one posted on social media

104
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,902
as this positive message, and to me it made me cringe a bit.

105
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,442
The issue here is more subtle.

106
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,223
The designer doesn't want the person to add to the design.

107
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,903
They want feedback on the experience they just played.

108
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,604
They wanna know how it felt for them.

109
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:09,244
But in reality, everything that person is saying is feedback.

110
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:11,885
It's just not easy for people to really find the problem

111
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,225
and tell you about it, so sometimes

112
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:15,406
they jump straight to solutions.

113
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,706
So what the designer is telling them is,

114
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,506
tell me what I wanna hear the way I wanna hear it.

115
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,056
and they're not really trained sometimes

116
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:22,956
to talk in our language,

117
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,317
and this statement may push them away

118
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,498
to not give feedback in the future.

119
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,880
This is the design we approved.

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,721
So this one's usually said when someone gives feedback

121
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,982
to an already approved design,

122
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,683
and we as designers just don't wanna open that can of worms,

123
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,285
we just got that design finalized maybe months ago,

124
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,286
or we just want production to keep moving forward.

125
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,447
But what it's really saying is,

126
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,929
I don't wanna listen to you or reflect on feedback.

127
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,782
It's saying that nothing has changed, that we as a team have learned nothing since the

128
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:51,744
design was first written, we haven't seen the game progress, we don't have a deeper

129
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:55,127
understanding of what the game is, that we can't look at an approved design and question

130
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,748
its purpose in the grand scheme.

131
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:57,729
And we all know that's never true.

132
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,859
And finally, an old favorite, trust me.

133
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:03,359
Just trust me.

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,581
And the developer's of course thinking, trust you.

135
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,422
Like seriously, why don't you trust me?

136
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,824
Because you're the designer, you know best.

137
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:10,884
My feedback doesn't matter

138
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:14,126
because we already approved this design a while ago.

139
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,308
I'm not gonna stay late when this all blows up.

140
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,569
And there it is, that divide you kinda see

141
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,850
in your day-to-day throughout the team.

142
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,251
And I've seen this happen a lot.

143
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,961
I've even seen developers storm out of the building

144
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,543
because they're not being listened to,

145
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,044
shouting matches on the floor,

146
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,466
and worst of all, I've seen what can happen

147
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,087
to an entire team that no longer believes

148
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,508
in the game they're building.

149
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:33,971
These mindsets lead to a destructive,

150
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,652
I'm the designer, do what I say, culture.

151
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,335
And as I went through these examples,

152
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:39,736
I know some of you were thinking,

153
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:40,757
crap, I said that last week.

154
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,939
We've all been guilty of these,

155
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,842
and honestly, I believe it stems from our biggest insecurity.

156
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,003
Stop trying to do my job.

157
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:50,043
As designers, we have chosen a profession

158
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,263
that everyone wants to be a part of.

159
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,984
And after all, everyone has ideas.

160
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,365
But we also have this fear that if we don't have control

161
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,386
and maintain control, that people on the team

162
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,347
are just gonna be pitching ideas that don't work,

163
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:01,447
don't fit our systems, they aren't what we're looking for,

164
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:02,928
they're not coming together, they don't make sense,

165
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,409
just give me some time, just let me design this,

166
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,309
stop trying to do my job.

167
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,590
Maybe that sounds familiar to some of you.

168
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,571
But what is our job?

169
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,690
Our job is to design perfect game loops, mechanics,

170
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,792
and systems that engage our players and keep them hooked.

171
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,494
And we do that, and they look great.

172
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,555
Now, I know some of you are looking at this like,

173
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:21,156
what game is that from?

174
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,259
This is a filtration system to a swimming pool.

175
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,901
Sort of just a metaphor.

176
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,202
So we put this system into the game,

177
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,684
and we connect it to all the other systems.

178
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:33,087
But we can't do this section because the technical hurdle

179
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,028
is too high, and the directors changed their mind

180
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,751
on this piece, and we have some messaging issues here,

181
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,632
and playtests came back with some frustrations here.

182
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,349
and afterwards your perfect system

183
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,450
sort of looks like a chewed up dog toy.

184
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,152
But it's honestly the team that comes to the rescue.

185
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,313
This idea of stop trying to do my job

186
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:52,555
quickly becomes hey guys, can you help me fix this?

187
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,516
The UI team finds a solution for this piece,

188
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:56,217
the gameplay team reroutes this section,

189
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:58,758
and the art team pitches a cheaper solution to this.

190
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,814
In the end, game design always becomes a team effort.

191
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,574
Designers, we need to ditch that insecurity,

192
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,195
we need to let the rest of the team in,

193
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:07,235
and we need to learn to lead.

194
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,356
Because the best teams I've worked with

195
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,177
are ones where everyone feels engaged

196
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,017
and invested in the experience they're making.

197
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,358
Now of course, I'm not saying everyone

198
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:15,298
should design their own sections.

199
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,439
Everything still needs to come together

200
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,339
in a cohesive vision.

201
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,500
And for designers, sharing that vision

202
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,561
leads us to our first soft skill

203
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,921
for building a positive design culture.

204
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,602
The ability to inspire.

205
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,489
Now most designers know how to communicate their vision,

206
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,991
but few know how to inspire with it.

207
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,094
Communication ends with people understanding design,

208
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:35,655
inspiration ends with them believing in it.

209
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,757
The time of I'm the designer, do what I say,

210
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,478
that's long gone.

211
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,301
Developers are gonna devote the next three to five years

212
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,062
of their career on your designs,

213
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,983
they need to believe in them.

214
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,525
And if they don't believe,

215
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:47,186
honestly they'll never stop questioning.

216
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:50,330
But getting them to believe isn't as hard as you think.

217
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,236
It all starts with the design goals of the feature,

218
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:57,299
the problems you're trying to solve with the design itself.

219
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,141
And for a quick example, I'm gonna turn to the war meter

220
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:00,262
for Starlink Battle for Atlas.

221
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:06,848
This vertical meter on the right displays the current state of the conflict on the planet.

222
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:10,069
It shows who owns more ground, your alliance or the legion enemy.

223
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,530
The goals of this feature are listed in priority order.

224
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,012
To display the status of the planetary conflict, to give more meaning to the player's action

225
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,934
by showing the impact they're having on the world, and to push that feeling of the enemy

226
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,255
as an oppressive and dominating force.

227
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:26,936
The perfect goals are things everybody wants and nobody could say no to.

228
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,437
These goals should drive everything,

229
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:31,638
all discussion, all design, all brainstorms,

230
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,718
and later on I'll show you how they end up

231
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:36,919
resolving most disagreements.

232
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,719
So before you even start designing,

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,100
create a set of two to three goals

234
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,560
and pitch a few of them to your peers.

235
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Use their help to strengthen these goals.

236
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,881
Get them excited about these goals.

237
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,261
If people don't believe in your goals,

238
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,962
they're honestly not gonna believe in your design.

239
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,382
With this process, you're not only gaining believers,

240
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:51,742
you're actually gaining advocates.

241
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,203
These advocates will resolve smaller issues

242
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:55,723
across the team that you don't even realize are there.

243
00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:59,735
And step two to inspiring the team,

244
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,175
sell the goals then to the people

245
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,936
that will implement the feature.

246
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,557
And with their input, build design that achieves those goals.

247
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,199
The design isn't finished until they fully believe in it.

248
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,399
Now I know some of you are worried

249
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,220
that this process feels a bit time intensive,

250
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,561
but honestly the time spent building a design with the devs

251
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,142
will save you in the long run at the end

252
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:17,743
when you're trying to clean up that mess of pipes

253
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:18,223
I showed you earlier.

254
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,163
And step three, pitch all of it to the team.

255
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,712
As always, you're going to start with the goals,

256
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,554
because the team believes in the goals,

257
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,355
and your design accomplishes the goals,

258
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:31,316
then they'll believe in your design.

259
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:33,057
And later on during the production,

260
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,918
maybe a person's going to come up to you and say,

261
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:35,839
hey, why are we doing this?

262
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,320
This design, I don't understand it.

263
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,900
What's the point of it?

264
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,922
And the answer is pretty simple.

265
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:42,563
It's because we agreed on this goal,

266
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:45,025
and that design accomplishes that goal.

267
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,446
Do you still believe in that goal?

268
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,948
That question will honestly resolve most questions

269
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:49,608
you get through development.

270
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,815
So to recap, every time we say, I'm the designer,

271
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,776
let me do my job, or I know best,

272
00:09:56,776 --> 00:10:00,498
we are failing to inspire and we're pushing the team away.

273
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:03,179
It's our job to rally the team around a solid design.

274
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm the designer, let me do my job becomes,

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,801
it's my job to own the vision

276
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,782
and empower the team to own the game.

277
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:09,962
Own the goals and build the design

278
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:12,183
with the insights from the developers.

279
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:16,005
Teams have the best results when everyone feels invested.

280
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,046
Oh, there's the information.

281
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,975
So this feedback process becomes one of the most important

282
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,696
during production, and to do that successfully,

283
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,078
you're gonna need your second skill.

284
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,279
Sorry, I think I skipped one.

285
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,460
So I Know Best becomes, if you don't believe, that's on me.

286
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,401
This is a subjective industry where millions of ideas

287
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,723
could work, and they need to believe in your goals.

288
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:39,984
Throughout production, developers will give you feedback

289
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:41,225
and challenge the design.

290
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,086
Just continue referring to the goals.

291
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:44,327
Make sure they still believe in them.

292
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,528
And if those goals need to change,

293
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:47,589
make sure everything changes

294
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,450
and the entire team still is on board.

295
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,858
So that feedback process I talked about earlier

296
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:54,959
is extremely important.

297
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,260
And the next skill, patience and understanding.

298
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,241
I know it sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon,

299
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,122
but it is extremely important as well.

300
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:04,483
So everyday people on the team are gonna be pitching you

301
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:07,165
tons of ideas, the problems they see in the game,

302
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:07,945
things they wanna do better.

303
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:10,606
It's gonna feel like everyone's trying to do your job,

304
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:11,887
but it's actually your job to listen.

305
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,728
These people are coming to you

306
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,249
because the design isn't perfect.

307
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:21,253
Something is missing and sometimes the only way they know how to communicate that is by coming up with solutions.

308
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:25,257
So there's going to be times when people are going to pitch you something that may sound completely out there.

309
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:29,900
But we need to look past their solution and look at the core issue you're trying to solve.

310
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,722
What goal are they trying to add? What they feel is missing?

311
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:36,425
So this example I've used previously, I want a gun that kills everything in one shot.

312
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,908
The first time I heard this, I couldn't get past how unbalanced it all sounded.

313
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:44,112
But after conversation, what they were really saying was, I want to feel powerful.

314
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,897
The solution, a powerful weapon that takes skill to use

315
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:51,198
and is punishing when you miss.

316
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,478
And another example, in the early development of Starlink,

317
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,899
one of the engineers surprised me with,

318
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,000
this game is pointless.

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
That's a really harsh statement, it was a little hurtful,

320
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,561
but it wasn't an attack.

321
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:03,901
Something was wrong and it's my job to get to the bottom

322
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:04,802
of what they're trying to say.

323
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,242
So I took this developer to lunch,

324
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,963
and after about 10 minutes of listening to them sort of rage,

325
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,084
I understood what their feedback actually was.

326
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,984
I don't feel like my actions are having an impact

327
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:14,525
on the world.

328
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,912
So this was something I could actually use.

329
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:19,433
And this conversation is actually what led

330
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,395
to that war effort meter I talked about earlier.

331
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,797
As the player completes major actions on a planet,

332
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:25,059
the meter shows them how the action

333
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,320
has changed the state of the world.

334
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,943
So to get to the real feedback,

335
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,625
you need to sit with a developer

336
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,966
and have a deeper conversation.

337
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,228
Step one, get to the root of their concerns

338
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,109
by asking questions.

339
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,911
If they pitch a solution,

340
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,432
ask them why they believe that solution works.

341
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,175
And then two, reiterate the issue.

342
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,016
The biggest miscommunication in game design

343
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,877
happens when two people are solving different problems.

344
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,998
So this will ensure that you're on the same page.

345
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:51,459
Also, this may be the first time

346
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,980
you've ever even heard the problem out loud

347
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,801
so you'll sound really cool.

348
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,202
And three, resolution.

349
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,544
Work with them to find a solution to their problem.

350
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:01,885
And the solution may be something that's already designed,

351
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:04,287
and if that's the case, just explain that to them.

352
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,587
But still make sure that they believe

353
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,348
that solves their concern.

354
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,740
And now you've figured out what they really want,

355
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,581
but should you incorporate it?

356
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,821
There's only one question left to ask.

357
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,622
Does it align with your goals?

358
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:16,402
If so, awesome.

359
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:19,243
If it doesn't and those goals are still valid,

360
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,024
then it's actually pretty simple

361
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,324
to explain why you shouldn't do it.

362
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:28,175
Now, before I came to GDC, I gave this presentation to a few colleagues, and I got some pretty

363
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,817
similar feedback, which was, Richard, this looks great.

364
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:31,698
I love the message.

365
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:32,878
This list is nice.

366
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,920
It's very in a perfect world.

367
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,263
So what happens when the person is being so difficult that you can't really talk to them?

368
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:40,544
And I responded, oh, it's the same thing.

369
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,405
Just follow these steps.

370
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:41,965
No, no, no, no, Richard.

371
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,866
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

372
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,768
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

373
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:51,953
What if this person see is built so many walls around them,

374
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,594
so closed off, they don't want to hear your ideas.

375
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:55,594
If it's not their ideas,

376
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,494
they'll let the whole thing burn down.

377
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,015
So, all right.

378
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:02,876
Think about that passion the person has

379
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,677
that's kind of going against you right now.

380
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,337
Now, turn that around

381
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:08,838
and think about that passion going with you.

382
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,678
Think about all the things you could do together

383
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:11,658
and how amazing it could be.

384
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:13,569
If you're gonna build great games,

385
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:14,729
you need to surround yourself

386
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,590
with passionate and awesome people.

387
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,131
So you can't be surprised when sometimes

388
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,892
that passion sort of goes down a different path

389
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,992
and starts butting against you.

390
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,533
These people aren't the problem,

391
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,093
they're actually the solution.

392
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,234
The main question is how do you

393
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,595
turn this person into an advocate?

394
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,876
If they're an advocate, they'll not only work hard,

395
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:32,097
but they'll spread that advocacy across the team.

396
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,918
And the larger the team, the more you're gonna need people

397
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,539
to drive that vision when you're not around.

398
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,608
To turn this person an advocate, it's easy.

399
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:40,909
You just listen.

400
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,670
No one is so closed off that they're not gonna

401
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,771
tell you about their ideas.

402
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,192
Everyone wants to talk about their ideas.

403
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,493
So all you have to do is say,

404
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:47,514
hey, you want to grab some lunch?

405
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:48,514
I want to hear more about your ideas.

406
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:53,338
And they'll go, ah, okay.

407
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,059
And the goal with this lunch is just to listen.

408
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,161
Let them talk, let them pitch you their design.

409
00:14:58,392 --> 00:15:00,093
And of course, the longer they've been thinking about it,

410
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,153
the bigger it will seem.

411
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:03,274
It'll just keep growing and growing and growing

412
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,174
to the point where it feels like

413
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:05,255
its own three-year project.

414
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:07,596
And if you listen long enough, you're gonna see it.

415
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,857
At the center of all this,

416
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,358
one major goal that brings everything together,

417
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,499
one huge piece that gets them the most excited.

418
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,039
I wanna feel powerful.

419
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,200
I want my actions to have a meaningful impact.

420
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,841
I know I used those examples earlier

421
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:21,681
and it made it seem kind of easy.

422
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,182
Those weren't easy conversations.

423
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,543
And when you repeat that goal back to them,

424
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:26,463
you'll gain their trust.

425
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,546
Because you get it, you listened.

426
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,927
And everything else will just fade away.

427
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:33,448
And now all you need to do is focus on that goal.

428
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:39,070
At this point, you're left with three scenarios.

429
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,171
Scenario one, integrate it.

430
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,892
If that goal can't exist alongside yours,

431
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,753
and it'll make the game that much better,

432
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,073
there's no reason not to put it on the list.

433
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:50,135
Scenario two, it may be that it already exists

434
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:52,256
as part of your design, but nobody can really feel it.

435
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,417
So if that's the case, show them it's there,

436
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,777
and brainstorm ways to make it stronger.

437
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,457
And scenario three, what if it conflicts

438
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,438
with one of your goals?

439
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,579
This is honestly gonna be a tough conversation

440
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,440
because you need to figure out which goal

441
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,861
is better in the overall experience.

442
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,182
And the conversation isn't tough for them,

443
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:10,483
it's tough for you because you have to be open

444
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,944
to the idea that your goal isn't the best.

445
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:14,226
If you walk in there trying to win,

446
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,287
you'll get defensive and then they'll get defensive.

447
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,388
But the good thing is that their entire design

448
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:19,189
has faded away.

449
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:20,830
When you break things down to goals,

450
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,231
it takes most of the baggage away

451
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,391
and most of the emotion out of it.

452
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,392
No matter what happens at that point,

453
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:26,953
honestly you've already earned their respect.

454
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,195
So to recap, the more we shut down communication,

455
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:33,276
the more we alienate the team.

456
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,938
As designers, we need to be open

457
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,539
to all forms of communication.

458
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,061
It's our job to either convince them we're on the right path

459
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,382
or work with them to find a better one.

460
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,385
Give me feedback, not designs or solutions

461
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,566
becomes give me feedback, designs or solutions.

462
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,649
All communication can lead to the feedback we're looking for.

463
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,450
So make sure to talk it out

464
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,912
and make sure that the feedback is understood.

465
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:57,937
This is the design we approved becomes

466
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,338
what are your concerns with this design?

467
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,942
We all know that game development is complex,

468
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:04,302
so there's no point in shutting down

469
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:05,123
someone else's perspective,

470
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,983
because they may have seen something different.

471
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,864
The more you use this mindset,

472
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,845
the stronger your design will become.

473
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,686
But of course, what happens when you think

474
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,746
you resolve the conflict,

475
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,667
and that the same issue keeps coming up

476
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,387
over and over again across the team?

477
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,268
This takes us to our last soft skill

478
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:24,409
for building a positive design culture.

479
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,410
Trust and humility.

480
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,015
You now have a vision the team is behind,

481
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,116
and you know how to incorporate feedback.

482
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,236
You're building trust with the team,

483
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:33,556
but every game hits a wall at one point or another.

484
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:35,457
When a teammate's play starts to have major doubts,

485
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:38,357
it's not coming together fast enough, maybe it never will.

486
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,178
You believe staying the course is the best option,

487
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:46,819
and you just want the team to trust you.

488
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,780
But what is trust?

489
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,460
Trust isn't blindly following someone

490
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,801
because they have the title of game designer.

491
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:54,521
Sometimes we think it'd be easier that way,

492
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,802
but it usually leads to bad games.

493
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,055
To earn trust, you have to give it.

494
00:17:59,055 --> 00:17:59,895
Trust goes both ways.

495
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,737
You have to trust your team to own the experience

496
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:04,178
as much as they're gonna trust you to lead it.

497
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:07,420
Trust doesn't stop people from questioning design.

498
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,021
Because the moment they stop questioning

499
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,622
is the moment they stop caring about what they're building.

500
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,424
And trust is feeling safe.

501
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:17,505
It's an environment where everyone can speak freely

502
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:18,466
without restrictions.

503
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,127
Safe also means building relationships

504
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:21,147
where it's okay to be wrong.

505
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,029
The final issue is being able to tell when you're wrong.

506
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,290
And that's where humility comes in.

507
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:32,195
Humility plays a major role in knowing when to alter course.

508
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,636
As designers, honestly, we believe our design is perfect.

509
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,377
We've looked at all the possible outcomes.

510
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:37,678
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

511
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,538
Except for these few things, you know?

512
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,319
And then this one here,

513
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,640
and maybe, you know, maybe I should design that better.

514
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:45,704
Every designer is guilty of getting married to an idea,

515
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,965
of thinking the other developers just don't understand

516
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,545
because they're not seeing the whole picture.

517
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,606
The UI team is just focused on the smaller portion.

518
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:54,588
And a fair amount of the time that may be true

519
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,528
because it's our job to hold the entire vision

520
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,189
and how everything's gonna come together

521
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:00,450
whereas other teams are focused on specific sections.

522
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,812
But when do we stop trusting our vision

523
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,052
and start trusting the skeptics?

524
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:09,152
Let's take one last look at an example

525
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,893
from the war meter in Starlink.

526
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,194
The first feedback I received about this feature

527
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,415
came from a tester who was just very confused

528
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,816
as to how this was calculated.

529
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,737
The bar shows, and so I explained,

530
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,378
the bar shows who has control of the planet

531
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,199
and it's determined by the number of bases

532
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,820
you have versus the enemy.

533
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,941
Except these dueling bases are not built

534
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,401
on the same plots of land.

535
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,703
This was to allow these bases to exist all at once

536
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,443
so you get this epic war feeling on the planet.

537
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:38,177
So as the player gains allies, by building bases,

538
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,218
their meter's gonna fill up.

539
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,359
On the other end, you have the enemy called the Legion.

540
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,142
One of our goals, you might remember,

541
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,363
was for them to feel oppressive

542
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,324
and feel like this dominating force.

543
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:50,606
Their bar doesn't stop growing when it meets yours.

544
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,668
It engulfs it, just like they engulf the planet.

545
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:55,530
This overlapping section is owned by the Legion.

546
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,412
At this point, the only way to push your alliance higher

547
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:00,232
is to destroy their bases.

548
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,513
This gives you the room you need to expand your alliance.

549
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:04,934
After I explained this to the tester,

550
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,375
he understood, went on his way, everything seemed fine.

551
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,176
But then the second red flag came from an engineer

552
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,257
who repeated that concern, that confusion

553
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,677
about how the bar was calculated.

554
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:17,218
Again, I explained the goals, he understood,

555
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,799
and then the third strike came from a level designer.

556
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,000
At this point, I stopped selling the goals.

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,560
Something was wrong.

558
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,469
The overlap owned by the Legion was causing confusion and frustration.

559
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:30,671
There were a few solutions to this problem, but honestly the easiest one was to pull back

560
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:34,914
on my goal of the Legion feeling like an oppressive force and adjust how we calculate this meter.

561
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:39,778
We ended up making the meter average out between both factions, so there was a constant tug

562
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:40,158
of war.

563
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:44,741
Now the shipping product had a less dominating Legion, one that just engulfs you easily,

564
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,383
and in hindsight though, this was always the better option.

565
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,238
I use this as an example of how designers can get too entrenched in a goal or an idea.

566
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:56,561
We must have a process that forces us to stop and think differently.

567
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,202
And this one's mine.

568
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:00,584
Step one, defend the vision.

569
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:03,386
Every decision you've made up to this point has had a team behind it.

570
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:06,488
We've built great goals the team believes in.

571
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:10,532
We follow that up with the design we've built with the devs that achieves those goals.

572
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,938
Step two, listen to feedback with patience and understanding.

573
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:17,019
Get to the bottom of everything they're saying

574
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:17,880
and discuss solutions.

575
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,823
But the last issue arises when the solution

576
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:23,045
goes against your goals and you still strongly believe

577
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,847
in those goals, just in my previous war effort example.

578
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:30,172
And when three people on the team of different backgrounds

579
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,394
say the same thing, it's time to stop and reflect.

580
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:35,777
The exact number of strikes is gonna change for each team

581
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,999
and now that I've publicly announced mine is three,

582
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:38,940
I probably need to increase it.

583
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:43,463
But the point here is to have a limit when you stop defending your goals and start changing

584
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:44,223
your perspective.

585
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:47,264
And just let everyone know the reason it's not one is because you can't spend your entire

586
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:53,925
career rethinking everything every time someone brings something up.

587
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:57,446
So to recap, trust me becomes I trust you.

588
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,142
The purpose of building trust isn't so everyone leaves us alone.

589
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:03,964
The purpose is to build an environment where all team members can be heard,

590
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,266
because we trust each other to want what's best for the game.

591
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:09,668
And of course, when we falter, the others are going to be there

592
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,049
to get things, pick us back up.

593
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,951
Yes, more Saturday morning cartoon stuff.

594
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:15,112
And there you have it.

595
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:18,375
These are the soft skills I believe every designer needs

596
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,576
to create a positive design culture at a studio.

597
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:22,958
A culture where everyone feels invested in the game's success.

598
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,220
And these, of course, spark the soft skills.

599
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,866
of the designer mindsets that will dismantle all walls

600
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,667
between design and the rest of the team.

601
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,828
Our job is to ensure that every developer on a team

602
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,969
believes in each and every one of their tasks,

603
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,090
because they understand and believe in the goals

604
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,390
that that task will achieve.

605
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,451
They believe in the game that we're trying to make.

606
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:44,172
The best culture is one with team ownership,

607
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:45,753
a team-driven approval process,

608
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:47,013
and full team collaboration,

609
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:49,054
because the game doesn't belong to designers,

610
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:49,895
it belongs to the team.

611
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:53,486
So this is a design culture I promote on my teams,

612
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:56,212
and I strongly believe it can help resolve conflicts

613
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:57,795
and promote teamwork across the industry.

614
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,081
And I always like to lend with my contact info

615
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,382
so we can keep the conversation going.

616
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,604
If you have any thoughts or experiences you'd like to share,

617
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:08,766
feel free to hit me up.

618
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:09,967
I hope you enjoyed the talk.

619
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,990
Before I head out, remind you all to hit that review

620
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,653
that you'll get your Nemo for.

621
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,176
And I'll be doing a full Q&A tomorrow

622
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,457
at 11 a.m. at the UB lounge.

623
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:21,760
There I'll talk again about all three talks I've had

624
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,901
in the past four years.

625
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,570
Also, if you're interested in hearing more about Starlink,

626
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,171
that great game I showed you,

627
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,951
our lead engineer is gonna be giving a talk tomorrow

628
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,732
at 11.30 a.m. about giving the starship physics

629
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:34,672
and controls that feel real.

630
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:35,413
That's gonna be in room 2001.

631
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,533
And right now, I'm gonna be heading over

632
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,634
to the wrap-up room real quick,

633
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,874
so you guys can all join me there if you want,

634
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:42,155
if you wanna ask questions

635
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,715
and dive deeper into this kind of issue.

636
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,735
Thank you.
