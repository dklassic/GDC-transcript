1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:08,518
So thanks for coming, everyone, despite my incredibly

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:09,759
undescriptive title.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,220
I'm glad you could all come.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,282
So my name's Jamie, and I'm a game artist from New Zealand.

5
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:21,483
And I'm going to talk about my design work

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:22,883
on the UI of Mini Metro.

7
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,664
So I've been in the game.

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:31,991
development industry for over 15 years and I started out as a 3D artist and

9
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:36,593
Became a lead artist at a small medium-sized studio in New Zealand

10
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:42,175
And now I do more contract work and in between that I work on my own titles

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,384
So, Mini Metro.

12
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:47,106
First, I'll talk a bit about the experience

13
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,167
we were shooting for

14
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,889
and how this impacted on the UI content,

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,531
and then why we made certain decisions,

16
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,853
and then how we wrapped that content

17
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:59,395
into the package that you see today.

18
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:03,157
But first, I'll introduce the game

19
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,639
and how I came to work on it.

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,520
And for the uninitiated,

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,323
I'll just show a quick app preview video of the game.

22
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:48,490
Okay, so Mini Metro was the brainchild of Robert and Peter Curry.

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,132
They started development on the game back in 2013

24
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,737
for a Ludum Dare game jam,

25
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,162
and they made this brilliant little prototype,

26
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:02,164
and it showed a lot of promise,

27
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:05,607
so they kind of went off to develop the game further.

28
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,242
At that time, I was creating the game design and art

29
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,884
for a turn-based bar brawling game with bears

30
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:16,065
called Bear Knuckle.

31
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,127
But I was going through a lot of design problems

32
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,028
and hitting a few roadblocks,

33
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:26,090
so I was pretty receptive to any distractions.

34
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,972
So when I got this email, I was pretty excited to open it,

35
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,633
and it said, hey Jamie,

36
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,114
and I replied and said, hey Pete.

37
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,801
And it went on like this for quite some time.

38
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,782
And then eventually Pete said, hey,

39
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:47,044
do you know anyone who wants to work on the UI of Mini Metro?

40
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:49,005
I said, yep, I can do that.

41
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,745
It'll probably take about two weeks.

42
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:58,609
And then game development being game development,

43
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,729
things dragged on for quite some time.

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,151
And two years later, we end up here in this place.

45
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,635
So over that time, it's been a finalist for quite a few awards,

46
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:13,899
and it won excellence in audio at the IGFs in 2016

47
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:19,445
due to the brilliant work of Rich Vreeland and Pete.

48
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:22,388
And probably more importantly, it

49
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,330
was a finalist for excellence in art.

50
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,456
And then at the end of 2016, it was chosen

51
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,859
for the best of app store promotion.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,604
And so that was a great reward for a lot of hard work.

53
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:45,850
So over those two years, just to give you an idea

54
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,533
of the volume of visual iteration that went into the game,

55
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,275
I somehow managed to spit out over 4,000 images.

56
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:57,759
112 previews videos, and 12 gigs of data.

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,262
So in terms of sales, the game has shifted

58
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,184
800,000 units to date.

59
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:09,707
That's across all platforms, Steam, Mac,

60
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:12,369
and mobile, Android and iOS.

61
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,452
And so far it's grossed over three million US dollars,

62
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:22,155
and it has a 96% overwhelming positive Steam rating.

63
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:33,009
Okay, so those two weeks that turned into two years, how exactly did we get here?

64
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,613
You could probably say the design process looked a little bit like that image.

65
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:45,539
Invariably, the design process starts with understanding your subject matter, and in

66
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,762
this case, that's understanding a game that's halfway through development.

67
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,108
So it can be a bit of a shifting target.

68
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,848
But you can start with a simple question.

69
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,450
And that question is, what is the game about?

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,751
What is the experience exactly that you're designing for?

71
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,632
So you might come up with a list that

72
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:10,612
looks a little bit like this.

73
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:15,633
The game is about building efficient networks, minimalism,

74
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,114
score chasing, city planning.

75
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:25,366
But this list kind of feels a little bit surface level,

76
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,988
and it doesn't quite get to the root

77
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,250
of the nature of the game.

78
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,092
So if we dig a little bit deeper

79
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,035
and go back to the very original inspiration of the game,

80
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,437
which is the London tube map,

81
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:43,582
and if we go right back to the birth of the game,

82
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,605
to where the original inspiration came from,

83
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,362
As I understand it, that came from Rob standing in the London underground

84
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:55,464
trying to work out how to get from point A to point B.

85
00:05:56,804 --> 00:06:02,667
So you can say that the origins of the game is more in interpreting maps

86
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,989
and the core idea of the game is possibly more about observing,

87
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,231
reading those different shapes and lines and colours

88
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,812
and trying to work out how they all work together.

89
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,952
So maybe you could say the game is more about

90
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:27,555
observing, decoding, experimenting, discovery,

91
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,636
and by extension, learning.

92
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:43,064
So at this point, I should probably point out

93
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:46,025
that it's a lot easier to come up with a list in hindsight.

94
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,126
At the time.

95
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:53,586
I'm probably operating more on an intuitive understanding of the game.

96
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:56,768
And that was based on playing the prototype.

97
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,030
And, you know, kind of,

98
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,152
with the prototype it was extremely bare bones,

99
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:07,995
it was just some shapes, and you connect them and try and figure out how it all works yourself.

100
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:13,038
So that process, you know, was incredibly rewarding,

101
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,400
and that's the experience that...

102
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,524
which we tried to imbue in the game

103
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,325
through the UI design and the UX.

104
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:26,108
So how do we build a UI UX that encourages and supports this?

105
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,171
The UI content and the UI flow

106
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:32,872
can set the tone and expectation of the player.

107
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,394
And even by the things you choose to omit,

108
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:38,715
you can change this tone and experience that the player has.

109
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:42,338
So there's three main areas of the UI design

110
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,718
where I was particularly conscious

111
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:44,919
about setting the right tone.

112
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,726
The first one being the new user flow or the tutorial.

113
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:52,888
So this is a quick

114
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:58,051
time lapse of the new user flow.

115
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,473
So you can see this really strips back the game

116
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,794
to its very bare components

117
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:07,216
and only exposes the player to one thing at a time.

118
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,618
And so by breaking things down into components

119
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,840
and staging them very slowly.

120
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:18,176
you can teach incredibly complex things to players.

121
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,499
Some things to keep in mind with this approach

122
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,340
is that it does require a lot of testing,

123
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,221
and you need to get the pacing correct

124
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,861
for all sorts of different types of players.

125
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,722
And that's probably something we needed to do better

126
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:39,824
on Mini Metro in terms of pacing out how that tutorial went.

127
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:49,138
And don't necessarily feel the need to over-explain things to the player.

128
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,540
There's two reasons for that.

129
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:57,084
One, new players don't necessarily need to know everything about the game straight away.

130
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:03,488
And secondly, it leaves a door open for players to discover new features later on, on their

131
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:03,969
own accord.

132
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:09,412
And this is something we're actively trying to incentivise in the game, is that sense

133
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,934
of experimentation and discovery.

134
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,792
And the other thing is we didn't use any text.

135
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,913
So for a lot of people, this is frustrating.

136
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:26,315
And this was primarily motivated

137
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,616
by our desire for minimalism,

138
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,816
but it also serves another purpose

139
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:35,258
of encouraging players to observe the game symbols

140
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,519
and game visual language rather than reading.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,721
Often you can maybe think of this like a game of charades.

142
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,614
where if someone starts speaking

143
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,995
in the middle of the game of charades,

144
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,336
it kind of ruins the game.

145
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,817
It's more efficient and it's quicker and it's faster,

146
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:57,838
but it also just undercuts the whole game.

147
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,680
The next area is the in-game UI.

148
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,942
The best way I can explain my approach to the HUD

149
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,383
is with the idea of a toy train set.

150
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,763
So a toy train set is strongly entwined

151
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,026
with the idea of observing, experimenting, and discovery.

152
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:26,709
And it's a very consequence-free environment

153
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,590
where you just play around with tracks,

154
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,632
rebuild them, lay them out, pick trains up, put them down.

155
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:37,015
And that kind of explains our approach in Mini Metro,

156
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,056
where there's no...

157
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,319
In the default game mode, there's no penalty

158
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,882
for relaying out tracks and taking your time to do so.

159
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:49,204
You can pause time, relay out everything you like,

160
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:52,026
and just play around and experiment with the game.

161
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:59,431
So, one thing I was very conscious of

162
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,093
is to not build a shell over this game,

163
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:06,396
and to have a HUD which takes functionality

164
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,616
off the tracks itself.

165
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:13,433
And one thing that became obvious is that the HUD was most beautiful when it wasn't

166
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:13,933
there at all.

167
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:22,895
So for example, this is a really old HUD mock-up where we were toying with the idea of shifting

168
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,095
functions onto the HUD.

169
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:36,518
And here's a later mock-up for mobile, where you can see that the HUD expands and retracts

170
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:37,418
to stay out of the way.

171
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,681
So some other in-game UI things to keep in mind.

172
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,925
Where possible, simplify rules that are hard to communicate.

173
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,508
Initially, we had a lot of complicated rules in the game,

174
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,750
which were causing a lot of frustration,

175
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,212
and they were blinging up errors all over the place,

176
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,474
and a lot of people just could not understand them.

177
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,537
So rather than trying to design our way

178
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:07,678
out of the hole visually,

179
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,960
we can go back to the game design

180
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,881
and change the game design itself.

181
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,067
I'll show an example of that later on.

182
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:24,969
And one kind of idea to operate by with this sort of thing

183
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,710
is to be the world's worst magician.

184
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,131
Magicians operate on the idea of misdirection,

185
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,772
where they create a distraction and present a trick.

186
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,313
And that's the complete opposite approach

187
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,774
you need to take with displaying errors in game.

188
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,475
So, always...

189
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,356
be aware of where the player's attention is

190
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:48,838
and display your errors at that point.

191
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,403
And lastly, for the in-game visuals,

192
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,624
we were very, well, I was very conscious

193
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,987
to avoid adding in any extraneous visual rewards.

194
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,451
This could possibly be summarized

195
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,112
as the desert golf approach.

196
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,014
I absolutely love this game,

197
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,956
and it kind of became a bit of a touchstone during development.

198
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:17,558
So if anyone hasn't played it, this is a game where you can hit a hole in one and absolutely

199
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,358
nothing happens.

200
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,483
But at the same time, you still feel quite rewarded for having done so.

201
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,466
So that was a very similar approach to Mini Metro.

202
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,470
So this is...

203
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,320
Again, some early error approvers,

204
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,542
and you can see I've got, this is an incredibly bad idea,

205
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:43,544
I've got errors displaying in two different locations,

206
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:46,866
so obviously a person's attention can't be split

207
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,107
into two different areas.

208
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,571
And then this is another example where we change the errors

209
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:57,793
to occur at the point of mouse interaction.

210
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,447
so we know the person's already looking there

211
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:01,768
and it's going to come through.

212
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:06,192
And this is when we had the no line crossing rule in the game.

213
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,433
And that was an example of an error

214
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,337
that we took out of the game just to simplify communication.

215
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,362
The last area is UI flow.

216
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:25,548
So one thing we took out of the UI flow was the leaderboards.

217
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:31,007
The easiest way to explain this is that for us,

218
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:34,288
leaderboards were kind of an extrinsic motivator,

219
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:38,209
and we wanted to keep the motivations to the game

220
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,489
inside the game, or inside you, intrinsic to the game.

221
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,950
And the other thing is, we didn't want to hammer

222
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,091
new players with leaderboards,

223
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:55,172
and point out how poorly they were doing all the time.

224
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,581
And there's a lot of different reasons people play Mini Metro,

225
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,843
and it's not always to do with competition.

226
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:07,787
So we took the leaderboards and kind of reduced them

227
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,929
to a button, but we took it even further

228
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,312
and reduced it to a non-standard button for the UI.

229
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:16,754
So this is breaking our UI convention.

230
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:22,598
And then we kind of just nestled it, sort of hit it,

231
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,540
out of the main UI flow and the city select screen.

232
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:30,499
And so instead of showing leaderboards,

233
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,621
we show your personal bests.

234
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:40,106
So that's important for you to establish

235
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,687
whether your experimentation and progress in the game

236
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,869
is occurring, is to see how well you're doing.

237
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:53,234
And lastly, we avoided any metastructures to the game.

238
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:59,639
We avoid any of these structures that aren't intrinsic to the game,

239
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,700
like collectibles, unlockables, and any sort of currency.

240
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,741
We do have unlockable cities,

241
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:11,662
just to limit the player choice when they enter the game.

242
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:17,804
But even for some people, this can become a means to an end,

243
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,065
where they just play through the game,

244
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:21,505
unlocking all the cities,

245
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,026
and then when they've unlocked the cities, they call it quits.

246
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:28,029
So we try and avoid those sorts of situations.

247
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,011
So we've talked about some of the ideas

248
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:38,252
that gave form and structure to the UI.

249
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:40,953
Now I'll kind of talk a little bit

250
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:45,834
about how we gave it a look.

251
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:48,054
So I might go without saying that the game itself

252
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,275
is hugely inspired by Harry Beck,

253
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,635
the designer of the tube map.

254
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,575
And one of the challenges was bringing this to life.

255
00:16:56,876 --> 00:17:01,138
So there was a lot of previs to do with spawning stations,

256
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:01,978
how that might look.

257
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:08,000
This is a really bad idea of a station spawn.

258
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,002
Looks like it's giving birth.

259
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:11,082
But.

260
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:16,284
And that even went as far as designing

261
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,725
how the passengers overflow out of stations

262
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:19,965
and how they bounce around.

263
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:27,605
And then into kind of how the track handles layout

264
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:31,887
so that they're all accessible under dense conditions.

265
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:36,849
And then exploring station permutations

266
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,830
and how the corner radii nest together.

267
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,854
And then even stuff like platform switching

268
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:51,036
where each station has three platform inputs

269
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,016
from each angle.

270
00:17:56,213 --> 00:18:04,577
So when designing the front end, this particular book became a huge source of inspiration.

271
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:09,599
This is designed by Vignale and Bob Norder,

272
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:17,041
and these guys spent two years making an immaculate design document for the subway signage system in New York.

273
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:23,924
So, you know, this was a big inspiration and it's absolutely perfect.

274
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:29,050
almost perfect, but at the same time, it's kind of demoralizing looking at it, but

275
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:33,934
you know, they spent two years doing it, and if we tried to hit this kind of

276
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,815
perfection, it would take us probably four years.

277
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:44,901
So I took a lot of color samples from this, including the paper and the ink,

278
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,383
which comes through into the white and the blacks in the game.

279
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,275
and we adopted some of the kerning,

280
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,257
where the text is kind of shoved

281
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:59,423
into the top left corner of the boxes.

282
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:02,906
Yeah, and the way the signs are built

283
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:04,728
in a square and modular fashion,

284
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,531
so that comes through into the menu as well.

285
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,075
So you can kind of see the influence

286
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,037
coming through into the menu design there.

287
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:23,443
Another big aspect of the game were the arrows and transitions.

288
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:27,664
So anywhere where we have a transition in the game,

289
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:31,445
we have a big black arrow with the exception of the leaderboards,

290
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,225
which we were demoting.

291
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:42,608
So this is some early previs of the in-game transitions.

292
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,068
So a big...

293
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,544
A big design goal of the UI was to have no cuts in the game whatsoever,

294
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:56,228
so everything kind of freed slowly through from menu to game and back out.

295
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,635
And that included the game over screen

296
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,078
where it kind of transitions smoothly.

297
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,961
Well, that's the early one, which was a bit more rough,

298
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,402
but yeah, you get the idea.

299
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:15,963
and that is just showing a transition,

300
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,303
early, previous transition to in-game.

301
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,484
So, all of these are done using,

302
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,225
I did a lot of these in After Effects.

303
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,726
But I had to dig a little bit further

304
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,586
and look at things like subway maps,

305
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,407
which see their influence in the city select screen,

306
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,628
and even road signage imagery,

307
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,408
which is used around the in-game icons.

308
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,230
So, this is a bunch of...

309
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:47,510
previous for the city select screen,

310
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,132
where you can kind of see that influence come through.

311
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:53,214
And there's also a lot of,

312
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:59,038
a lot of the city screen is based on tube map line,

313
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,880
or line maps for subway systems.

314
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:10,346
So that's,

315
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,763
basically all I've got today,

316
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,784
but I'll just run through some takeaways

317
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,886
and then hopefully take some questions

318
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,027
if there are any questions.

319
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,909
So the Mini Metro takeaways would be

320
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,931
understand your game.

321
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,512
The design process starts with understanding

322
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,893
what you are designing for.

323
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,175
And this can be intuitive to you

324
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:33,856
or it can be explicit.

325
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:35,737
And if you're in a team,

326
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,919
a place to keep an open discussion going

327
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,340
throughout the project on the nature of your game.

328
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,572
Find ways to encourage and support this

329
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,132
through your UI content.

330
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:54,214
Be mindful of what your UI is emphasizing

331
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:55,434
to the player as important,

332
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,615
and omitting some things can become just as powerful

333
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:00,896
as what you choose to include.

334
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,557
Give people some credit.

335
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:08,478
Don't be too scared to let them figure things out

336
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:08,938
on their own.

337
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:12,994
You don't have to over-explain everything with text prompts.

338
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,994
And if you include enough visual cues

339
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,135
and introduce elements to people at the right pace,

340
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:23,336
they can learn incredibly complex game mechanics.

341
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:29,038
And then find your visual key and build a visual language

342
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,578
around using inspiration that means something to your game.

343
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:35,199
And if you can, make it relatable

344
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,520
so when people look at your game,

345
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,140
they immediately have a connection to it.

346
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,286
And then the last thing is iterate.

347
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:45,588
Iterate a lot.

348
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:48,630
Cool, that's all.

349
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,271
You can find me on Twitter,

350
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,233
or you can give me an email if you want,

351
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,393
if you have any questions.

352
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:56,175
Cool, thank you.

353
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:18,683
Cool.

354
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:21,104
Yeah.

355
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:24,846
Yeah.

356
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:24,926
Hi.

357
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:27,047
Oh, hi.

358
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:31,049
I have a question about your testing.

359
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:38,013
You were saying that you did a lot of player testing, and I was wondering what, you know,

360
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:42,675
where you found your players, how often you were testing, et cetera.

361
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:43,156
Yeah.

362
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:49,131
So the question is about how often we did testing and where we got our players to test from.

363
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:58,413
We did quite a few trade shows, so a lot of that was just on the spot watching how people play and

364
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:07,215
whether they can pick up the game at the right speed. And then you can also watch YouTubers

365
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:11,277
play the game for the very first time and see how they react to what they're playing.

366
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,314
and then there's also streamers.

367
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:16,239
But we didn't actually do too much in-house testing.

368
00:24:18,462 --> 00:24:18,682
Thanks.

369
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:26,701
Obviously MiniMetro has a very unorthodox minimalist UI,

370
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:31,685
and that's not generally what you see in iPhone games.

371
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,228
Even personally, when I do minimalist UIs,

372
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,030
people have an immediate assumption like,

373
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,994
oh, you need to add pictures, or you need to do something more polished,

374
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,836
or, you know, 3D-ish, or whatever.

375
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:46,298
How do you...

376
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,422
How'd you stick with the unorthodox UI?

377
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:52,623
Did you receive that kind of feedback?

378
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:56,166
And how did you overcome it or incorporate it?

379
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,168
Or did you tell them just go away?

380
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,131
So how did we stay on the path of minimalism?

381
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:05,872
Is that generally what you mean?

382
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:09,654
Yeah, in lieu of going with the standard iOS app look.

383
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,997
And there were times where we went too minimal

384
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:16,399
and we had some player revolt in the...

385
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:24,656
Steam early access forums, so we did cut back on going too minimal.

386
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:27,598
But, I don't know.

387
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,882
I don't know, there was a big, there was a lot of talk about adding more text into the game,

388
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:41,107
but because the game was built on minimalism, it was easy to discard it using that as an excuse.

389
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:46,210
Yeah, that's probably as good as I can answer. Thanks.

390
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:47,292
Thank you.

391
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,153
Cheers.

392
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:49,494
Hi.

393
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:53,736
What are your biggest influencers on minimalism?

394
00:25:56,118 --> 00:26:01,841
To be honest, one of my biggest influences on minimalism is probably what I showed you

395
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:05,843
in the presentation.

396
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:13,948
The New York City Transit Authority design manual was probably my biggest influence in

397
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:14,388
that regard.

398
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:22,350
But other than that, I really love minimalism, so I find it easy to just cut stuff out as much as possible.

399
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:24,531
Thank you.

400
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:30,934
One of the things I loved about Mini Metro is the sound design

401
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:33,414
and how cohesive the sound and animation is.

402
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:37,916
I was wondering if there was collaboration in that department

403
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,537
or is it more that the sound was done to match the animation?

404
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,491
Collaboration between the sound and the visuals.

405
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:46,172
Yeah.

406
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,894
A lot of that was handled by Pete, our programmer, and Rich Vreeland.

407
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:51,854
And...

408
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,636
So there was a large amount of collaboration there with changing...

409
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,758
...the timing of the game so that it matched up with...

410
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,500
...Rich's musical needs, if you catch what I mean.

411
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:07,481
Yeah.

412
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:08,921
Cool. Thank you very much.

413
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,483
That's probably the last one.

414
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:15,907
I see that the game is not free to play.

415
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:19,751
Can you expand a little more into what kind of decision?

416
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,514
Because I'm pretty sure you discussed about the possibility.

417
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,537
Yeah, so why wasn't the game free to play?

418
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,364
Yeah, we talked about that for months.

419
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,481
To make it free to play, we would have to gut the game too much,

420
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:43,163
because it came out on PC first as a premium title.

421
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:50,465
Yeah, so adding advertising into it was a big no-no,

422
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:52,686
because it would just destroy the look of the game.

423
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:00,029
Yeah, and adding in systems for rewards like currencies

424
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:02,550
just wasn't part of the philosophy of the game.

425
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:03,970
Yeah.

426
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,230
Thanks.

427
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:05,318
Thank you.

428
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,221
Cool.

429
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:07,084
Thanks, everyone.
