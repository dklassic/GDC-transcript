1
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:14,500
So we're just setting a couple of things up here. Before we begin, can I just get a bit of a show of hands?

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,501
Who here has played this version of Killer Instinct?

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,422
Yep, cool. Oh, that's awesome.

4
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:23,944
Who's played the original Killer Instinct? Maybe back in the day in the 90s. Whoa.

5
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,244
Expectations.

6
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:28,466
Who here has never played a fighting game whatsoever?

7
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,646
Oh, not one? Really? Nobody?

8
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:31,727
Have you played a fighting game before?

9
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:35,068
Wow, nobody's lying. Nobody's never played a fighting game before.

10
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:44,365
Well, that's awesome. I need to do an introduction then. That's absolutely fantastic.

11
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:48,847
Thank you so much.

12
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:49,647
Alrighty.

13
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:52,747
So, ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,068
do you remember

15
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:54,248
the 90s?

16
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:57,109
Take a seat, Jed.

17
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:57,489
Yeah?

18
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,469
Do you remember this guy?

19
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,170
What about this girl?

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,590
This guy?

21
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:11,764
Of course. Do you remember the video game arcade?

22
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:18,926
Yeah? Or what I like to call the scene of the first loudness war.

23
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:23,627
No kidding, I mean, as a sound designer back in the day working on arcade games,

24
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:27,228
it was your job to make as much noise as possible,

25
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:31,409
because you had to lure any punter who was close and within earshot

26
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,870
over to your machine because they had a shiny little quarter in their pocket.

27
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,927
And that was the goal, to try and bring people over.

28
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,028
And Killer Instinct was one of these loud games.

29
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,649
I mean, most of you played it before, you'll know.

30
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:47,392
Now, Killer Instinct was developed by Rareware in the UK.

31
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:49,233
They're still going today.

32
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:55,077
But between 91 and 2006, Rare released some of the most iconic video games

33
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:56,637
of all time.

34
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,478
An incredible effort for any studio.

35
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,504
Now, Rare used revolutionary CGI technology

36
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:08,085
to make Killer Instinct look really, really good.

37
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,785
Back in the day, back in the 90s,

38
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:12,786
magazines described these visuals as movie-like.

39
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:13,246
Yeah?

40
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:19,568
Now, not only did Killer Instinct look really good,

41
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:21,568
but Killer Instinct sounded really good.

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,149
The two sound guys back in Rare, back in the day,

43
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,810
were Robin Beanland and Graham Norgate.

44
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:32,443
Now, their approach was to make killer instincts sound like something you would hear on the TV or in a movie.

45
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:32,583
Ready?

46
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:32,683
Yeah!

47
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:32,803
Ready?

48
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:32,963
Yeah!

49
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:33,183
Ready?

50
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:33,403
Yeah!

51
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:33,884
Ready?

52
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:33,984
Yeah!

53
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:34,084
Ready?

54
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:34,224
Yeah!

55
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:34,364
Ready?

56
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:34,504
Yeah!

57
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:34,624
Ready?

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:34,884
Yeah!

59
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:35,344
Ready?

60
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:35,865
Yeah!

61
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:36,785
Ready?

62
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:44,970
Yeah!

63
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,310
Ready?

64
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,693
Yeah!

65
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:57,477
Now, this modern sound, which was modern at the time,

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,560
really helped to lure those punters over with the shiny quarter in their pocket.

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,502
The arcade machine, it shook with the noises of the punches and kicks,

68
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,822
and it shook with the sound of this guy.

69
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:12,542
Rule breaker.

70
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:18,683
Maybe you guys heard that one this morning, yeah?

71
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,544
So anyway, in 2012, late 2012,

72
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:25,204
Microsoft brought us on to develop a new killer instinct

73
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,465
as a launch title for the Xbox One.

74
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:31,518
Now after a 17 year hiatus and a huge fan base,

75
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:34,360
it was clear that we had a bit of a challenge

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
ahead of us, right?

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,103
So how do you modernize the sound

78
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:42,605
of a classic 90s fighting game?

79
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,127
So we think that,

80
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:55,833
so we think that car design is fascinating.

81
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:05,693
It's fascinating because every year, they come up with a new model.

82
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,813
Something fresh, something unique, something new.

83
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,714
You want to buy that car on the right.

84
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:13,194
It's always different every year.

85
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:19,675
But it retains the essence of the brand and of the BMW M3 that we have here.

86
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:23,516
So imagine the Ki1 was the car on the left.

87
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,037
And when Microsoft approached us...

88
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,189
and ask us to bring back, to revive Killer Instinct in 2013,

89
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,611
we had to imagine the car on the right.

90
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:38,036
And to do so, we thought that one of the first things

91
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:44,782
that we had to update, to modernize, was the announcer.

92
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:49,165
So Chris Sutherland, who was the producer on Killer Instinct,

93
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,468
gave his voice to the announcer.

94
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,069
And he still works there today.

95
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:02,642
So KI wouldn't be KI without the voice of Chris Sutherland.

96
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:05,903
So we recorded him twice.

97
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,703
We got two big virtual sessions.

98
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:12,464
And it was very difficult to match the same performance.

99
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:15,104
His voice actually changed during those 17 years.

100
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:22,745
So what was fantastic is that Robin Binland sent us

101
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,406
the backup tapes from the original Killer Instinct.

102
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:31,114
So he transferred those DAT tapes, the digital tapes, to Pro Tools Sessions.

103
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,054
He sent them to us.

104
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:38,859
And we could actually hear the original recordings of Chris when he was recording in 94 and try

105
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:44,222
to match the same performance and not try to match the process ones.

106
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:53,047
So there was still one problem.

107
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:57,849
the iconic lines like the co-co-co-combo breaker and the ultra,

108
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,112
it was almost impossible to match the same performance.

109
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:09,356
So, what we did was actually just to grab those takes

110
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:12,818
from the original recordings, since we had them unprocessed.

111
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:16,420
And we just had to process them.

112
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,484
And back in the day, Robin used a noisy Behringer Composer MDX.

113
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,786
2100, chained by an Ensoniq DP4.

114
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:35,891
That's the binger that you see at the top and the Ensoniq at the back, at the bottom.

115
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:40,033
But today with Pro Tools, we just used the plugins.

116
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,614
We pitched it down 2.5 semitones.

117
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:52,600
We used the Renaissance compressor and the Waves doubler.

118
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:58,152
And we managed to find something that was really close.

119
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:04,276
So next, you're going to hear an ABC test of the announcer.

120
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:09,220
We hear first the original recording, and then

121
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,684
the 2013 version, followed by the 1994 version that

122
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,846
was recorded out of the Nintendo 64.

123
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:18,907
So that's what it sounded like.

124
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,747
Triple combo!

125
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:29,729
Killer combo!

126
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:37,171
Combo breaker!

127
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,192
Game over!

128
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:47,993
So, as a kid...

129
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:54,519
As arcade sound designers back in the day, our goal was to attract the crowd, as Mick

130
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,201
mentioned, to our arcade machine and make them spend their last scones that they had.

131
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:07,143
And we thought that to attract the crowd like they used to do in the arcades back in the

132
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:14,085
days, the impacts were one of the biggest things you could hear after the announcer.

133
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:23,491
So in order to bring them back in 2013, make some really interesting impacts,

134
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,553
we started recording, banging things around.

135
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:34,898
And this started in the kitchen of Double Helix, our studio.

136
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:39,381
And we got about 1,700 takes, lots of different things.

137
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:50,870
And some of the best ones actually came from hitting that black leather chair that you see in the back with a racket tennis, racket, sorry, a ping pong racket.

138
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:59,712
Then we took all those steaks, reprocessed them, tried to bring a little bit of crunch.

139
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:08,433
We used the filter freak from the Soundchoice and the, some compressors like the C4.

140
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,164
and a denoiser from the RX advanced removal that noise.

141
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:20,290
And then we got some interesting materials.

142
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,834
You're going to hear now the original recordings straight

143
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,977
from this kitchen, but I had to compress them,

144
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:31,340
otherwise you would only hear a little pfff,

145
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,081
and the processed version after.

146
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,605
All right.

147
00:09:55,605 --> 00:10:01,390
So from those hundreds of takes, we

148
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,375
had to categorize them into low, medium, and heavy for the game.

149
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,338
And this is what it sounds like for the low impacts.

150
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:18,086
All right, we had to create the medium ones and the heavy ones.

151
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:25,339
The distinction between those categories is not that big.

152
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,881
We tried really to make a really big difference

153
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,883
between the low and heavy ones, but then after,

154
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:33,546
it didn't feel right when you used the low impacts.

155
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,128
But that was okay because the designers

156
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:40,931
added new features to the game as we were developing it.

157
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,892
And one of them was the shadow moves.

158
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:47,496
And shadow moves, for the ones who are not familiar with it,

159
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,522
are basically superpowers for the characters

160
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:54,423
that they can trigger at any time of the game

161
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,183
when they have their meters filled.

162
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:59,765
And so we created new impacts for it.

163
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,125
That's what it sounded like.

164
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,285
Pfft.

165
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:01,585
Pfft.

166
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:03,246
Pfft.

167
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,306
Pfft.

168
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,746
Pfft.

169
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:08,827
So this, so far, we can go with that.

170
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,288
And the designers created new impacts.

171
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,009
That was for the last hit of the combo.

172
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,990
And it basically launches the opening in the air.

173
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:20,635
So we had to come up with new sounds for that.

174
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,656
And this is what it sounded like.

175
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:31,220
All right.

176
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:38,583
So one of the most satisfying moment in the game, in my opinion, is when you take the

177
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,085
opponent and throw it on the ground.

178
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:47,267
He creates this blast that spreads dust and debris.

179
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:52,455
And we thought it was a great opportunity

180
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:56,157
to use slapback echoes that quickly move

181
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,538
from the front speaker to the back.

182
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,580
Because the stage is in 2D, it's a 2D plane.

183
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,040
It's a 3D game, but it's a 2D plane.

184
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,322
So we want to create that third dimension

185
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,743
that surrounds the player.

186
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:18,148
So it gives a little bit of depth.

187
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:29,825
to the stage and this is an example of an orchid slapback echo.

188
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,307
So, here it sounds quite processed.

189
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:38,032
We could tell a little bit of a story with those sounds.

190
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:43,136
Because the jaguar is a symbol of orchids.

191
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,257
She uses that as a secret weapon, sort of.

192
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,885
So we use cougar sounds to create those slapback echoes

193
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:53,506
that quickly move from the front speakers to the back.

194
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,147
And for Cedira, for example, who is the spider queen,

195
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,668
we used female whispers.

196
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:03,708
For Spinal, who is the skeleton, creepy dude,

197
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,349
we used monster growls, et cetera.

198
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:09,090
For Thunder, it's obviously thunder claps.

199
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,330
So just to tell a little bit of story.

200
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:22,193
So, that stereo sound that you heard here is actually separated into two mono sound

201
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:25,914
in the game, for the left side and the right side.

202
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:29,035
And they all go through silences.

203
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:35,977
So the duration of those silences changes in real time in the game.

204
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:41,298
In this example, the two characters are on the left side of the screen.

205
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,519
So when the impact happens...

206
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,827
the silence for the right side, for the right slapback echo,

207
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:54,569
is bigger than the left one, which creates a delay

208
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,650
in the right slapback echo, which means it happens quicker

209
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,451
on the left and after on the right,

210
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:02,932
which helps to localize the character

211
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:10,095
and gives a little bit of interactivity.

212
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:12,616
Now,

213
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,312
Now, arcades were very loud.

214
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:31,136
There was a lot of music, a lot of people yelling around.

215
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:41,062
And good audio feedback was crucial for the players.

216
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:46,585
We wanted them, because the first time they

217
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,346
came to the arcade machine, they started to play.

218
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,308
We wanted them to stay there and keep investing coins, right?

219
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,349
That was the arcade time.

220
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,852
So in order for them to enjoy the game,

221
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,693
they need to have audio feedback.

222
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:00,293
It's very crucial.

223
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:04,616
So instead of going with like cliche whooshes when we play,

224
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:06,717
doing shoo, shoo, shoo sort of thing,

225
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:07,777
it wouldn't cut through the mix.

226
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:18,743
So instead of that, we amplified all the transients of any sound.

227
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,104
We added impacts to every whooshes.

228
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,245
And in this example here that you're

229
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:23,865
going to hear.

230
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:30,197
It's just like punches and kicks for a character.

231
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:36,739
Let's see what it sounds like.

232
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:45,081
Now fighting game players don't only need to know when a sound happened.

233
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,301
This is great.

234
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,342
It cuts through the mix.

235
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:52,903
But players also need to know which sound was triggered.

236
00:15:55,764 --> 00:16:04,006
And to do so, we think that tonalities is something that works very well.

237
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:12,727
Like in the old games.

238
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,408
Old games had that particularity.

239
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:20,109
Because they're easy to detect and remember.

240
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,770
So we're going to do a little test here.

241
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:30,116
So the first, try to remember what was the game from the first sound here.

242
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:33,117
Oh, that was very quick.

243
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,917
Hope you were fast.

244
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,298
Now let's try the second one.

245
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:36,878
The third one.

246
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:48,462
It's like, how fast did it take for you to remember when you heard the first few milliseconds

247
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:49,142
of that sound?

248
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,142
It's very quick, right?

249
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,823
They're very iconic, but that's because they were tonal.

250
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:58,351
So we did the same thing with Killer Instinct.

251
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,014
It's a little bit less straightforward, but this is

252
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,076
what ended up in the game with Orchid.

253
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,758
Try to hear those tonalities.

254
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,520
So yeah, it's very punchy, it's very tonal,

255
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,480
and you can detect those sounds very quickly.

256
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,620
And that's what we wanted to give to the fighting game

257
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,080
players.

258
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,141
So those sounds, all those electrical sounds and sparks,

259
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,002
where could we make them from?

260
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,562
Well, what about Tesla coil?

261
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:10,579
Now what would you use for the sticky sound of web?

262
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,800
For Sidira, Sidira is a spider queen.

263
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,541
She throws web everywhere on the stage.

264
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,302
Sticky sounds, tonalities.

265
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:19,963
What about duct tape?

266
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:20,623
What about that?

267
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,222
Now this is what it sounded like in the game when it's mixed with other sounds.

268
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:59,455
Okay, so that was Sedira.

269
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,957
But Glacius is a very interesting character, one of my favorite in the game.

270
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:06,760
He's an alien and he doesn't have a mouth.

271
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:14,062
So how would you create the wide range of emotions with vocalizations?

272
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:15,223
That was a very tricky one.

273
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:20,307
But we experimented, and we thought that we could use

274
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:23,289
something that we call the reversed larynx technique,

275
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,652
which basically, you inhale air through your larynx,

276
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:32,176
and it vibrates your vocal cord in a very non-human way,

277
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:35,538
and it creates those screeches like that.

278
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,793
So that was the voice for Glaciers.

279
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:49,276
So he doesn't have a mouth, but he can breathe on Earth.

280
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,738
And he uses gills.

281
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:57,701
So I tried to find fish in the Union, but I couldn't find any.

282
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:02,943
So instead, we used my colleague's iron that is here.

283
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,285
You know the iron they use for your shirts?

284
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:11,010
And this is what it sounded like for a million breathing on Earth.

285
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,070
Oh!

286
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,250
Oh!

287
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,290
Oh!

288
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:11,330
Oh!

289
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,370
Oh!

290
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:29,639
Oh!

291
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:29,679
Oh!

292
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,039
Oh!

293
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,519
Oh!

294
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:30,679
Oh!

295
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:31,079
Oh!

296
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,419
Oh!

297
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:31,620
Oh!

298
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh!

299
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh!

300
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,540
Oh!

301
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:32,700
Oh!

302
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:32,740
Oh!

303
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:32,860
Oh!

304
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:32,980
Oh!

305
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,100
Oh!

306
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,741
Oh!

307
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:33,881
Oh!

308
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:34,101
Oh!

309
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:34,241
Oh!

310
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:44,441
And to give that sensation without going into the electronic sound world, we used a very

311
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:47,183
organic sound, the elastic band.

312
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:57,411
So you can create things, because this elastic band, I can stretch it and I can control the

313
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:58,232
pitch of it.

314
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:59,333
So you do things like that.

315
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,789
So you can rise the pitch up or bend it down.

316
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,070
And you can, after that, once it's brutal,

317
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,971
you can process it, you can slow it down even further,

318
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,011
pitch it down, you can reverse it,

319
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,512
add a little bit of distortion.

320
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:28,955
And when added in the game, it could sound like that.

321
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:33,657
So there's another character that I really like, Spinal.

322
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:34,686
the skeleton.

323
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:40,630
Spinal is very interesting because he has traveled all around the world with his ship.

324
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,413
And he learned many different languages.

325
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,834
So in the game, his words

326
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:51,077
that he uses for his attacks are actually made of five different languages.

327
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,198
There's Spanish,

328
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:54,960
when he says espada,

329
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,281
which means sword.

330
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,822
There's Greek.

331
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,506
He says, uh, Tromos, which means terror.

332
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:07,409
And there's also Italian, there's Indonesian, and there's also Swedish.

333
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,790
And that's something that we put as well in the music.

334
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,831
All the lyrics were recorded in Swedish, in Sweden.

335
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:23,734
And this is an example of where we recorded it.

336
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:47,587
I know right

337
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:06,852
Hey!

338
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,793
Man, it's really cool, like, recording a Viking.

339
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:11,335
Yeah, thank you, clap for the Vikings, everybody clap for the Vikings.

340
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:18,621
What's the most difficult thing about working with Vikings is trying to get them sober to

341
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:19,721
actually do something, right?

342
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:19,902
Yeah.

343
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:25,774
So excuse me there, I see you taking photos of things.

344
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:38,661
I'm wondering if I can ask you very quickly in a few, like a few couple of words, what music is to you?

345
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:39,241
Wrong person?

346
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:39,742
Emotion?

347
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:39,942
Yeah.

348
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:40,642
Yeah, that's a good one.

349
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:43,804
Hey man, can I, you're Swedish right? Yeah, Vikings, yeah.

350
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:47,446
So can I ask you in a few short words what music means to you?

351
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,989
Emotion, yeah, great. I love it. Thanks, man.

352
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:53,010
Hey, man, how's it going?

353
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,532
That's a killer beard, dude. Killer. Do you like my jacket?

354
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:55,752
Anyway.

355
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:57,673
So, can I ask you in a few short words what music is to you?

356
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:58,394
Expression.

357
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:02,336
Expression and emotion. I love this. This is really, really cool.

358
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:05,158
Do you know why? Because these things

359
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:08,701
represent exactly what music means to us.

360
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:09,081
Right?

361
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,583
To us, music is storytelling.

362
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,706
It was music that told us exactly

363
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,487
what Luke Skywalker was feeling

364
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:18,188
in this moment.

365
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,712
It was music that told us exactly what Jack and Rose were feeling in this moment.

366
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:33,839
And it was music that told us exactly what Marion Crane was feeling in this moment.

367
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:41,685
Now storytelling applies really, really well to a fighting game. Why?

368
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,346
Because we have a narrative structure.

369
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:44,948
Here's what I mean.

370
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:48,651
Two characters enter.

371
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,631
The round begins.

372
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:54,342
They beat the shit out of each other.

373
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:57,023
And the round ends.

374
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,903
That there is our story.

375
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,144
That's our narrative structure, right?

376
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:05,385
Now I want you to think of that like a scene in a film.

377
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:08,986
There are many moments there that you

378
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:13,427
could choose to accentuate emotionally with music.

379
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:15,328
But the art comes from choosing the right moments.

380
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:20,289
Now interactive music, the art in interactive music.

381
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:25,401
is choosing the right gameplay moments to change the score.

382
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:31,806
Now, I want you to think of the interactive music

383
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:39,673
system in Killer Instinct as like a pop song, where

384
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:42,855
we give the control of the structure over to the player.

385
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:44,957
So the structure being verse, chorus, et cetera.

386
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:47,860
We give the control of that over to the player.

387
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:56,134
Now to further demonstrate this, we're going to talk through a single round of Killer Instinct to see what happens.

388
00:25:56,134 --> 00:26:03,556
The first fighter enters and the round begins.

389
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:04,657
The music gives that player an entrance.

390
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:08,938
It also sets up the mood for the impending battle.

391
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:14,079
Now the second character enters and you'll hear the music build.

392
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,859
Now, did everybody see that beat when he jumps down there and it changes?

393
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:24,119
Right?

394
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,379
That's the music system.

395
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:30,720
Each character has a different intro animation,

396
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,301
and they're all different lengths, which we love, don't we, audio people?

397
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:40,042
So the system changes into that build on the beat

398
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:43,043
to make it sure that it's like the same on every level, right?

399
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,724
So anyway, we've got our two characters here.

400
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:46,724
The round begins.

401
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:54,915
All right, boom, the fights on, yeah.

402
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,877
At this point, we change to what we call

403
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:58,778
our normal state of music.

404
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:01,740
But I want you to think of our normal state

405
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,623
as like the verse of our pop song.

406
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,345
But we've split the individual components

407
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:11,008
that make up a verse into individual files.

408
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:13,229
So what I mean by that is we have stuff

409
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,430
like little interludes.

410
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:20,735
Right, we have part A's of the verse.

411
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:32,316
And then we've got part Bs of the verse.

412
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:37,600
And we have different riffs and things.

413
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,981
Cool?

414
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:41,784
And we arrange these individual components

415
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,665
to form a verse in Y's here.

416
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:49,470
Each one of those components has multiple variations.

417
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,752
And this way, we get hundreds of different combinations.

418
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:55,214
So the verse is always slightly a little bit different.

419
00:27:55,797 --> 00:28:00,881
The goal of this is to give every single player some cool music to fight along to,

420
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,002
even if they're a beginner.

421
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:06,086
But of course, Killer Instinct isn't really for beginners.

422
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,968
People really want to get good at fighting games and things as such.

423
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:12,371
And you've all played Killer Instinct, you've played fighting games before,

424
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:14,253
so you'll understand the combo system.

425
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,275
Combo, essentially, for those who may not know,

426
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:18,977
is about linking individual moves together to form a combo.

427
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:21,499
So you link your punches and kicks and things together to form a combo.

428
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:27,638
Now despite what you might have seen in that awesome match between Jed and I at the start of the game,

429
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:31,020
those combos are actually really difficult to pull off.

430
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,624
So we wanted to reward the player who succeeds at that.

431
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:39,547
We wanted to give them a reward.

432
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:45,272
Any player that successfully pulls off a 15-hit combo or more

433
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:51,377
is rewarded with the first eight bars of our chorus.

434
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,670
Right?

435
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:13,955
Now during those eight bars, if that player successfully pulls off another high hit combo,

436
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,536
they're rewarded with the second eight bars of the chorus.

437
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:22,900
If they pull off another high hit combo and that, they're rewarded with the third eight bars of the chorus.

438
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,621
And so on and so on.

439
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:26,182
Now what does this do?

440
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:31,735
This exposes the interactive music system to the player.

441
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:37,056
It pulls the interactive music system out of the shadows,

442
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,257
where it normally sits trying to pretend that it's

443
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:41,378
scored like a film, right?

444
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,718
And puts it square into the player's lap,

445
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,599
and they're aware of it.

446
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,600
So to further kind of explain this, what I'm going to do

447
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,121
is kind of set up how this works, right?

448
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,381
We're going to do this in Wwise, just

449
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:54,082
for the sake of demonstration purposes.

450
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:59,732
We're going to start with our verse, and then we're going to say that one of the characters has done a hi-hat combo.

451
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:05,778
We're going to go into the chorus, and then we're going to fail to do another hi-hat combo within those first eight bars.

452
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,521
You'll hear the music drop back down into the verse.

453
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:09,622
Let's try that.

454
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,504
Oh, sorry. Here we go.

455
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:12,925
Come on.

456
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:18,270
It's our verse.

457
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:18,871
Chorus.

458
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:30,458
If it failed, back down into the verse.

459
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:34,600
Let's do that again, but this time the player is going to successfully produce another 15

460
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,982
hit or higher combo within those first eight bars, and you'll hear the chorus linked together.

461
00:30:54,301 --> 00:31:09,805
Cool?

462
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:10,706
Makes sense?

463
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:15,047
Now here's a little bonus for everybody playing at home there.

464
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,768
The observant audio people of you there might know that we have something a little kind

465
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:20,268
of sneaky and magical going on there, right?

466
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:25,871
So, if you've got a verse in a dance song, and it's going 1, 2, 3, 4 with a kick drum.

467
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:29,453
Then you have a chorus, which also has 1, 2, 3, 4 with a kick drum.

468
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:33,575
We want to make sure that chorus punches in nice and hard.

469
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,277
The best way to do that is to kind of take the kick drum away a little bit.

470
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:39,579
But of course, how do you do that when you've just got two segments, right?

471
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:42,861
Well, there's a sneaky little trick going on here.

472
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,042
The observant of you will know that here in the combo,

473
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:48,184
if you see in this section here, I don't know how well you can see that from there.

474
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:50,425
We have two kick drums. You can see that with the big square things there.

475
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,906
No loudness jokes please, I know it looks like a block of cheese.

476
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:53,766
Right, hear those two kicks?

477
00:31:53,766 --> 00:32:00,827
But when we go from our verse into the chorus, we hear those kick drums disappear.

478
00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:10,509
Right, everybody kind of get that? It's a little bit hard to hear in the room here.

479
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:18,191
But anyway, those first two kick drums in my block of cheese that you had there before, well they're inverted.

480
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:22,980
They're exactly the same samples from the verse, but we've inverted them.

481
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,342
Jed, what happens when we put two sounds across to the other and one's inverted?

482
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:27,443
It cancels each other out.

483
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:29,184
It cancels each other out.

484
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,166
So we have this magical disappearing kick drum every time the chorus triggers, yeah?

485
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,747
Cool stuff, huh?

486
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:34,508
Anyway, let's move on.

487
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:38,210
So, back into Killer Instinct,

488
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,193
you may have noticed that Killer Instinct is a bit of a busy game, right?

489
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:44,574
There's lots of stuff going on, yeah?

490
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:46,395
There's lots of stuff to pay attention to.

491
00:32:47,307 --> 00:32:52,410
Now I don't know how well you can see here, but do you guys see this tiny little yellow bar?

492
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,290
Do you see this yellow bar here? Everybody see that?

493
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,612
Right here, this big long red bar is the player's health.

494
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,152
This little yellow bar down here, right?

495
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:04,015
That little yellow bar is actually really, really, really important.

496
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,876
That little yellow bar can change the match.

497
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,457
It's basically like a special meter.

498
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:13,859
As the match goes on, depending on certain circumstances, that bar fills up.

499
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,560
It's very important.

500
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:19,097
So we don't know why it got so much little kind of screen real estate though,

501
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,858
but I guess everything is kind of competing, right?

502
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:23,358
So if you can't have enough space on the screen,

503
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:26,199
we need to find another way to make that bar stand out.

504
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,820
Now Jed here had a fantastic idea.

505
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,021
Let's use music to make that little bar stand out.

506
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,722
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm talking about here.

507
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:46,653
To make that bar stand out, we have mono layers of musical flourishes that can come in on

508
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:47,734
top of the music.

509
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:54,415
I'm just going to set one up here for you.

510
00:33:54,415 --> 00:34:01,357
You'll hear it come through one side of the speaker.

511
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:02,317
Is Ellie in here, by the way?

512
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:03,837
Ellie Eastman?

513
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:04,198
Are you Ellie?

514
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:04,718
Shout out, Ellie.

515
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:05,018
She's not here.

516
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:06,218
That's Ellie singing, by the way.

517
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,178
Nobody knows Ellie.

518
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:07,918
All right.

519
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:16,015
So anyway, so that mono layer there, right, is attached to the player who has a filled

520
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:16,475
yellow bar.

521
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:20,396
And it plays on top of the music that's already playing.

522
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:25,038
If that player, so, all right, so what I mean by attached is that that player is over on

523
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:31,039
this side of the screen, that means that piece of music there, that little florist, is only

524
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,440
playing out of that side of the speaker.

525
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,821
If the player jumps over the other side and they swap.

526
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:46,392
That layer cross-fades over to the other beam.

527
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:47,313
Right, you guys getting that?

528
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:47,793
Yeah?

529
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:51,936
If the second player also has a filled meter,

530
00:34:51,936 --> 00:35:01,383
then it fills out a little bit more.

531
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:01,723
Cool, huh?

532
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,264
So what does this do?

533
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,963
slightly upsets the stereo balance, our stereo image.

534
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:12,545
We have one side that has a little bit more information in it than the other.

535
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:19,008
What this does is subtly makes one side, where the character is,

536
00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:23,090
feel a little bit more powerful than the other side.

537
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,831
Kind of cool, huh?

538
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,552
All right.

539
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:32,495
So anyway, following basic game design rules.

540
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:39,773
You want to reward the player who figures out your system.

541
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,254
If that player has a controller in their lap,

542
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,576
and they're going, well, if I push more of these buttons,

543
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,337
and the music changes, and it gets more intense,

544
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:50,957
what happens if I put it down?

545
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,138
You want to reward that person.

546
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:55,379
You want to reward that player who tries to figure out your system

547
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:56,219
and break it, yeah?

548
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:02,161
Each level features a remix.

549
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:08,401
of each character over that level's original theme from 1994

550
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:14,186
that only plays if both characters put their controllers down for a set period of time.

551
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:51,614
Now if the players move, it jumps straight back into the verse.

552
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:51,794
Cool, huh?

553
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:57,676
So anyway, our players have been beating the living crap out of each other for a little while.

554
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,817
And one has beaten the crap out of the other one more than themselves, I guess.

555
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:02,018
So they end the match, right?

556
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,800
But of course this is a fighting game, you don't just end the match, right?

557
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,722
You want to completely decimate your opponent.

558
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,803
You want to beat the living crap out of them, right?

559
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:24,807
You want to make them feel completely bad and never want to pick up the controller again.

560
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,789
So the player has an option.

561
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,932
If they import a special series of buttons at the end of a match,

562
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:34,194
at exactly the right moment,

563
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:37,516
they're rewarded with this huge, epic, decimating ultra combo,

564
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:40,979
which of course you all know from the original game, which looks like this.

565
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:49,273
Right? Now he's dead, yeah?

566
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:53,595
So with that moment, it's a special moment at the end of the round.

567
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:57,856
We wanted to try something that's a little bit interesting.

568
00:37:57,856 --> 00:38:01,077
I mean, the entire match we've got punch, kick sound effects,

569
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,878
and we've got music that sits in the background.

570
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:06,699
So we wanted to try something that's a little bit interesting.

571
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,100
We're looking around for different sources of inspiration,

572
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,441
and we came across these amazing music levels in Rayman,

573
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,522
where the visuals on screen reflect the music.

574
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:31,293
Cool, huh?

575
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:37,495
So you see how the visuals are kind of matching the music, yeah? It's kind of really linked, it's really really cool.

576
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,855
So I thought, why not make our ultras... musical?

577
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:59,049
He was enjoying that subwoofer there.

578
00:38:59,049 --> 00:38:59,550
Right.

579
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,511
Now, pulling that off was really hard.

580
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:03,091
Excuse me.

581
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:03,972
Gosh.

582
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:05,032
So, how do we do that?

583
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:06,813
Right, well, every single level has 50 hits.

584
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:14,677
And think of these individual hits as like a scale that's kind of raising up.

585
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:17,339
I can actually show you a couple here.

586
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:21,801
So this is the ones for the level that we've been playing through.

587
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,731
Let's hit number one, two, three, four, five.

588
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:34,473
Alright, you getting what I'm saying?

589
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,754
So it constantly goes up, right?

590
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,214
So it's 50 of these per level.

591
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:41,435
For those of you playing at home, that's 400 hits.

592
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:41,515
Pfft.

593
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:41,775
Anyway.

594
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:45,376
Once we've got those 400 hits,

595
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:50,318
we give each character a sequence.

596
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:51,318
Here's what I mean.

597
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:52,539
So this is a sequence.

598
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:53,379
The guy at the top there...

599
00:39:54,307 --> 00:40:00,512
His sequence, his matter sequence, might be hit number 1, hit number 4, and then hit number 8.

600
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:09,879
Saber Wolf, on the other hand, might be hit number 1, hit number 5, and then hit number 9.

601
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:12,721
Spinal, lastly, might be hit number 1, hit number 3, hit number 7, and then hit number 10.

602
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:19,686
So this system selects these individual hits out and places them on every single punch and kick.

603
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,784
And what this does is ensures that every character has a melody for their Ultra Combo.

604
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:34,692
So this way, Jago's Ultra will always sound like Jago's Ultra, regardless of the stage,

605
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:45,401
but it will be styled according to that level's music.

606
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,663
So anyway, what did we learn from this?

607
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:46,065
What is Next Gen Audio?

608
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:53,581
We thought the next gen took away all the technical restrictions

609
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:57,904
that we used to have on the previous consoles.

610
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:58,545
It was really...

611
00:41:58,545 --> 00:41:59,205
No, well said, my man.

612
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:06,009
But of course, I think really, anything really creative or artistic

613
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:09,231
requires careful restrictions.

614
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,892
That's right, Nick.

615
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:14,855
It would be like thinking that using 300 tracks in Pro Tools

616
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:16,396
would give you better sound.

617
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:21,139
Or having 300 toppings on your pizza will make a better pizza.

618
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,980
The thing is though, finally, kind of maybe,

619
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,122
NextGen allows us to choose what those restrictions are.

620
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:37,226
My name is Jean-Édouard Miclot, and I did the audio in Killer Instinct.

621
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:40,468
My name is Mick Gordon, I made all the music for Killer Instinct.

622
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,288
Thank you guys very, very much.

623
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:52,567
So we've got about 15 minutes for questions.

624
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,189
So if anybody has a question, I'd

625
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:56,971
like to invite you up to the microphone here.

626
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:59,313
The man at the back, Mark, would you

627
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,475
mind just boosting up the room lights a little bit,

628
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,317
just so we don't have any people trip over anything?

629
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:05,839
And while that's coming up, GDC has

630
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,441
reminded me to tell you guys, after this,

631
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,182
you're going to get a little email that'll

632
00:43:09,182 --> 00:43:11,004
come into your phone.

633
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:12,205
And it's like an evaluation form.

634
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,747
If you wouldn't mind just spending two minutes filling

635
00:43:14,747 --> 00:43:15,408
that one out.

636
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:19,027
It really helps GDC with selecting talks and things for the future.

637
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,968
So does anybody have any questions?

638
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:24,730
Yeah, just step right on up to the microphone, my man.

639
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:35,536
I'd love to hear any thoughts you might have about how the process was mixing all of the

640
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:41,040
sound effects versus the music, since both of them, they have so much character.

641
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,241
How do you balance that kind of challenge?

642
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:45,872
Right, that's true.

643
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:51,473
When we started to work on tonal sounds,

644
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:55,253
we found that it was very complicated to get them in tune with the music.

645
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:58,514
So Mick actually gave me one note.

646
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:03,115
He used, like, across all the stages, the E minor scale?

647
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:07,075
Yeah, so, it's funny, musical people, we're musical people, right?

648
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:07,956
Alright, cool.

649
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:11,396
So Jed here, the main sound designer man,

650
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:13,297
everybody saw the Tesla things before, right?

651
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:23,886
So it turns out that when we recorded the Tesla coil, it was at a B-flat, right?

652
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:26,988
And the music for Awkward Stage was in E. Oh gosh, really?

653
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:28,109
Music people?

654
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:29,290
Tritone, right?

655
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:29,471
GDC.

656
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:36,316
No, so what we had to do was basically give Jed a set of notes that would apply to any

657
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:41,521
stage and so the pre-planning was involved as to what key each piece of music is in.

658
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,649
But yeah, generally with mixing we had a ducking system.

659
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,490
So we had a priority system over four levels.

660
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,931
What was the priority system, Jed, number one?

661
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:51,252
No, there was actually like 15 different priorities.

662
00:44:51,252 --> 00:44:51,692
Yeah.

663
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:54,074
But it's all automated.

664
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:56,015
So yeah, you have in and outs.

665
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:58,456
And the announcer is the biggest priority.

666
00:44:58,456 --> 00:45:00,697
The sound effects are the second one.

667
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:04,299
And then after, impacts, music, vocals, those kind of things.

668
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:05,480
Nice kind of thing.

669
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,481
So that's how we mix the game in real time.

670
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:08,961
Whiz Man, did that answer your question OK?

671
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:09,842
Yeah, cool.

672
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:10,482
Thank you, man.

673
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:11,663
What's your question, dude?

674
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:21,627
My question is for you. In terms of your choices for genres, I was wondering what was going

675
00:45:21,627 --> 00:45:27,310
through your head when you were thinking, did you ever want to go orchestral heavy or

676
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,832
rock heavy? Because I know you're dealing with a lot of genres there. What was your

677
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:35,015
sort of mindset or your thoughts on how you came about choosing the genres for your music?

678
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,670
the entire field? Yeah, definitely, absolutely. Great question.

679
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,572
So, essentially, obviously if you're familiar with the original Killer Instinct soundtrack,

680
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,994
it's very varied. I mean, there's all sorts of different tracks. There's orchestral tracks,

681
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:46,856
there's dance tracks, there's all that sort of stuff. So, it's quite varied.

682
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:49,337
A lot of that information was already laid down.

683
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:53,420
So, when we were doing Orchid's track, it was clear that that was going to be a dance track.

684
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,861
Oh, I see. So you're basing it off of... Yeah, pretty much.

685
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:59,043
The only one we had was Cedira, which is a new character.

686
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:00,784
She was the spider queen that Jeb was showing before.

687
00:46:01,064 --> 00:46:04,052
And so here I went through about seven different versions and just couldn't get it right.

688
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,618
Couldn't find music that was like a spider queen, right?

689
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:13,477
So I remembered this girl I knew in high school, and she was like a goth, and she was just obsessed with spiders, and Marilyn Manson.

690
00:46:13,477 --> 00:46:19,758
So we ended up doing this really heavy, heavy track, with singing and all that sort of stuff, which kind of fit.

691
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:21,438
Just because it was kind of, you know, fit the spider queen, right?

692
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:24,879
Imagine, I don't know if you've seen the level, was that Spider-1 at the end there?

693
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:25,299
Right, yeah.

694
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:31,380
And imagine like she hangs out there with her spider assassins, they all sit around listening to Marilyn Manson all day.

695
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,091
That was kind of it, yeah.

696
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:37,654
And if you remember the original teaser that we did for Cidre, she used to look like way

697
00:46:37,654 --> 00:46:40,196
more evil, and we changed the character design as well after.

698
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:43,238
So the music affected the character design?

699
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:43,498
Is that...

700
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:43,718
Oh good.

701
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,959
Yeah, yeah, seriously.

702
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:45,379
Yeah.

703
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:45,739
Yeah.

704
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:46,160
Yeah.

705
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,620
Yeah.

706
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:46,900
Yeah.

707
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,220
Yeah.

708
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,361
Yeah.

709
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:47,681
Yeah.

710
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:47,881
Yeah.

711
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:47,981
Yeah.

712
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:48,061
Yeah.

713
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:48,181
Yeah.

714
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:48,281
Yeah.

715
00:46:48,281 --> 00:46:48,441
Yeah.

716
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:48,541
Yeah.

717
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,052
Yeah, something like that.

718
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:53,957
Yeah, so that was basically it. It just depends on the character.

719
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:56,221
Killer Instinct is, I mean, obviously a fighting game from the 90s.

720
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:00,488
It's based on this really fascinating thing that we've really lost with films and cartoons these days,

721
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:02,191
which is the idea of characterization.

722
00:47:02,578 --> 00:47:06,041
Do you remember back in the day when every cartoon there was a character that had the

723
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,383
ability to solve any problem that came up?

724
00:47:08,383 --> 00:47:10,204
So Transformers is a good example and things like that.

725
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,666
The characters would need to get across a gorge and they'd need a bridge.

726
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:16,569
But there was no bridge there, but they happened to have a Transformer that transformed into

727
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:17,170
a bridge, right?

728
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,251
And then they can get across.

729
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:20,272
So it was all based on characterization.

730
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:25,016
So the original Killer Instinct had like robots and lizards and wolf people and, you know,

731
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:26,818
all these sort of varied characters.

732
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:31,421
So the music really needs to be different for every single character so we get that characterization across.

733
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,882
I see. Really good question, man. Thank you very much.

734
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:34,182
Thank you.

735
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,423
Hey, buddy. How are you?

736
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,264
Doing well. How about you?

737
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:38,824
I'm good. Thank you.

738
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:42,246
Great presentation. I really enjoy you guys. We're a big fan of the game.

739
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,807
I have questions for each of you.

740
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:47,709
First, the sound designer.

741
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:55,833
The technique that you had for when I noticed that you were recording your sounds,

742
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,613
you had a certain...

743
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,843
It's like a baffle of a filter of some sort.

744
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,146
But what kind of microphones were you actually using to capture it?

745
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,289
And what were your microphone placements for, like just hitting for the chair?

746
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:09,312
Did you have like a side mic set off here?

747
00:48:09,312 --> 00:48:11,354
And what were your techniques for that?

748
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,697
That was absolutely random.

749
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,044
I put, that's true.

750
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:17,465
I don't even remember how I did it.

751
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:19,566
I recorded like, yeah, 1,700 takes.

752
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,587
So, yeah, I usually have,

753
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:23,968
I like to have like one that is pretty close

754
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,329
and have one that is like medium distance

755
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:28,250
and one that is like even further.

756
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,612
Yeah, I mostly, I really like using MS microphones,

757
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:35,814
mid-side, because it helps me after to decide

758
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:37,835
if I just want to use the directional mic,

759
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:41,656
the capsule or add like a little bit more of ambient sound.

760
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,913
It's actually really cool when you start distorting sounds

761
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:48,855
because you also can apply just that effect to the left and right.

762
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:52,977
So yeah, it's just about like after experimenting, when you search.

763
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:59,500
For the impacts, I watched like a lot of movies and played a lot of video games.

764
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:06,683
All the way back from Raging Bull that was designed by Frank Warner

765
00:49:06,683 --> 00:49:09,645
and he did all those like super cool impacts that he deleted after.

766
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,863
But those inspirations, you know, I check like all the movies and video games.

767
00:49:15,863 --> 00:49:18,884
And we tried to find like a unique style for Killer Instinct.

768
00:49:18,884 --> 00:49:22,626
And it was just like, you know, looking for that happy accident to happen.

769
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,787
Very nice work.

770
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:25,848
Nick, my question for you is...

771
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,823
With the Wwise implementation, you did that correct?

772
00:49:29,823 --> 00:49:29,883
Yes.

773
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,423
Very, very great work.

774
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:35,024
I was interested in how you actually

775
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:39,805
were able to crossfade or implement the music for it

776
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:42,646
to be transitional so seamlessly as far as having

777
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,087
the old theme rather than having a new theme as soon

778
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:47,287
as the player makes a jump.

779
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:50,668
How were you able to implement that besides the whole phase

780
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:51,428
cancellation?

781
00:49:51,428 --> 00:49:52,628
Yeah, no, that's really good.

782
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:55,853
I'll say a couple of points here, obviously.

783
00:49:55,853 --> 00:49:57,635
I'm based down in Melbourne, down in Australia.

784
00:49:57,635 --> 00:49:59,236
These guys are in Irvine, California.

785
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:01,897
So there's a big distance there.

786
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:04,539
It was Jed and myself, the main sound people on the team.

787
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,580
We also had Zach Quiles at Microsoft.

788
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,200
We had Boyd Post.

789
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,621
We had Greg Allen.

790
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:07,121
Greg Allen, yep.

791
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:09,222
Couple of different people that helped us out

792
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:09,803
and things along the way.

793
00:50:09,803 --> 00:50:12,024
But it was basically Jed and I.

794
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:14,886
And what was great about that is that we pretty much

795
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,267
had free reign to do whatever we liked.

796
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:16,747
And that was great.

797
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,008
It wasn't political or anything like that.

798
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:19,970
We were just, let's make musical ultras.

799
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:20,870
That'll be cool.

800
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,031
And it was great, right?

801
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:26,589
So anyway, I believe, I really, really, really strongly believe

802
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,993
that if you're a video game composer and you're not implementing your own music,

803
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:32,154
then that's really wrong.

804
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,357
Because essentially you're handing something

805
00:50:35,357 --> 00:50:38,139
that you're spending time, energy and money over

806
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:40,341
to an assistant that has nothing better to do

807
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,543
that slices up your sounds and music and things.

808
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:46,006
So when you have control over that from the beginning,

809
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:50,310
you're able to compose knowing about your implementation techniques.

810
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:56,005
So with that session there, it's all built in one huge massive session.

811
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,946
So it's all mixed, mastered all in one massive session.

812
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:02,807
But it's kind of mastered and mixed and things in like eight bars at a time.

813
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:04,648
So when we do recording, it's really boring for the players

814
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:06,068
because they kind of play eight bars and then stop.

815
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:09,449
We do another eight bars and then they stop and think about that, right?

816
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,069
But with phasing and things, we didn't have any issues because of that.

817
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,310
Wwise is pretty handy with that sort of stuff.

818
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,631
If you're familiar with Wwise, you'll know about the pre-entry and post-exit.

819
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:19,875
So we're just basically using that, yeah.

820
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:23,891
What's great about this system is that everything we used is off.

821
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,878
I don't think we have any custom stuff.

822
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:29,480
We have some scripting stuff for the musical ultras.

823
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,980
Yes.

824
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,982
But how they're being played back is all in the works.

825
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:34,283
Come home, break, there's all these things.

826
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:34,464
Yeah.

827
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:36,145
Does that answer your question okay?

828
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:37,746
Yeah, yeah, and you wrote the lyrics

829
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:39,487
and everything like that too.

830
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,649
Yes, yeah, well I had a little bit of help

831
00:51:41,649 --> 00:51:42,690
with the Orchids theme.

832
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,512
Ali Edwards, who's the main vocalist on that theme,

833
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:47,133
she wrote a lot of the lyrics.

834
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,234
And that was a funny one, the track is called

835
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:49,835
Touch Me and I'll Break Your Face.

836
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:50,035
Yeah.

837
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,136
I love that track, I heard it.

838
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:52,297
Thank you.

839
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,558
The original.

840
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:59,763
Killer Instinct, obviously Orchid was treated very,

841
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:01,465
very overly sexualized and things, right?

842
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:04,048
And there's a line in the original song which is like,

843
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:04,949
touch me, feel me.

844
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:08,112
And when we were talking about like the new Orchid

845
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:09,113
and how we wanted her to come across.

846
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:13,597
we took that, we don't want that touch me thing now, we want that touch me and I'll break your face

847
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:18,282
and then that became the whole, like the thought, once we got that, the song kind of wrote itself

848
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:22,325
but I didn't feel comfortable writing lyrics for Orchid being male

849
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:26,650
so I wanted to give that to somebody else, so that was Ali, so she sung it and she wrote all the lyrics and things like that as well

850
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,034
but we did heaps of stuff, I mean all the stuff in Sweden with the Swedish choir

851
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:33,836
was written by Pontus Rufelt, he wrote all the translations and stuff

852
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:38,202
We recorded that. There were 13 viking men who were really into it and all that sort of stuff.

853
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:41,406
We recorded it in a gymnasium in Gothenburg.

854
00:52:41,406 --> 00:52:47,093
What else, man? Yeah, we did strings in Manchester, we did brass in London, we did stuff all over the place.

855
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:51,118
So Mick raised a very good point here about the sexual aspect of orchid and...

856
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,473
Like every character was treated very carefully, like Thunder,

857
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:58,976
you know, who's now like a native American fighter.

858
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:02,038
And the previous character was very racist,

859
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:04,159
so like every character, we put a lot of efforts

860
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,361
to make sure that he doesn't...

861
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:08,742
that is not offensive for any community.

862
00:53:08,742 --> 00:53:12,803
Yeah, I mean we had representatives in the Nez Perce tribe

863
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:15,064
that basically designed Thunder for us,

864
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:18,205
all these wall painters, traditional wall painting things.

865
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:22,046
Jed actually went to Idaho for a couple of days

866
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:25,127
and recorded singers and things out in the wilderness

867
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:27,148
and stuff like that as well, so

868
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:28,989
we were really fortunate to be able to have that access

869
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:30,029
to that sort of thing.

870
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:32,030
Bravo work guys, really appreciate it.

871
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,990
Does anybody have any other questions?

872
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,570
I've got time for one more!

873
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,751
Yeah man, thank you.

874
00:53:36,494 --> 00:53:37,274
Da da da da da.

875
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:38,135
This is an amazing talk.

876
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:38,335
Thank you.

877
00:53:38,335 --> 00:53:43,097
Go on to GDC vault right after to watch it again because it's that good.

878
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:46,199
So my question is you have Fulgore coming out soon.

879
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,520
I'm not sure how much you can talk about this,

880
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,622
but any cool sound things or music things you guys have been working on?

881
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:53,942
Fulgore is that character.

882
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,824
I didn't know anything about Fulgore.

883
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:59,645
So yeah, Fulgore is coming out later this month.

884
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:01,626
What can we say about Fulgore, Jed?

885
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:03,047
Because he is announced, I guess.

886
00:54:03,047 --> 00:54:05,048
What can we say about Fulgore?

887
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,469
We can't say anything now.

888
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:10,010
That's fine.

889
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,931
Yeah, it's very true to the original games.

890
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:13,951
So yeah.

891
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,191
If you're a fan of Heavy Metal.

892
00:54:16,191 --> 00:54:19,372
The only thing that I can say maybe is that

893
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:21,433
we treated him with

894
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:22,413
trying to blend the

895
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:24,713
organic side into the electronic

896
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:26,674
and the electronic into the organic.

897
00:54:26,674 --> 00:54:28,694
That was like the idea for Fugor.

898
00:54:28,694 --> 00:54:30,855
Yeah, there's lots of modular synth

899
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:32,235
stuff and things that went into

900
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,015
designs and things.

901
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:36,093
Eurorack and stuff, distortion pedals.

902
00:54:36,093 --> 00:54:39,835
Very special character, very different from the other characters in the roster.

903
00:54:39,835 --> 00:54:45,179
Again, tonal stuff, he's a robot so he's got lasers and all that sort of stuff, so tonal things again.

904
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:47,880
Yeah, does that answer your question? Probably not.

905
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,181
That's fine, it's good, thanks.

906
00:54:49,181 --> 00:54:51,262
End of March? What did they tell us? End of March, I think?

907
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:51,362
Yep.

908
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,023
End of March, yeah, I think. Thank you, man.

909
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:59,227
Okay, guys, I think that's all. One more, alright, we will do one more just because I love your shirt.

910
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:02,850
I'm just curious, now that you've actually done the title,

911
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:06,472
do you feel that you could have actually delivered this audio

912
00:55:06,472 --> 00:55:08,353
solution, the previous generation,

913
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:09,634
or do you feel that actually, no, it

914
00:55:09,634 --> 00:55:11,255
needed this generation for you to actually deliver it?

915
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:12,075
That's a really good question.

916
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,536
Do we talk about trying to do it on 360?

917
00:55:13,536 --> 00:55:16,358
Let's imagine you say that.

918
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,040
Let's imagine we try to make it to 360.

919
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,222
We could, but yeah, we would have

920
00:55:23,222 --> 00:55:25,984
to downraise a lot of stuff and get a lot of content.

921
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:28,565
The system would work.

922
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:31,507
Yeah, the system would work with your stuff too.

923
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:31,767
Yeah.

924
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:32,908
It's really interesting.

925
00:55:32,908 --> 00:55:35,209
I mean, I know we're talking about next gen

926
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:37,831
and all that sort of stuff.

927
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,752
It's fascinating when you can have 500 mega sounds playing

928
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:41,312
in a single level.

929
00:55:41,312 --> 00:55:43,974
Getting 500 mega sounds off a hard drive quick enough

930
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,055
becomes the problem.

931
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:47,476
So yeah, it's still not quite there, I guess.

932
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:53,712
I think so. I mean the same again as creative restrictions. It wouldn't have been this game, but it would have been something else

933
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:57,815
And you just work with whatever creative restrictions you have but imagine like all the particles

934
00:55:57,815 --> 00:56:02,759
You'll never get down on 360. Yeah, all the lighting's real time all the

935
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:06,282
I mean 60 frames per second, so there's a lot of visual stuff. That's happening as well

936
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:10,986
It wouldn't be just audio that would be affected. Yeah a lot of stuff. Yeah. No just curious about on the audio side. Yeah

937
00:56:10,986 --> 00:56:15,930
Yeah, thank you. Cool. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming to the talk guys. I really appreciate it
