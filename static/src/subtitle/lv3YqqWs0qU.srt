1
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:07,235
Thank you so much for coming.

2
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:09,616
I wasn't, I mean, Friday morning after this week.

3
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:12,897
It's amazing that anyone can get up this early at all.

4
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm Ingvild, and I run a small studio

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,380
called Henchmen & Gunn out of Norway.

6
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:21,541
And last year, oh, by the way,

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,723
if you can turn off your noise-making devices,

8
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:26,564
that would be great.

9
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:31,026
Yeah, I run a company called Henchman & Goon,

10
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:34,829
and last year we released our game, Pod, to Nintendo Switch,

11
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:38,111
and we just launched on PS4 last month.

12
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,974
One of my main tasks on Pod was art direction,

13
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,915
and that's what I'll be talking about today

14
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:44,916
for the most part.

15
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,558
But first, I want to show you our launch trailer,

16
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,280
so you can keep what I'm talking about fresh in mind.

17
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:06,771
Remember to subscribe!

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,561
There we go.

19
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,931
Okay, so I'm going to start at the very beginning.

20
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:37,593
When we were developing PODE, we had some guiding principles that we stuck to.

21
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:43,655
The idea was to make a family-friendly game, not necessarily a children's game, but a game

22
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:49,037
children could participate in playing and enjoy without feeling left out or unable to

23
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:49,558
contribute.

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,674
We wanted to stay clear of any negative action.

25
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,316
Even on violent games today,

26
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,438
have you destroy objects for loot or materials,

27
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:01,140
but we wanted everything to be about growth

28
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,320
and positive actions.

29
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,902
So that meant no negative impact on the game world,

30
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,843
and everything you do as a player

31
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,005
should be about adding something to your surroundings.

32
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,247
We wanted a relaxing game,

33
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,589
which meant we had to stay clear of any stressful situation.

34
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,031
So there's no time pressure, no enemies, no danger,

35
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,012
and no dying in our game.

36
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:29,488
We wanted it to be accessible to anyone regardless of age, location, or level of education, which meant no text and no speech.

37
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,954
We wanted the game to promote positivity and compassion, to connect people and make them want to help each other.

38
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:41,781
And lastly, we wanted the possibility for asymmetric co-op when playing Mint with kids or inexperienced players.

39
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,889
These guidelines had a big impact on the visual direction that we took.

40
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,473
Having a slow-paced game where people spend a lot of time in one place solving puzzles

41
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,576
meant the surroundings had to be interesting and engaging.

42
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:58,619
It needed to be bright, positive, eye-catching and interesting to look at.

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,004
It had to be a pleasant place, cozy and relaxing, a place where you'd want to hang out.

44
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,847
And we wanted to give it a feeling of mystery to push the player to explore,

45
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:11,711
make them want to know more about the world and characters and background.

46
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,049
The asymmetric gameplay meant the less active player needed stuff to do.

47
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,611
They should be able to interact with their surroundings, not just for puzzle solving.

48
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:25,974
And things had to feel alive, and it had to be fun and interesting during downtime.

49
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:30,417
We wanted them to be able to play around with the world, twirl in the grass, splash in the

50
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,659
water, and paint in the world as they played.

51
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:38,640
The world also needed to reinforce the positivity of the theme and morale of the game.

52
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:44,405
We did want mystery and secrets, but nothing scary, so that had to really come through in the atmosphere.

53
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:50,289
We wanted interaction, but without negative results, so anything you make happen in the game should give you a good feeling.

54
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,191
And we wanted there to be a positive change from start to finish.

55
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:58,194
Give the player the feeling that they had a positive impact on the world.

56
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:04,238
So when you start a level, it's dull and barren, but when you finish, it's lush and colorful, and it feels inviting.

57
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:12,357
We didn't really have a clear idea of what PoE would look like, and the early concepts didn't have any particular direction,

58
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:15,319
but one thing that stayed consistent are the characters.

59
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,483
They are the focus of the game, and for the story to work, we needed the player to feel connection to them.

60
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:27,532
As we explored, this cute, cartoony style started to emerge, but we still didn't have a clear direction.

61
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:30,535
So we kind of turned to games and movies we like for inspiration.

62
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:36,299
And what stuck out to us was the cultural influences that you see in a lot of things.

63
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,402
For example, you see a lot of Japanese influences in pop culture today.

64
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:47,368
And this sort of had us switch our focus a little bit and look at our own culture and maybe try to build on that.

65
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:49,908
So history time.

66
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,869
I love history time, it's fun.

67
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,510
Since the Viking era, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark

68
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,110
have been in and out of unions.

69
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,271
The latest union involving all three was the Kalmar Union,

70
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,972
which ended in 1521 when Sweden withdrew

71
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:04,673
and elected their own king.

72
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,693
And the Danish king and nobles decided that Norway

73
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,634
should become a dependency of Denmark.

74
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:13,755
So fast forward to 1814, Denmark was forced

75
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:16,096
to give Norway to Sweden due to intricacies

76
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,256
of the Napoleonic Wars.

77
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,962
Norway, unaware of the treaty between Sweden and Denmark, was pissed off, which prompted

78
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:29,484
the writing of our own constitution, leading to full liberation in 1905 and the importation

79
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,045
of a Danish prince to be our king.

80
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:36,687
And backtracking a little bit, Norway went on a quest for its soul.

81
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,461
In the mid-1800s, the National Romantic Movement in arts was big in the Nordics,

82
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:43,202
but in Norway it became more.

83
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:47,984
It became about figuring out what is actually Norwegian.

84
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:51,225
What were we without the influence of Sweden and Denmark?

85
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,488
And it's been an important and defining era in Norwegian cultural history,

86
00:06:56,948 --> 00:07:01,410
which is still very present today in both art, literature, architecture, and politics.

87
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,482
So going back to my previous points,

88
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,984
we now had something that fit all the criteria

89
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,705
we'd set for the visual design.

90
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,207
It's bright and colorful, it's eye-catching,

91
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,568
and it's interesting to look at.

92
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,931
It's pleasant and cozy, the motifs are relaxing,

93
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,572
and the environments are beautiful.

94
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:21,835
It's mysterious, especially the landscapes.

95
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,716
You kind of want to enter them and explore,

96
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,658
and there's almost a supernatural atmosphere to them.

97
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,407
So finally having a solid direction,

98
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,348
we started going deeper into the material

99
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,829
to identify the main visual characteristics of the era.

100
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,650
And we found four cornerstones to build our visual design on.

101
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,812
You have colorful swirly plants and flowers,

102
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:46,313
which are found in rose paintings, embroidery,

103
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:47,133
and carvings.

104
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,194
We have evocative natural environments

105
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,755
with a fairy tale-like atmosphere.

106
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:58,257
A maximalistic expression, I mean, everything is in abundance and excessively ornate.

107
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:00,861
And there's a lot of fine detail.

108
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,687
You see this in art, jewelry, and everything, as well as everyday objects.

109
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,902
So having our foundation, we now needed to look at what challenges we would be facing.

110
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:19,365
Apart from the obvious challenges of building a super detailed, organic, growing and ever-changing

111
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:24,408
world, the two things that had the potential to get us in some real trouble were that we

112
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:28,650
were a very small team and we had very limited time and money to make our game.

113
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,002
At this point, the company had just split in half,

114
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,163
so we started the project with only four people.

115
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,806
And due to the split, and that we wanted time

116
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:45,027
to work on game development,

117
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,289
we had drastically cut down on contract work.

118
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,330
So we certainly had some challenges

119
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,311
to overcome during this project.

120
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,753
None of us had been doing this on a big scale before,

121
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,355
so we had to figure out everything as we went.

122
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:59,076
Eventually, we did find the funds

123
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:01,278
and we were able to grow our team to seven,

124
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,139
but that's another story.

125
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:10,824
Anyway, we didn't want to scrap the game or stray from the core idea,

126
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:14,045
so we needed to find ways to efficiently produce a lot of content

127
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:15,865
in as little time as possible.

128
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:20,107
The most important thing we did was to create modular world building

129
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,187
and decorative assets.

130
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,689
We made a small set of generic assets for the entire game,

131
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,490
including walls, floors, filler plants, and some decorative elements.

132
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,471
And from these, we created multiple combinations,

133
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,672
some of them generic and some of them level-specific.

134
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:40,596
Then we had a small set of level-specific plant assets to give each level its distinct look.

135
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:48,468
Mushrooms and pine cones for the pine woods level, and cloudberries and cotton grass for the birch woods, and so on, and so on.

136
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,349
We did the same with textures.

137
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,072
We had some generic textures with a few variations

138
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,116
and level-specific textures with different colors and patterns.

139
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,100
And this approach makes each level feel new

140
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,702
in spite of the reuse of assets.

141
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,185
Unique floral and crystal combinations

142
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,708
give each level the feel of its own shape and texture.

143
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:13,095
The combination of generic assets and level-specific assets give the impression of a much bigger variety than there actually is,

144
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:18,140
and the unique color scheme for each level reinforces the idea that when you enter a new level,

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,723
everything is completely different from what you've seen so far.

146
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,283
Another thing we did was to make small playable areas.

147
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:30,567
There are nine different levels in the game, all based on different parts of Norwegian nature.

148
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,049
And each level is split into smaller rooms.

149
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:37,252
Varying the size of the rooms prevents the feeling of repetition.

150
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,135
So going from a tiny room to a more open one,

151
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:44,499
shifting from moving in depth to moving horizontally or vertically.

152
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:48,225
Completely closed in rooms versus open area ones.

153
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,590
Always keeping the navigational space relatively small,

154
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,294
but giving the illusion of big, open, bottomless spaces.

155
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:06,045
The small size means there is less repetition in use of different plants and combinations.

156
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:11,670
So we could create variation in flora not only from level to level, but also from room to room.

157
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:16,975
Introducing new level specific plants and crystals and combinations the further into a level you go

158
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,118
makes it feel like the world is constantly evolving throughout the game.

159
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,474
Having a fixed camera made it easier to have control of floral compositions.

160
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:30,678
All compositions are set up to grow in a pattern relative to the camera.

161
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,423
This gives a less random and more decorative feel, emphasizing the influence of traditional

162
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:40,849
rose painting, which would be incredibly difficult to pull off if the player could view the compositions

163
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,890
from different angles.

164
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:48,446
Having full control of what the player would see at any given time made optimization easier

165
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,868
as we could limit the use of growing and moving objects.

166
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,831
And it's what allowed us to do grass the way we did as well.

167
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:59,056
It looks absolutely horrible from the wrong angle and it's nothing but visual trickery

168
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,199
that makes it look lush and beautiful.

169
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:06,744
It also opened up for extensive use of fake lighting.

170
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,768
All the bleeding volumetric light in this game is fake.

171
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,073
It's all just transparent gradients on planes.

172
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:19,877
And these are also used to create color gradients in some places,

173
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,479
as well as shades and vignettes.

174
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,144
And this only works because we have 100% control of the angle it's seen from.

175
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:30,780
When it comes to animation, we face some issues.

176
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,062
Getting the growing right was very important

177
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,304
for our idea to work.

178
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:36,887
There was no point having a living, growing world

179
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,388
if it didn't move or feel right.

180
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,511
And this became a constant battle

181
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,553
between optimization and our visual goals.

182
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,855
We had growing moving stuff absolutely everywhere.

183
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,536
So even in the smallest levels, we had latency issues.

184
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,837
Most objects were OK to work with.

185
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,339
We could just use scaling and a bit of rotation.

186
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:57,260
And this worked for crystals, moss, small flowers,

187
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,561
and all kinds of rigid objects, where we just

188
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,302
used simple low poly models and no animation.

189
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:04,703
Sorry, no idle animation.

190
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,323
Plants and combinations were a bit more tricky.

191
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,424
We had a lot of swirly plants and rose painting,

192
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,005
although it has no animation,

193
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,226
the dynamics of the paintings makes it easy

194
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,887
to imagine the movements they should have.

195
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,788
It needed to feel like it was growing

196
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,168
in an organic and natural way.

197
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:23,509
We started out with a lot of morphing objects,

198
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:27,111
but luckily we discovered that this was only necessary

199
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:27,971
for a few things.

200
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,312
And combined with scale and rotation,

201
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:33,413
that it gave the impression of natural growth.

202
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:38,920
So for this, the amount of objects actually worked in our favor, which was nice for a change.

203
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:46,069
And combined with the speed of growth, it helped the illusion, as you never really focus on one single object.

204
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,759
We used the same approach for idle animation,

205
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,802
where after a plant has grown, we switched it

206
00:13:53,903 --> 00:14:00,688
from a dynamic object to a rigid object with slight rotation,

207
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,310
just to give the impression of constant movement in life.

208
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,233
And this had a massive impact on latency issues as well.

209
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:13,608
For plant and crystal clusters, we started out with everything being separately triggered to grow.

210
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:18,809
We figured we wanted people to move around and kind of just like make everything grow as they went.

211
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:23,910
But we kind of discovered that this wouldn't work with large collections of plants.

212
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,111
And we wanted control of how the combinations grew and looked,

213
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:32,632
and for it to be less of a hassle for the player to grow everything in a room.

214
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:37,113
So we decided on using a few triggers spread out through each level.

215
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:43,918
to set off a cascading bloom, and we created a tool to set up our growing objects in sequence.

216
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:50,224
This also let us control the timing between each step in a sequence, so everything could be perfectly timed.

217
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:57,116
The grass is a combination of single triggers and sequencing

218
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,797
to give the player a bit more freedom.

219
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,318
So if you trigger the grass and stay still,

220
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:02,798
it'll keep growing,

221
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,659
but the spread is slower than the character's movement.

222
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,860
So if you move around while using the glow ability,

223
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,461
you'll get to paint it in yourself.

224
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,802
All these things combined gives the player

225
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,943
the impression of full freedom to grow the world,

226
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:17,103
but with us having enough control

227
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,764
so the world feels cohesive

228
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,345
and everything grows with a nice flow.

229
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,597
So what did we learn from making PODE?

230
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,440
It's been a very steep learning curve for us,

231
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,141
being a small and inexperienced team,

232
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:35,063
and we certainly made our share of mistakes along the way.

233
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,865
Some of the things we're taking away from this

234
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:39,766
is you need to work smart.

235
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,447
Streamline your pipeline, because with a small team,

236
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,609
there is absolutely no time for idleness.

237
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,090
Make few and reusable assets.

238
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,891
You really just need enough variation

239
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,512
not to hinder the creative process

240
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,053
or make the game feel repetitive.

241
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,520
You need to be constantly cutting everything not vital to your core goals.

242
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,541
I mean, the phrase, kill your darlings, is cliche for a reason, right?

243
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:07,623
You simply can't create quality content if you don't have the time or resources to do so.

244
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:10,623
You have to be ruthless. Build your game with a machete.

245
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,224
Focus on what's most important and perfect that.

246
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,639
You have to make sure not to lose track of your goals.

247
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,161
Visual design is really just a tool to help tell a story.

248
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,522
And for us, it's a growing, evolving world

249
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,543
telling the story of a growing friendship

250
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,623
and evolving emotions.

251
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,384
Our increasingly detailed and beautiful world

252
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,165
mirrors how empathy, selflessness, and cooperation

253
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,346
makes the world more beautiful and thus scary.

254
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,007
And entering into uncertainty together

255
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,208
may reveal things about yourself you didn't know.

256
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,789
And lastly, fake everything.

257
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,150
If the player can't see it, why bother?

258
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,281
So by trying our best to follow these rules,

259
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,323
in the end, we managed, without mentionable resources,

260
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:53,486
to create a finely detailed, excessively decorated world

261
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,508
with a distinct, recognizable look

262
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:57,289
that sets it apart from other games,

263
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,271
and that we feel helped tell the story

264
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,612
of our two star-crossed friends.

265
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:03,294
And that's it.

266
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,336
Thank you so much for coming to my talk.

267
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,788
I think we have time for a few questions.

268
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,069
Yeah?

269
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:19,771
So if anyone has any questions for me.

270
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,333
I think we have microphones on either side of the,

271
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:24,554
or in either aisle here.

272
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:28,357
Okay.

273
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,538
Have a good day everyone.

274
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,739
Question?

275
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh, you have a question, okay.

276
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:42,711
I was curious, since everything's about the growth of plants, how your approach to differentiating

277
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:49,555
levels from each other through color was, since you're probably going to tend towards

278
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:53,317
staying towards greenery, how you work within that to differentiate.

279
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:58,959
So we, like I said, we had, there were the nine different levels and each of those are

280
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,580
based on different parts of Norwegian nature.

281
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:06,743
So we have kind of a level that represents the fjords and we have one representing the

282
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:08,844
high mountains, the glaciers and stuff like that.

283
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:15,127
So what we did was taking our color schemes from each of those areas and kind of finding

284
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:20,611
What is unique to that area and how can we use the color scheme

285
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:25,255
on our already existing assets to have that come through in the game.

286
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:27,036
Thank you.

287
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,178
Hi, everyone.

288
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:33,061
How long did it take to develop the game from start to finish

289
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:37,644
and how much of that time was spent on the pre-production and the art style?

290
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:43,094
Oh, so we started the game in June of 2015.

291
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:48,176
So it took roughly three years for the entire thing to be finished.

292
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,658
And to be honest, it was, being such a small team,

293
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,098
being only four people in the start,

294
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,919
it's a lot of back and forth between all, like,

295
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,560
finding a style, starting the production.

296
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,542
So everything was sort of parallel for the first few years.

297
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,003
And although we had...

298
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,490
We had the direction that we wanted to take.

299
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,612
It was kind of a long way to get that,

300
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:17,273
to finally kind of nail that look.

301
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,355
So it's a difficult question to answer

302
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:21,856
because it's not like the first three months

303
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:22,617
are a pre-production.

304
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:23,417
Yeah, no worries.

305
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:23,677
Cheers.

306
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,320
Okay.

307
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:29,941
Well, thank you so much for coming.

308
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:34,264
And remember to fill out the evaluation form

309
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,265
that you should have gotten on your email already.

310
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,112
And happy GDC, everyone.
