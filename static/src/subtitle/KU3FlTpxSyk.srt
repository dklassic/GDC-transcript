00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:13,556
Hi, so I'm Tony Howard Arias.

2
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:19,639
I am the co-writer and game designer for Scarlet Hollow, which is a choice-driven horror visual

3
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:26,243
novel that sits at the intersection of Twin Peaks, Gravity Falls, and Life is Strange.

4
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:29,245
It's really weird to be in front of a crowd like this

5
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,927
after the past couple years, so forgive me

6
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,288
if I get a little nervous.

7
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:39,392
And I'm here to talk about ways to think about player choice

8
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:42,694
in your choice-driven narrative games in terms of both making

9
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,696
it feel like the decisions in your game

10
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:48,758
matter to your players and not burning yourself out

11
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,701
or being unable to finish your project because of just,

12
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,622
like, scope creep.

13
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,764
So to do a bit of an overview, when you're working on a choice-driven game, it's always

14
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:05,006
going to be a balancing act between maintaining your cohesive narrative, making sure your

15
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:10,188
choices fall within the cohesive story you're trying to tell, the struggles of exponential

16
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:16,030
scaling, so if you have too many major decisions, incredibly easy for that to just get out of

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,872
hand and lead to an unfinishable project, and then, of course, delivering impact for

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,532
your choices.

19
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:24,193
And impact is the term I'd like to use here

20
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:28,093
to describe the measure of your players feeling

21
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:31,454
like the choices in your game matter.

22
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:33,574
Something I want to stress to the above point

23
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:36,395
is that as narrative designers for video games,

24
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,135
we are not tabletop GMs.

25
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:42,516
And by nature, our medium is limited by finite choice

26
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,237
because we can't just go off and immediately react

27
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:47,277
to what our players are doing.

28
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:50,318
So you have to make sure that your choices count.

29
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,199
Building on that, creating impact is a function of knowing

30
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:58,000
when you need to put in the blood, sweat, and tears

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,242
it takes to really make your narrative branch out

32
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:05,483
in interesting ways, and knowing when to use misdirection

33
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:09,184
and illusion to make your players feel like there's

34
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:12,766
a lot more while still managing the scope of your project.

35
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:19,932
um something to speak to on that note is that you know your back end, you know how things work,

36
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:26,278
your players don't, which is both a blessing and a curse. Cause in some ways they will assume

37
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:32,483
things work differently and that it's easier to make more branching than you actually can, but

38
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:37,648
you can also find interesting ways to surprise your players and keep them guessing.

39
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,394
All of this, creating impact, comes down to player emotions.

40
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:46,816
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter

41
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:50,619
if you have a massive fork at the beginning of your story

42
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:54,543
that leads to 100,000 words of different content

43
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:57,525
in either direction, because if people don't feel

44
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,388
like that's the case, you haven't succeeded at your job.

45
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:07,074
So focusing in on those emotions, knowing your players, paying attention to their feedback,

46
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:11,698
and understanding why they feel the way they do is vital here.

47
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:17,363
Now we're going to talk about impact, kind of of three varieties or techniques.

48
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:23,672
I like to refer to these as cascades, callbacks, and heuristics, and we'll be going in depth

49
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:27,217
in each of them, and we will be defining each of them as we go.

50
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:30,422
We're going to start with cascades, which...

51
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,113
I would define as what most people are talking about

52
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:39,134
when they reference a big decision in a game

53
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:42,636
or say that choices matter in a game.

54
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:46,018
Choices in a cascading decision generally promise

55
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,679
to permanently alter the game or world

56
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,080
that the game takes place in in a major way.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,226
So taking an example of the first big cascading decision in our game, you run into monsters

58
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:05,434
in the woods and you are stuck with the dilemma of saving a farmer or saving an adorable 17-year-old

59
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:10,319
pug who, depending on how you've built your character, maybe you can talk to the pug too.

60
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,400
Most people save the pug.

61
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,736
In terms of what this looks like in our game,

62
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,697
we've got the top path where you save the pug early on.

63
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:22,998
You can see death of Duke the farmer.

64
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:27,859
This leads to a breakaway scene with the police.

65
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:33,161
It also leads to an encounter with his son later on,

66
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,721
where you have to sort of justify and come to terms

67
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,002
with the decision you've made.

68
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,042
And Stella, your companion who owns the pug.

69
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:43,805
continues to carry her around with her the rest of the game.

70
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:49,508
So we're also differentiating that branch via different art assets.

71
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:54,552
And then on the bottom you see the bummer path that not a lot of people get to see.

72
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:57,673
Pug gets grabbed by monsters.

73
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,756
Awful heart-to-heart conversation in the woods about what it's like to lose a dog.

74
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:05,858
But you don't have to justify getting someone's dad killed.

75
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:07,014
Yay.

76
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,596
So there's a bunch of advantages

77
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,718
to using Cascades as a primary technique.

78
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:14,879
The first is that they're pretty easy to set up.

79
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,762
They are a situation with a limited number of choices.

80
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,043
You should probably put a lot of care

81
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,525
into what those choices are, but the setup is simple.

82
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,685
They're also attention-grabbing.

83
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,106
They're memorable, and they're the sort of thing

84
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:31,306
people talk about.

85
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,667
People will talk about whether they saved the pug,

86
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,548
and they will admonish the folks who

87
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:39,389
did not save the pug online.

88
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,650
And because they're limited in scope,

89
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,951
you usually only need to keep track of a single flag.

90
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,492
Players, when they see one of these decisions,

91
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:51,513
also know what they're going to be presented with.

92
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,094
And if you actually pull it off, because these things are

93
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,394
really hard to pull off.

94
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,141
It's super impressive and again, people will talk about it.

95
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,303
And that leads us to the challenges.

96
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:04,805
The first is a scaling issue.

97
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,646
Impacts that deviate too far from each other

98
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,288
present exponential scaling problems with your narrative,

99
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:13,770
especially if you have multiple cascading decisions

100
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,250
like back to back in one game.

101
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:22,397
Players have also been burned by games that say choices matter, like many, many times before.

102
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:27,383
It doesn't matter how well you handle it, because folks have been burned, some people will get mad at you.

103
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:33,689
These decisions, because they're major turning points, are also very emotionally charged,

104
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,534
and again, some people will get mad at you for that.

105
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,631
There's also, getting back to the scaling challenges,

106
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,512
there is a delicate line to walk

107
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,493
between making your cascades feel important,

108
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:50,516
giving them impact, and being able to finish your game.

109
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:53,297
It's also easy to over-promise and under-deliver

110
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,318
because, again, people are familiar with this

111
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,319
and they're going to hold you to very high standards,

112
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,902
and pulling it off is both extremely labor-intensive and...

113
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,505
subject to high levels of scrutiny,

114
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:09,408
because there are always going to be few cascading decisions,

115
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,451
and people are going to know what they are.

116
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,453
That being said, we've got some tips and tricks

117
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,035
for pulling them off, too.

118
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,477
The most important one is for any sort

119
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,138
of major decision in your game, you

120
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:24,241
want to think about how you can write it to be modular.

121
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,362
And when I'm using the word modular here,

122
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,265
I'm talking about making it so that.

123
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:33,867
bubbles of new content that come from that decision

124
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,728
can slot into the main narrative.

125
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:39,590
So you're not, instead of making, say,

126
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,872
a tree or roots that expand forever,

127
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,532
you're expanding a bit with new content,

128
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,493
you're contracting to a common point,

129
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:47,634
and you're expanding again.

130
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,075
While you're doing this, it's important to think about

131
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:53,337
what purpose these decisions serve for your narrative.

132
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:58,707
In a lot of ways, they can flavor your player's experience with your game.

133
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,751
This slide indicates another.

134
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:04,715
big cascading decision we have in episode three of our game.

135
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:09,159
The premise of Scarlet Hollow is that you are coming to town

136
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,960
for an aunt you've never met's funeral.

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,744
You've been invited by your cousin who's on the left there.

138
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,345
She's a terrible person.

139
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:19,508
She's really mean to you.

140
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,670
And a major theme of the story is

141
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,212
about what your relationship with her is.

142
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,315
Do you try and build a bond?

143
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,696
Do you brush her off?

144
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,085
And in episode three, we have this central set piece

145
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,607
that's a ghost hunt, and there's a decision of,

146
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:38,489
do you invite her along with you?

147
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,751
If you do, you get to experience this ghost hunt

148
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:41,952
with her at your side.

149
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:46,175
If not, you get this other spooky guy on the,

150
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:50,418
I guess it's the right for you guys, to follow you as well.

151
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:55,411
This kind of comes back to a later point on this slide,

152
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,715
which is you should always avoid making people feel

153
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,599
like they're losing content when they make these decisions.

154
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,722
One of the biggest impacts you can think

155
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:06,605
of a cascading decision having is a character death.

156
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,541
And if a character dies, you should make content

157
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,002
about their death, so it doesn't feel like people

158
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,163
are min-maxing their playthrough to get

159
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:19,324
as much content as possible.

160
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,785
Talking, going back to what I mentioned earlier

161
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:25,526
with kind of bubbles and coming back to a common ground,

162
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,247
if you're making a choices matter game

163
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,348
that you intend to finish, your story is always going

164
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,649
to have to revert to the mean in some way.

165
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,090
It's always going to have to join back together.

166
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,711
but you can focus on making the process,

167
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:44,732
the journey of that mean reversion more impactful.

168
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:47,493
So again, with the episode three choice here,

169
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,293
you get two very different perspectives

170
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:53,834
on an hour long segment of the game

171
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,095
that change the themes of the story

172
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,075
and shine different lights

173
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,856
on different parts of our mystery.

174
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:05,001
The next type of impact I'd like to talk about are callbacks.

175
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,983
These are really straightforward.

176
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,286
A callback is a reference to something

177
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:11,549
that happened earlier in a story,

178
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,091
specifically to a player choice.

179
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,174
But it makes this reference without interrupting

180
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:19,077
the flow of the narrative or creating new scenes.

181
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,220
The choice it can reference can be big.

182
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,382
I like a cascade.

183
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,785
Stella mentions, oh, you saved my pug.

184
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,328
That's great, or is sad about it.

185
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,690
Or it could be small.

186
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,954
So the small example we have here is in episode one,

187
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:37,159
when your cousin tells you that she is a coal magnate,

188
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,523
you can respond by saying, hashtag girl boss.

189
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,886
And then in episode three, she references the fact

190
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,807
that you said hashtag girl boss, if that's

191
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,288
something that you said.

192
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,790
You can track all of these things with Boolean flags.

193
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,831
That's pretty much it.

194
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,093
There's a lot of advantages to using callbacks.

195
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,614
The first is that they are one and done.

196
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,157
So adding more of them is just linear scaling over time.

197
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:02,959
You don't have to worry about five callbacks taking

198
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,601
20 times the energy of one.

199
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,082
You just do them.

200
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,203
It changes a line or two of dialogue, and you're done.

201
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:18,348
Because when, because writers, game writers often think about creating impact in terms of those cascading decisions earlier,

202
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:24,431
these aren't as common, so your players also don't expect them, which makes it easy to under-promise and over-deliver.

203
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,573
So with the episode three moment,

204
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,555
a player sees that we tracked the fact that they said

205
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,957
hashtag girl boss in episode one.

206
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,399
Suddenly, they're taken aback, it's unexpected.

207
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,341
They start wondering, what else are we tracking?

208
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:41,984
So even though that's a small callback,

209
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,586
it makes the breadth and depth of the experience

210
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,907
seem a lot more significant.

211
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,629
They're also personalized,

212
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,130
and they make your players feel good.

213
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,952
There's challenges with them too.

214
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:56,837
You can't rely singularly on callbacks

215
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,278
because then you have a script

216
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,761
that is mostly just a straight shot

217
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,422
and doesn't really deviate.

218
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,885
People won't feel like their choices matter.

219
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:08,289
You also need a lot of them for your players to notice.

220
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,251
In Scarlet Hollow, we probably have.

221
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,641
somewhere between 500 and 1,000 of these things

222
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:15,822
scattered all throughout in the first couple episodes.

223
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:21,006
And by extension, because you need a lot of callbacks

224
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,947
to make them effective, they require a lot of flags

225
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:27,850
and booleans in your code to cover all of your bases.

226
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,971
Again, we use like 1,000 and track everything

227
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,332
players can say.

228
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,253
Writing-wise, they can also require

229
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,235
you to have a bit of encyclopedic knowledge

230
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,255
of your own narrative.

231
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:42,367
and it can really break your brain if you rely on them too much, just keeping everything

232
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,328
straight.

233
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,650
That being said, there's a few tips and tricks for using these things.

234
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:51,373
Something that we really like to do is specifically using callbacks to make our dialogue feel

235
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:55,776
less awkward and to make conversations with characters flow better.

236
00:12:55,776 --> 00:13:00,540
If you say something that you'd already said earlier in the game to a character and they

237
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,181
call you out on that or they act...

238
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,381
a little confused.

239
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,342
That's something that doesn't actually take a lot of effort

240
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:08,624
to put into your game, but it makes your characters feel

241
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:09,164
more organic.

242
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,426
And again, it makes the depth and breadth

243
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:16,568
of what you're doing seem that much more impressive.

244
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,609
I also just make it a general best practice

245
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:23,411
to flag literally every single line of dialogue

246
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,913
you can say in Scarlet Hollow with a unique Boolean,

247
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:28,534
because you never know when something

248
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,855
might come in handy later.

249
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:34,489
Um, so, you know, pretty standard code stuff there.

250
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:40,076
Make sure you name your variables in an easy to search and easy to break down way.

251
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:46,163
Make sure that you're, you know, defining them and storing them in the right places.

252
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,405
Um, all that good stuff.

253
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:51,631
The third type of impact I'd like to talk about are heuristics.

254
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:56,115
So if you've taken an introductory psychology course,

255
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,258
this term might ring a bell to you.

256
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:01,321
A heuristic is essentially a problem-solving technique

257
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:05,125
that relies on simplification to quickly arrive at.

258
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:09,526
something you might think is a good enough answer

259
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:14,107
to a problem or question, often at the expense of accuracy.

260
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:16,307
So to use a pretty standard example,

261
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:19,328
you might think, I've only known one person,

262
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:22,028
or I haven't known anybody who's been struck by lightning.

263
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,929
I don't need to know the exact rate at which Americans

264
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,889
are struck or killed by lightning every year

265
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,330
to be able to say, it's really uncommon.

266
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,450
It probably won't happen to me.

267
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,192
An example of a heuristic that isn't working well is,

268
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,753
I saw two news stories about people

269
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:37,814
who were struck by lightning.

270
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,495
It must happen all the time.

271
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:44,498
The most common example you'll see of these things in games,

272
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:49,100
especially visual novels, are affection meters.

273
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,383
But doing that across one axis,

274
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:57,482
has some issues.

275
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,743
My biggest issue is it can't handle bootlickers.

276
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,884
I think we've all played games where you're in a dating sim

277
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,545
and instead of treating the character you want to romance

278
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:11,027
as a human being, you spend some time thinking about

279
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,527
what can I say to make this person like me,

280
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:15,728
regardless of whether or not you're actually

281
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:18,989
being authentic or you have those shared interests,

282
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,230
which is something that I don't like.

283
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:25,156
So our approach to this in Scarlet Hollow is we use a five-axis

284
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:29,319
and ten-variable heuristic-based relationship system

285
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,341
to measure the player relationship

286
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,003
with every major character in the game.

287
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:38,126
So to just talk about some of these axes,

288
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:40,227
we have one that's like openness versus closeness,

289
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,949
which is representative of the emotional trust

290
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,251
and vulnerability of a relationship.

291
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:47,312
And then we also have one that's, you know,

292
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:52,776
agreeableness versus adversarialness, which is politeness versus headbutting.

293
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:57,279
We have, um, you know, boldness versus passiveness.

294
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,841
How brave does someone else think you are?

295
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:05,504
Um, and then major decisions, uh, major decisions like ones that lead to

296
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:08,866
cascading impact can change these variables in big ways.

297
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:13,208
Going back to the episode one decision with a dog we were talking about, if

298
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,690
you let Stella's dog get grabbed by monsters,

299
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,473
she closes up emotionally.

300
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:22,634
So it will be more difficult to get her

301
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,696
to open up about her feelings,

302
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,857
but she won't necessarily be hostile to you

303
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,598
because that's measured across a different axis.

304
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,760
And then on top of those major decisions,

305
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,282
we also change these variables in smaller ways

306
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,123
for pretty much every dialogue option.

307
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:39,647
So you have two things working together,

308
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,671
big relationship-defining events that move meters a lot,

309
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:45,955
but then there are smaller ways to influence things.

310
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:49,079
You don't need 10 variables to do this,

311
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,281
and there's definitely some that I use

312
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,783
more than others in our game.

313
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,485
You probably want more than one or two.

314
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,441
Some of the advantages to using a heuristic-based system

315
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:00,382
in your game.

316
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:05,363
First one is that people use them all the time in real life.

317
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:08,144
If you think about your best friend

318
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,745
and how you feel about them, you probably

319
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,345
think about the general vibe they give you,

320
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,866
instead of pulling up a list of every interaction

321
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,747
you've ever had with them and remembering specific events,

322
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,347
because that would be too much.

323
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,228
So people are wired to think.

324
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:29,472
using Heuristics, and if you use a system like that in your game, it can make your characters feel more organic.

325
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:34,895
You also don't need to memorize or remember a thousand specific details like you do with callbacks,

326
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:41,538
because again, you're using a system to simplify some of this. We have an example of

327
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,659
how we call our system here, where

328
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:48,522
it's character Kanika. She's kind of the scully of the group.

329
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:55,025
has a very different vibe depending on how brave she thinks you are, how emotionally

330
00:17:55,025 --> 00:18:01,432
vulnerable she is with you, as kind of the events of the story chip away at her disbelief

331
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,134
in the supernatural.

332
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:08,481
So here we're actually able to call on multiple aspects of the relationship system to decide.

333
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,823
Is that wall of skepticism breaking,

334
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:13,324
or is she holding strong?

335
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:17,347
You can also use these,

336
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,669
you can use heuristics to add flavor and nuance

337
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:22,291
to both cascades and callbacks.

338
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,832
So with Stella and her dog,

339
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:27,434
if you're talking about what happened in the woods,

340
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:30,677
she might have different things to say,

341
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,578
different things she trusts you with,

342
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,579
depending on how you've built that relationship.

343
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,940
So within that major kind of cascading impact,

344
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,221
you have all of these little smaller deviations

345
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:46,702
that again make the ocean of your game feel a lot vaster.

346
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:50,063
Another really cool thing with them is they're

347
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,764
essentially modular by nature.

348
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:56,385
So you can slot them in wherever without deviating too much

349
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,785
and you can construct them as sliding scales

350
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:03,266
so you have a wide range of character reactions

351
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,827
and relationships you can pull from.

352
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:12,450
Using a few examples, what if somebody thinks you're super brave but really likes you in a romantic way,

353
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,352
they might try and toughen up to impress you,

354
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:21,354
versus if they don't think you're brave but they like you in a romantic way,

355
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:25,536
they might be, you know, a little more open about their concerns.

356
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,062
There's a bunch of challenges with these two.

357
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:30,623
They're difficult to set up,

358
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,404
so if you have hundreds of dialogue choices like we have,

359
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,565
you need to think hundreds of times

360
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,507
about how each of those choices impact another character

361
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:39,468
and how they think about you.

362
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:45,461
They also need cascades and callbacks to reach their full effectiveness.

363
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:48,084
They're also only as good as your writers are.

364
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:53,331
This is true of any kind of impact, especially in a game that's mostly writing, but it's

365
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:58,417
much more pronounced here because your writers in any given scene might need to take...

366
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:03,799
Keep three variations of how a character feels in mind,

367
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,479
and think about how those variations might flow

368
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,740
into each other or change the flow of a scene.

369
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,640
This can create a lot of extra complexity

370
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
in your narrative, which is a good thing,

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,341
but can make it harder to write.

372
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:17,861
And if you over-rely on these and over-simplify

373
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:22,722
the kind of human relationships you're tracking too much,

374
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,483
it'll make your narrative feel too gamey.

375
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:28,523
See my earlier bootlicker comments.

376
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,032
So some tips and tricks to using heuristics.

377
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,355
Once you have them set up,

378
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:39,919
they're one of the more flexible tools in your arsenal.

379
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,721
You can use them to do a lot of things.

380
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:45,246
Some of the stuff we use are calling on them

381
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:46,648
to contextually change.

382
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:49,251
music in scenes.

383
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,314
Going back to this last slide,

384
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:54,177
this is spending some quality time with your cousin.

385
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:57,762
The image on the left is you asking her a probing question

386
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:58,803
when she hates you.

387
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,947
And the image on the right is asking a probing question

388
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:03,569
where she's starting to trust you.

389
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,451
So in that scene, if you're entering...

390
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:12,938
entering it with like a relationship that's warming up. We play you know a soulful guitar track that

391
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:19,424
kind of reflects on the way her thoughts about you are changing otherwise it's her normal sort of

392
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:22,126
plucky tense strings music.

393
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:25,623
We also use them all the time to just change sprites.

394
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:29,525
Like, we call on these things a bunch to change dialogue

395
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,446
and to change what information people are giving you,

396
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:34,248
but the same line of dialogue with a different sprite,

397
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:36,609
especially if you're not using voice acting,

398
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,111
completely changes the way your players

399
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,072
will read that line of dialogue.

400
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:45,554
So, pretty low effort there to change the flow of a scene

401
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,375
and to make it feel more or less oppressive,

402
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,697
warmer, colder, all of these other things.

403
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:58,657
Mentioned this before, you can use them in conjunction with flag decisions to make them

404
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,421
feel a lot more impactful.

405
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:05,406
So if somebody lost a friend, how much are they willing to open up with you about it?

406
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:11,033
How does your relationship with them change their perspective on the events that are happening

407
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:11,313
to them?

408
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,599
Another cool thing is you can use a heuristic-based system

409
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,061
to change what options are available for big decisions

410
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,843
that lead to cascades.

411
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,524
So this image is from the end of episode three.

412
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,546
You're confronted with a ghost

413
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:27,269
that your great-grandmother killed,

414
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,492
who wants years of your life to kind of be able

415
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:33,995
to move on to the next world.

416
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:41,118
Normally your options are to leave the ghost behind where it can be a dangerous haunting that can hurt people or to make this huge

417
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:48,840
Sacrifice, but if your cousin is with you and you have built that relationship in the in that right way

418
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,462
She'll stop you from stepping in and will take that burden upon herself. So that's

419
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:59,464
That's a way to kind of take the accumulation of hundreds of decisions over the course of

420
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:03,345
a five or six hour game and really make it add up to a new thing.

421
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:04,425
More cool things.

422
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,866
Yeah, saying it again, combine your heuristics with flags.

423
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:12,967
You can also combine your heuristics with other heuristics.

424
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:17,788
So we'll have a lot of checks that are based on, okay.

425
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,078
One, what level of emotional openness

426
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:25,159
does this character have with you?

427
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,220
But then also, what are the other flavors there?

428
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,920
With your cousin, a pretty common one is

429
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,081
she'll start to warm up emotionally,

430
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,101
but she'll still be combative

431
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,522
because she's a combative person.

432
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:40,562
So we'll look at both the information

433
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,943
she's willing to share, but then the tone

434
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,523
that she's willing to share it as well.

435
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:50,396
And then another really neat thing you can do too

436
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,759
is you can use your existing heuristics data

437
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,600
to alter the way that, sorry,

438
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,462
new decisions affect those numbers.

439
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,624
So going back to that hangout with your cousin,

440
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:02,047
your cousin doesn't respond well to people

441
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:06,812
who are nice for the sake of being nice,

442
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,452
and often

443
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:12,227
kind of being overly nice harms the emotional bond

444
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:13,909
you're forming with her,

445
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:16,232
but once that bond's been strengthened,

446
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,316
you being nice feels more genuine to her.

447
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:23,001
So those other axes on the relationship chart

448
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,943
will actually change.

449
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:28,367
based on what other data is already in the system.

450
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,689
So you can create rubber banding effects.

451
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,971
And again, this is a way to simulate real life.

452
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,634
The same thing said by someone you can't stand

453
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:39,177
versus said by your best friend is going to feel

454
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,280
very different and going to impact those relationships

455
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,424
in different ways.

456
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:48,186
Just general takeaways from this.

457
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:55,912
When we're making Scarlet Hollow, we make sure to use all three of those kind of perspectives

458
00:24:55,912 --> 00:25:03,879
on impact for how we shape our narrative, how we shape decisions, and how we shape relationships.

459
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,701
It's so easy to focus on just doing one thing.

460
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:10,104
But if you want players to really feel like the choices in your game matter,

461
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:15,627
you have to come across, you have to come at it from like every single angle.

462
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,029
It's not just enough to have a really effective cascade,

463
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:23,792
they need to be caught off guard by, you know, a very meaningful callback.

464
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,513
They need to be caught off guard by,

465
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:29,116
I thought this playthrough was mostly the same in terms of major decisions,

466
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:32,238
but actually it's different in terms of how characters are responding with me.

467
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:35,743
When you're crafting these choices,

468
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,744
it's important to remember that you're making a narrative game.

469
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,805
You should be constantly asking yourself

470
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:44,927
why your narrative benefits from interactivity,

471
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,168
and you have to use the answers to those questions

472
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,849
to guide your design process.

473
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,530
It's easy to just throw 50 choices on a screen,

474
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,811
but you have to think about what the choices you

475
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:55,932
present your players.

476
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:59,854
will tell you, tell them, and tell your game

477
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:03,517
about how they're engaging with your story.

478
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:05,858
And the most important question of all

479
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:09,320
is that throughout all of this, you should always

480
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,221
be thinking about scale.

481
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:12,882
What's the most important way that you can add just

482
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:15,084
a little more impact to a choice or scene

483
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,665
without breaking your back?

484
00:26:16,665 --> 00:26:19,226
Again, it is a balancing act.

485
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:27,083
and it is very easy to get yourself stuck in a hole where you're never going to finish your game.

486
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:29,738
That's the high level.

487
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:33,140
Happy to take some questions.

488
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,581
Once again, I'm Tony Howard Arias.

489
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,842
I'm one of the co-founders of Black Tabby Games.

490
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,983
You can reach me at email at tonyatblacktabbygames.com.

491
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:43,985
You can follow me on Twitter at Tony Howard Arias.

492
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:44,725
I only lurk there.

493
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:45,786
I don't really post.

494
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:49,968
And then I post all the time on our studio account,

495
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:52,229
which is at Black Tabby Games.

496
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:55,990
So how do we move on to the Q&A part of things?

497
00:26:58,695 --> 00:26:59,516
It's there.

498
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,777
Oh, there's microphones here.

499
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:01,938
So if anyone has questions.

500
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:07,884
Hello, quick question for you.

501
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:08,365
Yeah.

502
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:12,328
How do you think your players would respond

503
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:15,592
to you exposing the heuristics during gameplay?

504
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:23,866
badly. Um, we we keep those hidden uh for a lot of reasons. One, I don't want people

505
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:31,390
nitpicking about it. Two, uh we designed our heuristics the way we did specifically to

506
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:38,915
avoid people gaming the system. So all of the kind of branching decisions in our game, all

507
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:45,718
of the ways relationships can grow are written from this baseline kind of design

508
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:51,526
like core design rule that there isn't really a good or bad relationship. There isn't a

509
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:59,974
good or bad answer to a major decision or dilemma. And if we provided heuristic data

510
00:27:59,974 --> 00:28:03,777
to people, they would just assume that wasn't the case and it would break immersion.

511
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:10,084
Hello, I have a question about planning and management.

512
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:12,266
When you talk about all these heuristics,

513
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,327
I just keep thinking about my experiences with it

514
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:17,049
and saying, okay, at this point in the game,

515
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,871
they could potentially have six love points

516
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:22,393
or four love points, or when they get to this point,

517
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:23,874
if they don't have enough love points,

518
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,696
that decision won't give them the points.

519
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,998
You know, there's just so many different contingencies.

520
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,600
How do you and your team possibly keep track of all of that

521
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,782
and see all of the different pathways

522
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:34,862
that the character can go?

523
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:48,409
Yeah, so one of the main things that we did when we structured this is it was important to us to specifically have two variables for each of our axes.

524
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:56,632
So we're able to look at it less in terms of raw points and more in terms of ratios, right?

525
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:57,353
Like...

526
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:03,534
for openness versus closeness or for love points versus not love points,

527
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:07,075
you know, what's the ratio of one to another?

528
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:13,236
And that's something that you can standardize a bit more. And,

529
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:16,397
um, you know, if you're standardizing it, you don't have to plan as much.

530
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:18,598
Okay. Thank you. Yeah, of course.

531
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,827
Thank you, I love this.

532
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,128
You talked about having a thousand booleans

533
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,229
that you're tagging every single line.

534
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,530
Do you have any systems at your studio

535
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,351
for naming all of your booleans or your tags

536
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:34,732
so that they are readable by other members of the team

537
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,052
or that you yourself two days later

538
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:37,193
don't forget what it is that you wrote?

539
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,630
I do my best with that.

540
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,551
So we're a two-person team, and I do all the coding.

541
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:47,272
Generally, I try and name it with a convention

542
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:51,373
along the lines of episode number, name of the scene,

543
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,854
character name, and then a descriptor.

544
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:55,594
And then when I'm defining these,

545
00:29:55,594 --> 00:30:00,976
I define them in a central spot for that given scene.

546
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:01,876
So if I remember.

547
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:05,338
at the very least, oh, I think you could say something

548
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:08,021
along these lines in this scene.

549
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,222
I can just click to that part of the script.

550
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:09,482
Hi there.

551
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:10,343
That talk was really, really great.

552
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:10,623
Thank you.

553
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:14,607
I'm a narrative designer for a game called Weird West.

554
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:20,232
And I've been thinking a lot about player choices, too.

555
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:24,996
And I was curious if you could speak a little more to,

556
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:28,319
I was thinking sort of of the heuristics of the player's

557
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:28,940
choices.

558
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,824
if they choose things that are more confrontational over time,

559
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:37,388
are you giving them more confrontational choices,

560
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:44,776
or do you have a set number of archetypes for player choices,

561
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,258
for them to express themselves like,

562
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,781
here's the brash choice, here's the honest.

563
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,984
I was just curious in general how you think about player choice flavor.

564
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:59,440
Yeah, so, um, I try and avoid thinking about archetypes too much, uh, because I feel like

565
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,346
that kind of, uh, pigeonholes the design process in a lot of ways. I think it puts you in a

566
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:06,908
lot of scenarios where

567
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:12,650
You should have more, uh, options to respond in dialogue than you do, and then a lot of

568
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,191
other scenarios where you have too many. Uh, so I try and go on a case-by-case basis and

569
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:22,892
just think about what are the range, if I say we're DMing this game instead of coding

570
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:26,673
it, what's the range of player responses I could expect?

571
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:34,282
And then I also watch too many people stream our games, so I use that to sort of broaden

572
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:42,091
the perspective of what kind of choices people are consistently making.

573
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,035
Yeah, and then I also like, I personally...

574
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:54,800
avoid using heuristics to block people out of saying specific things, and instead, I'll

575
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,842
let them say that, but then if they say something out of character, that's something that the

576
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:01,864
other characters will comment on or maybe confront them with.

577
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,927
because again, I don't want to strip agency away.

578
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,970
The closest thing we do to that is we use a

579
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,173
trait-based role-playing system where you pick

580
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:13,877
like two out of seven tags when you create a character

581
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:17,060
and those are sort of the more archetypal

582
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,181
responses that you get.

583
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,651
Thanks very much.

584
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:20,111
Appreciate it.

585
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:20,472
Yeah, of course.

586
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:25,976
Oh, and before I take more questions, I should just remind people, remind attendees to fill

587
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:30,400
out session evaluations by visiting Swapcard, GDC's virtual event platform, mobile app,

588
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,183
and selecting session feedback button for each session they attend.

589
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:37,627
Feedback is very important to speakers and show management will weigh in to speakers

590
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,368
being accepted into future GDCs.

591
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:41,390
Back to questions.

592
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,811
I think we're on this side now.

593
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:47,316
Oh, that was it.

594
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:50,761
If people have more questions, I will be heading,

595
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,303
thank you so much.

596
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,365
I will be heading to the tables outside

597
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:55,827
and I'm happy to chat for a while. ♪♪
