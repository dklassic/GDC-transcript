1
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:09,480
Amazing game developers, thank you so much for coming.

2
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:16,206
You know how hard it is to lead in the video game industry.

3
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:23,433
First of all, you're dealing with people, and I don't want to indict all game developers,

4
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:24,754
so I'll just indict myself.

5
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:30,819
I got into video games not because I loved people so much, but because video games were

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,901
more fun and predictable than people.

7
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:38,465
So it's possible that some of the people you lead in video game development are not the

8
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,846
most people-oriented people.

9
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,749
Furthermore, you're leading multiple disciplines, doing immensely complex projects.

10
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,931
Anyone worked on a project that never shipped?

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,833
Yeah, lots of us have.

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,433
Newbies?

13
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,035
Be glad you haven't been through that yet.

14
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:54,555
It's painful.

15
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:58,498
So leading in the video game industry is extremely difficult.

16
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:03,941
The problem that I am here to focus on for the next hour is disengagement makes your

17
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,401
hard work harder.

18
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:10,384
When people are disengaged, everything you're trying to do as a lead is harder.

19
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:14,511
Few of you might know I spent over six years at Intel.

20
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,855
When I started at Intel, there was a guy just down the hall

21
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:22,260
from me who had a poster up in his cube from despair.com.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,042
You know what despair.com is?

23
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,646
Few of you, those who don't, despair.com

24
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:30,429
mocks the beautiful inspirational posters

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:30,770
that were.

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,131
trendy maybe in the 90s.

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:36,254
You know, the real ones had like people rowing and climbing

28
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:39,316
rocks and lighthouses and inspirational images and quotes.

29
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,898
Well, despair.com mocks those.

30
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:45,360
So this guy had a despair.com poster up in his cube

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,242
that said across the top in big letters, apathy.

32
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,960
And then it had a picture of a leopard lying in a tree with no expression on its face at

33
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:54,401
all.

34
00:01:54,481 --> 00:02:00,667
And down below it said, it takes 47 muscles to frown, 13 to smile, but zero to sit there

35
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,229
with a totally stupid look on your face.

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,696
That's apathy, that's disengagement, and that's really what we're here to focus on, is how

37
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,758
can you better engage people.

38
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:18,449
According to Gallup, if your organization is typical, and I can't imagine a game development outfit being typical,

39
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:24,911
but if you're typical according to Gallup, two in ten people you work with are actively disengaged.

40
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,772
That means essentially trying to get away with as much as they can.

41
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:34,034
They're almost working against you. And as bad as that sounds, according to Gallup again,

42
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,556
five in ten, fully 50% of workers, are basically

43
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:44,288
somewhat engaged, sure they want to do a good job but they're not willing to give you their all.

44
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:49,654
Massive gains to be had if we can earn more engagement from some of those people.

45
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,811
So that's the problem, it's disengagement.

46
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:56,114
Fortunately, science and experience tell us

47
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,976
how to engage people by delivering more

48
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:00,517
of what video games deliver.

49
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,880
So these are some of the sources for today's talk.

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,461
Sorry for the image overload,

51
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,283
but wanted to very quickly share a bunch of sources.

52
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,005
At the bottom, perhaps least important,

53
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,507
are clients of mine.

54
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:16,388
Since I founded Happy Brain Science, I've had the pleasure of working with a number

55
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,908
of fantastic game companies.

56
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,629
The two rows above that are games that I have made in my career.

57
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,330
So yes, I have led video game development.

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,370
As you can see, lots of kids and family titles.

59
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,831
There's an iPhone game there, some console games, and even a card game that I just released

60
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,912
for Happy Brain Science.

61
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:37,973
But as much as I am excited and proud of that experience, I'm trying to use as little of

62
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:43,094
that experience as possible and rely on science and data as much as possible.

63
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,556
As I mentioned, I spent over six years at Intel.

64
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:49,617
The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove,

65
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,219
had a quote that was oft repeated in the halls of Intel.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,401
The quote was, everyone has an opinion,

67
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,942
some people have data.

68
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:00,222
Okay.

69
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,088
Hungarian accent, by the way, I'm terrible with accents.

70
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,349
Forgive me if you're from Hungary

71
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,610
and I just mangled your accent.

72
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,352
Anyway, so I'm trying to give you

73
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,354
as little of my opinion as possible

74
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:12,758
and as much grounded in science and data as possible.

75
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,100
And that's what the top row represents.

76
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,064
Books, journals, science.

77
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,227
What does all that science tell us?

78
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,123
Think for a minute at a macro level, so get out of the details, up at a higher level,

79
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:32,086
what is it about games that engage people so well?

80
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,528
According to science...

81
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,690
The keys are captured in this acronym ARMS.

82
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,811
So I'm encouraging you to play your way to higher pay,

83
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,492
master giving ARMS each day.

84
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:50,014
ARMS stands for autonomy, relatedness,

85
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,075
mastery, and surprise.

86
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:57,878
I'm going to work through each of those as we go through today's program.

87
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,541
By the way, pardon the cheesy title, Play Your Way to Higher Pay.

88
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,442
I wanted to be very clear with you all.

89
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:05,803
It's not actually money that motivates me.

90
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,244
It may not motivate you much.

91
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,086
I mean pay in whatever the payoff is for you.

92
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:14,989
Making great games, having lots of people play your games, being a great leader, whatever

93
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,690
the pay is.

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,951
I hope you'll get more of it.

95
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:18,892
By learning to master.

96
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,283
or take the next step in mastering your ability to deliver arms.

97
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:26,665
Autonomy, relatedness, mastery, and surprise.

98
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,627
I want to practice what I preach.

99
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,668
So this session is a game.

100
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,710
I will give you points.

101
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,871
Like a lot of games, the points don't actually matter that much,

102
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:39,012
but they're still kind of fun.

103
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:42,114
So I'll be very clear with you when you have an opportunity

104
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:44,655
to earn points, either as an individual,

105
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:48,237
part of a small group, or perhaps a whole group.

106
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:49,979
Starting right now.

107
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,002
I think showing up and focusing your attention on the important stuff

108
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,844
is a huge part of success in life.

109
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:02,888
And you all have chosen to come and spend an hour of your valuable time,

110
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:04,489
and I hope attention,

111
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,510
with me, and I am honored and grateful.

112
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,571
So please give yourself three points,

113
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:12,833
the most you will likely get at any moment during this talk.

114
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,094
Give yourself three points for showing up

115
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:16,214
and paying attention to me.

116
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:23,284
I wanted to pass out paper that you could keep score on, but I was told under threats,

117
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,008
so to speak, don't pass any paper out.

118
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:29,812
So you have to hold your score in your head or maybe write it in your phone.

119
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,396
Anyway, we will use the honor system for you to track your points.

120
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,078
Three points for showing up.

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,940
Autonomy.

122
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,967
You've already heard this from me in my little pre-exercise warm-up.

123
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:45,869
Autonomy is a massive motivator, so let me make this 100% crystal clear.

124
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,630
I work for you this hour, not the other way around.

125
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,871
You do whatever you want this hour.

126
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:56,313
I will offer you some choices, I will make some suggestions, and I'll explain why I'm

127
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,234
making those suggestions, but you decide what you want to do.

128
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:00,555
Relatedness.

129
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,436
I want you to relate to me.

130
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:06,839
I want to relate to you and I want you to relate to each other, so I'm going to ask

131
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,841
you to participate at several times.

132
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:12,124
Again, what you actually do is up to you, due to autonomy.

133
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:17,849
Mastery, I want to help you take the next step in mastering your ability to effectively

134
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,870
lead other people.

135
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:24,354
And surprise, I hope to have at least a small surprise for you along the way.

136
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,553
Back to mastery.

137
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,175
For me to really help you master this material,

138
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,697
it will help me know,

139
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:34,120
help me if I know a few things about all of you.

140
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,783
So, if you're willing and able,

141
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,284
again, autonomy is vital.

142
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,026
If you're willing and able,

143
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,787
I'm asking you to get on your feet

144
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,429
if you have worked in game development

145
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,670
for one day or more.

146
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:47,710
There should be all of you, or at least 99%.

147
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,014
Why am I asking you to get on your feet

148
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,716
and not just raise your hands?

149
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,539
The same reason I'm asking you to do anything

150
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,882
I ask you to do today, because solid science suggests

151
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:00,963
it may be helpful to you.

152
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:07,786
Specifically, in this case, studies suggest that bodies in motion have brains that produce

153
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:14,187
more of what scientists call BDNF, brain-derived neurotropic factor, which long nerdy scientific

154
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,288
story short you can think of as learning aid.

155
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:21,629
And I want you not just to hear me today, but to remember, burn this into long-term

156
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,510
memory circuits, and act on all of this.

157
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,010
So I'm going to keep asking you to stand up, sit down, talk to each other, self-test, things

158
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,851
like that, because solid peer-reviewed science suggests it's going to be helpful to you.

159
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:37,232
Please stay standing if you have worked in game development for one year or more.

160
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,133
Thank you new people.

161
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,953
Three years or more, stay standing.

162
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:47,754
Five, seven, ten, I can see the math going in some people's brains, fifteen, twenty?

163
00:08:53,604 --> 00:09:02,088
veterans. You can all take a seat if you would like. That is awesome. Now, please do me a

164
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:09,892
favor and stand up if you officially manage other people. If you are somehow responsible

165
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:15,614
for their raises or performance evaluations or whatever, thank you. Please stay standing.

166
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,976
If you manage three or more people, five or more people, seven...

167
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,935
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 35, 40, 44, 45, 50, 50, do I have?

168
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:31,896
Thank you, you can all sit down.

169
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,396
Some of you are managing huge numbers of people.

170
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:35,877
Wow, OK.

171
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,917
Please do me a favor.

172
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,518
I know this feels a little bit silly,

173
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:41,998
but please stand up if you're one

174
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:44,398
of the people who does not officially manage other people.

175
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:48,696
Why? Because I want you to learn every bit as much as the official managers,

176
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:54,281
and I want to tell all of you who don't yet officially have management responsibilities

177
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:59,025
that a recent SHRM survey, that's Society for Human Resource Management,

178
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:03,949
surveyed thousands of people and asked them to identify a leader in their organization.

179
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:09,193
And 85% of those identified were not officially managing other people.

180
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:12,220
So all of you standing are leaders as well.

181
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,082
Thank you very much.

182
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:14,004
You can take a seat.

183
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,889
And finally, to help me help you.

184
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,738
Please stand up if you did not grow up speaking English.

185
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:26,381
If English is not your first language,

186
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,304
he said slowing down from his nervous frenetic talking pace.

187
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:30,944
Wow.

188
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,325
Welcome, everyone.

189
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,987
So glad you're all here.

190
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:36,929
I will try to slow down a little bit.

191
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,751
Anyone need anything else to understand what I'm saying?

192
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:46,451
Tell me if there's anything I can do to make this more comprehensible to people who perhaps

193
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,872
were not raised speaking English.

194
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,453
Thank you, you can all sit down.

195
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:55,837
And finally, last thing I want you to do for me, please, is stand up if you have ever read

196
00:10:56,037 --> 00:11:02,941
any academic research about what makes games so compelling, or academic research about

197
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:03,661
leading people.

198
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,952
Awesome, thank you very much.

199
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,435
You can all take a seat, that is super helpful.

200
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,338
Thanks for helping me help you.

201
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,622
By the way, there'll be multiple opportunities for questions.

202
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:20,864
We're gonna try to take those at these two mics.

203
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:23,647
You can go to a mic anytime you wanna ask me a question.

204
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:26,069
And again, I'll explicitly state

205
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,691
when we're going into Q&A as well.

206
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:32,418
So, unless anyone has a burning question or comment now,

207
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,121
we'll dive into play your way to higher pay,

208
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,765
master giving arms each day, starting with autonomy.

209
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,787
So, first a quick definition.

210
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,129
Autonomy is simply self-governance,

211
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,091
doing what you wanna be doing,

212
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:51,114
being in charge of your own life and work.

213
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:55,218
Please stand up if you like being micromanaged.

214
00:11:56,564 --> 00:12:00,665
Yeah, nobody does, and yet we do this to each other, right?

215
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,665
Are you programming that the right way?

216
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,306
Hey, is that the way that texture's supposed to,

217
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,426
hey, that animation could use a little more,

218
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,467
we get into the details if we're not careful.

219
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,367
Science recommends we don't do that

220
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,608
because autonomy is a massive motivator.

221
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,809
So the easiest and simplest way to give people autonomy

222
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,409
is to give people choices.

223
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:26,810
Who is willing to shout out some ways that you can give choices

224
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:28,932
in your role as a game development lead?

225
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,315
It's a non-rhetorical question.

226
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,060
Task selection.

227
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,441
Thank you, that's one point for you.

228
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,063
People can select their own task.

229
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,865
Good, how else can you give people choices?

230
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:49,319
This is the problem, you figure out what the solution's going to be.

231
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,639
Excellent, point for you.

232
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,559
What else?

233
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,199
Please.

234
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,440
Ownership of the problem.

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,860
Ownership of the problem, yeah.

236
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,641
People who should fix the problem are the people

237
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,021
who know the most about the problem.

238
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,622
So get out of their way and let them fix it.

239
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:01,262
Point for you.

240
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:02,042
Great.

241
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,903
Anything else to add about giving people choices?

242
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,364
Open questions.

243
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,004
You started first.

244
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:09,684
Please go again.

245
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,985
Doing it the way is going to be satisfying.

246
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,406
Do it and be satisfied?

247
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,045
Yeah, okay, point for you. And?

248
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,847
Open questions.

249
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,630
Open questions, yeah, as opposed to yes and no questions. Point for you. And?

250
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,433
In a similar vein, get them to generate the options.

251
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,896
Get them to generate the options. Love it. Okay, thank you all. Good participation. Yes?

252
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:40,303
So we set up a team culture. You can follow or you can choose what to follow, but if you love to follow it, your life will be easier.

253
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:43,365
You set up a team culture where people choose what to follow?

254
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:56,429
You can choose to follow or choose not to follow. Okay, good. There's interesting and

255
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:02,914
controversial science about choices that suggest we do better at engaging people if we give

256
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:09,179
them limited choices. So I apologize, I have no free gifts for anyone. I'm prohibited from

257
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,320
giving you things like products.

258
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:18,004
If I said, this part of the room gets a free game that I brought you, again, sorry, I don't

259
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,645
have one for you, I don't want to disappoint you, but if I said, you all get this free

260
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:26,648
game, and the rest of you, I said, hey, I brought these 10 games, you can all pick whichever

261
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:31,390
one you want, and I'm here through late on Friday, so if you change your mind, come back,

262
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,952
find me, and I'll swap out your game for you, there's some evidence to suggest that you

263
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,853
all would like your game better initially and for the rest of your lives.

264
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:44,060
Why? Because when you pick a game, there's nine games you didn't get.

265
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,202
Oh, maybe I should have gone with the shooter.

266
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,905
Oh, that strategy game looked good.

267
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:50,989
You know, I love puzzle games. Why didn't I pick the puzzle game?

268
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,033
When you offer people a lot of choices,

269
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,596
there's a lot of things they don't get when they pick one.

270
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:02,939
This is summarized in a great book by a professor called Barry Schwartz called The Paradox of

271
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:03,339
Choice.

272
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,840
Now, as I mentioned, there's some controversy about this science.

273
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,462
Does that paradox of choice show up everywhere under all circumstances?

274
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,422
No, it doesn't.

275
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:19,904
So it's tricky, but generally the science suggests provide limited choices to people,

276
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:25,846
maybe four, three, even two choices, and the chooser will be happier with the choice they

277
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:26,506
might make.

278
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,063
You might even present just one choice.

279
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:31,144
What?

280
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:33,067
One choice isn't a choice, dude.

281
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,870
That's forcing someone to do something.

282
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:39,397
Yes, but science tells us you can preserve autonomy

283
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:41,500
even when you don't give people choice

284
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,283
if you get their buy-in.

285
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:49,520
If you want to be doing what your leader has asked you to do, if they have sold it to you

286
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,005
so that you get it and you're committed to doing that thing, even if you have no choice,

287
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,668
you still have autonomy, according to science.

288
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,391
So let's see how many TED Talks you all watch.

289
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:05,555
I'm going to say one, two, three, and then if you know who this is, I'd like you to shout

290
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,717
out his first and last name in that order.

291
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,479
One, two, three.

292
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:15,227
Simon Sinek has one of the most popular TED Talks in the world.

293
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:16,828
It is fantastic.

294
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,369
It is about how leaders engage people.

295
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,971
And it is about the power of why.

296
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:26,853
Why-in gets buy-in.

297
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:30,435
So cheesy reminder through rhyming.

298
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:34,957
But I want you to think, if you need buy-in, give why-in.

299
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:40,507
A very experienced senior producer I was talking to last night told me, without prompting from

300
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,571
me, he said, quote, telling people what to do is easy.

301
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,835
Telling them why they need to do it is the challenging part.

302
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:52,162
As leaders, focus on that why when you can't deliver options and choices, and you will

303
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,285
preserve autonomy even when.

304
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:57,187
You're not actually giving someone a choice.

305
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:00,209
I would like to give you a choice now.

306
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,051
For the next minute, I would like you either

307
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,353
to sit right where you are, think,

308
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,614
what have I heard and how can I apply this?

309
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,075
You might write about it.

310
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,257
Or if you'd prefer to talk to somebody,

311
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,358
then I'm asking you to get on your feet

312
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:15,039
and talking with somebody else on their feet.

313
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,681
People who stand up, don't ask the person

314
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,042
sitting next to you to talk to them.

315
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,063
They don't wanna talk to you.

316
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,764
They're introverted, they wanna sit and think.

317
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:25,870
For the next minute, please stand up if you want to talk to somebody, sit and think if

318
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,751
you want to sit and think.

319
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,432
What have you heard?

320
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:28,614
How can you apply this?

321
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,061
Nobody's going to stand up and talk?

322
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,924
Okay, a few people are going to stand up and talk.

323
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
OK, wrap up, please.

324
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,281
I know these bells were not necessary,

325
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,942
given how few people we had talking.

326
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,804
But I'm going to get you all talking coming up.

327
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,265
And the only way I'm going to get you back

328
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,545
is with that sound.

329
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,727
So when you hear that sound, that

330
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,929
means please come back and sit down and return

331
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,869
to one conversation.

332
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:59,252
If you participated in that, either talking or thinking,

333
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:00,653
give yourself another point.

334
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,514
If you were like, I'm going to think about this,

335
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,295
and then opened up your phone and went through Twitter,

336
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:05,175
no points for you.

337
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:08,958
So point for participating if you participated.

338
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,842
Next up in arms is relatedness.

339
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:15,562
Quick definition of relatedness,

340
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:17,843
it's simply feeling that human connection,

341
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,424
that familiarity, being part of the same tribe.

342
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:24,065
I feel a bit of relatedness with all of you

343
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:25,406
because we're all game developers.

344
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:28,527
It's so awesome to be back at GDC with all of you.

345
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:33,508
Relatedness is a fundamental human need.

346
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:38,832
Now, it's probably easy for all you game developers to see how games deliver autonomy.

347
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,073
Tons of choices.

348
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:41,653
Lots of buy-in.

349
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:43,913
But you may be thinking, relatedness?

350
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:46,074
I play games usually by myself.

351
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,654
What the heck are you talking about, Crabtree?

352
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:51,335
Well, not all games deliver all of these motivators.

353
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:56,756
Not all games satisfy our needs for autonomy, relatedness, mastery, and surprise.

354
00:18:57,296 --> 00:19:02,197
But the games that satisfy more of these tend to do better as games.

355
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:08,780
there were a lot of word games before words with friends came out and became a smash hit.

356
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,942
And I would submit to you it's the with friends part that added relatedness

357
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:22,906
that made words with friends a smash hit. So, people need autonomy, people need relatedness,

358
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:28,328
and when you satisfy those needs you engage them whether it's a game or leading people making games.

359
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,810
Let me show you my favorite tool for building relatedness

360
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:33,831
on a team.

361
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,692
It's called a Pecha Kucha presentation.

362
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:40,014
Anyone here from Japan want to help me pronounce that better?

363
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,195
It's really Pechakucha or something like that.

364
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:43,915
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,096
I'm just ignorant, and that's why I

366
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:46,897
don't know how to pronounce it.

367
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,818
Anyway, this is simply a presentation format.

368
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,639
Comes out of the Japanese architecture design community.

369
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,761
Original format was 20 pictures on 20 slides,

370
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,442
20 seconds each on auto-advance.

371
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,784
It's a way of getting people to quickly share

372
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:01,744
visual information.

373
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,447
So quick story about using a Pecha Kucha presentation.

374
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,610
I started at Intel and was very happy managing

375
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,992
my team of engineers doing outreach

376
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,173
to the video game industry.

377
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,095
And then I heard a word that many of us at Intel

378
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,237
learned to dread, reorg.

379
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,298
Reorg, what does that mean?

380
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,599
It means reorganization.

381
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,383
It means I'm getting new peers with strong personalities.

382
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,544
Anyone worked at Intel?

383
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,645
Wonderful company, very competitive culture.

384
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,206
My new peers and I were competing.

385
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,547
My boss's praises and raises.

386
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,327
That competition turned to conflict.

387
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,208
That conflict turned ugly.

388
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:40,008
We were not relating well to each other.

389
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,729
So I went to my boss, and I said, hey, boss,

390
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,990
bet you've noticed some of the tension on the team lately.

391
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,150
And he said, oh, yeah.

392
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,251
What do you want to do about it?

393
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:53,533
So we talked about team building and together we arrived at these Pecha Kucha presentations.

394
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:58,096
So we modified these for a couple of ways to build relatedness on our team.

395
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:02,038
First of all, we're performance optimizing people.

396
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:05,200
We cut the number of slides and the duration per slide in half.

397
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,801
That's four times the performance people, do you realize?

398
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:13,084
We also made a rule for our team building that you could not show anything about your career.

399
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,325
It had to be about you as a human being.

400
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:20,351
So my new peers and my boss and I all created these and presented them to each other.

401
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,334
Mine went very roughly like this.

402
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:28,841
I was born and raised in Massachusetts, born in Western Mass, raised mostly in and around the town of Andover,

403
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:31,624
where the Red Sox infection comes in the hospital.

404
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,188
It's going to be a good year for the Red Sox, my friends.

405
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:41,455
I was specifically raised on the campus of this fancy-pants boarding school where my father, a PhD, taught math for 30 years.

406
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:46,701
I grew up on campus, went to the school for four years, learned countless things, one of which was

407
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,385
some people seem to have a lot more money than we do.

408
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:54,904
Went from there to Vassar College in upstate New York,

409
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:58,307
turned co-ed in 1969, in case you're wondering.

410
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,490
Vassar is where I got a degree in cognitive science

411
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,412
and became really enthralled with brains

412
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:07,435
and what makes us tick and not tick so well between the ears.

413
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,858
Moved from upstate New York to my beloved Oregon.

414
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,380
That is my beloved wife and I on the Oregon coast.

415
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:20,276
This is my father holding my first daughter shortly after she was born over seven years ago.

416
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:24,059
My wife likes to crack the joke that new babies and old men look alike,

417
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,961
so we've always found this picture amusing in that way.

418
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,323
Here's the rest of some of my family from left to right.

419
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:35,126
That goes sister, brother, mother, niece, nephew, brother, daughter, sister-in-law, and wife.

420
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,588
I love making music. Any musicians here?

421
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,693
Awesome, I play lots of instruments, been in lots of bands,

422
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,879
made many CDs, got a royalty check from BMI in the mail

423
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,001
in the past couple of years.

424
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:50,685
Super exciting lifetime goal achieved,

425
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,066
even though with that royalty check,

426
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:53,929
I could buy any two of you a beer.

427
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,531
It was still exciting.

428
00:22:56,432 --> 00:23:02,882
Also love nature and backpacking. I am not compensated by the Oregon Department of Tourism when I tell you this is Jefferson Park

429
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:09,832
Maybe the most beautiful place I have ever been if you like nature and backpacking go to Jefferson Park in Oregon. It is stunning

430
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:15,059
We get really terrible family shots, even hiring a professional photographer.

431
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,820
I am putting on my multiple chin display here.

432
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,401
Althea on the right, grown up, is like,

433
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,221
I'm smiling as hard as I can.

434
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:22,922
How's this?

435
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,683
And Zinnia, my youngest, looks a little bit like,

436
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:27,563
please don't squeeze me to death, Daddy.

437
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,344
So we created and presented these to each other,

438
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:34,085
and our relatedness immediately improved.

439
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:42,750
I would predict and hope that you can relate to me somehow better now than you could before

440
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,971
I showed you that slideshow.

441
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:49,294
You too are from Massachusetts, or you too grew up where there's snow, or you too like

442
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,396
baseball or camping or whatever it is.

443
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,477
You found some way to relate to me.

444
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:58,120
When your need for relatedness is satisfied, it is compelling.

445
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,320
You want more.

446
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,082
I mostly teach the science of happiness to people.

447
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:07,703
Science of happiness says the quality of our relationships with other people is a massive

448
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,143
factor on our happiness.

449
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:12,604
And happier brains do better work, do better game development.

450
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:18,425
So to build relatedness, to boost relationships, to boost happiness and therefore productivity,

451
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:23,086
I highly recommend creating and sharing these Pecha Kucha presentations with each other.

452
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,069
You can learn more about someone as a human being in under two minutes

453
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,476
than you can in two years of typically working with someone.

454
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:39,175
We have a PowerPoint template that makes it easy for you to put these together, drag and drop, and present them to each other.

455
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:43,558
If you want that PowerPoint template, you can find it on happybrainscience.com.

456
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,920
You can email me, I'm scott at happybrainscience.com.

457
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,522
You can tweet me, I'm scott crab, and I'd love to get you that free PowerPoint template

458
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:55,344
so that you can create and share these Pecha Kucha presentations with each other

459
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:59,887
and boost your relatedness and become a more engaging leader

460
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,988
by satisfying that core intrinsic need.

461
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,189
for relatedness.

462
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:08,735
Very quickly, of course, this goes multiple ways.

463
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,478
It's not just about getting people reporting to you

464
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,980
to relate to you better.

465
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,482
You need to relate to them better.

466
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:18,106
So pay attention when you see their Pecha Kucha presentation.

467
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:22,511
Take time during a one-on-one to ask them personal questions.

468
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:26,563
I got so results focused that I stopped doing this.

469
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:29,584
I stopped getting together and saying, hey, how was your weekend?

470
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:30,825
Or how's your mom doing?

471
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,326
You said she wasn't doing very well.

472
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,406
She was sick last month.

473
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:37,028
That personal connection is not a waste of time.

474
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:43,691
Solid scientific evidence suggests personal connection, relatedness, boosts the bottom

475
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:50,075
line through satisfying needs that engage people and building happiness.

476
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:55,946
I also want you to give your people a chance to relate to each other.

477
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,881
My favorite tool for team members to relate to each other is to encourage people to go

478
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,462
on walking one-on-ones.

479
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:09,044
I vastly prefer walking one-on-ones, that is two people going on a walk together for

480
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:09,424
a meeting.

481
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,645
That's together for a meeting, not together, sorry.

482
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,847
Two people walking together on a meeting is a great idea for multiple reasons.

483
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:22,129
One, science suggests that when you are walking, your brain works better.

484
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,510
You have better coordination between the two hemispheres in your brain.

485
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,311
You're also increasing blood flow.

486
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:30,212
Your cognition improves when you're walking.

487
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:35,013
And as I alluded to earlier, the physical activity produces more BDNF in your brain,

488
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,934
so you might remember that walking one-on-one better.

489
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:44,037
So, I want to take a risk and send you all on a walking one-on-one.

490
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:50,129
Up to you, but I'm encouraging you to leave the room and come back.

491
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,571
Why am I encouraging you to leave the room?

492
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:57,054
Because science says that memories are formed attached to physical locations.

493
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:02,238
And you will remember this content better if you learn it here and out in the hallway

494
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,499
than if you just learn it here.

495
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,863
So, we have only four minutes for this,

496
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,184
and I'd love you to come back.

497
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,326
So I'm gonna run out into the hallway ahead of you.

498
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,487
You can kill my mic in just a second.

499
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:15,749
And when you hear me going like this out there,

500
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:17,351
that means please come on back

501
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:19,993
so that I can give you more points and we can continue.

502
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,795
So if you choose, it's always up to you.

503
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,057
Find a person, go on a walk, up to you,

504
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,878
whether it's inside or outside of this room,

505
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,521
and come back in exactly four minutes.

506
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:30,842
That is 4.02.

507
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,091
Walk and talk. What have you learned? How can you apply it?

508
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:41,996
And no need to wait, I can start. Questions while people are coming back in.

509
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:44,738
I got a question.

510
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:45,618
Yes, thank you.

511
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:56,405
What would be some management things that we've learned not to do over the last, you know, 50 whatever years of learning to manage? What are some do-nots?

512
00:27:56,746 --> 00:28:00,648
What are some do-nots for what we've talked about so far? Great question.

513
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:05,697
Let me try to get everyone to hear your question and the answer.

514
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:10,060
So we're doing Q&A. Welcome back. Thanks for walking and talking.

515
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,943
The question was, you've given us some do's, what about some don'ts?

516
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:19,103
Well, the easiest way of killing autonomy

517
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,404
is to micromanage people.

518
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:23,025
So tell them what to do, exactly how to do it,

519
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,706
check in on them daily, give them

520
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,468
no freedom about how to hit that goal.

521
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:30,950
So somebody wisely said over here, give them the goal,

522
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,111
but don't tell them how to do that goal,

523
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,191
how to reach that goal.

524
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:38,353
If you want to kill autonomy, get in there and tell them exactly how to do it.

525
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:43,075
Especially get your programming style, for example, on there.

526
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:46,556
So, hey, dude, you're not commenting right. The bracket goes on top.

527
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:50,038
Like, that's a personal choice. Don't micromanage people that way.

528
00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:52,159
Offering people no choice.

529
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,720
Kevin, you'll be doing the UI remapping control screen.

530
00:28:56,675 --> 00:29:02,397
If I don't want to, if you give someone no choice about what they're doing, that doesn't

531
00:29:02,437 --> 00:29:02,597
help.

532
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,619
Now I know you're all leaders in game development.

533
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:08,040
You have to give people tasks.

534
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,221
Sometimes you have to give them no choice.

535
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:15,423
My four year old, a little older than you saw her on screen there, my four year old

536
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:21,726
has to take baths, but I can sometimes trick her with a little bit of false choice.

537
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,307
Zinnia, would you like to take a bath in two, three, or four minutes?

538
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,390
Anyone else a parent in the room?

539
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,052
Don't think I'm an evil person if you're not a parent yet.

540
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:32,633
When you're a parent, you'll understand

541
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,474
just how freaking hard it is.

542
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:37,295
And I know you're not managing four-year-olds,

543
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:40,277
but you can still add choices even

544
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:41,998
if you don't have choices, right?

545
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:45,840
So Kevin, I need you to do the UI remapping controller

546
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,800
remapping.

547
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,623
interface. You decide whether you want to do that before or after you work on the audio

548
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:56,484
enhancements that we talked about, and you tell me how long it's going to take and what

549
00:29:56,524 --> 00:30:00,166
your due date will be. So you're not giving them a choice about tasks, but you're getting

550
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,466
some other choices in there.

551
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:07,993
Relatedness. Some don'ts to do for relatedness. Don't make my mistake where you get so results

552
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,998
oriented. It's all we're under crunch time. We need results, results, results. You stop being

553
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:17,904
human with people, right? It's like you just you're so focused on the work you never ask, how are you?

554
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:19,267
How's it going?

555
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,508
How was your weekend?

556
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,468
That's another don't.

557
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,709
Separating people so they can never work together,

558
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:26,949
that's another don't, right?

559
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,929
Relatedness comes through pair programming,

560
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:31,770
co-design, code reviews, things like that.

561
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,710
Does that help?

562
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,010
And I can probably come up with more

563
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,111
if you give me more time,

564
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,391
but there's someone else at the mic,

565
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,771
so I'll take the next question, please.

566
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:42,452
Yeah, can you talk about reconciling autonomy

567
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:44,232
for poor performers?

568
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,011
Autonomy for poor performers.

569
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,834
Why'd you have to ask me such a hard question?

570
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:54,256
That is a really, really hard question

571
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:58,259
because the temptation when somebody is not performing well

572
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,400
is to get in there and manage them more, right?

573
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,542
Now, they might need that.

574
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:10,650
We're actually about to go into the section on mastery where we're going to get some ideas around how to maybe make things easier for someone who's struggling.

575
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:16,135
So if you'll allow me to partially postpone my answer, there's some information coming there.

576
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:26,383
Otherwise, I think you can get more involved with someone who's struggling if you get their buy-in through YM.

577
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:27,925
Right? So, hey...

578
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:33,506
Kevin. I'll use Kevin over and over again so I'm not discriminating.

579
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:37,809
Uh, hey Kevin, I gotta be completely candid with you.

580
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,524
Your performance is not as good as some of your colleagues here and some of us are having

581
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:44,064
concerns.

582
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:45,686
I really want to help you.

583
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:48,428
How could I help you boost your performance?

584
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:51,171
Let them start providing answers, right?

585
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:56,576
And if they don't give you something that you want to do, say you want to have Kevin

586
00:31:56,596 --> 00:32:00,400
do pair programming with a senior programmer one day and they're not into it.

587
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,361
Give that why in.

588
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:03,302
Give more reasons.

589
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:05,244
And by the way, your reasons don't even

590
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:06,204
have to be that good.

591
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:11,408
There's an amusing study about people are lined up

592
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,689
at a copy machine, right?

593
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,850
Somebody's making copies.

594
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,392
And then a research assistant comes along

595
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:17,653
and says one of two things.

596
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:20,816
They say, hey, can I jump in the middle here

597
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,757
and make some copies?

598
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:24,819
Or they say, hey, can I jump here

599
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,221
in the middle of what you're doing and make some copies?

600
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:29,182
Because I really need to make some copies.

601
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:32,370
That's a content-free reason, right?

602
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,212
You didn't tell them anything except because I

603
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:36,253
need to make some copies.

604
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,675
And yet people who get because I need to make some copies

605
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,158
are much more likely to let the person interrupt and make

606
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:42,578
copies.

607
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,280
So any reason is better than no reason.

608
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,081
And good reasons are better than bad reasons.

609
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:50,564
If you give a lot of why and get buy-in,

610
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,747
maybe you can get more hands-on managing while still

611
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:54,628
preserving autonomy.

612
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:57,730
That plus what you're about to hear coming up in Mastery,

613
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,231
if that's OK.

614
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,052
And I'm happy to go deeper on that answer later after the session as well.

615
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:08,875
So that's relatedness. By the way, if you participated in the relatedness exercise,

616
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:11,136
please give yourself a point.

617
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,838
Thank you very much for participating.

618
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:16,059
Mastery.

619
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,861
Virtually every game in the world delivers mastery.

620
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:22,442
If you have ever felt,

621
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:24,343
GRR! One more time.

622
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:27,114
You have felt the pull of mastery.

623
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,835
Research calls it different things.

624
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:32,255
Research sometimes calls it competence.

625
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:34,856
Competence is not a very sexy word.

626
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,397
So Daniel Pink rebranded competence

627
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,097
as mastery in his book Drive, which is about

628
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,038
these same internal motivators.

629
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,018
Anyone read Drive before?

630
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:46,139
Yeah, some of this sounds familiar.

631
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,079
You're not mistaken.

632
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,640
Drive is based on self-determination theory

633
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,120
research.

634
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,584
So is a lot of the research based on what makes games so compelling, also based on that

635
00:33:56,624 --> 00:34:02,008
same research that talks about autonomy, relatedness, and mastery.

636
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:10,454
So competence, self-efficacy, whatever you want to call it, mastery is progress, improvement

637
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:11,895
on something that matters to you.

638
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:13,756
It is extremely compelling.

639
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,939
How can you give more of this to your people?

640
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:20,047
You can learn from what video games do.

641
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,709
Who knows this term rubber banding

642
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:23,989
for adjusting difficulty?

643
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:26,751
I think some of us do, but it's not a universal term.

644
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,352
I learned it in the context of racing games.

645
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:32,754
So imagine a racing game and imagine an invisible rubber

646
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:36,176
band between you and a computer-controlled car.

647
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:39,117
If it's your first time playing and you're heavily

648
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,978
intoxicated, I don't mean to be inappropriate,

649
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:43,500
but some people play video games heavily intoxicated.

650
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,141
and you're crashing back and forth back here,

651
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,022
what happens to that computer car?

652
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:50,744
It starts driving very badly ahead of you

653
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,385
so that you have a chance to catch up.

654
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,587
And conversely, if you are awesome

655
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:55,808
and zip through that course,

656
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:58,910
wee, that computer car is right there behind you

657
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,771
because closer races are more fun races.

658
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:05,334
I've been playing lots of Rocket League lately.

659
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,335
Anyone here make Rocket League by chance?

660
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:12,937
You can confirm or deny this for me if you are, but I believe when I'm playing against

661
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,618
the computer, not other real human beings, but when I'm playing against the computer,

662
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:21,679
if I am down a couple goals at the end of the match, it's amazing how often the ball

663
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,220
ends up right between me and the opponent's goal in the last minute.

664
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,480
Thank you very much, rubberbanding, for making this game more fun.

665
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:33,222
And conversely, if I'm up by three goals, my computer-controlled teammate will literally

666
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:35,622
sometimes take the ball and drive it into our own goal.

667
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:39,746
What are you doing? You're rubber banding so that the game is more fun.

668
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:45,551
You can do the same thing. Adjust difficulty for people so that it's right at the edge of their ability.

669
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:50,076
How can you do that? Let's get a contribution or two if you're willing.

670
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,879
Something's too hard for someone. How can you make it easier for them?

671
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:00,305
Coach them on how to resolve it. Excellent. That's a point for you.

672
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:04,499
Change the scope of the task.

673
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,460
Excellent point for you.

674
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,641
And there was another one I didn't hear.

675
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:09,683
Break down tasks, yes.

676
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,906
Great way to emphasize progress and therefore mastery.

677
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:14,728
Anytime you're making a goal,

678
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,449
if you're co-creating a goal with someone,

679
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,032
don't give them the goal that's a year out, right?

680
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:21,834
Give them the goal that's eight months out

681
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,537
as measured by these 10 milestones along the way.

682
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:28,960
Break it down, get them some help, get them some mentoring.

683
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,162
What do you do if it's too easy for someone?

684
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:39,458
Increase the difficulty, give more responsibility, challenge them to do it faster.

685
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:44,760
See if they can write more beautiful, easy-to-maintain code as they get the feature done.

686
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,061
Whatever it is, you want to adjust difficulty through rubberbanding to keep people right

687
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:56,863
at the edge of their ability so that you satisfy their internal, intrinsic need for mastery.

688
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:01,589
Give immediate feedback and celebrate progress.

689
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:03,390
You all know how this happens, right?

690
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,491
You're playing a game and it's,

691
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,573
bing, 10 points, whoosh, 50 points,

692
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:07,834
whoo, new set of armor.

693
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:09,835
Hey, look, now you're a level three wizard.

694
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,837
We're constantly giving players feedback

695
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,100
and information about progress and celebrating progress.

696
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,402
Do the same thing as a leader.

697
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:22,065
If you are constantly communicating as a leader,

698
00:37:22,465 --> 00:37:24,307
you might be doing enough communication.

699
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,790
You want to adjust difficulty to get people into flow.

700
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,098
Hands up if you already know about flow.

701
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,635
Good, because I have hardly any time for it.

702
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,656
So for those of you who didn't put your hand up,

703
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:41,336
forgive me for going very fast and consider this

704
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:43,576
a pointer to information.

705
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:46,757
Flow is optimal experience in life,

706
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,898
discovered and documented by a psychologist named

707
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:51,858
Csikszentmihalyi, who found the very peak of life

708
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,499
is not relaxation, which is what we predict.

709
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,599
The peak of life is being intensely challenged,

710
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,540
having a high level of challenge,

711
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,000
but also a high level of ability to meet that challenge.

712
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,323
If a task is too easy for you, you end up bored or variations of bored.

713
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:11,646
If a task is too hard for you, you end up anxious or variations of anxious.

714
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:19,331
When you are right at the edge of your ability, you are in a delightful, super productive zone.

715
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:23,235
where everything is clicking because you focused completely,

716
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:24,436
you hear me, multitaskers?

717
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:27,319
You focus completely for 20 minutes or more

718
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:29,461
on something challenging but possible.

719
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:31,844
You're getting feedback about progress.

720
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:33,565
Your brain says, that's it.

721
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:34,746
I'm on the right track.

722
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,448
Everything starts clicking for you.

723
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:38,070
Time disappears.

724
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,191
That's flow.

725
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:43,516
When you are in flow, you are satisfying your need for mastery.

726
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:48,982
When you give your people undistracted, uninterrupted time to focus on a challenge

727
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:53,327
that is just at the right level of difficulty for them, right at the edge of their ability,

728
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:55,690
you deliver mastery to them.

729
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:03,647
I want you to master this material, so here's why I'm suggesting you get in groups of three

730
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,710
or four now and talk for the next couple of minutes right here.

731
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,192
No need to leave the room this time.

732
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:10,474
What have you heard in this talk so far?

733
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,457
How can you apply this to your game development leadership?

734
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:17,701
Autonomy, relatedness, mastery, how can you apply what you've heard?

735
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,363
Discuss for a couple of minutes, please.

736
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,273
Please wrap up those conversations.

737
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:36,467
Please come back to one conversation together so that I can tell you how you can earn more points.

738
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:40,434
I know that was really rushed, I apologize.

739
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:41,815
I wish I had more time.

740
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:45,377
You can all obviously talk with each other after this session.

741
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,299
So there's your other group talking opportunity.

742
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,520
So this time, you don't get a point from me,

743
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,982
or you don't get a point from yourself,

744
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:57,604
but you can give a point to one of your discussion partners.

745
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:02,087
So, if you felt that one of your discussion partners, you have only one point to give

746
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:02,407
away.

747
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:09,271
So, if you felt that one of your discussion partners was especially helpful, please give

748
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:10,912
them a point by pointing at them.

749
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:12,693
Pointing at them gives them a point.

750
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,576
And thank you so much for playing along.

751
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,862
So play your way to higher pay.

752
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,502
Master giving arms each day.

753
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:30,303
Autonomy, relatedness, and mastery

754
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:33,824
are all core intrinsic psychological needs.

755
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,245
According to research, they are the three most important needs

756
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,066
we have as human beings.

757
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:41,266
Games satisfy them.

758
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:43,887
You can satisfy them too as leaders.

759
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:47,134
Next up and finally, surprise.

760
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,944
Surprise is not really a core intrinsic need,

761
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:53,690
but it is a device to keep people coming back.

762
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:57,248
So I hope it's okay that I say this.

763
00:40:57,328 --> 00:41:00,129
I was at Blizzard years ago giving a workshop called

764
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:01,650
This is Your Brain on Game Development,

765
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,631
and I said to a classroom full of Blizzard people,

766
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:08,652
quote, hey, look, I'm a game designer,

767
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:09,533
you're a game designer,

768
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,254
we know how to get people addicted to things.

769
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,114
Guy in the back raised his hand and said,

770
00:41:13,694 --> 00:41:15,155
we prefer extremely compelling.

771
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,596
Okay, extremely compelling.

772
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:20,137
But if you want people extremely compelled

773
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,358
to follow you as a leader, exceed their expectations.

774
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:27,722
When you manage expectations, you are managing brain chemistry.

775
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:30,869
Very loosely speaking, this is how this works.

776
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,689
skipping over a few of the details of neuroscience here.

777
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:37,750
But basically, when you set an expectation,

778
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:41,272
or if you have an expectation, and the world

779
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,853
meets that expectation, your brain

780
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:46,174
releases slight bits of dopamine and serotonin

781
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:49,176
that tell your brain, yep, I expected this to happen.

782
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,096
That happened.

783
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,976
That was cool.

784
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:53,838
Certainty is very comforting for us.

785
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,258
We like to know what's going to happen

786
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,279
and then have those expectations met.

787
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,141
If you expect something to happen,

788
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:07,049
and reality comes in way below your expectations, that horrible disappointed feeling you get

789
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:10,412
is a big drop in dopamine and serotonin that tells your brain,

790
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:16,077
Ow! We didn't expect this and this sucks! Let's not do this again!

791
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:21,963
And if you have an expectation and the world exceeds your expectation,

792
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:24,385
you want to watch me alienate?

793
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,087
80% of the crowd in one moment.

794
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,249
If, as a Patriots fan like me, you think,

795
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:32,990
the Patriots are gonna lose this Super Bowl

796
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,612
and then they win in the greatest comeback ever,

797
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:38,634
I know you can all hate me later, it's all fine.

798
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:40,035
They're the greatest of all time,

799
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,315
whatever, we're all here in the hallway.

800
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:44,817
But when your expectations are exceeded,

801
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:51,026
your brain essentially gets a big hit of dopamine and serotonin that hits your reward center and

802
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:57,156
tells you, whatever this was, this was awesome! Let's do this again! Right? Games do this all

803
00:42:57,196 --> 00:43:00,962
the time, all the way back to pinball. You're playing with one ball and then...

804
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:06,467
Multiball! We exceeded expectations! This was awesome! Let's come back and play

805
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:11,613
pinball again. And you've certainly done this in games you've made. Set up one

806
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:16,518
expectation, then boom! Jackpot! With a chest filled with all kinds of gold and

807
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:22,263
armor and weapons. When your expectations are exceeded, your brain basically says

808
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,125
this was awesome. Let's do this again.

809
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:28,068
and it's part of what compels us to come back and play games,

810
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:31,130
and it's part of what you can do to compel people

811
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:34,993
to stick with you and be loyal team members

812
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:37,334
who follow you when you go from project to project

813
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,416
or even company to company.

814
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:42,658
So real quick, how can you exceed expectations

815
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,019
as a leader in game development?

816
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:47,601
Fake cakes.

817
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:49,423
Say that again?

818
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,279
Bake cakes. Awesome. Point for you.

819
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:58,042
If you baked me a cake, I would not expect that, and I would follow you around forever.

820
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:00,984
Yes. Exceed my expectations. Good. What else?

821
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:03,686
Give immediate feedback.

822
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:07,509
Give immediate feedback. Yeah. If you're not expecting that and you get immediate feedback,

823
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:10,251
you're like, whoa, this guy is awesome. I love working with this guy.

824
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:11,832
It gives me immediate feedback. Point for you.

825
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:20,306
For those who couldn't hear for the recording,

826
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:21,866
it was keep a note of their personal,

827
00:44:21,906 --> 00:44:23,747
well, not all their personal details,

828
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,287
but some of their personal details

829
00:44:25,307 --> 00:44:27,368
so you can remember to ask them about their mom

830
00:44:27,408 --> 00:44:28,188
who was getting sick,

831
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:30,128
or their kid who was struggling in school.

832
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,809
Yeah, awesome, good point for you.

833
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:35,590
And make them coffee or bring them coffee, love it.

834
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,331
The little things, we pay people so much money to make games

835
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,191
and I'm telling you the slice of cake or the cup of coffee

836
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:45,232
or the immediate feedback means so much to us, doesn't it?

837
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,473
I mean, more than the salary often, yes.

838
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:50,987
Public recognition, yes.

839
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:54,630
General guidance, praise in public, criticize in private,

840
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,152
culturally dependent, so be careful,

841
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:58,113
but yes, point for you.

842
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:58,653
And finally?

843
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:03,157
The anticipation of future sales.

844
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:03,237
Yes.

845
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:09,135
I'm not encouraging you to sandbag, but if you think you might ship the game on this

846
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:12,437
date, I would tell them a little later.

847
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:16,940
If you think you're going to sell this many, I'd tell people, well, we're probably going

848
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,461
to sell this.

849
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:19,922
So that if you actually sell that, you've exceeded expectations.

850
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:20,843
Awesome.

851
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:29,669
Not much I could do to exceed your expectations in this context, but I hope you will exceed

852
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,711
expectations to get your people hooked on you.

853
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,850
And the only thing I could think of to pleasantly surprise you

854
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,912
is to write an e-book for you about this content

855
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:41,052
and give it to you for free.

856
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:45,735
So I have, or will have really soon when I go back to my hotel

857
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:49,198
and finish it up, a free e-book on what leaders

858
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:50,278
can learn from game designers.

859
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:53,240
It's essentially an elaborate handout for this talk.

860
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:59,586
If you would like that, please text happybrain with no spaces to 444-999.

861
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:03,790
I want to be crystal clear because I don't want to disappoint you.

862
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,913
This will add you to my Happy Brain Science mailing list.

863
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:08,775
That's how I'm going to get you the e-book.

864
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:10,897
It is one click to unsubscribe.

865
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:13,540
I will not hassle you if you unsubscribe.

866
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,903
I send tips on the science of happiness and employee engagement at work.

867
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:22,285
If you don't have a US-based phone, this probably won't work for you.

868
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:28,087
So if you have a phone that's from outside the US, or you just prefer, email me.

869
00:46:28,107 --> 00:46:31,828
I'm scott at happybrainscience.com, and I would love to get you that free e-book.

870
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:39,851
That is Surprise, and that is Play Your Way to Higher Pay, Master Giving Arms each day.

871
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:43,812
Please step up to a mic and tell me what questions or comments you have.

872
00:46:47,525 --> 00:46:47,946
Thank you.

873
00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:54,771
You're very kind, but I'm not actually 100% done.

874
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:56,973
Let me just peel the curtain back a little bit

875
00:46:57,013 --> 00:47:00,016
and tell you why I'm doing Q&A now and not at the very end.

876
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:02,258
I don't do Q&A at the end because

877
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:04,600
of what's known as the peak-end rule of memory.

878
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,942
Peak-end rule of memory says you don't remember things equally.

879
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,664
You remember the ending of things

880
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,606
more than anything else, with the possible exception

881
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:13,487
of an emotional peak.

882
00:47:14,147 --> 00:47:19,609
So, if I end on Q&A, I'm taking my best learning opportunity and giving it to the randomness

883
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,149
of questions.

884
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,851
Now, I'm sure I'm going to get insightful questions from you and others that stand up

885
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:29,773
to the mic, but I want to take my key points and give them to you in the final minute of

886
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:30,493
this program.

887
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:31,914
You should do the same thing.

888
00:47:31,954 --> 00:47:36,295
In team meetings, if you want people to remember things, say the most important thing last,

889
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:37,896
even if you've already said it.

890
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:41,637
If you're doing a demo and you really want to impress a publisher, show them your best

891
00:47:41,697 --> 00:47:42,117
feature last.

892
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:46,299
Memories are not created equally, final memories are stronger memories.

893
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,260
That's why I do QA in the middle-ish, not at the very end.

894
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:50,560
Sir?

895
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:53,141
Yes, thanks for the talk first.

896
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:58,303
In your own mind or knowledge of things,

897
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:04,350
Would it be okay in a case of the previous guy questions or in a case of mentoring someone you know to grow up in?

898
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,771
a role to

899
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:12,760
Reduce a lot the autonomy, but keep the old three like at a maximum because that's something we

900
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,946
Usually do and have a side questions like what is the best season for Jefferson Park?

901
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:20,650
Sorry, I missed the side question.

902
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,791
What is the best season, in your opinion,

903
00:48:22,831 --> 00:48:25,553
for going to the Jefferson Park in Oregon?

904
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:28,015
What's the best way to get to Jefferson Park?

905
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:28,776
The best season.

906
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:30,137
Oh, season.

907
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,478
Certainly summer.

908
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,780
Jefferson Park is a hanging valley,

909
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,361
so you're halfway up Mount Jefferson.

910
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:38,304
That whole picture you saw is at about 6,000 or 7,000 feet.

911
00:48:38,564 --> 00:48:40,725
Your only choice, unless you like snow camping,

912
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:42,006
is July or August.

913
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:43,488
The bugs will be terrible.

914
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,230
Hit me up with other questions about Jefferson Park.

915
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,731
We won't get those on the rest of the people.

916
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:47,991
But.

917
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:52,033
You asked a question before that, memory, memory, which was,

918
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:55,514
oh, what do you do, can you take away autonomy and still engage people?

919
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,075
Let's ask these wise people.

920
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,436
Let's say that I'm your manager.

921
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:04,318
I am now going to micromanage you because I'm concerned about your performance,

922
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:06,979
but I'm going to give you as much relatedness as possible,

923
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:09,900
and I'm going to tell you that I'm going to help you master what we're doing.

924
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,860
We're going to do it together,

925
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,022
and I'm going to try to pleasantly surprise you by bringing coffee,

926
00:49:14,422 --> 00:49:16,022
but I'm going to sit down next to you and say,

927
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,203
ah, you missed a semicolon.

928
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:18,783
No, no, no, don't do it that way.

929
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:19,484
Do it this other way.

930
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:21,764
You would feel, I'm going to give you two choices,

931
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:24,105
three choices, good, bad, or mixed.

932
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:25,466
I would feel good about that.

933
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:29,387
So the survey says, don't do that.

934
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:30,688
I'd feel bad about that.

935
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,349
I'd feel mixed about that.

936
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,323
You know, this is very complicated.

937
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:39,084
Not all games satisfy all these needs.

938
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:41,125
Not all managers satisfy these needs.

939
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:44,747
I think you can keep someone decently engaged

940
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:47,648
without autonomy if you give them lots of relatedness,

941
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,789
mastery, and surprise.

942
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:51,610
But I think you get the most engagement of all

943
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,631
by satisfying all four and giving them arms.

944
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:57,412
Engagement is a slope, right?

945
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:00,073
You can be totally disengaged, somewhat engaged,

946
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,615
more engaged, or heck yeah, I'm gonna give it my all.

947
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,196
The beautiful thing about engagement, by the way, is that it is win-win.

948
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:10,718
This is not extracting more work out of people and ruining their lives.

949
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:16,340
The scientific evidence is that people more engaged at work have better lives, including

950
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,660
better personal lives.

951
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,022
If your people are more engaged at work, they will have better marriages at home.

952
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,442
the data suggests.

953
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:27,503
Their kids will behave better in school

954
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:29,644
if their parent is more engaged at work.

955
00:50:29,704 --> 00:50:31,524
So this is not win-lose.

956
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:34,685
The more of this you can do, the more you can engage somebody,

957
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,165
the more everybody benefits.

958
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:39,466
You, the person you're engaging, and outside.

959
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:41,526
Does that help?

960
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:41,767
Yep.

961
00:50:41,787 --> 00:50:42,227
Thank you.

962
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:42,947
Thank you so much.

963
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,187
Question over here, please.

964
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:49,397
Thank you for the great talk and sorry about my poor English, but

965
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:57,246
I as a personal game designer, I feel really the same as you and I think we can make game

966
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:02,431
fun, so why don't we, why can't we make the job fun, but

967
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:08,976
Every time I think about that, I feel that making games is really hard.

968
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:13,399
So the making job fun is also hard.

969
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:26,669
So maybe we can do that, you said, like give feedback to your colleagues and give relatedness.

970
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:27,409
But...

971
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,972
That is good for the other guys, but it is hard to make that.

972
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:36,633
It's same thing. I think it's a kind of meta problem.

973
00:51:36,813 --> 00:51:43,835
So, who actually making the game maker job fun?

974
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:48,650
I'm so glad you brought up fun because I meant to say this earlier.

975
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,151
When you think about what makes games compelling, you probably think fun.

976
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:53,172
That's what I thought.

977
00:51:53,732 --> 00:51:55,393
Fun is what makes games great, right?

978
00:51:56,453 --> 00:52:00,215
Fun is a very fuzzy concept for scientists.

979
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:01,255
They're like, fun?

980
00:52:01,575 --> 00:52:02,636
What is that?

981
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,477
We don't know exactly what that is.

982
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:11,759
When scientists systematically go after what makes games so fun, they arrive at autonomy,

983
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:13,280
relatedness, mastery, and surprise.

984
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:19,766
So, my suggestion to you is game development, no it's not playing a game, but games that

985
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,628
are really easy are not fun, right?

986
00:52:22,028 --> 00:52:25,952
Games need to be right at the edge of your ability to be fun, they need to be challenging

987
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:29,375
to be fun, they need to satisfy your need for challenge and mastery.

988
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:36,159
Game development can be just as fun if you deliver autonomy, relate to people at a human level,

989
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,361
most of all get that mastery just right so that it's right at the edge of their ability.

990
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:45,262
If it's right at the edge of their ability, they will be deeply immersed in game development

991
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:50,124
and they might even not want to play a game so that they can spend more time making a game.

992
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:54,746
It can be just as fun if you take care of these intrinsic needs. Fair enough?

993
00:52:55,967 --> 00:53:07,541
But the man who delivers autonomy and relatedness and other things, that job is, I think, could

994
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:08,221
not be fun.

995
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,227
The job of delivering autonomy, relatedness, mastery, and surprise can't be fun?

996
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:15,149
How to do that?

997
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:19,809
Try this on for size.

998
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:21,530
I'm short on time, but I'm going to try

999
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,731
to make a long story short.

1000
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,652
I was working in game development.

1001
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,413
There was a guy I will call Brad.

1002
00:53:27,213 --> 00:53:30,115
Brad was an artist and not a very good artist, right?

1003
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:33,297
But Brad loved games, so we were trying to figure out

1004
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:34,157
what to do with Brad.

1005
00:53:34,197 --> 00:53:35,758
So OK, you're not a very good artist.

1006
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:38,159
Let's have you be sort of an art asset coordinator.

1007
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,240
OK, that didn't work well.

1008
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,081
Let's try making you a designer.

1009
00:53:41,141 --> 00:53:42,202
Well, that didn't work very well.

1010
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,163
Let's try making you more of a commuter.

1011
00:53:44,363 --> 00:53:47,424
Finally, after years and years, we let Brad go.

1012
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:49,537
should have been done earlier.

1013
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,058
All of us felt really bad for Brad.

1014
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:52,798
Oh, poor Brad.

1015
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,099
Brad lost his job, right?

1016
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:57,460
This was a long time ago, back in the days of renting

1017
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,761
videotapes from Blockbuster, right?

1018
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:02,802
So he gets a job at Blockbuster behind the counter saying,

1019
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:05,363
like, yeah, these movies are due back Tuesday.

1020
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:07,363
And all of us were like, oh, poor Brad.

1021
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:08,984
He's working in a video store.

1022
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:11,665
In under a month, as Boston noticed,

1023
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,406
that every time somebody came up with a game,

1024
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,688
he knew tons about the game and engaged with them

1025
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:16,408
about the game.

1026
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:20,050
So in under a month, he made him the corporate buyer

1027
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,051
for that store.

1028
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,652
And in under a month after that, he

1029
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:26,114
was promoted to director of corporate buying

1030
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,655
for video games for Blockbuster, a huge chain

1031
00:54:28,695 --> 00:54:29,536
for those who don't know.

1032
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:35,320
He went from a struggling job that he really didn't enjoy with us to a dream job by us

1033
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,960
firing him.

1034
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:41,404
If you have someone who doesn't enjoy making games, who doesn't find it fun, if you give

1035
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:45,627
them autonomy, relatedness, mastery, and surprise and they still don't enjoy making games, maybe

1036
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:48,770
they're in the wrong industry and you could do them a favor by letting them go.

1037
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,813
Some of the enjoyment has to just be because you love making games.

1038
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:54,215
Fair enough.

1039
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:54,736
Thank you.

1040
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,356
I apologize I'm out of time, but we can continue afterwards.

1041
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:59,237
So what am I going to do now?

1042
00:54:59,277 --> 00:55:00,938
I'm going to use my final minute to summarize

1043
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,718
the most important information for you,

1044
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:05,579
after I challenge you for a few seconds

1045
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:08,220
to think about where, when, and how you will

1046
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,320
apply what you've learned.

1047
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:12,138
Why am I asking you to be so specific?

1048
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:14,559
Because science says the more specific you are,

1049
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,220
the more likely you are to follow through.

1050
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,621
So if you say, I'm going to make a personal connection with Kevin,

1051
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:20,981
great, you might succeed.

1052
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:23,482
If you say, I'm going to make a personal connection with Kevin

1053
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,423
during a walking one-on-one Thursdays at 3 o'clock

1054
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,884
when we have our meetings, you're more likely to follow through.

1055
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:32,905
So please think for a few seconds when, where, and how

1056
00:55:32,925 --> 00:55:33,905
you apply what you've learned.

1057
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:42,574
Before I let you go, I would be remiss

1058
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:44,115
if you enjoyed this talk at all.

1059
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:47,136
I'm speaking again Friday at 3 on Collaboration

1060
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:48,217
Through Candid Conversation.

1061
00:55:48,237 --> 00:55:49,197
Would love to see you there.

1062
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:50,798
Sorry for the shameless self-promotion.

1063
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:55,900
Play your way to higher pay, master giving arms each day.

1064
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,942
The problem we were here to focus on is disengagement,

1065
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:02,443
people not giving you their all in game development.

1066
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:08,680
Experience, but much more importantly, science and data suggest solutions.

1067
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,841
What does all that science tell us?

1068
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:15,182
You can play your way to higher pay by mastering giving arms each day.

1069
00:56:15,682 --> 00:56:21,383
Satisfy core intrinsic human needs for autonomy, relatedness, and mastery.

1070
00:56:21,803 --> 00:56:25,264
Add surprise, and you've got loyal followers for your career.

1071
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:27,485
Thank you so much for your time and attention.
