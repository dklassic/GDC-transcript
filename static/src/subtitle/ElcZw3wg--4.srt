1
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:06,826
My name is D.B. Cooper. I'm a voice actor.

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,269
I'm also a director of stage and video games.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,133
I also do talent and casting, so I help people find the voices they need.

4
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:24,419
One of the hallmarks of early game development was how bad the dialogue was.

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,782
Okay? So, like, using the guy in accounting who always wanted to be a DJ

6
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:33,625
was pretty much a surefire way to get your game on audioatrocities.com.

7
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:38,351
Okay, but luckily the scope of games has certainly grown,

8
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,753
and so has the investment in narrative.

9
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,414
And so we've got better scripts,

10
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,656
and better directors, better actors,

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,179
and really, overall, an understanding,

12
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,722
a better understanding of what has really become a craft.

13
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:57,766
But now, all kinds of games are adding voice acting,

14
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,248
and history is kind of threatening to repeat itself.

15
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:07,471
Indie game developers especially are inundated with the demands of audio, of dialogue.

16
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,635
And audio folks who may never have directed are finding themselves in charge of a whole

17
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:17,359
huge cast of characters with voice talent who may never have played a game.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,903
So no matter what kind of game you're directing, I am hoping that some of the things you see

19
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:25,685
today will help you get better results from your actors.

20
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:28,627
Some of this stuff may seem obvious.

21
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:31,926
Let's address it anyway.

22
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:35,049
When you invest time before a recording session, it can solve

23
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,351
problems before they even start.

24
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:40,235
If it's at all possible, get your script into the hands of the

25
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,057
actors before the recording date.

26
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,019
Even if it's not final.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,185
And the same thing goes for, um, for character briefs, anything you can

28
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:51,308
do to give your actor time.

29
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:57,063
to learn about his or her character is going to be great for you in the long run.

30
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:01,187
It makes it feel a lot less like jumping out of an airplane without a parachute.

31
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,072
The characters that your actors play quite often are not the ones they auditioned for.

32
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:14,158
It's a little bit daunting when you show up expecting to play a rowdy southern girl

33
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:16,339
because you're going to be shooting people and all

34
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,901
and they want you to be a femme fatale with a French accent.

35
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:27,347
It's nice to know in advance because it's a bit of a stick in the spokes if you're surprised.

36
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:33,129
Some of us have a little bouquet of characters that we have in our pockets.

37
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,191
We have a little bouquet of voices we can automatically do straight out of the gate.

38
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,872
But others need exercise before they're trotted out.

39
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,873
Okay, just who directs dialogue here?

40
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,774
Okay.

41
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:51,393
Just, and say it out loud, do you always do auditions?

42
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:51,493
Yes.

43
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:54,354
Excellent.

44
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:57,715
Okay, so we don't need to talk about the efficacy of auditions.

45
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,976
In case you're getting into directing,

46
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:04,457
auditions are the first best way to separate the wheat from the chaff.

47
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:08,758
You want to be able to tell if the people that you're asking to do your game with you

48
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,579
can take direction, and that's what auditions are for.

49
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:21,528
Something else that needs to be determined before the recording date is the studio hierarchy.

50
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,934
You get one director, have one person be

51
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:29,800
the conduit through which information is passed on to the actor.

52
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,202
Just one person guiding the actor.

53
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:36,826
Direction by committee is like a recipe for the immolation of time

54
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,008
and having your actor's head blow up.

55
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:42,591
Have you seen the Santa sessions on YouTube?

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,273
Where there are like five guys in the control room

57
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:46,955
telling Santa how to say ho, ho, ho?

58
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:50,298
Yeah, yeah, and yeah, you know, I didn't feel it that time.

59
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:54,141
Okay, so having other people in the control room is fine.

60
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,829
as long as it's fine with the director, okay, and the engineer,

61
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,513
and as long as it doesn't interfere with that connection between the director and the actor.

62
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:11,177
And once the actor gets in the booth and has his headphones on

63
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,658
and the engineer has come in and set his microphone,

64
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,801
just use the talkback to talk for a couple of minutes.

65
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,079
Just shoot the breeze.

66
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,160
What did you have for lunch?

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,200
Do you have any kids?

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,461
Did you see that program on Sunday night?

69
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,762
Just anything, especially if it's the actor's

70
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,882
first time doing a game.

71
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,283
It's really kind of overwhelming.

72
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,883
If an actor's never been in a booth before,

73
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:38,884
you've got all of this fabulous technology all around you.

74
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,585
And if you use it for something really comfortable

75
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,786
and familiar, like a nice conversation,

76
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:48,627
it makes it a lot less anxious and a lot less formal.

77
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,478
And I've lost my, ah, there we are.

78
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,467
If you're part of the dev team.

79
00:04:56,987 --> 00:05:00,308
you know a lot more about the game than a script can ever tell anybody.

80
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,889
Okay, especially if your script is a spreadsheet.

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,650
And so any character brief, any script,

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,391
will never be able to reveal the amount of information

83
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:10,812
that you have as a developer.

84
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:17,515
So take a moment, tell your actor what his place in the game is,

85
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,876
what his character's place is, what the relationships are.

86
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:24,958
What triggers fights? What triggers changes of scenes?

87
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,779
Just the whole business about some of the mechanics of the game.

88
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,780
And anything thematic that matters.

89
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,001
You want to add information if you can.

90
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:38,004
Because as director, you're so much more than a traffic cop.

91
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:42,506
You are in charge of the way the game speaks to the player.

92
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:43,766
Literally.

93
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,930
Now, regarding the actual words you use to speak...

94
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:58,896
What you think you are saying is not necessarily what the actor hears.

95
00:05:59,617 --> 00:05:59,937
Okay?

96
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:04,120
So it's a good idea to let the actor know at the beginning of a session

97
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:07,223
that it's okay to ask you what you mean.

98
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:12,767
I was once an assistant to a director whose two key terms,

99
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,970
his two key instructions for the actors were,

100
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,951
loosen it up.

101
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,132
I just need you to loosen it up.

102
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,373
You know what I'm talking about.

103
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,387
So I just need you, I need you to loosen it up.

104
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:27,010
And his other direction was tighten it up.

105
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:32,658
And sometimes, and I kid you not, he would use both for the same passage.

106
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:35,182
Okay, I need you to loosen it up, but I just need you to tighten it up.

107
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,166
And the poor actor was in the booth going.

108
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,072
And I could tell he had no idea what the director meant.

109
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,554
And neither did I, until I went to dinner with him later,

110
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,995
and I said, you know, you use this term, loosen it up,

111
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,016
what does that mean?

112
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,597
And it turns out that loosen it up means,

113
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,238
don't make it sound so scripted.

114
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,120
Get a little more relaxed with the way

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,961
that you're delivering it,

116
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,462
so it doesn't sound like you're reading a line.

117
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:01,622
Make it sound authentic.

118
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:05,265
And tighten it up means that he just wanted it

119
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,366
a little brisker with the delivery.

120
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,763
Okay, I never would have known if I hadn't asked.

121
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:17,843
I recently did a session with Tom Keegan, where I was a tough girl with a Russian accent.

122
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:21,885
And Russian accent is one of the accents I like to be able to pull out of my pocket.

123
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:23,846
And I practice it all the time.

124
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,107
You know, I listen to the radio and I listen to BBC.

125
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:31,349
So I can make sure that I can always keep track of the way that Russians sound, because

126
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,371
I want to make sure I'm spot on with my accent.

127
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:40,853
So my hoodlum girl had these shouts like, get down from there, you coward!

128
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,101
you know, big and round.

129
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:44,642
And Tom kept saying, you know what,

130
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:46,102
I just need a little sharper over here

131
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,683
and we need to put an edge on it

132
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,705
and I want a little more, less, less ah and more eh

133
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:51,705
and that kind of stuff.

134
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:55,627
And he was being really precise, but I just didn't get it.

135
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,309
So at the break, I told him how I keep my accent sharp,

136
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,230
by listening to foreign radio

137
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,752
and making sure that I've got an authentic Russian accent.

138
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,133
I said, I want to be able to deliver you the authentic goods

139
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:09,014
and he goes, oh no, we're not doing authentic,

140
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,095
we're doing Hollywood Russian.

141
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:15,445
Oh, it's more Boris Badenoff, right?

142
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:17,547
So it's not, get back.

143
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,348
It's more, get back.

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,691
OK, awesome.

145
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,296
So the deal is, when you start your session with the

146
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:32,399
permission to ask you what you mean, you're establishing a

147
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,602
respectful freedom to communicate without

148
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:36,903
relinquishing your authority.

149
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:39,626
And something else.

150
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:45,790
When you're the actor in the booth, here you are in a box with a window.

151
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:53,153
And sometimes at the end of a scene, or when a, or a, let's say we're done with a certain character,

152
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:59,576
or even at a page change, the recording stops down and the guys in the control room talk.

153
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:06,202
about sushi and other stuff, or something that happened hilarious that one of their

154
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:11,544
children said this morning, and they all laugh. Now the actor, actors tend to be thinking,

155
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:19,048
oh my god, they're laughing. Okay, so if you possibly can, keep the talk back engaged so the

156
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:24,951
actor doesn't feel completely out of the loop. Otherwise it's like being on display in an

157
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,451
aquarium.

158
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:31,329
Okay, so here's the corollary to letting your actor ask you.

159
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,714
Most of the time, actors want to give you

160
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:37,155
what they think you want.

161
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:40,156
But if you don't get what you want,

162
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,497
be ready to explain your direction.

163
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:43,538
OK?

164
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,499
So don't just jump into a line read.

165
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,419
We were actually talking about this yesterday

166
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,521
at Mike Surik's talk about how to get a point across

167
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:51,081
to an actor.

168
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:55,263
A line read is where a director will actually

169
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:58,104
say the line to the actor as he hears it in his head.

170
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,705
And it seems like a real expeditious thing to do.

171
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:02,106
Saves time.

172
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:13,985
monstrously insulting to the actor and is not very good for, you know, the overall congeniality

173
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,428
of the session. No one likes to be force-fed. So you're going to get a far better result

174
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:23,892
for the entire session if you just take time to engage the actor's frame of reference as

175
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:29,636
an actor. So something like, instead of just, you know, I need you to say this line like,

176
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,277
You're going down, mister.

177
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:41,424
Okay, whatever. But say something like, you know, as a teenager, how mad were you when your dad wouldn't let you use the car?

178
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:48,670
It's not just angry, but thwarted. Okay, so that's going to be, mean something hot to your actor.

179
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,794
And you're actually going to get a better performance overall. This is collaboration.

180
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:58,579
Because if you give him a line read, what you're actually asking him to do is pare it back.

181
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,158
your inflection in his voice.

182
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,960
Now sometimes, and it's going to happen,

183
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,243
he can get an actor who's truly stumped with something.

184
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,585
And that's when a line read is appropriate.

185
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:15,348
And frankly, if after like three tries at a line,

186
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,770
if he's still not getting it, an actor

187
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,652
is very likely to ask you for a line read himself.

188
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,596
If he doesn't ask, you should ask.

189
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:30,034
That is, you can offer to say, here's how I hear it.

190
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:34,055
And here's something that David Chan mentioned yesterday in Mike Surick's talk.

191
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:37,176
He never gives a line read with exactly the line.

192
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,556
He paraphrases the line.

193
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,476
So it isn't identical.

194
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:46,877
So the actor isn't trying to simply mimic what he said.

195
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:50,638
He's not trying to replicate the line in David's inflection.

196
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,219
He'll give a paraphrase of the line so the actor can get the gist.

197
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,599
And usually it's like, oh.

198
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:56,519
Click.

199
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,900
I get it.

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,541
When it's presented with a spirit

201
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:05,083
of genuine collaboration, it's freeing and not limiting.

202
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,806
Something else I've been asked about is interrupting.

203
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,588
Sometimes you need to make a directorial adjustment

204
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,809
while you're working on lines.

205
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,310
Please wait till the end of the line.

206
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:27,269
Please just wait to the end of the line, honestly, unless the actor is narrating the origin history of epic saga.

207
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,494
Can I say saga? I can say saga, right?

208
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:38,858
There really aren't a lot of full-scale paragraphs in most of the scripts we do.

209
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,240
A lot of the stuff we're dealing with is lines.

210
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,762
And interrupting the actor, once again, it may seem like a time saver,

211
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:46,544
but just be patient.

212
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:48,145
Just for a few seconds.

213
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:52,008
Because what interrupting does is it immediately alarms the actor

214
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,471
and will either undermine his confidence or irritate him.

215
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,233
And that's going to make him less likely to be receptive.

216
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:01,235
So either way, you lose a strong performance.

217
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,273
Veteran voice actors usually, like I said,

218
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,116
come with a little bouquet of characters

219
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,958
that they're ready to give you.

220
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:19,203
Sometimes, actually, when it's smooth, too smooth.

221
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,269
Even seasoned pros can approach lines of script

222
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,812
as elements that need to be rendered whole.

223
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:34,900
Okay, but what happens is scripts end up sounding stilted if all the lines are read as lines.

224
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,744
There's just something about the visual cue, okay, of a page full of these short sentences

225
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:45,068
that makes them look like darts and everybody's heading for the punctuation as a goal.

226
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,950
No, please, enemy fire, getting flogged here, block.

227
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,052
This is racing when you're heading for the end of a sentence.

228
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:54,955
Even the best actor.

229
00:13:56,143 --> 00:14:02,866
can sound stilted or odd when speaking all the lines perfectly fluently clear all the way through.

230
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:10,129
Pure fluency really doesn't exist all that often in the real world. You hear it in plays especially

231
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,890
where actors are stepping on their cues and everybody's got their lines memorized and you

232
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,712
hear it. Think of the old movies from like the early the early 40s or the 30s where everybody's

233
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:24,014
talking really rapidly and there's this super quick repartee. Well sometimes you're gonna have

234
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:24,894
something like that.

235
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:32,085
with like, um, your face looks like it caught on fire and someone put it out with a brick.

236
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,546
Okay, so sometimes you're going to get something blasting all the way through.

237
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:42,049
But other times you're going to have something instead of just, they have no authority over

238
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,791
the red lanterns, if given the chance, I will destroy every last one of them.

239
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,312
People speak in phrases.

240
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:54,314
They have no authority over the red lanterns.

241
00:14:55,631 --> 00:15:01,475
If given the chance, I will destroy every last one of them.

242
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:08,579
So conversation tends to be rendered in bits for the most part.

243
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,382
If you don't want your game script to sound like a performance, the other thing you can

244
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:19,666
do is allow for mistakes and corrections and pauses, as well as fluency.

245
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,747
We want authenticity.

246
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:25,869
We want reality and we want honesty in our games.

247
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,494
So at the beginning of the session, assure your actor that there is

248
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,737
time to find authentic pauses.

249
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:40,842
So the line, great, now we look incompetent becomes great.

250
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:49,190
Now we look incompetent to self interrupt.

251
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,220
Sorry guys, I know you're coming off a case, but we're going to have to make a detour.

252
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,804
Becomes, sorry guys, we've got to...

253
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,948
Shoot, I know you guys are coming off a case, but we've got to make a detour.

254
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,392
To say, ah, like real people do.

255
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:09,295
So instead of, Jesus, he looked pretty mad.

256
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:14,720
You get, Jesus, he looked pretty mad.

257
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:20,639
In fact, you might want to record that shoot the breeze conversation before the session.

258
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,227
Record it and play a little bit back to your actor if he's got some authentic dialogue

259
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:31,315
because he'll be able to hear the way he truly speaks in real conversation.

260
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,693
The series reads, as you begin your session,

261
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,514
you can use some tricks to get a grip

262
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:40,216
on the vocal quality of your character.

263
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:41,496
These are like little theater games

264
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,338
that allow the actor to stretch his imagination, okay?

265
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,280
And offer up some really juicy choices.

266
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,681
So you use short lines like,

267
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,402
hey you there, I ain't seen you before.

268
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,384
The Goldilocks read, it's too hot, too cold, just right.

269
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:54,586
And it's whatever that means to the actor.

270
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,486
You just let him go.

271
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,128
So, too hot.

272
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,931
Hey you there, I ain't seen you before.

273
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,552
Too cold.

274
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:05,753
Hey, you there.

275
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,735
I ain't seen you before.

276
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:09,456
Just right.

277
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:10,938
Hey, you there.

278
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,279
I ain't seen you before.

279
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,062
And so the like, don't like, close to series,

280
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,483
you like the person you're speaking to,

281
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,104
you don't like the person you're speaking to,

282
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:21,866
or you're very close to the person you're speaking to.

283
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,368
And that's in proximity.

284
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:26,650
So we've got, I like you.

285
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,791
Hey, you there.

286
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:29,052
I ain't seen you before.

287
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:31,534
I don't like the person I'm speaking to.

288
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,956
I'm going to speak to an empty chair so nobody thinks I'm mad.

289
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:39,176
Hey, you there, I ain't seen you before.

290
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:44,837
And close to, hey, you there, I ain't seen you before.

291
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,438
OK, so you get all of these different choices.

292
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,559
There are other things like the good day, bad day, normal day,

293
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,399
angry, bored, excited.

294
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,580
It's kind of the same thing.

295
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,080
There's no correct rendering for these lines.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,601
Everything is completely subjective.

297
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,915
Using these exercises as trials at the beginning,

298
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,017
it gives your actors a chance to try something

299
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,739
before committing to the right voice.

300
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,961
And frankly, you may end up hearing

301
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,784
something you never thought of and never knew you'd love.

302
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,232
White lining is when you're driving right

303
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:23,352
down the center of the road.

304
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:29,881
Sometimes during a long session your actors imagination can become fatigued and you can hear her white lining

305
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:34,204
That's driving right down the middle of the road. It's a middle-of-the-road performance. It's really safe

306
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:41,251
It's not terribly interesting. Okay, this happens when there are lots of those short lines, you know like in battle chatter

307
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:46,876
So this is where you can take a moment to go off-road completely. Was that five?

308
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:48,097
Thank you

309
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:53,493
You can read a set of lines like a wildly declaiming southern preacher,

310
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,254
like a total doofus,

311
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:56,755
or like a pony!

312
00:18:57,195 --> 00:19:00,497
Okay? So it's like, you know, when you're constantly going over lines like

313
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:01,718
force field active,

314
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:02,839
force wall up,

315
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,040
force field ready,

316
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,801
repair station on line,

317
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:07,442
repair station ready.

318
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:11,845
You can just kind of get into this groove that's a little bit, uh oh, sounds a

319
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:12,385
little boring.

320
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:13,446
So if you just

321
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,606
take a detour

322
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:15,727
and you

323
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:17,796
Deployable!

324
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:19,856
Everything's accessorized!

325
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:20,937
Upgrade!

326
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,317
New hardware!

327
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:24,057
Pulse generator deployed!

328
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:25,778
Pulse generator out!

329
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,338
Generators pulsing!

330
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:32,060
What happens is you break the dam when you do something wrong.

331
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,461
So do it wrong, keep the tape rolling, and then do it right

332
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,702
without stopping.

333
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,443
And then you can also.

334
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,452
Just take a break!

335
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,753
Everybody needs to get out of the control room

336
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,855
for several minutes every hour, no matter what.

337
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,797
So, if you invest bits of time with your actors,

338
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,738
you give them the freedom to enjoy the process,

339
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,499
it becomes a fully shared experience,

340
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,101
you have a richer recording experience,

341
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:06,102
and everyone ends up with great audio.

342
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:08,263
I am DeeBee Cooper.

343
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,849
Now we've got about four minutes before they're going to throw us out of here.

344
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:25,370
So if we have any questions, please step up to the mic.

345
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,551
And if we run out of time, we'll roll next door.

346
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:29,272
Michael.

347
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:31,152
Thank you.

348
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,953
This is a very good session today.

349
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,894
You're looking lovely this morning as well.

350
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,515
Can I have a copy of that photo, please?

351
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:39,816
Yes, you may.

352
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,478
In fact, we'll roll back to it because it's so great.

353
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,759
These are happy audio guys.

354
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:47,960
Yeah.

355
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:50,125
Anybody else?

356
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,507
All right, if you need to come and see me later,

357
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,849
you'll probably be able to find me.

358
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,711
And have a great rest of the GDC.

359
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,532
Thank you for coming.
