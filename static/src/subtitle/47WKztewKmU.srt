00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:07,690
Hello everybody, my name is Xinxiang Chong, I'm a designer at Respawn Entertainment.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,653
Welcome to my talk, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, also less pretentiously known as

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:14,094
Evolution of Rodeo in Titanfall.

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:17,556
So quick reminder, please turn off all your cell phones.

5
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:21,779
We got a lot of ground to cover and only 16 minutes to do so, so we're just going to get

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,099
right to it.

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,561
So, what is Rodeo in Titanfall?

8
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,422
Well, in case you've never played the games before,

9
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:28,563
but for some reason are still interested in this talk,

10
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:31,865
the Titanfall series of games are first-person shooters

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,787
featuring acrobatic, wall-running pilots

12
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:36,108
dueling massive armored titans on the battlefield.

13
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,550
One of the signature moments of the game is something we call Rodeo,

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,692
where crafty pilots can sneak up on an unsuspecting titan

15
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,494
and jump onto their back.

16
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,716
In Titanfall 1, pilots rip off an access panel

17
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,978
and they shoot the exposed circuitry to deal heavy damage.

18
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:05,796
In Titanfall 2, however, Rodeo becomes a cat and mouse game of the pilot stealing a Titan battery,

19
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:08,862
taking a chunk of the Titan's health, and then the Titan frantically hunting

20
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,084
down the pilot to get the battery back.

21
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:36,571
So, what I'll do during this talk is give a highlighted tour of the history of Rodeo.

22
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,634
It won't be an exhaustive list of everything we tried with Rodeo, although I should be

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,497
here all day, but we'll cover the major milestones along the way.

24
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:47,580
I'll provide some insight about the unique design challenges for Rodeo.

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,864
Not many other games feature classes as distinct as Pilot and Titan, and making Rodeo be a

26
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,828
satisfying mechanic for both has actually some surprisingly difficult constraints, which

27
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:57,648
we'll go further into.

28
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:00,889
And lastly, we'll go into what we think went well,

29
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,673
as well as what we think went poorly with Rodeo.

30
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:06,435
Specifically, we'll talk about some of the rationale

31
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,277
behind the huge changes we made for Rodeo

32
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:09,158
between Titanfall 1 and 2,

33
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:12,041
and why we think it makes for better gameplay.

34
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,124
Incidentally, what this talk will not go into

35
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,185
is any in-depth details

36
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,327
of the technical implementation of Rodeo,

37
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:19,330
so if you're hoping to get details for that,

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,331
I'm sorry to disappoint.

39
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,774
But in the beginning, so back in August 2012,

40
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:27,516
what was eventually going to be Titanfall

41
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:30,237
was slowly but surely taking shape.

42
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,779
After spending years prototyping several concepts,

43
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,480
we decided to focus on two classes

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,001
for our multiplayer-only game,

45
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,522
wall-running, double-jumping, super-acrobatic pilots,

46
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:41,844
and giant mechanized weapons of destruction called Titans.

47
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,726
And the idea was that players would start the game

48
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:45,667
in a Titan, and then when it got really hurt,

49
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,848
they could eject away and get a second life as a pilot.

50
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:53,820
An early idea we had was, what if a pilot could jump onto the back of a Titan and do heavy damage to it?

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,980
And we called the idea Rodeo.

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,223
Rodeo was supposed to give pilot players another meaningful way to interact with enemy Titans,

53
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,944
other than just shooting at them from afar like a typical FPS.

54
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,906
And the picture you see here was painted by one of our designers, Jeff Smith,

55
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:11,869
early on to give an idea as to what this David vs. Goliath moment could look like.

56
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,436
So that was our first design goal for Rodeo, give a way for pilots to meaningfully interact

57
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,718
with titans, potentially doing heavy damage to them.

58
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:23,321
Of course, we didn't have the entirety of Titanfall designed back when we first started

59
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,361
implementing Rodeo.

60
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:28,004
As work on the game increased, so did our understanding of what it was we were making,

61
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,746
and our understanding for what other goals needed to be hit for Rodeo.

62
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:34,469
I'll come back to these goals as I show you the various iterations of Rodeo we had, and

63
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,830
how we were trying to do different things.

64
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:41,630
So, the very first major iteration for Rodeo had pilots immediately pop into place on the

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,651
back of a titan when they jumped near the titan.

66
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:46,712
After a short amount of time, an explosive would be planted on the titan, which would

67
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:47,572
blow the titan up.

68
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:02,606
So as you can see, this iteration is super barebones and simple, but even then it quickly

69
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:06,910
revealed a ton of issues that Rodeo had to contend with that weren't immediately obvious.

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,932
And the first and most glaring issue was that of communication.

71
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:12,574
How do you tell the Titan player what's happening?

72
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:17,178
So it's a first-person game, and the Titan player literally can't see that a pilot player

73
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,820
is jumping on your back and what they're doing once they got there.

74
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:24,431
As a pilot player, the problem is less apparent since Rodeo is pilot-initiated,

75
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,733
and the animations that it affects should convey what's going on,

76
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,575
but since Rodeo is a fairly unique element to Titanfall,

77
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,937
there's still quite a bit of a learning curve involved.

78
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:38,541
Next, once they understand what's going on, what should both sides do once Rodeo starts?

79
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,463
Clearly, it would be ideal if the Titan player could somehow react to what was going on,

80
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:46,766
and meaningful choices could be made on both the pilot and the Titan that would affect the outcome.

81
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,817
Lastly, how long should an entire sequence take?

82
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:53,399
Too long and it would distract from the main combat of the game,

83
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,742
but too short and you wouldn't be able to give the beats it deserved as a cinematic moment.

84
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:00,304
Of course, these aren't the only problems with Rodeo,

85
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:03,826
but these are issues at the heart of Rodeo that all versions of Rodeo have to contend with and solve.

86
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:09,350
So with that in mind, let's take a look at how the first iteration of Rodeo looked like from the perspective of the Titan.

87
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,903
So, as mentioned, this first major iteration of Rodeo

88
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,845
was implemented without us fully understanding

89
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,626
the issues involved, but it's useful for us

90
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,408
to take a look at how it addressed those issues

91
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:32,291
as a baseline we can use for future Rodeo attempts.

92
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:34,132
Firstly, communication.

93
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,913
Since this first major iteration of Rodeo,

94
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:38,694
we've handled this problem primarily

95
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:40,455
through HUD elements and sound.

96
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:43,057
These are the first and most obvious things to try.

97
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:45,018
And while they're not perfect, they kinda do the job.

98
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,378
When the pilot climbs on,

99
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,339
the tank gets HUD elements on screen saying,

100
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,960
you are being Rodeoed.

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,621
This is true even in the final shipped versions

102
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:53,722
of Titanfall and Titanfall 2.

103
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,305
second choice.

104
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,768
So for the pilot, once Rodeo starts,

105
00:05:57,768 --> 00:05:59,671
the input, sorry, the sequence completes

106
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:00,993
without any further input.

107
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,376
However, the pilot can also choose at any time

108
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,380
to cancel the process by manually jumping off.

109
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,747
For the Titan, they needed to find some way

110
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,888
of removing the pilot before rodeo was completed,

111
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:11,929
and otherwise they'd die.

112
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,870
Other than having a teammate shoot off the pilot for them,

113
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,491
the two main ways the Titan could remove the pilot

114
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,992
were to disembark from the Titan

115
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,873
and shoot the pilot off manually,

116
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,093
or use electric smoke.

117
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,874
And a quick sidebar, in case you didn't already know,

118
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,875
electric smoke was a Titan ability that,

119
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,056
as the name suggests,

120
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,797
deploys a cloud of lightning around the Titan

121
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:31,798
that zaps anyone in its immediate vicinity.

122
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,698
You can see how this would be useful for a Titan

123
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,119
to get the rodeo pilot off his back.

124
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,405
At this stage of the game, however, it was kind of like a super move from Street Fighter,

125
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:41,668
so you had to charge up a bar before you could deploy it.

126
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,833
So the ability to kill rodeo pilots with it was somewhat limited.

127
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:51,120
length. Uh, so this iteration of Rodeo lasted about a total of 6 seconds and our playtest

128
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,421
revealed that this was probably a bit on the short end as it gave little time for the Titan

129
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:58,982
to react to what was going on before they died. But that said, from the playtest we

130
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:03,343
were also pretty confident it shouldn't take 30 seconds or so to complete either. So that

131
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:07,644
gave us a range of maybe about 10 to 20 seconds or so as probably an ideal window as to how

132
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,644
long the process should take.

133
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,697
So, even though this version of Rodeo clearly had lots of things to improve on, it's important

134
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,839
to focus and see if it did what it set out to do.

135
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,403
Did it give a way for pilots to meaningfully interact with Titans, potentially doing heavy

136
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:19,903
damage to them?

137
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:23,947
And I think that yes, we could agree that we did indeed hit this design goal.

138
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:26,910
Pilots can now jump up onto Titans and blow them up with an explosive.

139
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,143
However, having rodeo be a binary outcome where the titan was either totally destroyed

140
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:35,466
or totally undamaged was kind of unsatisfying.

141
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,849
When the titan won, the pilot could feel like all his hard work in getting up close accomplished

142
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:40,489
absolutely nothing.

143
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:45,113
When the pilot won, the titan was instantly destroyed, and this was counter to the idea

144
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:47,475
that players could feel safer in a giant armored titan.

145
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:50,684
And on top of that, there was a desire

146
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,485
for more player choice in the sequence.

147
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,306
Having it just be a canned animation sequence

148
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,687
for the pilot wasn't quite ideal,

149
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,488
and Titan players wanted more ways

150
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:58,848
to get the pilots off their backs.

151
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:03,431
So that led us to the next major design goal for Rodeo.

152
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,492
Make Rodeo be a process of a more dynamic range

153
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,613
of outcomes affected by player choices and skill.

154
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:13,280
And the next iteration of Rodeo had you holding down a trigger to do a steadily increasing

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,443
amount of damage to the Titan.

156
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:18,551
The idea was that pilots would have a special Rodeo drill weapon that you could take out

157
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:20,616
during Rodeo, and holding down the trigger would activate it.

158
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:37,927
So, note that while the presentation for this is really rough, it's actually not too far

159
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:40,751
mechanics-wise from the final version of Rodeo that we shipped with in 10.4.1.

160
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:45,277
You can also see the inspiration from the original piece of concept art that I showed

161
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:45,537
earlier.

162
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:48,321
And this is how it looked like from the Titan's perspective.

163
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,649
So, how did this version compare to the previous one?

164
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,352
With regards to communication, once again,

165
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,033
primarily through hot elements and sound

166
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,114
that we tell Titan pilot what's going on.

167
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,716
Since the drill process was a continuous process

168
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,558
as opposed to the previous discrete process,

169
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,479
that gave more time for effects and sound,

170
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,260
et cetera, to be played,

171
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,242
which helped the communication process for the Titan.

172
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:25,023
For choice, this time around the pilot had to choose

173
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,364
to fire the weapon instead of being locked

174
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:27,525
into a fully animated sequence.

175
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,027
Now in this iteration, we only started giving the Titan

176
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,769
the warning that they were getting loaded

177
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,551
when the pilot started firing the weapon.

178
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,012
So there was an element of when the pilot

179
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,354
should start firing the weapon for maximum effect.

180
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:39,956
Ideally, you'd start firing when the Titan

181
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,798
was already distracted fighting other players.

182
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:44,180
For Titans, not much changed.

183
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,242
The two main choices remain to disembark

184
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,143
and shoot the pilot off or to use electric smoke.

185
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:55,677
Length. This iteration of Rodeo had a variable length, but to take a Titan from full health to 0 lasted a bit longer than before, about 10 seconds or so,

186
00:09:55,677 --> 00:10:01,601
although this was more easily tweakable than before by adjusting the amount of damage that the drill weapon did.

187
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,743
Now, did we hit the design goals of this iteration of Rodeo?

188
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,605
First goal was still preserved, so we'll check that off.

189
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:12,041
For the second goal, having the damage to the titan be applied over time made for a

190
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,725
vastly increased dynamic range of outcomes for rodeo.

191
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:18,090
Let titan players who are good at getting rodeo pilots off escape with minimal damage,

192
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,835
while letting rodeo pilots who failed to kill the titan still feel like they did something.

193
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,237
So yeah, we'll call that a success.

194
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:29,056
And while this version of Rodeo Play tested fairly well, the presentation needed a lot of work.

195
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:35,960
It also didn't help that we were technically unable to do the next step of putting an actual gun into the pilot's hands while rodeoing.

196
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,881
The code features we needed to really sell this feature just weren't quite there yet.

197
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,821
At this point in development time, however,

198
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,143
we were running very close to an internal milestone.

199
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,404
We needed to be able to present the game

200
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:46,805
at an internal EA marketing event,

201
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:47,966
and the current form of Rodeo

202
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,329
was way too far from being showable.

203
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,250
This was especially pressing

204
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,612
because we were trying to sell the concept

205
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,854
of a cinematic multiplayer for Titanfall.

206
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:58,957
So that led us to the next major design goal for Rodeo.

207
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,179
Make Rodeo be visually compelling.

208
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:07,197
This next major iteration of Rodeo we tried involved planting shaped charges that we called

209
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,638
cabers on the back of the titan after you had jumped on.

210
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,579
It would take multiple cabers to finish off a full health titan.

211
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,200
The Rodeo pilot would have to aim at specific spots to plant the charges, and the spots

212
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,261
would be semi-randomized.

213
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,902
And the titan player could also affect the aim of the Rodeo pilot by dashing around.

214
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,902
And this is how it looked like from the Titan's perspective.

215
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,542
So once again, we'll take a look at how this version

216
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,802
of Rodeo addressed issues before.

217
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,443
Communication, primarily through sound.

218
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:10,225
In this version, we had actually removed the big flashing,

219
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,966
you are being Rodeo'd, warnings,

220
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,147
as part of a conscious response to feedback

221
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,508
that there was always too many things on screen

222
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,429
in our crazy, chaotic game.

223
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,450
You could hear a thunk as each caber was planted,

224
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,991
but that was about it.

225
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,172
Playtesting did show, however, that we really did need

226
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,713
some kind of visual element on the screen

227
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:26,953
to tell you that Rodeo was being done to you,

228
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,554
so we eventually brought it back.

229
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:32,998
Choice. From the pilot's perspective, this was kind of like a mix between iterations 1 and 2.

230
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:37,920
Instead of a single planted explosive, the pilot chose to plant as many as they wanted before

231
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,762
jumping off and detonating them all. If the player died before jumping off, however, all the cabers

232
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,164
would just disappear. Not much change with regards to the Titan. They could still use electric smoke

233
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:52,545
or disembark and shoot off the pilot. Lastly, length. This iteration of Rodeo was definitely

234
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:56,487
slower than the previous iterations. It took about 15 seconds or so to plant enough cabers that a

235
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,427
Titan would die from them.

236
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:01,293
Same thing as before, let's look to see if we hit the design goals.

237
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:06,337
The first and the second design goals were still intact, so we'll check those off.

238
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:10,040
This version of Rodeo definitely looked more polished than the previous one,

239
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,862
and we successfully demoed it at the EA marketing event.

240
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:15,524
So yeah, we'll say we hit that goal.

241
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:18,746
However, internally, playtest feedback suggested that

242
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,508
this version of Rodeo was kind of too much like a minigame.

243
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,465
planting the cavers at random spots had to be taught.

244
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:25,906
And as a multiplayer only game

245
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,846
without a single player campaign,

246
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:28,967
mechanics that needed to be taught

247
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,668
were kind of already at the limit.

248
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:34,089
And that led us to Nick's major design goal for Rodeo,

249
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,469
make Rodeo be accessible.

250
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,770
So given the feedback from iteration three,

251
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,351
we decided to revisit iteration two

252
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:43,913
and actually do the technical work needed to finish it up.

253
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,994
We put in code features to properly handle

254
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,274
putting a weapon in a player's hands

255
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,235
while they were attached to the Titan.

256
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,155
And the player then needed to shoot his weapon

257
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,536
at a weak spot on Titan.

258
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,665
Bring it down.

259
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:05,848
Okay, you're time to start the launch. Call it when ready.

260
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,651
So we were still harboring the idea that when the Titan player knew that he was being rodeoed,

261
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:22,253
he could throw off the aim of the pilot on his back by dashing around, smashing themselves

262
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:22,914
into walls, etc.

263
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:26,696
So we made the weak point a relatively small area on the Titan.

264
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,899
We had art make us a little hatch panel that we attached to the Titan, and then we had

265
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,081
animation and damage effects for ripping it off and shooting into it.

266
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,722
And our initial playtests were pretty positive.

267
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:38,985
It felt like we had finally struck the right balance between it being fun, easy to understand,

268
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,806
accessible, and it being cinematic.

269
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:45,067
There were a few annoying lingering issues with the view of the Titan,

270
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,988
strongly affecting the view of the rodeo pilot.

271
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,268
So when the Titan dashed around and when he turned rapidly,

272
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,309
the pilot's view would kind of lurch right along with a sudden jolt of motion.

273
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,170
And it sometimes made rodeo maybe somewhat nauseating,

274
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,371
but generally we thought, this is it, this is what rodeo is going to be like.

275
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,651
Unfortunately, fixing the view issues took some time,

276
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,612
and we were running really close to our ship date,

277
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:06,273
so we decided to shelve any attempt to try and have the Titan stashing around,

278
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,433
throw off the aim of the rodeo pilot.

279
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,133
This is the perspective of the Titan.

280
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:29,987
Oops.

281
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,908
So once again, we'll run through the list of issues.

282
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:35,109
Since iteration four is pretty much a more polished

283
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,730
version of iteration two, you can expect that this part

284
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,770
is gonna be pretty similar.

285
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,731
Communication, primarily through HUD elements and sound.

286
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,512
However, with the addition of a hatch panel

287
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,512
on the brains of the Titan, we made Rodeo more grounded.

288
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,053
There was an actual physical thing

289
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:50,393
that pilots ripped out and shot at.

290
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:53,376
This helped sell the concept of what was going on to the pilot a lot better.

291
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:57,700
It also gave us the gameplay benefit of the first rodeo attempt on a Titan,

292
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,662
taking longer to start up, as the panel had to be ripped out first,

293
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:04,606
but subsequent attempts would let the pilot start shooting immediately.

294
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:05,446
Choice.

295
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:08,089
So with regards to the pilot, this was very similar to Edition 2.

296
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,992
However, the hatch panel having to be removed before the pilot could fire the weapon

297
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,453
was an additional prerequisite to be fulfilled.

298
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,182
For the Titan, we enhanced their existing choices.

299
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:19,904
First, by this time, electric smoke had become

300
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:22,126
a regular Titan ability that could be used on cooldown,

301
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,869
so it became much more effective of a counter for rodeo.

302
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,592
Secondly, to help players disembark and shoot the pilot off,

303
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,594
we made the player's auto-Titan kneel down

304
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,776
if it was being rodeoed.

305
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,498
So, this is a video that shows that.

306
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,122
So before we added this functionality, however,

307
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:44,963
when rodeoed, the player's Auto Titan would keep trying

308
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,665
to face the pilot on its back, shooting it.

309
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,087
So, you know, it kind of had about as much effect

310
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,428
as a dog chasing its own tail.

311
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,830
Since the Auto Titan now kneeled,

312
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,511
it was much easier to shoot the pilot off.

313
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,073
And it also gave us a way to visually communicate from afar

314
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,674
that the Auto Titan was getting rodeoed.

315
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,916
length. So this iteration already had a variable length, but to take a Titan from full health to

316
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:11,158
zero lasted about 15 to 20 seconds, which is the longest of all the iterations we had so far.

317
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:15,940
As mentioned before, this is about long enough for Titans to react to what's going on and for us to

318
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,921
sell the cinematic experience of it, but not too long where it starts to drag on like a separate

319
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:20,202
mini-game.

320
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,453
Did we hit the design goals?

321
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:24,773
First goal is definitely intact.

322
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:26,995
In fact, at this point, since we had added the concept

323
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:28,315
of shields to the Titan,

324
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,837
we made rodeo damage bypass the shield

325
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:33,818
and that increased the strategic value of doing rodeo

326
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:36,900
as opposed to just firing an anti-Titan weapon normally.

327
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,221
The second goal is intact as well,

328
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,002
just by the nature of letting how much damage

329
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:43,844
a pilot does be dependent on how long he stays on the Titan,

330
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,925
which can be affected by both pilot and Titan choices.

331
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,649
And we hit the third design go-to by doing a bunch more presentation work.

332
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:54,014
Having the technical feature to have a player hold on to a gun while rotoing,

333
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,198
having a hatch panel that reacted to being shot,

334
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,201
it all helped to sell the experience.

335
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,323
Lastly, accessibility.

336
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,924
We think that Rodeo in Titanfall 1

337
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,005
is actually pretty accessible to new players.

338
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,726
The only inputs involved with Rodeo as a pilot

339
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:07,866
are one, jump towards a titan,

340
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:09,147
and two, shoot your gun at a weak point.

341
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,687
These are actions we ask the player to do

342
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,548
in the rest of the game,

343
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:14,629
and as such, it's actually very feasible

344
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:17,971
that a player with no information whatsoever

345
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,092
can stumble upon Rodeo during the course of normal gameplay

346
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:22,552
and understand instantly how to play it.

347
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:29,876
It's admittedly less accessible from the Titan's perspective, but we've done things like make the Titan OS call out when you're getting rodeoed,

348
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,078
and even advise you to disembark and remove the pilot from your hull.

349
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,019
Overall, I think the accessibility of rodeo is a big win.

350
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,090
At this point in time, we've arrived at how Rodeo shipped in Titanfall 1.

351
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,251
I think it's appropriate to take a step back and reflect a bit deeper on some of the things

352
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:46,412
we thought went well with Rodeo and not so well.

353
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:50,193
Firstly, and most importantly, Rodeo proved to be popular with players in Titanfall.

354
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:54,314
Far and away the most important thing when you're developing a new mechanic is if players

355
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:54,894
enjoy it or not.

356
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:59,535
While internal playtest feedback is often a good barometer for success, nothing beats

357
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:00,475
actual player feedback.

358
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:05,256
There's plenty of YouTube videos of epic Rodeo moments, and sentiment on Rodeo is generally

359
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:06,717
positive, so we'll treat that as a win.

360
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:12,819
Balance. A general sentiment in the community is that Rodeo is fairly well balanced. Even

361
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,420
among high-level competitive players, there is a bit of a divide between whether pilots

362
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,201
or titans have the upper hand when it comes to Rodeo, with some really powerful tactics

363
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:25,343
available to both pilot and titan players in a 1v1 situation. For example, titans can

364
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:29,604
use the cluster missile and crouch looking upwards to pin the Rodeo pilot with their

365
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:33,746
backs against the wall and kill them from the explosion, at the cost of heavy damage

366
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:34,206
to themselves.

367
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,291
Pilots can jump on, and instead of just shooting their weapon into the weak spot,

368
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,374
they can attempt to call down a Warpfall Titan on their opponent,

369
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:51,157
eliminating both Titan and Pilot in one quick move.

370
00:19:51,157 --> 00:20:03,488
So we'll take the fact that Rodeo is deep enough to support multiple advanced tactics as a win, too.

371
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:07,211
Returning back to what went well for Titanfall 1's version of Rodeo.

372
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,647
A fantasy fulfillment aspect.

373
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,629
David versus Goliath is always a popular trope,

374
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,290
and Rodeo evokes that imagery very well.

375
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,713
Another thing that went well with Rodeo,

376
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,595
organic interactions with the Titan Eject system.

377
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,797
Ejecting from your doomed Titan

378
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:23,179
onto the back of a Titan who was shooting you

379
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:24,881
is a very satisfying highlight in our game

380
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,603
that happens as a natural result

381
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:28,264
of both systems working as intended.

382
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:31,227
So this is a short clip from our E3 reveal trailer

383
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,548
showcasing the moment from ejecting

384
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,589
from your Titan into a Rodeo.

385
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,913
The other interaction that comes with eject is when you eject from your Titan and when

386
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,274
an enemy player is rotoing you.

387
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:07,398
Both you and the roto player are thrust high into the air when you can have an epic duel

388
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:08,879
while falling down.

389
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:12,882
This is a lot more deliberate than the first interaction and had plenty of bugs, but we

390
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,924
think the end result was very much worth it.

391
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:21,949
This is a clip from YouTube that showcases that moment.

392
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:32,048
So lastly, since we allow players in the same team

393
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:34,632
to rodeo their teammates, or as we like to call it,

394
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:37,776
brodeo, there's a number of interesting interactions

395
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:38,838
that result.

396
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,541
First of all, since only one person

397
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,403
can be rodeoing a tent at a time,

398
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:44,586
brodeoing blocks enemy rodeo attempts from happening.

399
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,364
Secondly, Brodewing is a great way for a Titan to quickly ferry pilots to destinations.

400
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:54,907
For example in CTF, since Titans can't carry flags, a popular tactic is to have your pilot

401
00:21:54,907 --> 00:22:01,371
teammate pick up the flag, have him jump on a Titan teammate, and have the Titan carry

402
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:03,852
the pilot quickly to the flag cap base.

403
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:08,135
And so here I picked a video from YouTube showing the Brodew flag cap and how excited

404
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:10,957
the players are to pull this off.

405
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:17,881
Oh my god, this is amazing. This is so good. Oh my god. Oh, I did not think of this

406
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:26,169
I did not think of this. I did not. Oh, that's brilliant. I love it. Titans are made for this game, lads

407
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,913
Come on, go go go go right in the window

408
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,394
Oh get in there get in

409
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:36,158
All right, come back do it again do it again

410
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:36,198
Oh

411
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,699
So to encourage this teamwork element of Rodeo,

412
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,720
we even added a feature where as long as the Titan

413
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,121
carrying the pilot has shields,

414
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:46,282
any damage that the pilot passenger would take

415
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,663
is passed on first to the shields.

416
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,624
And these small things add a very much needed

417
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:52,325
amount of teamwork in the game.

418
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,646
So now that we've patted ourselves on the back a bit,

419
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:55,667
it's time to be a bit more harsh

420
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,448
and look at what we think went poorly for Rodeo.

421
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:01,569
First, the back and forth between the Titan and the pilot could be improved.

422
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:05,773
Note that even though we previously said that Rodeo supported a wide range of high level

423
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:10,296
tactics, there's generally a lack of meaningful things that the Titan player can do as a Titan.

424
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:15,080
Electric Smoke as an option is the loadout choice, but when activated, it really doesn't

425
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,404
offer much in the way of interesting gameplay beyond activate it and wait for the pilot

426
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:20,565
to die or jump off.

427
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,588
The cluster missile yourself in the corner tactic is kind of awkward, and it's a sign

428
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,770
that there isn't really a better option for Titans to do.

429
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:35,554
Getting out from your Titan to shoot the pilot is a valid option, but having to disembark feels like a bit of a concession that you don't really have an option as a Titan.

430
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:41,578
In addition to that, in our in-office playtest, once the Titan player hears the kutunk from the rodeo pilot climbing on,

431
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:45,099
the Titan player often disembarks immediately and tries to shoot him off.

432
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:49,922
The rodeo pilot then tries to jump off and take out the newly disembarked player, or he hides somewhere.

433
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:54,024
And this can lead to a very frustrating game of get out, get in, get out, hide and seek for the Titan player.

434
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:59,196
And this YouTube video shows this loop of the player getting out of the Titan, getting back in, repeat.

435
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,617
So he gets out, there's a dude on him, he jumps off, he's like, okay, I guess I'm getting back in my Titan.

436
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:06,459
Gets back in, he notices the guy is still on his back, and he's like, alright, fine, I'm getting out.

437
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:10,560
He tries to shoot him, and the rodeo pilot jumps again.

438
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,682
This time he fakes going back in before actually shooting the pilot off.

439
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:18,984
So, another thing that went poorly for rodeo, aiming during a rodeo.

440
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:29,042
We talked about Brodeal having useful applications, but actually staying on top of a friendly

441
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:33,187
titan and trying to shoot a target can be an exercise in frustration.

442
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:37,031
Titans move at a really fast clip and a lot of the screen of the Brodeal player is taken

443
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:40,095
up by the model of the titan, which makes it very hard to shoot anything accurately.

444
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:42,808
Last of all, readability.

445
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:46,929
As mentioned before, Titans can move really quickly

446
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,730
and only one person can rodeo a Titan at a time.

447
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,890
Sometimes when you turn the corner

448
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,150
and see an enemy Titan close by,

449
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,351
you just jump out in reaction.

450
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,491
It's hard to see sometimes though

451
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:56,232
if the Titan already has somebody rodeoing him,

452
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:59,193
and if it does, it often ends in the pilot's untimely death

453
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,214
as he gets squished by the walking Titan.

454
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:03,354
This is a constant source of frustration.

455
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,235
All right, so that was how rodeo was developed

456
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:06,636
in Titanfall 1.

457
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,136
We're about halfway into the talk.

458
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,296
How's everybody doing?

459
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:17,070
Alright, alright, so hold on tight because now we're going to go into the story of how and why we did Rodeo in 10.4.2.

460
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,273
So even though we clearly understood that Rodeo in 10.4.1 wasn't perfect and could be improved,

461
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:29,279
that still doesn't quite explain why we decided to totally change Rodeo drastically from 10.4.1 to 10.4.2.

462
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,924
As a reminder, we went from this... ...

463
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:35,925
... ...to this.

464
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:54,342
And this is the view from the Titan's perspective.

465
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:05,105
So to give some context as to why we changed Ruri

466
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,066
the way we did, we first need to get some history

467
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,307
in an experiment we did to Titan health.

468
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:10,947
In an effort to have a better sense of pacing

469
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,868
during Titan fights, we tried a system where,

470
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,989
instead of having shields, Titans had a series

471
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:15,769
of health chiclets.

472
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:18,651
These health chiclets would regenerate over time,

473
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,451
much like shields did in Titanfall 1,

474
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:22,572
but once a chiclet was gone, that portion of health

475
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:23,733
was lost permanently.

476
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,554
The idea was that it would give players a sense

477
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,734
of when they could play aggressively,

478
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,655
when a chiclet was full, and when they should play

479
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,076
defensively, when the chiclet is low.

480
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:37,460
When the player lost the chicklet, the tank would get a short period of invincibility, similar to getting knocked down in fighting games like in Street Fighter.

481
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,062
It would allow the victim some time to breathe, recover, and plan what to do next.

482
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:51,467
If you look at the top of the screen, you'll notice that the blue health bar is divided into three sections, or the chicklets as we call them.

483
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,889
You can also see that the enemy health bar in yellow is similarly divided into three.

484
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:03,295
So notice that as we fire on an enemy Titan,

485
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:04,615
as long as we don't do enough damage

486
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:07,356
to cross the Chiclet threshold,

487
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,696
you will be able to regen all the health you lost.

488
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,077
But once you cross the Chiclet threshold,

489
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:16,037
the enemy becomes temporarily invulnerable

490
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,138
and he has a shield to protect him.

491
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,438
Once the invulnerability fades,

492
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,578
that first health Chiclet,

493
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:21,778
you can damage the Titan again,

494
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,819
but that first Chiclet of health is now permanently lost.

495
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,420
And he only regens up to the second Chiclet.

496
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:36,035
So, unfortunately, the health chiclet system did not play very well with Rodeo at all.

497
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:40,477
Since you could regen all the damage you took until you lost a chiclet, it became a very

498
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:44,319
common occurrence that Rodeo wouldn't do enough damage to finish off a chiclet, which meant

499
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:46,380
the pilot player didn't do any lasting damage at all.

500
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,582
This was made worse by the fact that under the chiclet system, Titans didn't have a concept

501
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:54,824
of a normal shield anymore, which meant that the Rodeo damage, which bypassed the shield,

502
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,685
wasn't as advantageous anymore as compared to regular damage.

503
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:03,477
The invulnerability period also played havoc with the pacing of Rodeo.

504
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:07,080
The early iterations of the health checklist system gave the Titan a dome shield for a

505
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,103
few seconds, and that's the red shield that protects the Titan during Titanfall that also

506
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,965
does damage to enemies inside it.

507
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:17,549
It also forcibly threw the Rodeo pilot off the Titan to avoid the pilot getting killed

508
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:18,830
by the dome shield we gave the Titan.

509
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:22,919
Eventually, for other reasons, we stopped giving the Titan a dome shield, but we still

510
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,741
gave the Titan a period of invulnerability, which meant that rodeo shots during that time

511
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:30,043
just did no damage at all, so a pilot had to stop firing for a while.

512
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:35,625
The health checklist experiments lasted for a while, so it became pressing for us to see

513
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:39,267
if we could make rodeo work with it, instead of having rodeo be in an essentially broken

514
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:39,927
state for too long.

515
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,613
Once we agreed that something needed to be done for Rodeo, the design actually came together fairly quickly.

516
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:51,137
Since we wanted to keep the pacing of health chicklets, it was pretty intuitive that we made Rodeo just do a single chicklet's worth of damage.

517
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:55,419
This made it so that when the chicklet threshold would always be triggered when you Rodeoed,

518
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:59,882
and a Titan would have that moment of being able to catch their breath and reorientate themselves after getting Rodeoed.

519
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:05,376
The idea of batteries was also being floated around in design discussions when we were

520
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:09,259
talking about potential systems to limit how long Titans stayed on the battlefield.

521
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:13,283
So for example, maybe each Titan only had a minute worth of power, but players could

522
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,644
pick up batteries to extend this time.

523
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:17,326
This seemed like a great fit for Rodeo and health chiclets.

524
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:21,169
We could make chiclets be visually represented on the health bar as batteries, and Rodeo

525
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:23,291
be the act of removing one of these batteries.

526
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,814
It made the act of Rodeo doing one chiclet of damage a lot more understandable, and the

527
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,215
whole concept came together pretty well.

528
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:33,526
So if Rodeo was the act of removing a battery, it was a natural step for Brodeo to be the

529
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:37,049
reverse of inserting a battery and restoring a chiclet.

530
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,212
It's a simple idea but it actually has pretty far-reaching implications.

531
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,315
Nothing else in the game allows you to help your teammates in such a direct fashion.

532
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,798
Suddenly there's a whole new vector for players to contribute to winning the match instead

533
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:47,839
of just killing the opponent.

534
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:52,799
Titanfall had a kind of reputation as being a game that favoured a very lone wolf type

535
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,221
of style of playing the game, but now that your allies could heal you, there was suddenly

536
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,802
a lot more coordination, more communication.

537
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:01,843
We'd hear feedback from playtests that players would think they were going to lose the fight

538
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:05,145
against an enemy titan, but out of nowhere a teammate steals a battery from the attacker

539
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:08,866
and plunges it into the bag, allowing them to turn the tables on the fight.

540
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:11,108
And more than anything else, the positive vibes

541
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,548
that resulted from this interaction

542
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,889
was what convinced us that this iteration of Rodeo

543
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:16,370
was something we should commit to shipping.

544
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,111
In fact, we thought this version of battery-style Rodeo

545
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,573
was strong enough that we decided to ship it,

546
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:23,674
even though in the end, the inspiration,

547
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:24,974
the health checklists didn't ship.

548
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:26,575
So here we'll see gameplay footage

549
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,276
of a player in the battery medic role.

550
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:31,097
It's the last time in a standing match.

551
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:33,038
He's trying to keep the last hand on his team alive

552
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:33,878
by feeding him batteries.

553
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:36,160
As you see, he's able to turn the tide of the battle

554
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,740
by effectively being a healer for his teammate.

555
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,480
You're the last titan.

556
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,462
I'm getting you a battery.

557
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,303
I'm trying to get you a battery.

558
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,372
I'm getting this battery too!

559
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:25,566
You can make it!

560
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:26,186
Good job!

561
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,740
So another seemingly small but important change

562
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,821
that resulted from this was the duration of Rodeo.

563
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:35,363
Since we only wanted pilots to do a chiclet's worth

564
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:36,783
of damage when sealing a battery,

565
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:38,264
and we wanted them to take that battery

566
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,245
to insert into a friendly Titan,

567
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,226
it seemed obvious that we kicked the pilot off automatically

568
00:31:42,226 --> 00:31:45,148
after the sealing battery sequence was complete.

569
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:47,229
And with this change, Rodeo shifted away

570
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:48,689
from being a long process that happened

571
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:49,610
over a period of time,

572
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,771
to a short event that is follow-up gameplay.

573
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,142
For the pilot, the gameplay is to get away

574
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:55,442
with the precious stolen battery

575
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:57,123
and deliver it to a teammate.

576
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,384
For the Titan, the gameplay is to now chase down the pilot

577
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,925
and take back the battery.

578
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:03,866
This new cat and mouse element of post-Rodeo gameplay

579
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,587
reinforced some of the broader gameplay themes

580
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,727
we had with Titanfall.

581
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,328
It also confirmed some of the suspicions I had previously

582
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,430
about Titanfall 1's Rodeo, that the actual worst part of it

583
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,811
is the pilot shooting the Titan's hatch panel.

584
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:16,011
From the pilot's perspective,

585
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,932
shooting a basically stationary target,

586
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:20,193
reloading and repeating until the Titan is dead

587
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:22,354
is not very interesting, mechanically speaking.

588
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:28,849
From the Titans perspective a general lack of tools other than electric smoke to get the pilot shooting you off your back was kind of frustrating

589
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:31,393
But now that the gameplay part of Rodeo lies

590
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:33,174
in what happens after the battery is stolen,

591
00:32:33,174 --> 00:32:34,755
the weapons, the kits, the mechanics,

592
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:36,316
and the rest of the game all play a part

593
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:38,057
in whether or not the pilot can get away,

594
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,418
which makes for a richer gameplay experience.

595
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,079
For example, the pilots can use the grappling hook

596
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,180
to speed away quickly.

597
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,560
They can use cloak or phase shift

598
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,062
to disorientate the Titans to where they actually are.

599
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,943
They can use wall running to quickly scamper up buildings

600
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:49,863
and onto rooftops.

601
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:52,164
Titans can use their dash to quickly catch up

602
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:53,345
with the escaping pilot,

603
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:55,026
and use their assorted weapons to kill the pilot

604
00:32:55,026 --> 00:32:55,887
and retrieve the battery.

605
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:01,234
And with that, the base design for Rodeo in Titanfall 2 was complete.

606
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:04,737
The first major iteration of this battery-style Rodeo was complete in early July 2015, and

607
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:08,640
even though we added more features to support it, the overall design didn't change very

608
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,861
much since then.

609
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:14,265
Some examples of things that we added to help the experience are the ability to use the

610
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,687
battery on the player's own Titan by embarking into the Titan with it.

611
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:21,650
So this weakens the incentive to help a teammate with the battery somewhat, but it does reduce

612
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,813
the frustration when you manage to steal a battery, but you have no teammates to give

613
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:25,373
the battery to.

614
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,838
overhead indicator for the battery for the Titan.

615
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:31,459
So with the speed at which pilots can move in our game,

616
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,400
it's very easy to visually lose track of the pilot,

617
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,161
which hurt the cat and mouse gameplay

618
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,262
we were trying to support.

619
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:38,843
The indicator, as of release,

620
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:40,784
lasts for about 10 seconds before fading out,

621
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:42,605
which we thought was a good balance.

622
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,465
It's long enough for the Titan

623
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:45,306
to not have to drop everything immediately

624
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:46,687
and chase after the pilot,

625
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:47,607
but short enough that the pilot

626
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:48,908
doesn't feel punished forever

627
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,689
for not being able to quickly get rid of the battery.

628
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,881
an ability for the pilot to call out to friendly Titans

629
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,662
that they have a battery.

630
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,203
In an ideal world, this would already be handled

631
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,584
through verbal communications over a microphone,

632
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,905
but this allows even pickup groups to communicate

633
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:05,085
and coordinate to some extent.

634
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:08,587
This was in response to feedback that was very frustrating

635
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:09,787
to chase after a friendly Titan

636
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:11,248
when you were trying to give them a battery,

637
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,369
but the Titan would be oblivious of you trying to help.

638
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,692
And since we were committing to the battery being a physical object that the pilot would carry around,

639
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:24,435
it made sense to limit pilots to only be able to carry around a single battery.

640
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:29,037
Initially, we tried to just flat out disallow players from rotating if they already carried a battery,

641
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:33,019
but this fought too much against feedback that players wanted to keep rotating the enemy Titan.

642
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:36,561
So to satisfy this repeated request for pilots to keep rotating,

643
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:39,502
we made a different version of Rodeo for players who were already carrying a battery.

644
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:43,124
Instead of stealing more batteries, the pilot would chuck a grenade down the port of the Titan.

645
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:58,088
Since we wanted to encourage this hide-and-seek gameplay of stealing a battery and running

646
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:02,150
away with it, we tried to discourage grenade rodeo by making it do half as much damage

647
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,110
as the regular rodeo.

648
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,371
So for completeness sake, we'll run through the list of issues again and see how it stacks

649
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,512
up to the previous attempts.

650
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,844
Communication, same as before, we rely mainly on HUD elements and sound to sell the experience

651
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:14,204
to the player.

652
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:18,989
Admittedly, this aspect is probably a bit weaker than Titanfall 1's version of Rodeo

653
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:23,192
since the concept of a battery and having to steal it and insert it into friendlies

654
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:26,655
is much more abstract than just shooting into the weak point of an enemy titan.

655
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:34,910
On the plus side, however, since Sandfall 2 has a full single-player campaign, we were able to rely on the campaign to teach some of the mechanics for batteries.

656
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:42,415
Indeed, the first thing that BT, the single-player campaign's titan, asks you to do is to bring him some batteries so he can recover from a depowered state.

657
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:49,320
Choice. As mentioned before, much of the choice for Rodeo is now shifted to the part after the pilot steals the battery.

658
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,303
From there, pilots have access to their full suite of mobility options, scrappling hooks, dim, etc.

659
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:57,191
Similarly, Titans have access to all their loadout

660
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:59,032
to be able to kill the escaping pilot.

661
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,334
We did bring back electric smoke from Titanfall 1

662
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,956
as a universal tool that all Titans have access to

663
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,478
once they hit a 20% charge in their Titan core meter.

664
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:09,240
Length, so it takes about five seconds or so

665
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,482
to steal the battery and from there,

666
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:12,583
it's variable as to whether or not

667
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,824
the battery is recovered.

668
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:16,646
Similarly, although for Titanfall 2

669
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:19,008
we didn't initially set out to solve explicit design goals

670
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,169
when iterating on Rodeo,

671
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:22,511
it's useful to re-examine the goals we had before

672
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,032
to see if they're still met.

673
00:36:25,002 --> 00:36:32,311
So the first goal is still intact. Arguably, the aspect of doing heavy damage is weakened since each rodeo does at most one chunk of damage,

674
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:36,476
as opposed to the unlimited amount of potential damage that Titanfall 1 rodeo had.

675
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:44,805
However, the ability to give batteries to friendlies as well as the cat-and-mouse aspect of Titanfall 2's rodeo makes this goal overwhelmingly accomplished in Titanfall 2's favour.

676
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,519
The second goal is intact as well.

677
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,263
Pilots need to leverage their skills at traversal to get away from the Titan, and Titans need

678
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:57,885
to use their skill in hunting pilots to get the most out of the rodeo experience.

679
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,547
We think the third goal is also accomplished, although one could probably argue the visual

680
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:04,569
presentation for Titanfall 1's rodeo is stronger and more compelling.

681
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,831
Shooting at the brains of a Titan feels more compelling in a more abstract, stealing a

682
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:09,972
battery sequence.

683
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:12,173
The grenade version of the rodeo does help with this, however.

684
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,342
And the last goal is arguably where we gave up the most compared to the previous version of Rodeo.

685
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:21,923
A battery is an abstract concept, despite the lengths we go to make it more grounded.

686
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:25,585
It does help that we have a single-player campaign to slowly teach the player the concepts,

687
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:27,366
so we'll call this a mixed success.

688
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:32,628
Lastly, it's also instructive for us to re-examine what went well for Rodeo in Titanfall 1,

689
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:36,310
and see if those are still applicable to Titanfall 2,

690
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,471
and to see if anything new was added to the list.

691
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:45,087
At this point in time, it's maybe a bit too premature to comment about whether it's popular or well-balanced.

692
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:49,090
There is some feedback, even internally as well, about people who missed the feel of 10-4-1 style rodeo,

693
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:54,694
and that's certainly to be expected when you make a big change to a prominent mechanic.

694
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:58,197
But my hope is that over time, people will prefer this new style of rodeo.

695
00:37:58,197 --> 00:37:58,797
Fantasy Fulfillment.

696
00:37:58,797 --> 00:38:04,942
Admittedly, the concept of you pulling out a battery is weaker from a fantasy fulfillment aspect

697
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:09,085
compared to shooting the brains of a titan, so it's kind of unfortunate we took a step back in that regard.

698
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:13,152
The organic interactions of the Titan eject system

699
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:15,333
were preserved from Titanfall 1, so that's a win for us.

700
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,094
In fact, more parts of the game started

701
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,755
to have richer interactions with Rodeo's chase component.

702
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:24,356
So we think this was a big improvement overall.

703
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:26,596
Rodeo also felt much more improved and richer

704
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,917
since the pilot now has a strong supporting role.

705
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,238
Previously, it was mainly the Titan supporting the pilot

706
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:33,078
by ferrying the pilot to a hard point, et cetera.

707
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:36,199
Going down the list, let's see if we improved

708
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,480
what went poorly last time around.

709
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:42,334
The back and forth between the Titan and the pilot feels better this time around.

710
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:46,057
For the most part, we got rid of the Titan player feeling like they had to disembark

711
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,419
to shoot the pilot off. I think that's an improvement, especially from the fantasy

712
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:54,263
fulfillment aspect of David vs Goliath. The chase component of Rodeo is mechanically richer and

713
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:57,986
offers more room for counterplay than the old version of Rodeo. Since the amount of time the

714
00:38:57,986 --> 00:39:01,689
pilot is on the back of the Titan is minimized, there's less pressure for us to create tools

715
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,430
for the Titan to get the pilot off their back.

716
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:10,411
Aiming during Brodeo. This is generally improved because the position in which the pilot climbs on for Brodeo is

717
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:13,333
higher than Titanfall 1, which makes it slightly easier to aim.

718
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:18,156
It's still not easy and there'll probably always be limits as to how good we can make it, but overall

719
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,197
I think there's a noticeable improvement.

720
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:24,940
So these two pictures just show the improvement we're talking about. The picture on the left is Titanfall 1 and the picture on the right

721
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,502
is Titanfall 2. Notice how much more of the screen's real estate is taken up by the Titan's body in the left screenshot.

722
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:37,378
Lastly, the problem of being able to tell at a glance whether you can rodeo a titan is still there,

723
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:44,062
but the situation is less of a problem than before since rodeo normally only has the enemy pilot on the back of the titan for about 5 seconds or so.

724
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:49,346
Admittedly, a titan with a buddy on him can still be hard to tell at a glance, but other changes that we made,

725
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,708
for example the enemy highlighting system, should hopefully help with this as well.

726
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:57,220
So one interesting development about Rodeo that we had for Titanfall 2

727
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,004
was the need to have different behaviors for the single-player campaign versus the multiplayer.

728
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:07,190
This was somewhat regrettable, but ultimately necessary to best serve the needs of the game type.

729
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,632
In multiplayer, only pilots can pick up a battery.

730
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:13,055
To apply a battery to the Titan, it either has to be done via Rodeo,

731
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:15,858
or by a pilot climbing to his own Titan.

732
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:19,422
In SP, though, we allow you to pick up one as a Titan by simply walking over it.

733
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,618
There are 3 main reasons for adding this extra limitation in multiplayer.

734
00:40:23,618 --> 00:40:27,767
First, it doesn't encourage teamwork a bit more between pilots and Titans on the same team.

735
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,671
If the Titan could just walk over a battery,

736
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:32,196
there's less reason for you to need to depend on your teammates.

737
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:36,704
The second reason is to give an element of counterplay and risk-win reward.

738
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:40,425
If there are no friendly pilots around, the Titan player has to disembark to pick up a battery,

739
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:44,745
and then re-embark to apply that battery. This is a process that takes time and makes

740
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:50,566
the disembarking pilot more vulnerable. It also makes mid-combat pickups of batteries less likely,

741
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:53,287
which helps make the fights between Titans be a bit more controlled.

742
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:58,088
Lastly, there was a general desire on the MP team to make Titans last

743
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,208
just a bit shorter on the battlefield compared to Titanfall 1.

744
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:05,226
and making it a bit less convenient to pick up the batteries a step in that direction.

745
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:10,788
These reasons though aren't really applicable in SP, so we just made Tens able to pick up

746
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:11,828
batteries by walking over them.

747
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:15,809
There are some other subtle differences, like the amount of health and shield that the battery

748
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,430
application gives you, but those are relatively minor.

749
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:23,640
So we've gone on a journey of how Rodeo was conceived,

750
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,623
its various implementations through to Titanfall 1,

751
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:29,025
and why we made the changes we did for Titanfall 2.

752
00:41:29,025 --> 00:41:30,066
Before we end the talk, however,

753
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:31,287
there's a few other bits and pieces

754
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:33,069
I'd like to talk about for the design of Rodeo

755
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:36,012
that didn't quite fit the mainly chronological nature

756
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:36,612
for the rest of the talk.

757
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:40,584
The first of these things I'd like to talk about is the trigger condition for Rodeo,

758
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,186
and by that I mean how does the player initiate Rodeo.

759
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:48,129
The very first iteration of Rodeo had pilots automatically magnetized onto Titans when

760
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:53,533
jumping near them. There's no extra button input needed. In part, this was done out of simplicity

761
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:58,456
to get the simplest thing possible to playtest the idea of Rodeo. This automatic activation

762
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:02,779
had a divided response. Some players enjoyed the ease of which it happened, but others hated how

763
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:05,941
sometimes it happened even though they wanted to jump away from the Titan instead.

764
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:11,243
I was very resistant, maybe unreasonably so, to the idea of having rodeo trigger only when

765
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:16,085
the use button was held down since I thought it was an unnecessary barrier of execution.

766
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:21,187
This is especially so for consoles where you'd be asking the players who had their thumbs on

767
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:27,130
the lookstick to move it to the jump button and then to use the hold button. This just feels clunky.

768
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,286
We did eventually try out a jetpack assist ability

769
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:35,507
for pilots which involved them using the use button

770
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,508
and being propelled towards the Titan they were looking at.

771
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:39,568
At this stage of development,

772
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:42,009
Titans were a little too fast at getting around the map

773
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,870
and this was done in part to help make rodeo

774
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,130
a little easier and to respond to suggestions

775
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,011
that having rodeo be triggered by a button press

776
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:49,832
would make it more interactive and more immersive.

777
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:59,907
In the final shipping game for Titanfall 1, however, the trigger conditions for Rodeo

778
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:04,431
remained very similar to how it was initially implemented, with it happening automatically

779
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:05,553
when you're jumping near a Titan.

780
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:09,757
I feel like this is one of the reasons why Rodeo is so successful, because it's easily

781
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:12,219
done and even naturally discoverable and learnable.

782
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:16,083
You could conceivably stumble upon it without anybody telling you what Rodeo was, and it

783
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,586
would, hopefully, make immediate sense to you.

784
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:21,420
In Titanfall 2, this is largely unchanged,

785
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,601
although we did adjust the angles and the height

786
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,283
required to get frontal Rodeo to start.

787
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:28,044
The idea behind this is that it's often frustrating

788
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:29,886
from the Titan's perspective that you see a pilot

789
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:32,407
in front of you, they jump, you try to punch them,

790
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:34,509
et cetera, instead of the pilot exploding

791
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:35,570
in a glorious pile of jibs,

792
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,871
they disappear and start Rodeo instead.

793
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:39,552
And some of this is caused by latency

794
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:41,414
and it's kind of hard to solve,

795
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:43,715
so we just made Rodeo not trigger for the pilot

796
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:45,256
when he's jumping straight on towards the Titan.

797
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:50,178
Personally, I kind of dislike this since Titans can actually turn very quickly, especially on PC.

798
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:53,579
So what started out as a pilot trying to jump onto a Titan's back,

799
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,380
can quickly turn into a Titan facing the pilot directly,

800
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,061
and the pilot getting stomped at a Titan's feet.

801
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:00,782
That said though, we're going to be monitoring players' feedback on that

802
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:02,742
to see if they prefer that frontal rodeo is harder.

803
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:09,742
Another thing I wanted to talk about was some of the counterplay options we tried in the development of Rodeo,

804
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:12,444
i.e. what options did the Titan have to get the pilot off their back?

805
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:15,146
As I went through the various iterations of Rodeo in Titanfall 1,

806
00:44:15,146 --> 00:44:19,710
you may have noticed there didn't really seem to be any new ways we added for the Titan to remove the pilots off their back.

807
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,312
It was always just disembark or electric smoke.

808
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:28,817
And to be honest, this isn't because we didn't try, it's just that all the things we did try left something to be desired.

809
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:32,681
Here I'll talk about some of the few interesting things in this category that we tried that didn't ship.

810
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:39,721
So wall smashing. The inspiration for this came from this fight scene in the Princess Bride.

811
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,204
I'll be wearing them in the future.

812
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:46,445
I just feared what you'd give me so much trouble.

813
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:46,765
Why is that?

814
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:54,590
So, we had an idea that the Titan player could use their dash ability to ram themselves into a wall,

815
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,551
doing damage to the pilot and shaking him off.

816
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:09,216
So, it took multiple dashes to shake off a full health pilot,

817
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:11,437
which meant that the ogre with the smallest amount of dashes

818
00:45:11,437 --> 00:45:13,439
had the hardest time getting rid of a roadie player.

819
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,920
We tried versions where the pilot player just got shook off

820
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,161
and took damage without dying,

821
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:20,203
but that meant that he could just jump back on again.

822
00:45:20,203 --> 00:45:21,484
But then when we made it fatal,

823
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:23,125
it became frustrating for the pilot player

824
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,186
because it was hard for him to tell

825
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:26,748
that the Titan player was going to be running into a wall

826
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:29,469
at a high enough speed to throw him off.

827
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,531
All in all, it was just kind of clumsy as a mechanic.

828
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:32,551
Here, we'll see what it looks like

829
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:33,412
from the pilot's perspective

830
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:34,633
as the Titan tries to shake him off.

831
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:47,830
So you can see it's not very easy to follow along with what's happening.

832
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,371
Wired Hood.

833
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,972
This was a kit that could be equipped.

834
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:53,754
The idea was that the panel of the Titan was booby trapped, so opening it would cause the

835
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:54,995
pilot to be shocked and thrown away.

836
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,765
So the problem with this was that Rodeo pilots had no way of knowing beforehand that the Titan had equipped the wired hood,

837
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:12,289
so it led to players just assuming that every Titan had the wired hood on,

838
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:14,491
and Rodeo just happening a lot less as a result.

839
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:19,656
Astute observers among you would probably notice that the electric smoke that we shipped in the final game has

840
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:23,419
a lot of the same problems that you can't tell the Titan has it before it's used, but

841
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:29,245
since electric smoke had other uses and wasn't specifically designed only for Rodeo, we kept electric smoke in.

842
00:46:31,224 --> 00:46:36,326
So before we brought back Electric Smoke for Titanfall 2, we tried implementing an Active

843
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,927
Reload style minigame for Rodeo.

844
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:41,168
The idea was that if the Titan managed to get the timing down perfectly, it'd be able

845
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:45,630
to push the pilot off without having its battery stolen.

846
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:51,473
So in here you see the bars coming up, the Titan hits it correctly at the green part,

847
00:46:51,473 --> 00:46:54,894
and then the pilot is successfully thrown off without stealing a battery.

848
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:59,954
We also tried a version where the pilot had to do the minigame correctly to be able to

849
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:01,755
steal the battery.

850
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:04,698
Titan players definitely liked the idea of being able to push off the pilot without them

851
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:08,240
stealing the battery, but it proved really hard to communicate to the pilot what was

852
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,861
going on.

853
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:12,303
The pilot didn't know they were getting pushed off because the Titan succeeded in the minigame.

854
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:16,166
And even if we displayed the bars for both Titan and Pilot to both players, it proved

855
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:16,867
really confusing.

856
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:20,790
There's latency and there's prediction issues, which made it hard for us to show accurately

857
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,991
if the other player managed to do the minigame correctly.

858
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:27,794
And on the higher level, it kind of felt like a bit of a step back in that it literally was a minigame

859
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:31,556
that temporarily changed part of the controls for Titan and Pilot.

860
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:35,978
The response to this was not positive enough to outweigh the negatives, and so we eventually cut it.

861
00:47:37,456 --> 00:47:40,557
One last thing I wanted to show was the idea of having multiple spots for Rodeo.

862
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,237
We actually tried this idea multiple times at different points in the project, but I'll

863
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:45,918
just show you footage of the latest prototype of it.

864
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:49,459
So remember that one of the largest persistent frustrations of Rodeo is that there's only

865
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:52,920
one spot available on the back of a Titan, and sometimes you can't tell there's already

866
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,580
another pilot on it when you're trying to do your own Rodeo.

867
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,601
An obvious thing to try to fix this is to allow multiple players to be able to jump

868
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:59,621
onto a Titan.

869
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:02,022
So we tried making Titans have multiple climbing spots.

870
00:48:02,022 --> 00:48:06,043
Instead of pilots always climbing automatically to Titan's back, we let them climb to the

871
00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:07,143
spot nearest to where they jumped on.

872
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:16,186
So here's a video of how a multiple spot rodeo worked.

873
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,247
So note that the player can climb around freely

874
00:48:18,247 --> 00:48:23,589
on different parts of the Titan.

875
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,969
And that he can insert the battery

876
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,310
once he gets the correct spot in the bag.

877
00:48:27,797 --> 00:48:32,680
So the ability to climb to different spots was important because we only allowed the battery to be stolen on the back of the titan

878
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,921
and there's a few reasons why we did this.

879
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:39,524
It let us give a subtle reward to players who were doing rodeo correctly by jumping from the back

880
00:48:39,524 --> 00:48:43,366
since they wouldn't have to spend time to do the climbing animations to get to the back.

881
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:48,109
It also let us prevent rodeo from being instant death to a titan when there's four enemies jumping on at the same time.

882
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:53,853
And lastly, it really wasn't practical for us to design the titans with multiple battery ports all over the titan either.

883
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,447
One awesome moment that this gave us was for

884
00:48:57,447 --> 00:48:59,837
rodeo pilots to shoot off enemy rodeo pilots.

885
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,903
So, unfortunately, although there were definitely cool moments, the complexity cost for having

886
00:49:13,903 --> 00:49:17,225
multiple spots for rodeo was just too high to justify keeping it.

887
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:21,609
The extra cool moments you get by shooting off an enemy rodeo attempt, or multiple people

888
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:25,752
being ferried by a single titan, they just happen too infrequently for us to justify

889
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:29,735
having to make the players learn the extra complexity of having to understand which rodeo

890
00:49:29,735 --> 00:49:33,518
spot you're on, to have to remember to look for other people rodeoing the same titan,

891
00:49:33,518 --> 00:49:33,598
etc.

892
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,432
In Titanfall 1, when we were just introducing the idea of Rodeo,

893
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,014
which is a mechanic most games don't really have an equivalent for,

894
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:43,516
you can't afford for the mechanic to be too complicated.

895
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,938
For Titanfall 2, if we didn't make the changes to the battery system,

896
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:48,199
it might have been okay to add the multiple-spot Rodeo,

897
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,981
since we could depend on people having played Titanfall 1,

898
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:54,764
and we could leverage the single-player campaign to introduce extra complexity,

899
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:56,585
but you can't really do both the battery system

900
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:58,306
and the multiple-spot system together,

901
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,107
as it would confuse even players in the first game.

902
00:50:02,323 --> 00:50:03,485
So we're nearly at the end of the talk now,

903
00:50:03,485 --> 00:50:05,608
but before I leave, here's some lessons we learned

904
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:06,510
from working on Rodeo.

905
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,153
Some of this is pretty common sense,

906
00:50:08,153 --> 00:50:10,537
but I think there's still worth explicitly stating,

907
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:12,961
especially for any budding designers out there

908
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:13,742
that are just starting out.

909
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,848
First, start fast and start simple.

910
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,969
The very first prototype of Rodeo I showed you

911
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:22,330
was really simple about its baseline implementation

912
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,952
you can get for the purposes of testing out a new idea.

913
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:28,374
But from that simple idea, you can already identify

914
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:30,815
the central issues of Rodeo that would plague the mechanic

915
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:32,937
all the way up to launch and beyond.

916
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,779
Also note that we didn't over-plan the idea before starting to implement it.

917
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:40,383
Don't write a 10-page document detailing every single sub-case and problem you can think

918
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,264
of before trying to implement it.

919
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:46,248
Instead, just try out the simplest version you can that contains the essential components

920
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:47,388
of the idea.

921
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:49,851
You find out so much so quickly from actual playtesting.

922
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:53,774
You'll be able to identify the things you actually need to fix and improve on, as opposed

923
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:55,115
to just potential problems.

924
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:58,638
Also note that when you're trying to sell a new mechanic or concept to others,

925
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,781
it's much easier if they can see a rough version of the concept in-game,

926
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:05,864
as opposed to a multi-page document that nobody really wants to read.

927
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:10,167
Second point, add as little as you can to make the idea work.

928
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,870
So there's a favorite quote of mine from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,

929
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,333
the author of The Little Prince, that goes like this,

930
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,675
perfection is achieved not when there's nothing more to add,

931
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:21,216
but when there's nothing left to take away.

932
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:25,559
As you can see from the talk, we tried a lot of things with Rodeo that eventually didn't

933
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:26,119
end up shipping.

934
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,902
Rodeo wouldn't actually have been better if we ended up shipping all those failed ideas.

935
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:34,445
It would have been too confusing, too weird, and too unfocused.

936
00:51:34,445 --> 00:51:37,727
When you're working on a new mechanic, making sure that players understand what's going

937
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:42,290
on and that they have fun doing it is probably a higher priority than making it a mechanic

938
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,272
that is super deep and balanced.

939
00:51:44,272 --> 00:51:47,794
Ideally, of course, it's going to be both, but don't hesitate to make sure it's fun and

940
00:51:47,794 --> 00:51:50,396
understandable first before you're trying to make it deep and balanced.

941
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,313
Third point, advocate for both sides.

942
00:51:54,313 --> 00:51:56,937
This is kind of only really applicable for multiplayer games,

943
00:51:56,937 --> 00:51:59,039
but when you're designing mechanics,

944
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:00,541
it's important to make sure you're advocating

945
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,143
for both the player using the mechanic

946
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:03,565
and the player it's being used upon.

947
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:07,422
It would have been very easy for us to fall into the trap of making

948
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:09,343
rodeo mechanic focused only on the pilot,

949
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,385
one where the pilot could just straight up destroy the Titan.

950
00:52:12,385 --> 00:52:15,167
But instead, by making sure that both the Titan and the pilot

951
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:16,708
have their own defined role in the mechanic,

952
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,970
that both have choices and counter-choices,

953
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,112
we made rodeo mechanic that is deeper and more fun for both.

954
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:25,094
And this isn't to say that you can't have mechanics

955
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:26,915
that are easier for one side or another,

956
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:29,677
but in theory, rodeo should probably be at least a bit in favor of the pilot

957
00:52:29,677 --> 00:52:31,839
since they have to get up close to the Titan to do it.

958
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,051
It just means that you want to give the Titan at least some feeling of hope that they can

959
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:39,522
influence the outcome if they play well, instead of just being handed a death sentence.

960
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:44,002
Last point, don't be afraid to make big changes.

961
00:52:44,002 --> 00:52:45,623
As I mentioned, Rodeo was pretty popular in 10.4.1,

962
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:47,924
and when we first started making changes to 10.4.2,

963
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:51,767
the battery-style Rodeo, there was definitely some feedback

964
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,769
that they preferred the old-style Rodeo from 10.4.1.

965
00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:57,590
It's important to not flat-out ignore the feedback,

966
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,492
of course, but it's just as important

967
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:02,413
to not let all your decision-making

968
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,215
be ruled only by reactions to feedback.

969
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:09,397
Take a step back, calmly analyze what it is you're trying to do, and see if it's actually

970
00:53:09,397 --> 00:53:10,458
achieving it.

971
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,680
In Rodeo's case, it was initially driven by a need to make Rodeo work within the confines

972
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,323
of the health checklist system, but once we started playing with it, we realized just

973
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:22,985
how huge an impact being able to give batteries to your allies was.

974
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:26,947
Having a chase component to Rodeo also made so many more abilities and weapons play into

975
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,328
Rodeo in a much more interesting fashion.

976
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,872
So although I was responsible for a lot of the design

977
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:34,914
and implementation of Rodeo across both Titanfall

978
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:37,216
and Titanfall 2, it would be remiss for me to not point out

979
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:39,558
that Rodeo was clearly not the work of just one person.

980
00:53:39,558 --> 00:53:42,341
It takes an entire team of dedicated professionals

981
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:43,442
to bring game mechanics to life,

982
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:44,683
so let me just take some time out now

983
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:45,944
to thank all the folks back at Respawn

984
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:48,166
for their help on Rodeo and for this talk.

985
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,528
Special thanks in particular go to designers,

986

Thank you.

1013
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:34,538
Thank you.

1014
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:34,719
Thank you.

1015
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:34,899
Thank you.

1016
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:35,139
Thank you.

1017
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:41,742
Thank you.

1018
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:42,062
Thank you.

1019
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:42,402
Thank you.

1020
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:42,863
Thank you, thank you.

1021
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,143
Thank you.

1022
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:43,403
Thank you.

1023
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:43,743
Thank you.

1024
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:44,063
Thank you.

1025
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:44,383
Thank you.

1026
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:44,644
Thank you.

1027
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:44,904
Thank you.

1028
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:45,224
Thank you.

1029
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:45,544
Thank you.

1030
00:54:45,544 --> 00:54:45,884
Thank you.

1031
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,852
Hello, great game and great speech.

1032
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:53,192
Thank you.

1033
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:56,695
So first question was about how long

1034
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:59,637
would your iterations take for the major iterations?

1035
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:03,039
And secondly, how would you collect feedback?

1036
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,062
Did you do surveys or just around as a group and so on?

1037
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:07,293
iteration state and feedback.

1038
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:10,014
So our company tends to do weekly playtests,

1039
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:11,895
like a, sorry, let me rephrase that.

1040
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:14,036
Design department internally playtests all the time,

1041
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:15,437
like basically every day we play the game.

1042
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,718
And then every Friday we have what we call

1043
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,779
Friday night fights, which is design,

1044
00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:21,400
like basically bringing a more polished,

1045
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,000
stable version of the game onto the entire company.

1046
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,281
And we tell people, hey, these are the new things

1047
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:26,562
that we added, and these are,

1048
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:28,723
we would like feedback on these systems,

1049
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,724
tell us what you like, or didn't like about them.

1050
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:32,705
We get emails, we talk in person about them,

1051
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:35,486
and you generally get a sense of that, yeah.

1052
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:35,627
Cool.

1053
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:43,591
Alright, since you guys said that the Ogre in the initial game had maybe a weakness to Rodeo since they had less dashes,

1054
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:50,314
were there any considerations in this Titanfall 2 that Rodeo was going to affect each type of Titan differently?

1055
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:55,376
So it does actually affect each, sorry the question is does Rodeo in Titanfall 2 affect each Titan differently,

1056
00:55:55,376 --> 00:56:02,740
and it actually does because in Titanfall 2, even though we got rid of the health checklist specifically,

1057
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,781
like each person, each Titan still has like a...

1058
00:56:06,222 --> 00:56:09,063
chunk, like they divide the bars into like five sections.

1059
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:11,745
For example, for the, yeah, the ogre has five sections

1060
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:14,007
and rodeo only does one section of damage.

1061
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:18,289
So the ogre is more resilient to rodeo in that fashion.

1062
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:20,631
It takes more rodeos to actually bring him down

1063
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:21,591
to like, zero health.

1064
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:22,212
All right, thanks.

1065
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,474
Is there anything that you can share

1066
00:56:25,474 --> 00:56:27,955
about your dev process on iterations

1067
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:31,397
that helped increase the speed

1068
00:56:31,397 --> 00:56:33,058
at which you could go through those iterations?

1069
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:35,573
I'm sorry, the question is about the iterations?

1070
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:36,734
Yeah, so was there anything that you

1071
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,716
could share about your dev process that

1072
00:56:38,716 --> 00:56:41,578
helped you get through those iterations faster

1073
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:44,481
and understand quickly whether this idea was going to work

1074
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:44,581
or not?

1075
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:47,718
Tips for generally increasing iteration speed.

1076
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:51,100
I guess making sure you know exactly what you're testing for.

1077
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,442
And it's very common to just be like,

1078
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:54,843
hey, I put this new thing in,

1079
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:56,324
tell me what you guys think, guys.

1080
00:56:56,324 --> 00:56:58,645
But it's better to have more targeted feedback,

1081
00:56:58,645 --> 00:56:59,886
especially from players you trust.

1082
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:02,468
Like for designers in particular, we ask,

1083
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:04,449
so what do you think about this mechanic?

1084
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:06,030
Does it increase the teamwork element of this?

1085
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:09,933
What do you think it has on this other mechanic that we have in the game?

1086
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:11,574
Like what do you think of the spillover effects?

1087
00:57:11,574 --> 00:57:14,736
And you ask people, people that you trust, that aren't just, you know,

1088
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:17,217
like randomly going to say what they feel without really thinking about it.

1089
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:18,958
But also people, you know, who aren't going to be

1090
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,240
afraid to tell you things you don't want to hear.

1091
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,203
If they tell you it sucks, you should listen to them and try to fix that.

1092
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:27,204
Yeah. Cool. Thanks.

1093
00:57:27,204 --> 00:57:27,284
Hi.

1094
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,328
I was just wondering, looking at all those different iterations of Rodeo,

1095
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:41,319
I was just wondering, is there a favorite version that you had to cut that you have?

1096
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,984
A favorite version of Rodeo I had to cut?

1097
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:47,081
At the end of Titanfall 1, I was actually pretty happy

1098
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:50,103
with what we shipped for Rodeo in Titanfall 1.

1099
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:52,604
Like I said, I think it was a nice balance

1100
00:57:52,604 --> 00:57:58,208
between being cinematic, easy, fun, and accessible.

1101
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,629
I am kind of sad we didn't keep the wall smashing thing,

1102
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:02,731
but it was kind of clumsy.

1103
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:03,952
Like, if you saw the video,

1104
00:58:03,952 --> 00:58:04,952
it's hard to tell what's going on

1105
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:07,154
when you're being shook around.

1106
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:08,355
So maybe if we had somehow managed

1107
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:09,795
to find a more graceful solution to that,

1108
00:58:09,795 --> 00:58:11,196
that would have been good, but yeah.

1109
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:11,457
Thank you.

1110
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,181
And I guess that's it.

1111
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:16,762
So two things.

1112
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:18,824
Please remember to fill out your feedback forms, one.

1113
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:21,927
And second, my very talented coworker, Carlos,

1114
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:23,808
who's in the audience, he's gonna be giving a follow-up

1115
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:26,231
talk about tank combat in this room right next.

1116
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:28,112
So stick around for that if you're interested.

1117
00:58:28,112 --> 00:58:28,433
Thank you.
