00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:09,653
Hi everyone, and welcome to our virtual version of this talk,

2
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:13,334
Until You Fall, Building a Satisfying VR Combat on a Budget.

3
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:16,795
I'm Dave Bennett, the guy with the glasses on the left.

4
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:21,076
And I'm Patrick Shelbier, the guy hiding behind swords on the right.

5
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:25,157
And we are both game designers for a studio called Shell Games,

6
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:29,079
and if you haven't heard of us, we're a studio that works on a wide variety of

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,639
different weird things, both original IP and

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,160
client work.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,704
But our most well-known VR title is probably I Expect You to Die.

10
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:41,327
It's a kind of escape the room spy fi puzzler

11
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:44,930
where you need to escape death defying situations that only a,

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,412
you know, spy with telekinesis would find themselves in.

13
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,216
But again, we work on a lot of other weird stuff, ranging from location

14
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:56,899
based entertainment to physical toys that teach chemistry to iPad apps

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,603
that teach your toddler how to stop and go potty with the assistance of Daniel Tiger.

16
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:08,912
But the most recent game that we solved weird problems on together is a game called Until

17
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:15,337
You Fall, which is a melee combat action game with roguelite elements where you are a badass

18
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:21,842
glowing knight fighting your way through a neon hellscape that kind of feels like it

19
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,324
was taken from every 1980s album cover.

20
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:31,810
And the core combat in the game is striving to be what we call like a rhythm light combat

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,431
or gameplay.

22
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,713
that focuses on choreographed attacks and blocks,

23
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,815
and tries to maintain a much faster pace of combat

24
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:44,377
than we were seeing in other melee games at the time.

25
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:46,959
And to give you an idea of what we mean by that,

26
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,540
we've got a clip from one of our top players.

27
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,909
And a shout out to Krosis for giving us that.

28
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,551
So yeah, kind of with the high level of Until You Fall

29
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,251
kind of established, I also wanted to take a moment

30
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,332
and kind of give some context for why Patrick and I

31
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:39,253
wanted to give this talk.

32
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:41,734
So when we first started working on Until You Fall,

33
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:44,314
one of the early goals was to make something

34
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:47,756
that was not only high action and very high intensity,

35
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,956
it was also replayable.

36
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:52,843
It was kind of a stark departure from I expect you to die.

37
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:56,027
But with so many other VR titles kind of under our belt,

38
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:59,130
we wanted to, you know, try stuff we hadn't done before.

39
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:03,416
And even though Patrick and I are both game designers at the studio,

40
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,718
we both had different roles on this project.

41
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:07,801
So I, for example, am the project director.

42
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:11,387
who's responsible for kind of the high level vision of the game,

43
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:15,531
as well as the theme and overall cohesiveness of the game itself.

44
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,335
So you can thank me for the weird synth wave and neon nights.

45
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:25,401
But Patrick is the design director, and he's in charge of the combat systems,

46
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:28,584
the kind of player experience and the overall implementation

47
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,867
of how we actually do combat in this game.

48
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:32,668
So.

49
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:35,982
Even though this wasn't Shell Games first VR title,

50
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,863
we faced a lot of kind of difficult challenges.

51
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:41,904
I mean, like we've worked on, I don't know, this is like number eight or ten

52
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:42,484
or something like that.

53
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,284
There's a lot of VR that we've done at the studio.

54
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,565
And for Until You Fall, there are a lot of useful lessons

55
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,046
that we had learned that we wish we had known earlier on and.

56
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:56,345
kind of after talking with Patrick and trying to reflect on our experience

57
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,006
making the game,

58
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:02,307
we wanted to take these lessons learned and try to give them as takeaways

59
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:06,369
to give to you guys so that hopefully you guys don't end up

60
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,609
making the same mistakes.

61
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,531
So Dave and I talked about it a lot and cut a lot of slides

62
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:17,412
and tried to boil down all of our takeaways from Until You Fall

63
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:21,554
into kind of five major points that will be the subject of the talk

64
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:22,614
that we're going through here today.

65
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:28,995
One, it's okay to reference non-VR games for your VR game.

66
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:34,297
Two, be wary of adding secondary VR interactions.

67
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:39,300
Three, know your player fantasy, especially for VR.

68
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,362
Four, set the rules of your virtual reality.

69
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:48,924
And five, find ways to incentivize your player fantasy

70
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:50,205
in your gameplay.

71
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,870
So kind of getting started with the first takeaway,

72
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,550
it's okay to reference non VR games.

73
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,211
And this might be something that's just more specific to us and our studio.

74
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:04,012
But there's a lot of things that with our experience in VR,

75
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:06,933
it kind of really made it hard to trust our instincts.

76
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:12,075
So kind of taking a step back when we first started working in VR,

77
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:17,296
there's a lot of stuff that we had had to throw out a lot of experience

78
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,357
or instincts, that kind of thing. And.

79
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,855
In VR, things that seem oh so obvious and so straightforward actually aren't,

80
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:28,617
and more often than not can make players just super sick.

81
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:33,040
And that can lead to you feeling like all of our experience up to this point,

82
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:37,384
making other types of experiences, location-based, tablet, PC, whatever.

83
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,307
It feels like it leads you in the wrong direction and can lead you to becoming

84
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:47,251
super shy about trusting those instincts that you'd honed over years of making

85
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:47,631
games.

86
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:48,932
And.

87
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,241
kind of worst of all, this actually leads to this feeling of, uh,

88
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,021
things you can and can't do in VR,

89
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:59,582
these generalizations that kind of become ingrained in us.

90
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:03,703
And it becomes this vicious cycle where you can't do that because it didn't work

91
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,383
that one time. So we shouldn't do it again.

92
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:08,084
Therefore it becomes the truth that you can never do that.

93
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:14,605
And even for problems that in other mediums have solutions that are pretty

94
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:15,225
straightforward.

95
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:20,611
it feels like you have to invent entirely new, sometimes very expensive, solutions for these problems.

96
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:30,900
So something that became a really important learning point for the team in pre-production was that our instincts aren't always wrong,

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,365
and sometimes the non-VR solution to a common game problem can still work,

98
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:42,470
especially when it came to game feel in Until You Fall, because our game was a...

99
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,502
hack and slash games. So our hit impacts were some of the most important things. And a big

100
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:55,626
challenge early on for us was figuring out how to get that same good meaty game feel that you

101
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:03,271
could have in a non-VR hack and slash or a non-VR combat game to translate faithfully into VR.

102
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:09,335
And non-VR games would try to accomplish these things with screen flash, camera shake,

103
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,577
hit pause, sometimes an animation hit pause, things that

104
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:18,042
some of our developers were nervous about trying to translate into VR.

105
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:22,967
But we did end up studying a lot of these non-VR games,

106
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,415
and even when we couldn't directly take the solutions from those games, we were

107
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,680
able to really use those as our starting points and as our tone targets.

108
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:40,847
And sometimes the solutions actually did just work, which was a happy accident.

109
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:46,650
We found out that screen flash and camera shake worked way better in VR and were way more

110
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,852
successful in terms of getting a satisfying hit than we thought it would. And we only needed like

111
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:58,916
minor tweaks to get them VR ready. But in every case, we were always ready or capable of using

112
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:03,118
those non-VR solutions as starting points.

113
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,630
and then iterating towards those VR-specific solutions

114
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,430
if we needed to.

115
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,673
And for Until You Fall, this directly

116
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:14,355
led to how we solved the game's movement system, how

117
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,877
we solved all of our impact in our VFX system,

118
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,779
and actually led a lot towards our final solution

119
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,142
for weapon weights in the game, since we made that

120
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,124
as a direct response trying to come up with something

121
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,447
to mimic the animation lag on a heavy hit.

122
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,156
in in a game like Devil May Cry or God of War.

123
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:40,738
So even though the non VR solution for some of these problems do work

124
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:44,019
or at least serve as a good starting point, we are still making a VR game.

125
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:48,841
And one of the pitfalls of working in VR is that it feels so real

126
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,142
and you want to make it feel as realistic as possible.

127
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:55,383
And I guess our second takeaway for you is to be aware

128
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:59,305
of those secondary VR interactions, also known as don't drop the sword.

129
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:00,545
But we'll get to that in a little bit.

130
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,793
So when I'm talking about secondary interactions, I'm really talking about

131
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,657
those high fidelity moments of VR that are super exciting and super seductive.

132
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,400
It's those those things where it's just you touch everything in the world.

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,401
You pick everything up.

134
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,724
You can interact with anything and everything, because as a virtual world,

135
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,327
it should reflect reality and be realistic.

136
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:24,169
So I should be able to pick this object up and hit it against this other thing.

137
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,673
And it will work the way I expect it to because of my experience in reality.

138
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:33,375
And a lot of early VR actually based their gameplay, including I Expect You to Die,

139
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,856
on having this wide variety of novel interactions,

140
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,318
having the sandbox of different things you can interact with.

141
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,940
But if your game is trying to have a more narrow or specific fantasy,

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,561
having a lot of these interactions can actually become a trap,

143
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,762
which if you haven't figured out already, is one we fell into

144
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:51,583
during Until You Fall as development.

145
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,886
So to kind of illustrate this, I wanted to kind of walk through

146
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:59,727
some of the earlier features that or, you know, the lost features of until you fall

147
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:04,329
that, you know, we ended up having to walk away from. So.

148
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,610
Way back in the before time, the pitch for until you fall

149
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,571
actually started with a solid combat prototype.

150
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,972
So it was just a simple thing where you were fighting one enemy

151
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:19,014
and it highlighted the fun nature of our choreographed combat system.

152
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:20,215
And.

153
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:24,310
You know, obviously, to take that from a prototype to a full game,

154
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,972
we wanted to make it a fully immersive, fully featured VR dungeon

155
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:28,892
crawling experience.

156
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:30,053
So.

157
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,712
With that target in mind, we wanted to we started prototyping

158
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,393
all sorts of features that seemed absolutely necessary

159
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:38,694
to not only hit, you know, stay in the space,

160
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,316
but also keep it entirely immersive in VR.

161
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:44,337
So we added a bunch of stuff like, you know, looting

162
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,638
because there's treasure in dungeons consumables

163
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,980
because you need potions and things to acquire and heal yourself,

164
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,201
which means I guess you have health and maybe money.

165
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:52,621
I don't know.

166
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:56,103
There's weapon holsters because you have a sword, so you got to put it somewhere.

167
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,959
The sword has physics, so I should be able to throw it.

168
00:10:58,979 --> 00:10:59,599
That makes sense.

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,202
Also, the weapons should be, you know, stuck in trees

170
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,603
because, you know, they're sharp and sticking them in trees

171
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:07,965
or, you know, even better, enemies is awesome.

172
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:10,346
And hey, there's a big rock over there,

173
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,267
so I should be able to climb it

174
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,608
because I can climb in real life

175
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,649
and more stuff along those lines.

176
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:19,725
And for every feature that we added, it ended up inspiring us to either add more features,

177
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,406
more depth to the existing features, or more polish to make sure

178
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:27,748
it met player expectations in addition to our own quality bar.

179
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:33,770
So we kept adding these features and we were sort of following this normal path of iteration, which,

180
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:40,252
you know, coming from a studio that made a game like I Expect You to Die was not super surprising.

181
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,692
But we started to get

182
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:47,121
some issues with our playtest, especially as we got more into combat playtesting. We noticed that

183
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:52,465
players were very frequently during combat dropping their swords, and after they've dropped

184
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:58,629
their sword during combat, they'd look at the ground looking for their sword, fumble around

185
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,873
trying to pick it up, and get beat around the head and shoulders by even the most basic enemies in

186
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:07,655
the game. And it turns out this is actually the symptom of a bigger problem.

187
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:15,879
Because by adding all of these secondary interactions in pursuit of that VR immersiveness and that

188
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,624
feeling of being a fully featured game, we'd added a bunch of new ways for players to be

189
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:22,645
bad at our game.

190
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,289
Climbing introduced falling, particularly during combat.

191
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,213
The whole concept of weapon holsters introduced the weapon dropping issue.

192
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,756
Grabbing became grabbing the wrong thing during combat.

193
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:42,461
throwing was really just dropping with style, and weapon pinning was tough because it was really

194
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:48,785
awesome against the last enemy in a room, but mostly super frustrating when you were trying

195
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:55,890
to fight and your weapon was getting stuck off screen. And each one of these problems individually

196
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,313
was solvable, like we could iterate into solutions to shave the rough edges off of these,

197
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:05,056
but the iteration cost for all of those little rough edges

198
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,595
would push us out of scope.

199
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,896
So ultimately, these were all features

200
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:12,717
that we felt we couldn't actually afford

201
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:13,597
and be faithful to.

202
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,559
So if the worst offender is dropping the sword,

203
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:20,520
obviously the solution is to not drop the sword, right?

204
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,921
I mean, we actually did take a hard look

205
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,182
at what was really important to our core gameplay.

206
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,583
And going back to our simple prototype,

207
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:30,784
it's spoiler warning, it was about hitting dudes.

208
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,965
And we asked ourselves in what ways

209
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,885
is it okay to be bad at this video game?

210
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:40,005
And as we went down the list of all these things that we thought were oh,

211
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:42,946
so important to make a fully featured dungeon crawling game,

212
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,367
a lot of the VR interaction polish that we had added was just straight up removed

213
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,268
or re-imagined entirely. And wherever possible,

214
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:52,568
these points of friction,

215
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:56,469
these kind of stumbling blocks that vexed players so often,

216
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,029
we tried to turn those moments and make them opportunities for the player to

217
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,550
feel awesome instead. And going back to dropping swords,

218
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,870
I think weapon summoning

219
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,862
Our solve for that became kind of our best example.

220
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,423
So in our game, instead of dropping swords and having physical weapons,

221
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,303
you have magic hands with magic swords.

222
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:17,324
And at a moment's notice, you can summon that sword out of thin air.

223
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,065
So if you don't want your sword, you can just get rid of it

224
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,045
and be able to interact with a limited number of items.

225
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:26,886
Or, you know, if you do it by accident at a moment's note,

226
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,507
you can just re-summon that weapon and it's OK.

227
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:34,468
So these small moments where it's oops, I goofed up now actually look and feel awesome.

228
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,455
And off of that, don't drop the sword actually did become a mantra on the team as we went

229
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:42,996
into our next round of iteration.

230
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:49,301
And a process that we ran through that we'd recommend absolutely doing with your own games

231
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:56,407
and your own features in VR is for every feature, asking yourself, does this feature do anything

232
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,929
other than increase VR immersion?

233
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:04,373
And if not, does it introduce more depth?

234
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:11,823
or confusion? Does it add new ways to fail? And is it supporting a core interaction in

235
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:19,369
an important way that justifies it doing that? And even if it does, could another solution

236
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,094
do that same thing in a way that doesn't add those points of failure? And lastly,

237
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:31,457
is this a feature that it is supporting or undermining what your core player fantasy is?

238
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,560
Or does it have anything to do with it at all?

239
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,859
And that takes us to our third takeaway, which is knowing your player fantasy

240
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,943
and really kind of understanding it and instilling that knowledge to your player.

241
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,806
And this is something that, you know, as designers, we generally,

242
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,589
you know, try to establish a player fantasy early on.

243
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:55,693
But for until you fall in for VR, especially, it seems extra important.

244
00:15:55,974 --> 00:16:00,398
So once we had kind of changed the rule to, you know,

245
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,699
you can't drop the sword in this game.

246
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,346
It really kind of helped us establish what your fantasy is in this world.

247
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,388
You are not some bumbling idiot.

248
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:12,331
You are a badass magical knight from the moment you put on the headset.

249
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:14,653
It's not a story of zero to hero.

250
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:20,619
This is a competent swordsman, at the very least, becoming a literal sword god.

251
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,203
And as a roguelite, it's also a game about dying and learning

252
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,345
from your mistakes while still feeling OK about it.

253
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:32,630
In this game, death is expected, so it needs to feel worthwhile and understood.

254
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,491
And you didn't die because you are a chump.

255
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:38,352
You died because the odds are unbelievable,

256
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:42,653
and you fought valiantly until the bitter end, and you'll be rewarded justly.

257
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:49,416
So that put us in a place where we want to make the player feel empowered

258
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,198
in a game that is still a roguelike, knowing that you will die.

259
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:55,458
So to reiterate...

260
00:16:56,317 --> 00:17:02,101
And until you fall, you're supposed to start off feeling like you are a competent swordsman

261
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:07,864
in this universe, and then progress towards being this transcendent figure.

262
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:15,488
And preserving that heroic identity became the guiding light for a lot of our secondary

263
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:16,649
features that we did keep in.

264
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:21,892
For example, our rewards, like every upgrade or item that you select in the game, is actually

265
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:25,514
a crystal that you grab and crush in your mailed fist.

266
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,392
and that sort of underscores that moment of winning.

267
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,494
Our narrator, after this pivot, was redesigned.

268
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:34,675
And she was turned into a character

269
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,837
that was much more earnest and there to pump you up

270
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:41,358
and tell the player that, yes, they are worthy

271
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,560
of this challenge and they can overcome it.

272
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,242
And what they are trying to do is difficult

273
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:48,942
and worth cheering on.

274
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,085
And lastly, something that actually helped a lot with this,

275
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:57,279
was introducing a new, weaker enemy.

276
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,160
Because we found that our husks,

277
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
which were our basic enemy at the time,

278
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,121
were accomplishing a lot of technical goals for us.

279
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:09,122
They teach you basic combat, they showcase our mechanics,

280
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,703
they explain to players the best way to play,

281
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:15,324
but players would still die to them in the tutorial

282
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:17,784
and end up feeling weaker because of it.

283
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,525
So the purpose of the lesser husks that we added later on,

284
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:28,391
is specifically to remind you that you are not the bottom of the power rung in this universe.

285
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:33,713
You are strong, and these are the weakest things in the world that you can dispatch

286
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:34,974
easily and quickly.

287
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:43,157
And a lot of these features became ways to invite players to really embrace that power

288
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:46,238
fantasy, even if it was their first time using VR.

289
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:52,164
And we found that was pretty crucial to get people into the experience so that they didn't

290
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:56,326
immediately feel like it was something that they were bad at or should feel embarrassed

291
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,227
of while they were learning.

292
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:02,929
And even if you're new to VR or a veteran, it's really important, at least we found,

293
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,931
that having this strong player fantasy and teaching this to your player and having them

294
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:12,113
internalize it, it helped really reinforce the kind of most important part of the game,

295
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:13,494
which was the combat.

296
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:23,231
What we mean by that is that as soon as the player kind of started believing that they were, yes, a hero, yes, they were a badass magical knight, they started acting like it.

297
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,153
And it manifests in subtle ways, but they're important.

298
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:32,858
So for one, you know, if you're being told that you're heroic and you look cool and you feel cool, do you start standing up a little more straight?

299
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:35,780
You, uh, strike heroic poses, whether you mean to or not.

300
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,344
And then when it really comes down to the combat, you start taking bigger, more exaggerated swings, which.

301
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,442
not only plays better and works better with the hardware that you're playing on,

302
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:49,764
but it also looks better, feels better and is just awesome.

303
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:53,925
It's like for people both in and out of the headset, it's makes this, you know,

304
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:58,207
kind of goofy thing into something actually heroic and enjoyable.

305
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:02,669
And also as a bonus, it's really helpful for scope control.

306
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,409
So for until you fall,

307
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:07,190
if the feature did not help make you feel powerful or worse made it,

308
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:10,112
made it undermine that feeling. We just straight up cut it.

309
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:15,430
Or in cases where we really couldn't cut it or we really kind of thought that, no, this

310
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,151
could be cool if we just did one more thing.

311
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:21,011
We actually just kind of tried to change the rules for how it worked.

312
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:28,553
This idea of changing rules or setting up rules for what our specific virtual reality

313
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:35,175
was became another big mantra or something that we tried to carry forward into production.

314
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,095
Because really what we were asking is...

315
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,342
what is our game's baseline fidelity of interaction?

316
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,845
And to really dig into that, we found

317
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:50,667
that this is something that is actually a pretty hot debate

318
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:54,710
right now in VR development and in the VR gaming community,

319
00:20:55,211 --> 00:21:00,955
because the nature of VR creates this bottomless pit

320
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:03,176
of expectation for...

321
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:06,976
minute fidelity and functionality.

322
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:11,779
Like we suddenly now have this universe where we have hands and the hands can

323
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,982
touch everything and we can pick things up and we can manipulate them.

324
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:23,128
And we as developers need to pick the point where no, you, you can no longer do

325
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:29,652
that in VR because it's almost impossible to meet every request for fidelity of

326
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:30,153
interaction.

327
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,094
And for Until You Fall, during development,

328
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,156
we did start to get a lot of that.

329
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:39,058
And we got a lot of playtesting requests for features

330
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:41,000
that we deliberately walked away from,

331
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,922
either because we didn't have the scope for it

332
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:46,465
or because we knew that it just added a lot of noise

333
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:47,806
or ways to fail to the game.

334
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:51,829
So it became this big sticky question

335
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,132
of how can we preserve that sense of immersion

336
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,214
and that selling point of VR

337
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:58,975
without blowing our game scope.

338
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:06,137
And one of the ways we kind of inadvertently early on done that was by rewriting the rules of reality.

339
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:13,141
So you can't throw up the sword was actually our first stake in the ground at trying to solve this problem and

340
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:19,105
As an unintended side effect players were no longer asking for holsters because they knew where sorts lived in this world

341
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:24,388
They were in your hands. They're magic swords with magic hands, obviously, so you don't need a place to put them and

342
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,091
Based off of that kind of initial change,

343
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:32,073
we started establishing other laws of our world

344
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:34,634
to head off some more problematic requests that we had noticed.

345
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,096
So, for example, looting and fighting in our game is always separate,

346
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:42,599
and that helps solve the problem of picking up the wrong thing at the wrong time.

347
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,861
There's no way the enemy will sneak up on you while you're looting,

348
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,442
and there's no way to accidentally grab a piece of loot

349
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,583
while you are trying to fight for your life.

350
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:56,013
We also kind of shrank the size of our combat arenas to make them small

351
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:58,494
and focused and make sure that the exit is always clear.

352
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:02,695
And in our world, because you got magic swords,

353
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:06,536
these weapons have super abilities and what they really are.

354
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:11,718
These kind of catch all grab bag powers that actually let you do things

355
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:15,179
that otherwise would have been too risky or too scopey

356
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,260
to actually implement into our game.

357
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:21,374
So with all this combined, it really changed the way

358
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:24,976
the players started at requesting features and requesting things in our game.

359
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:28,837
So in our world, rather than asking for a way to throw weapons

360
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,718
because you can't drop swords in this game,

361
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,400
it became a request for super that let you throw the weapon.

362
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,442
And it was kind of great because it helped recontextualize a lot of things

363
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:43,505
and make requests a lot more sane, even if we couldn't entertain every single one.

364
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,326
And that was because.

365
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:52,263
We had established this virtual reality where the nomenclature for weird things that you

366
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:53,905
wanted to do was your supers.

367
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:59,069
When we took a big step back from that and tried to figure out, okay, what's the system,

368
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,471
what's the process underlying this iteration that we're doing?

369
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:10,337
When Dave and I talked about it, it was really that we were deciding on the fidelity of our

370
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:10,657
world.

371
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,240
We were deciding the smallest interaction.

372
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:17,105
or that was vital for the game.

373
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,428
And our recommendation moving forwards

374
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:24,591
is to take a look at what that baseline fidelity is

375
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:28,094
for your game and consider cutting interactions

376
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:31,777
that fall below that line in terms of gameplay importance.

377
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:35,200
Because things that fall radically below that line

378
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,621
may not be missed.

379
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:38,603
And in cases where you can't do that,

380
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,545
we found other ways to remove wants.

381
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:46,578
from playtesting requests that we really couldn't support from playtesting.

382
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:53,379
For example, in Until You Fall, we had a lot of playtesting requests initially of players

383
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,940
wanting to pick up enemy weapons and use them.

384
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,702
But as soon as we made weapons dissolve immediately after killing an enemy without letting them

385
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:06,243
touch the ground, those playtesting requests disappeared.

386
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:07,463
And it wasn't...

387
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:12,401
that we deprived players of the privilege of looting these weapons, it was because in

388
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:14,584
this universe, clearly, weapons dissolve.

389
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:23,456
But and I'll throw this out, this is still something, like we said before, that is kind

390
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:26,400
of a contentious topic in VR development.

391
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:33,373
Until You Fall gets critiqued a lot for being a VR game with a narrow feature set.

392
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:38,675
Some people really love what the game could accomplish because of that feature set, but

393
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:40,796
it's definitely an ongoing conversation.

394
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:46,639
So we're not saying that going narrow and being very laser-focused on your features

395
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:49,120
is the right way to go about VR development.

396
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,421
It's just what ended up working for our game and for our team.

397
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:54,502
So...

398
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:59,434
With our limited interaction set and our more focused core

399
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:01,856
gameplay, it becomes really important for us

400
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,278
to then incentivize the interactions that we do have.

401
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,480
And one of the ways that we really found helped us out

402
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,282
was actually incentivizing our player fantasy.

403
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,544
And put it another way, we really

404
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,926
looked for ways to find how to make

405
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,688
the fun way to play our game the mechanically the best

406
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:18,528
way to play our game.

407
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,291
And that's really exploiting this idea

408
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:25,133
that something's not dumb if it works.

409
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:30,544
And that was pretty important to us because we saw early on in our playtesting that for

410
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:35,928
especially adults and teenagers and especially players that are new to VR, they can feel

411
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,509
self-conscious while they're playing.

412
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,672
And that affects how much fun they have and the type of poses that they strike while they're

413
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,013
playing.

414
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:50,678
And beyond that, fatigue and focus will naturally push players towards doing whatever the smallest

415
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:55,601
effective action is for the game, aka wee-waggling.

416
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:02,009
And in Until You Fall, because we wanted to underscore our power fantasy,

417
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:08,234
we ended up building a lot of detection to isolate and shut down these waggling strategies

418
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:12,097
because we wanted to change our smallest effective action.

419
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:17,822
This actually had a really obvious and dramatic impact on our playtest,

420
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:23,968
and actually became something that playtesters called out as their favorite part.

421
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,813
of the playtest in hindsight. They loved that they couldn't cheese the mechanics or they loved

422
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:33,497
that the game's tutorial wasn't lying to them about the best way to play the game.

423
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:39,062
And we found that for players that really internalized that and believed what the game

424
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:45,047
was telling them about making big swings, they were more likely to strike those powerful poses

425
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:51,452
and get into that play acting. And that was because to them, it was no longer a silly act

426
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:53,574
or play acting with the game.

427
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,782
it was the effective, smart, and optimal strategy for playing.

428
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:03,284
And we found that that actually carried over,

429
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:07,326
not just from our more organic, like our mechanical swinging

430
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,627
features, but into the game stats as well.

431
00:28:11,747 --> 00:28:14,468
Once we had this trust with the players

432
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,429
that the game's mechanics mattered.

433
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:24,158
we found that we could use our weapon stats to enforce and create a number of these optimal

434
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:26,579
play styles that players can aspire towards.

435
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,342
So when we were doing our weapon design, we actually created four major archetypes, and

436
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:36,423
we assigned one to two of these archetypes to each one of our weapons.

437
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:41,385
The bruiser was all about big hits and big swings and dramatic motions.

438
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:47,987
The Spellsword is all about supers and nukes and big damage, sometimes from a distance.

439
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:56,710
Tactician was for players that really liked manipulating the space, so dashing around or locking enemies in place or pushing enemies around.

440
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:08,253
And Rogue was sort of our high-mobility, probably VR-familiar player who wanted the high-risk, high-reward or high-twitch skill strategies.

441
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:12,185
And once we had these play styles and play targets,

442
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:17,408
we then made it a point with the game's traits and weapons

443
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,811
to ensure that these archetypes had multiple effective builds.

444
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,813
And we used built-in traits on the weapons

445
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:29,956
to make sure that the way the weapon was being used

446
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,077
during our play tests actually aligned

447
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,478
with that fantasy of the weapon.

448
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,361
And at the end, we found out that this really benefited

449
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,962
all skill levels of play.

450
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,192
this kind of balancing and this kind of mechanical enforcement of your fantasy

451
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:48,254
is not something that only the hardcore players are going to appreciate,

452
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:52,516
but that a lot of our first-time VR users really appreciated.

453
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,478
Because this isn't about balancing the game for the hardcore,

454
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,960
it's about giving players permission to play-act with your game,

455
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,242
because that play-acting is the optimal way to play.

456
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,871
So we're just about at the end now.

457
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:12,195
Before we sign off, I wanted to just kind of go over the takeaways

458
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,497
one last time, so we remembered what we were just talking about.

459
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:20,802
So five big takeaways of this talk were it's OK to reference non VR games.

460
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,904
Be wary of secondary VR interactions.

461
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,786
Know your player fantasy.

462
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:28,608
Set the rules of your virtual reality.

463
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:32,931
And lastly, incentivize the player fantasy that you've established.

464
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:35,016
I'm just kidding. There's a sixth one.

465
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:40,658
So if you can be sure to try to consult with others in the space or genre,

466
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,880
even if it outside of VR, Jason Vandenberg kind of came in early.

467
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,401
He's, you know, well known for his expertise in melee combat games,

468
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,223
and he was able to give us some really helpful advice early on.

469
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,444
And we would definitely recommend for you to do the same.

470
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:59,866
In any case, just find someone that you can rely on to give you good advice.

471
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:02,007
So big shout out to Jason Vandenberg.

472
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:09,731
And that's it. So we can't give any, we can't take any questions here in a digital format,

473
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:14,777
but if you'd like to talk with us more about any of this stuff, we've got our emails and

474
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,961
our Twitter handles on screen, and please don't hesitate to reach out.

475
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,204
Thank you so much for listening, everyone.
