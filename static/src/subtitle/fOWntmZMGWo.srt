1
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:07,816
Thank you all for coming. I'm going to go ahead and jump right in.

2
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:12,758
This is a presentation about esports journalism.

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,440
The challenges we face as writers in that space

4
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,821
and the opportunities we're provided.

5
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:24,144
Hence, challenges and opportunities of esports journalism.

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:27,885
The second story part, I'll get to in a bit.

7
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:33,650
But I'd like to open with a quote from Paul Gallico, a legendary writer from the golden

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,810
age of sports journalism.

9
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:42,654
Daily, I was in contact with those necessary elements of drama.

10
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:49,558
Good against evil, suspense, frustration, climax, and success.

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,461
Every contest had its villain as well as its hero.

12
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:05,390
Nowadays, writing from the golden age of sports journalism can feel a little purple and maudlin

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,070
and theatrical.

14
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:15,795
But I think it's important to remember that Gallico and his ilk created the world of sports

15
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,636
journalism from almost nothing.

16
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:25,140
So over here in the fledgling years of esports journalism, we might want to see what we can

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,340
learn.

18
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:32,990
I'm going to go ahead and assume that the people in this room know that eSports is on

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,511
an uphill trajectory.

20
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:45,320
According to Newzoo, who you just heard from, one in four millennials now watches eSports.

21
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:50,124
22% of men and 15% of women watch eSports at least once a month.

22
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,388
That's between the ages of 21 and 35, specifically.

23
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:04,009
Among male millennials, eSports is now more popular than ice hockey and right underneath

24
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,810
baseball in terms of viewership.

25
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:14,493
More people watch the League of Legends World Championship in 2016 than the NBA Finals.

26
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:19,494
The point is, eSports is big.

27
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:21,375
And it's getting bigger.

28
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:28,327
It's not like writers up until now have sat on their hands exactly, waiting for the right

29
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:33,431
time to start covering eSports, but we do seem to be reaching a breaking point recently

30
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:37,855
where the platforms on which eSports are covered are ballooning seriously in size.

31
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:48,484
Early in 2016, ESPN, the Roman empire of traditional sports journalism, launched a dedicated eSports

32
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:48,804
section.

33
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:54,739
They did have some run up, like Mina Kheim's profile on Faker.

34
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:01,760
But still, for one of the largest sports journalism publications in the world, and one whose president

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,481
has gone on record as saying that eSports aren't real sports, to make this leap had

36
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,522
big implications.

37
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:15,403
Simultaneously, you could see traditional gaming sites start to pick up eSports as well.

38
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,523
PC Gamer has a ProTab now.

39
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,432
Rock Paper Shotgun has had an eSports section for a while.

40
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:28,093
Kotaku and Deadspin working together just released their compete vertical.

41
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:36,035
And even newer sites like Rolling Stone's Glixel have been covering major players like

42
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,436
Loda and Hungrybox right out of the gate.

43
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:44,618
We've also seen the arrival of a new kind of site enter the publishing landscape, the

44
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:46,378
developer-backed eSports site.

45
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:53,205
Which offers both official announcements while also profiling players and covering events.

46
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,166
All under the watchful eye of a PR department.

47
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:05,768
All these sites, an unprecedented spread, I think, when you have sport jockeys sharing

48
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:12,690
a web page with game writers, are grabbing over some piece of the eSports media landscape.

49
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,710
Which I would venture to say is still unclaimed.

50
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:24,965
Undoubtedly, they saw the opportunity to enter into a $490 million industry, or I think more

51
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:25,926
since I last checked.

52
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,627
But maybe this is being generous.

53
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,489
I think they probably saw something more.

54
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:42,212
A chance to shine a light on and find new language for a whole new realm in which narratives

55
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:44,353
of passion and excellence play out.

56
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:53,779
I can't speak to the challenges they faced in that pursuit, but I can offer some observations

57
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,080
on the obstacles I faced in my experience.

58
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:03,584
What that experience is, I'll fill you in on, but don't worry, it will be brief by necessity.

59
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:06,705
My name is Roy Graham.

60
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,067
I've been writing about video games since 2014, and that is not my dog.

61
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:20,811
In 2016, I was brought on as the editor of the meta, Kill Screen's dedicated site which

62
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,332
we launched in partnership with Twitch.

63
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,495
And that's it.

64
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,897
I did warn you it would be brief.

65
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,560
Which actually brings me nicely to my first point.

66
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:40,925
Those of you who are game writers are probably familiar with some portion of the internet

67
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:43,227
crowd not really getting the games thing.

68
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:49,876
But in the world of eSports, the divide between your informed audience and your casual audience

69
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:54,157
is probably broader than you've ever experienced before.

70
00:05:55,718 --> 00:06:01,479
It's that divide that lets me, a guy with less than three years of post-college experience,

71
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,921
be on this stage right now, having opinions about an industry.

72
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,263
So what do the people on either side of this divide look like?

73
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,819
Well, let's start with eSports fans.

74
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:24,922
eSports fans are by and large vocal, devoted, and intensely knowledgeable about their past

75
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:25,162
time.

76
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:30,404
They're usually experts in one or two games which they play in addition to watching them,

77
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,185
meaning that their understanding of them is very deep.

78
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:39,027
This is one of the big difficulties we encounter writing about eSports, especially when you

79
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,188
have to write about more than one.

80
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:46,000
There will inevitably be someone who knows much more than you in your audience.

81
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:55,165
The history of the most popular eSports and their corresponding professional scenes is

82
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,066
not only complicated, it's nuanced.

83
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,428
And it is very poorly documented.

84
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,811
You can do your homework as a writer, but research can only take you so far.

85
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,471
And if you screw up...

86
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:11,904
It's very likely you're going to be called out, as I certainly have been.

87
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:19,707
But you don't even need to get the details wrong to stir the ire of devoted eSports fans.

88
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,387
Tone plays a major role in this, too.

89
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,669
How many times over the last few years have you seen a headline like this?

90
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,951
That'll win you some portion of the casual crowd, but it'll make anyone who actually

91
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,632
cares about eSports roll their eyes.

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,261
Mainstream writers tend to approach games with this intense level of apprehension, as

93
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:47,162
I'm sure a lot of you know, and this goes doubly for eSports.

94
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:54,203
You can blame that on our puritanical roots as a country or on gatekeeping among the highest

95
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:59,564
echelons of media writers, but it's something that we do have to confront as eSports writers.

96
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,525
ESports fans demand a lot from you as a writer.

97
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,874
But this audience is also the most passionate and in that way if you're writing about esports

98
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:15,395
in the first place, they're probably the most like you.

99
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,377
They'll debate the hell out of you.

100
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:19,338
Don't get me wrong.

101
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:21,199
Esports fans love to win.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,063
But they'll also follow you into the strangest and best places.

103
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:32,807
Whether you're comparing the world of competitive smash to David Foster Wallace's tennis epic

104
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,093
talking about the architecture of Overwatch.

105
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,717
So what about on the other side of the chasm?

106
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,782
If you want to write for people who might lie outside the definition of eSports fans,

107
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,725
we run into a very different set of problems.

108
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:57,831
To start, most eSports have a big literacy requirement to understand what's happening

109
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,972
that you don't see as much in traditional sports.

110
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,414
In soccer or basketball?

111
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:07,771
If the ball goes in the hoop or the net, it's safe to say it's a point.

112
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:11,573
You don't really have to know a huge amount to follow what's going on.

113
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:18,897
Even in the more complicated sports like American football, there's a level of cultural literacy

114
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,558
that eSports just haven't managed to achieve yet.

115
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,420
I, for example, know what a first down is.

116
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,643
I cannot say who ever explained that to me or when it was explained to me, but that's

117
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:32,963
in there.

118
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,766
Our first challenge is just conveying how these games work quickly and painlessly, but

119
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,768
this is important, without being condescending to dedicated fans.

120
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:52,233
Second, and this is easier now than it used to be, we still have to convince some people

121
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,175
that these players are athletes.

122
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,353
For some, the amount of money and attention generated by the esports world has been enough.

123
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:03,993
They don't need more convincing.

124
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,894
But that isn't true across the board.

125
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:09,676
There's absolutely still a stigma against taking games seriously.

126
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:18,780
This stigma runs so deep that many esports players themselves, people who have dedicated

127
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,682
their lives up until now practicing, experience it.

128
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:29,460
I remember interviewing Marcus Dyrus Hill, the retired League of Legends player, for

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,321
Kill Screen last year.

130
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:38,446
Dyrus, for those of you unfamiliar, qualified for every world championship that happened

131
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:39,447
over the course of his career.

132
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:44,270
He's a legendary North American LCS player.

133
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:50,638
When I asked Dyrus why he found such success in the early years of competitive League of

134
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:54,079
Legends, his response was telling, particularly his choice of words.

135
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,081
He said it was because he was completely addicted to the game.

136
00:10:59,541 --> 00:10:59,961
Addicted.

137
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:08,285
I'm willing to bet that if Dyrus had been a competitive athlete in a major sport, that

138
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:12,587
word probably would have been something closer to relentless or dedicated.

139
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,408
Because he was an esports player, though.

140
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:23,763
It was addicted. Can you imagine a championship fighter saying he was addicted to boxing? There's

141
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,744
that stigma, that notion that video games are in some way a waste of time, even when

142
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:36,786
you're better than 99.99% of an enormous selection of people. As big as the obstacles are, though,

143
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:42,807
with this audience, the opportunities are at the same scale. Simply put, there are far

144
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:45,447
more non-esports fans than there are esports fans.

145
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:52,902
Winning over even a portion of the ordinary sport audience or the traditional gaming audience

146
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:54,703
would do wonders for our reach.

147
00:11:57,105 --> 00:12:02,468
At the end of the day, there's no easy way to bridge the gap between your informed readers

148
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,669
and your casual ones.

149
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:09,552
But that is something that publications will eventually have to do if they want to remain

150
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:10,473
financially viable.

151
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,756
For a moment, though, let's forget about the finances.

152
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,676
Let's pretend they don't matter.

153
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:26,282
Because outside of audience goals, outside of traffic numbers, we actually have a bigger

154
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:27,183
problem on our plate.

155
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:32,427
We have to figure out what the purpose of writing about eSports is.

156
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:37,771
And I don't mean a broad corporate purpose like connect with the youth.

157
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:39,953
I mean existentially.

158
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:46,387
Because while you can make a lot of comparisons between the world of sports journalism and

159
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:51,892
this burgeoning new world of esports journalism, you have to remember that they really came

160
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,293
about in entirely different ecosystems.

161
00:12:56,655 --> 00:13:00,938
The original purpose of sports writing was simply to inform people about the outcome

162
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,142
of a game or more specifically about the outcome of a horse race.

163
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,025
Good sports writing did that vividly.

164
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,211
It brought to life something that distant fans might not be able to see.

165
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:20,975
Today, though, subreddits deliver the outcome of a game much faster than the sports page.

166
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:26,358
And as for feeling like you're part of the action, they can just watch a live stream.

167
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,359
Which brings me to my next point.

168
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,662
Another big function of sports journalism was to give access to the athletes.

169
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:39,444
To hear what they think and feel, what they're like, what they have to say.

170
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,899
Now, though, Twitch exists.

171
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,962
Esports fans already have access to most of their biggest heroes on a regular basis.

172
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:57,884
They can see what they're like when they're bored or anxious or in training or drunk or

173
00:13:58,124 --> 00:13:58,464
whatever.

174
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,585
They can ask them questions.

175
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,847
They already have a more intimate window into their life than a reporter with a microphone

176
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,047
could ever provide.

177
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:13,317
So what do we bring to the table as journalists?

178
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:16,219
What can we offer the world of esports?

179
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,303
I'd like to quote here for the first, and you can hold me to this, last time in my life,

180
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:31,607
Malcolm Gladwell, who in a conversation with Bill Simmons on the Ringer, had something

181
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:34,108
pretty insightful to say about the world of sports journalism.

182
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,611
There is now a second conversation about baseball, the money ball conversation, that is interesting

183
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:46,573
even to people who don't follow the first conversation, the one that takes place on

184
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:46,933
the field.

185
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:49,293
Same thing for basketball.

186
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:55,215
There's an obsessive first conversation about a beautiful game and a great second conversation

187
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,977
about how basketball has become a mixed up culture of personality and celebrity.

188
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,359
Boxing had a wonderful second conversation in its glory years.

189
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,399
It was a metaphor of social mobility.

190
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:13,601
Jack Dempsey, one of the most popular boxers of all time, dropped out of school before

191
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:14,501
he even got to high school.

192
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:18,782
Joe Lewis' family got chased out of Alabama by the Ku Klux Klan.

193
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:23,963
That underlying narrative made what happened in the ring matter.

194
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,945
So what can we offer the world of esports journalism?

195
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,579
We could offer the same thing that great sports writers have always offered.

196
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,124
To start, that means keeping our perspective broad, not tunneling in on what happens in

197
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:49,528
the field, but making sure we understand the wider context in which all this is happening.

198
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:57,572
Second, we need to maintain a certain level of craftsmanship and pride in our work.

199
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:05,173
I've already noticed a fair bit of eSports writing start to slide into mindless hype-based

200
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:10,499
enthusiast press, and we're certainly not immune to the worst tendencies of sports writing

201
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:10,799
either.

202
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:15,564
Vagueness, recycled phrasing, a certain cloying quality.

203
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:20,789
We need to strive to remain great writers in addition to eSports experts.

204
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:28,269
And finally, we could use a bit of that myth making that Paul Gallico was doing almost

205
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,110
a hundred years ago.

206
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:37,253
Now as eSports rise in power, prominence, and popularity, I feel like we need this lens

207
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:38,634
more than ever before.

208
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:46,657
You can't talk about the world of competitive Smash without talking about this small, scrappy

209
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:51,259
community's fight for survival against the very developer that made the game they excel

210
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:51,359
at.

211
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:57,506
When fans in the audience of a major Call of Duty tournament shout racial slurs at an

212
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:01,070
African American player, that's not a random isolated incident.

213
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,393
That's part of a larger culture of intolerance surrounding the game.

214
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,462
Everybody knows that the best eSports players in the world come from South Korea, but fewer

215
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:18,804
people know that that's because of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s, which led the

216
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:24,906
government to invest hugely in telecommunications and Internet infrastructure, leading eventually

217
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:26,107
to the PC bang.

218
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:33,489
When you just talk about scores and stats, you're missing a fundamental part of eSports.

219
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:37,848
Usually, it's the most human, powerful, and important part.

220
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:45,012
It's this underlying narrative, this second story, that we as eSports writers should try

221
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:45,573
and grab at.

222
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,835
Because it might give us a bit of purpose.

223
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:54,598
And it might be the thing which unites eSports fans with people who just want to read a good

224
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:54,918
story.

225
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,403
Stock Car Fanatics probably enjoyed Tom Wolfe's thorough profile of their hero, Junior Johnson.

226
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:07,031
But even if you don't know anything about stock cars, it's still a great read.

227
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:14,176
There's something about a young bootlegger becoming a star racer that's almost mythical.

228
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:20,461
And that's because the best sports writers, the ones we go back to over and over again,

229
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:21,962
knew a secret.

230
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,746
The best sports writing is only ever partially about the sport.

231
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:33,637
Look at Gay Talese's profile of Joe DiMaggio, one of the best pieces of sports writing ever

232
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,018
written.

233
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:41,143
Out of its 8,000 total words, it has perhaps a few paragraphs devoted to baseball.

234
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:47,647
It's a story about fame and the diminishing years of an American hero.

235
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,692
String theory, David Foster Wallace's second most famous piece of sports writing probably.

236
00:18:55,863 --> 00:19:00,465
isn't really about his subject, Michael Joyce, it's about what becomes of the people who

237
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:05,447
are trained from a young age in something as frivolous and as difficult as tennis.

238
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,789
I contend we've done something similar with the very first feature we published on the

239
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:16,910
meta, Agony and Ecstasy at the Biggest Tournament Ever by the very talented Justin Groot.

240
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:24,719
Which isn't really about the international as much as it's about the fear and anxiety

241
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,942
that's accompanied the rise in eSports power and popularity among its fans.

242
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:34,227
Obviously, there's still a lot we need to figure out.

243
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,971
But that's the most exciting thing right now about being an eSports writer.

244
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,954
There are a few landmarks to go by.

245
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:46,477
But by and large, we're charting unknown territory.

246
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,321
If I could leave you with one thing, it would be this.

247
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:57,025
If you want to be the best sports writer in the world or the best music writer in the

248
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,046
world, good luck climbing that mountain.

249
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:06,090
But here is a vibrant culture full of human stories just waiting to be told.

250
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,632
And we're only now figuring out how to talk about it.

251
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:13,755
The best writing in the world of eSports is still waiting to be done.

252
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:16,837
So get out and do it.

253
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:19,313
Thank you for your time.

254
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:23,196
I'll be using however much time I have left to answer a few questions.

255
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,541
So feel free to come up to the microphone.

256
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,097
I'll ask a quick question.

257
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:46,880
So earlier you alluded to the existence of publisher-supported media outlets, like you

258
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,022
had LoL Esports in your deck.

259
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:56,566
I was curious, as someone coming from a more independent outlet than a publisher in your

260
00:20:56,606 --> 00:21:02,910
case, how do you find the context of the meta's work?

261
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:09,935
being changed by the existence of publisher driven publications.

262
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:14,297
Because now whatever story you're trying to tell that involves a League of Legends player

263
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:18,759
is going to be in the same news ecosystem as a whole bunch of stuff that is created

264
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,800
by Riot Games to tell the story that they would want to tell about that player.

265
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:22,641
Sure.

266
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,363
Well, I mean, obviously that's a complicated question because I think a lot of the stuff

267
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:33,285
that we're seeing in terms of like developer backed esports sites versus like

268
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:41,119
more traditional publications, partially comes down to a ‑‑ I believe this to be sort

269
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:47,185
of a transitory period in some ways. You can see even with like the recent PEA scandal

270
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:53,190
which was sort of aping the NBA in terms of structure, which everyone ‑‑ I sort of

271
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,534
thought was an inevitable direction for e‑sports to go in. That fell through.

272
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:06,337
The shape that eSports will take in five years is hard to say in terms of traditional media

273
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:10,098
outlets versus developer-packed publications.

274
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:16,820
But I think a lot of it, at least for us in the moment, comes down to the tone and the

275
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,502
direction that we take the article and the sort of...

276
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:24,133
I guess where we put the focus.

277
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:30,916
Because at the end of the day, while eSports does some good stuff, they're fundamentally

278
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:39,080
a PR-backed organization that are trying to at the end of the day make Riot more money,

279
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,783
whether that comes from sponsors or from players purchasing in-game items or what have you.

280
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:50,264
Our divorced perspective from that.

281
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:57,482
And our focus on, you know, just at the end of the day telling a good story and telling

282
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:01,926
a true story, I think, will always set us aside.

283
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:06,189
I don't believe people read LoL eSports and the meta for the same purpose, in other words.

284
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,652
Yeah, go ahead.

285
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:10,573
So strange question here.

286
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:17,700
Would you consider eSports journalism an enthusiast press or traditional formal press?

287
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:26,495
I don't know if you can qualify the whole of eSports journalism as either of those things.

288
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,639
I think that there's certainly room for enthusiast press within the wider net of eSports journalism.

289
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:43,708
But there also needs to be a critical, sort of culturally thinking model like Grantland or Deadspin,

290
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:44,669
which is...

291
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:52,067
Less about like, eSports is so awesome, let's all hop on the eSports bandwagon, which, you

292
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,928
know, nothing wrong with that and it should exist.

293
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:59,071
But there also needs to be someone being like, it's ridiculous how many Totino's products

294
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,472
I see on a regular basis as an eSports writer.

295
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:03,794
Do you have to write about them too?

296
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:05,755
I sure do.

297
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,996
But I get to trash them in my writing.

298
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:09,177
There you go.

299
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:09,697
All right.

300
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:10,018
Thanks, man.

301
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:10,558
Of course.

302
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:20,418
Hey, great talk. Just talking about, you're alluding to the quality of eSports journalism currently.

303
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:31,841
Do you think, my question is, do you think more conformity in eSports as far as like the organizations and tournaments, would that help the journalism quality kind of persevere or is it just solely on the publications?

304
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:36,762
I think ultimately the onus has to be on the publications.

305
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:49,144
When you see ridiculous kind of shit shows like the Shanghai Major in Dota 2's not too

306
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,366
recent past, I think

307
00:24:53,706 --> 00:24:58,489
At the end of the day, it's on the publications to write about that

308
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,492
in as much detail and with as much flourish as they can.

309
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:12,337
I wish I had read more elaborate 4,000-word takedowns of the Shanghai Major.

310
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:18,460
More like paintings of this terribly run event as Shakespearean tragedy.

311
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:29,586
Until eSports events shape up across the board in terms of production quality, I guess, is

312
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:38,154
what you're alluding to, I would just ‑‑ yeah, the quality of the writing on them has

313
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:44,740
no bearing on whether or not they were produced well, but the takedowns on them should be

314
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:51,944
even finer and more glorious now while we have the opportunity.

315
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,760
Hey, great talk by the way.

316
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,841
Thank you.

317
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:07,265
How do you think eSport journalists can help empower emerging new potential eSport with

318
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:12,969
much smaller community, for example, like Rocket League or Vainglory, perhaps through

319
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,671
the potential virality of the article they publish?

320
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:23,776
Right. I mean, this is definitely ‑‑ this is a tricky question because on one hand,

321
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:30,321
you do have to balance, like, traffic considerations when you're covering something, but, you know,

322
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:34,704
not every article has to be the thing that pulls in, like, a million likes.

323
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:39,667
I guess the short answer there would just be if they covered it.

324
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:47,371
If eSports journalists cover Rocket League, if they sort of find the dynamic firebrand

325
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:52,994
Towerfall player that wants to talk about how everyone else is trash and how she's going

326
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:58,557
to destroy the world, that's ‑‑ it's on ‑‑ yeah.

327
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:01,958
Just write about the stuff that you think is cool.

328
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:07,637
that you think maybe has the potential to be something bigger and better.

329
00:27:07,657 --> 00:27:12,242
Yeah, and if the community shares your view, I guess they'll just follow and the game will grow.

330
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,263
Yeah, I think so.

331
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:14,505
Cool, thanks.

332
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:15,045
Of course.

333
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,131
I have sort of a two part question, I guess.

334
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:19,791
Yeah, sure.

335
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,052
I'd like to know a little bit how you think about, like,

336
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:28,134
the fact that some of these sports are incredibly controlled

337
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:32,235
by singular companies, and some of them do their best

338
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,196
to sort of control the entire experience

339
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:39,217
and don't really want anyone to come in

340
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:40,937
and be a real journalist about it.

341
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,698
And the other question is kind of,

342
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,279
how would you like...

343
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:54,839
eSports or companies that make games that are potential eSports to behave so that they can like encourage you to do

344
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,580
Your job as well as possible. Okay, I think I understand what you're what you're asking

345
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,821
So just just so I could repeat it back to you and make sure it's I have it, right?

346
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:05,082
How?

347
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,543
How do I wish companies?

348
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,304
Handled their their competitive scenes and their games

349
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:21,313
And how do they, how does the fact that these are sports that are controlled by essentially

350
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,777
one gigantic company factor into that?

351
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:25,658
Is that about right?

352
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:33,996
Well, I mean, obviously, I just, access is key to a lot of this.

353
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:42,583
I feel pretty confident that a journalist worth his or her salt can find the story,

354
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:49,248
even if it's sort of being bodyguarded by, like, a PR person who maybe doesn't want you

355
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:54,912
to get at a player's deepest, darkest secrets, as long as they just have the opportunity

356
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:55,973
to speak with the player.

357
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:06,555
As far as the question of one company sort of controlling a sport and trying to control

358
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:16,338
not only the rules of the game itself but also the experience of watching it, it just

359
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:17,638
makes covering it a very...

360
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:23,357
A very unique experience but I don't know if it's that much different than what the

361
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,977
NBA does with basketball.

362
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,079
You can talk about patch notes obviously change the game more in League of Legends than they

363
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:39,921
do in basketball but basketball still does get pretty regular small changes to the game

364
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:46,602
and there's obviously like the NBA and the NFL tried very, very hard to control every

365
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:49,203
moment of broadcast of a major game like that.

366
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:51,624
I hope that answers the question.

367
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:57,589
Thanks.

368
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:03,534
So being a person who plays Super Smash Bros. Melee and how the different scenes are, say

369
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:07,417
it's a legal version of Cell, so I'm very familiar with, I kind of find it interesting

370
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:11,661
that people always talk about the narrative, the players, the narrative, like the stories

371
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:12,081
and like ‑‑

372
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:16,083
So that would be the second story you'd be having.

373
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:22,246
But in a lot of situations, the only people you ever hear about in certain games are the people who are at the top,

374
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:27,928
the pinnacle, or in our case, the gods of the game, or maybe the top few teams, like the TSM, the C9, or whatever.

375
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:31,569
But you don't really see many people covering, say, EnVyUs or something like that.

376
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,314
In your opinion, is there a way to foster some sort of narrative, maybe like a smaller

377
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:41,178
scene or something like that, like maybe an up-and-coming player who hasn't really gotten

378
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:44,842
much exposure or anything and is starting to travel or something like that?

379
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:45,863
Yeah, absolutely.

380
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:51,168
I mean, I guess, I think this again comes down to the question of like, the journalist

381
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:52,810
has to find the story in the first place.

382
00:30:54,495 --> 00:31:03,327
Actually, I remember we ran a profile also by Justin Greer on Axe, who is a great melee

383
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:08,353
player but is not usually considered a god, is not one of the top five.

384
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:15,939
The story just focused on the fact that he had played this game for years and years

385
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:20,421
basically without winning more than a couple hundred dollars at a tournament here and there

386
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,303
while holding down a job at CVS.

387
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:28,165
That's as much a second story as these sort of globetrotting rivalries

388
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,706
that you see in some of the major sports.

389
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,868
It's interesting, it's compelling, it's got a human element to it.

390
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,489
I think a lot of it is just that...

391
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:42,901
Players or reporters aren't always given the time or don't always elect to take the time

392
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:51,446
to chase down these kind of stories and find the, as you're saying, the sort of smaller

393
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:52,746
scale up and coming narratives.

394
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:58,650
And I guess one quick thing about that, so the Smash documentary is also a big thing

395
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,130
for Smash.

396
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,712
I was wondering if you had any opinions on where documentaries kind of sit in the idea

397
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:03,913
of I guess journalism.

398
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:04,994
It's somewhat.

399
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:05,734
I think.

400
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:11,764
A lot of the ideas that I tried to toss out in this talk can be applied to ‑‑ I said

401
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:17,185
writing a whole lot because that's my trade. But I think you can apply a lot of the same

402
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:23,447
ideas to documentary. Yeah. In terms of like the challenges of ‑‑ I think probably

403
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:29,749
it's easier in some ways to convey the ‑‑ just how the game works in a documentary form.

404
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:36,332
But you run into a lot of the same challenges. And I think that's a really good point.

405
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,925
like obstacles, I would imagine.

406
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,889
I haven't personally worked on any sports documentary,

407
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,451
so I can only theorize.

408
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,874
Thank you.

409
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:56,937
I just had a question of what you thought as far as casual games and casual gamers.

410
00:32:57,918 --> 00:33:04,639
They don't self-identify as gamers often, but my aunt is on level 2185 of Candy Crush

411
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,180
and probably plays it more than I play any of the other games I play.

412
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,780
But she's like, I'm not a gamer.

413
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:18,742
Do you think there's space or are we close to where we would start writing about casual

414
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:25,790
Is there, is that, is there, is that eSport?

415
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:33,578
So if I, okay, can I repeat this question back to you to make sure I have it right?

416
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,260
It's kind of disconnected.

417
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,181
I think I know what you mean.

418
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:44,008
Do you mean that like, is any writing about a game that is played at professional caliber

419
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:45,750
considered eSports writing?

420
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,018
Or could it be?

421
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,961
Do we need to recategorize eSports writing and call it something else to be palatable

422
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,783
to the mom crowd, for example?

423
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,304
I think that's an interesting question.

424
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:10,168
Falling back on the idea of looking at sports journalism for some clues there, you don't

425
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:19,103
You don't see much writing about the casual side of football or baseball, for example.

426
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:26,647
But you have college games, which are certainly played at a lesser level than the major leagues.

427
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:36,312
Maybe that's where sort of more casual games could, or more casual levels of play, I suppose,

428
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,053
could see profit in.

429
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:46,240
eSports journalism is like more coverage of collegiate events as colleges start to pick

430
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,460
up eSports programs.

431
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:54,465
I think that maybe the secondary, the corollary question is like, for example, if we found

432
00:34:54,605 --> 00:35:02,090
out that a 55-year-old woman had a Flappy Birds run of like 11,000 or something like

433
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,330
that.

434
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:08,394
So not played at a level, but literally someone who doesn't consider themselves part of the

435
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:09,415
eSports blanket.

436
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,834
It demonstrates an ability that would certainly warrant that in the top five game.

437
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:23,156
I think that at that point, it doesn't matter whether you identify as a gamer or not.

438
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:30,317
I mean, skill is skill, and that situation you described absolutely seems like something that esports writers should cover.

439
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:32,569
Thanks.

440
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,290
Of course.

441
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,214
It looks like that is all the questions.

442
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,036
So thank you guys.

443
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:41,020
Have a great rest of your GDC.
