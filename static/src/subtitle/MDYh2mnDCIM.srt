1
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:12,773
your attention please. I'm Alexis Kennedy this is what I'm talking about and in a

2
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:19,217
nutshell this is my motto for many years it's not a bad motto but I think this

3
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:26,022
one is better and that is I hope what I'm going to help you do today is to

4
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:30,365
learn from my mistakes the ones I made and some of the ones I didn't make

5
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:33,740
This is my biography slide.

6
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:39,086
I've been making software like 20 years.

7
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:40,827
Only 10 of that is in game dev.

8
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,450
I founded Failbetter Games,

9
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,193
which is where you'll have heard of me from

10
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:46,893
if you've heard of me.

11
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,696
I made Fawn in London, I made Sunless Sea.

12
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,939
I really enjoyed running Failbetter and then.

13
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,715
I needed a change, I wanted to do more hands-on work.

14
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,876
I'll talk about that later in the talk.

15
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,316
But I went off and did a kind of Ronin year,

16
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:05,637
doing a bunch of work for AAAs and learning a lot.

17
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,398
And now I have founded, with Lottie Bevan,

18
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:10,278
who's sitting in the front row,

19
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,619
Weather Factory, another studio,

20
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,239
where we are making a game,

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,940
which you may notice some subliminal messaging attached to.

22
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,324
which has already won a design award,

23
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:23,506
although we haven't finished it yet, which is really nice.

24
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:25,928
And we do a lot of mentoring of other indies

25
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,709
because there are things I wish people

26
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:29,670
had told me coming up.

27
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:33,973
So here's the roadmap for today.

28
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,795
First of all, I'm gonna talk about what I mean by growth,

29
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:37,635
which isn't necessarily

30
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:39,476
the traditional San Francisco definition.

31
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:43,239
I wanna talk to you about what you want

32
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,380
out of running a studio.

33
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:48,198
I want to talk about the specific advantages

34
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:49,938
that indie studios have that others don't.

35
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,059
We have disadvantages, but we have advantages too.

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,039
I want to talk about staying human

37
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,260
because I think two things.

38
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,501
One, doing the right thing is the right thing.

39
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,101
Two, doing the right thing is the best way

40
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,382
to get value out of your team.

41
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,362
So do well by doing good.

42
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,195
I want to talk about why I left Failbetter and hopefully

43
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:14,136
highlight some lessons that might be useful to you if you

44
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,216
did the studio you founded.

45
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,117
And I have one more piece of advice at the very end.

46
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:19,798
So growth.

47
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,079
I do not mean being an ex-Facebook.

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,001
I don't mean the kind of aggressive 10x growth that

49
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,441
you'll hear about in Silicon Valley.

50
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,602
I am not rich, and I cannot give you advice

51
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:32,323
on how to get rich.

52
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,524
What I can talk about is how to build a human scale studio

53
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:37,625
where people.

54
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,426
enjoy doing interesting work

55
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:43,969
and have enough financial stability

56
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,231
to be able to continue doing interesting work.

57
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,152
Because that is key.

58
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,394
Without financial stability,

59
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,216
nothing else counts.

60
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,539
One of the myths that leaks into IndyCulture

61
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:55,480
is this idea that

62
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,324
we are not subject to the same rules

63
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:01,846
that big corporations are.

64
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:03,287
We are.

65
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,118
Kindness isn't enough, creativity isn't enough,

66
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,378
good intentions aren't enough.

67
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,398
They're really important,

68
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,339
but everybody is subject to gravity.

69
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,260
And what I mean by gravity is crunch.

70
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,620
I mean, you start out with good intentions

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,741
and people end up working overtime,

72
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:20,781
which fucks their lives.

73
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:23,442
I mean,

74
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,403
being one of the 30 odd percent of Kickstarter games

75
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:30,883
which don't deliver.

76
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,079
I don't believe most of those 30% of games

77
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,680
that don't deliver started out as crooks.

78
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,101
I think people have good intentions

79
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:40,101
and sometimes fall prey to gravity.

80
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,662
And that's the last thing you want to happen to you, right?

81
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:44,823
Running out of funds is much, much worse

82
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,424
than not getting funded in the first place.

83
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:52,546
And above all, gravity is people not being paid,

84
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,887
not being able to make payroll at the end of the month,

85
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,287
whether it's you, whether it's your team.

86
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,509
If you take nothing else away from today,

87
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,543
Before you write another line of code,

88
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,103
before you write another line of dialogue,

89
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,344
before you draw another picture,

90
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,505
make sure you have an answer for each of these questions.

91
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:15,465
How much is it gonna cost to make the game?

92
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,466
How much money is the game gonna make?

93
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,347
And when's that gonna happen?

94
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,848
So I am very confident that a number of people

95
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,948
sitting in this room going,

96
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,669
well, duh, it's a business, of course I have those things.

97
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,150
But I'm also very confident that a number of people

98
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,610
sitting in this room going,

99
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:36,299
Ah, I don't actually have answers to every one of those questions.

100
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,962
You must. Otherwise, you're not running a business,

101
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:44,345
you're not making a project, you are engaging in an act of faith.

102
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,347
And if you have a team, that's irresponsible.

103
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,930
So you should be able to answer every one of those questions

104
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:55,333
without referring to documentation. That has to be the bones

105
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,075
of the thing you build to survive gravity.

106
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,253
So the reason that you are here today is,

107
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,594
unless you are press or unless you've strayed in here

108
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:09,235
looking for the bathroom, which is on the left,

109
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:12,577
then it's because you want to run a studio

110
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:14,138
or you are already running a studio.

111
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:20,702
This is why people want to run studios, indie studios.

112
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:23,824
But that's just the how, it's not the why.

113
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,685
If you spend eight hours a day,

114
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,206
five days a week making games,

115
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,003
Making games is a really kind of broad category of activity.

116
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,183
What do you actually want to spend

117
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,444
those eight hours a day doing?

118
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:39,765
Managing people, coding, drawing, designing,

119
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,526
marketing stuff, giving talks at conferences.

120
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:48,547
Often, people seize onto an inspiration,

121
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,708
a studio that they want to be like.

122
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:53,529
You see people do good work, you want to do similar work.

123
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,590
You see people out in the industry

124
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,030
who seem to be having a good time.

125
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,810
You want to be like them.

126
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:01,282
This is a good place to start,

127
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,806
but you can't replicate a studio

128
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,608
by looking at the shape of it from the outside.

129
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:10,052
If you put wings and a nose and a tail

130
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,394
and a cockpit on something

131
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,236
without thinking about how it actually works,

132
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:18,802
what you get is unlikely to clock much time in the air.

133
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,525
Here's a concrete example of what I mean.

134
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:26,153
I'm going to show you a quote, something somebody said to me back in about 2010, 2011.

135
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:32,940
They weren't a stupid person at all, they just didn't know what it was like being at Failbetter.

136
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:40,088
At that point, Failbetter barely generated any revenue at all,

137
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,693
let alone, you know, floating happily through life with sheer creativity.

138
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:50,000
It's very easy to look at a studio from the outside

139
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,602
that has published games and that has like a website

140
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,683
where they look kind of professional,

141
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,564
where people show up at conferences with badges

142
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:58,505
and assume that things are serene.

143
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,386
And if you copy them, you'll end up in the right place.

144
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,547
It's very dangerous to do that.

145
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,328
Even when you have a more detailed idea

146
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:08,550
of what you want to do on a project,

147
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:12,352
again, if you try to copy the detailed idea

148
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:15,774
without understanding why decisions have been taken.

149
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,482
you can end up with something that isn't fit for purpose.

150
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,466
This was my business plan, if you can call it that,

151
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,027
in 2009 when I found a Failbetter.

152
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,129
Here I am.

153
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,110
Has 10 million players.

154
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,711
It's got a shit story.

155
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,934
So I'll make a game that's kind of a social Facebook RPG,

156
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,595
because that's what people were making in 2009.

157
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,577
It'll have a great story.

158
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,118
So it'll do twice as well.

159
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,551
Yeah, so that didn't happen,

160
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,153
because I completely failed to understand

161
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,955
why people were making social RPGs

162
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:50,336
and what made some social RPGs successful.

163
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,659
As it happens, I'm really glad I didn't,

164
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,020
because if we had got 20 million players,

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,502
I'd have ended up trying to run a business

166
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,704
that was servicing 20 million players and not making games.

167
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,325
But there was no chance of that happening,

168
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,206
because I was doing this.

169
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,191
So this is a pithy insight I am indebted to Lottie for.

170
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:15,247
You wouldn't sit down and say, I'm making a game

171
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,188
and it's gonna be kind of like that game.

172
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,368
I mean, you might,

173
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:21,529
but it's probably not gonna be a great strategy.

174
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:23,129
You want design pillars,

175
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,190
you want key goals for what you're doing.

176
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,871
You want reference points for what you're trying to do.

177
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:33,752
So do the same with your business.

178
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,052
You're building a studio,

179
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,652
think about what you want the studio to be and do

180
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:38,853
and build it around that.

181
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:43,974
Here are some contenders for design pillars for a studio.

182
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:46,335
Take a moment to look at this

183
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,555
and see which of these things apply to you.

184
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:55,777
All of these are perfectly decent ways to run a studio,

185
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:56,957
perfectly decent things to focus on.

186
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,078
So me, broadly speaking, I'm in the left-hand column,

187
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,239
which isn't a particular category,

188
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,899
it's just a list of things that I like.

189
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,179
I do enjoy the biz side of things,

190
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,200
but it's not my main focus.

191
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:11,979
I like getting hands-on, more about that later.

192
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,741
I'm a story guy, and I really enjoy developing in the open.

193
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,423
I like crowdfunding, I like working with the community

194
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:23,544
to get feedback and to find out how to improve games.

195
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,965
I find it very validating and I find it a very clear way

196
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:27,986
of fixing my mistakes.

197
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,347
On the other hand, take someone like Subset Games

198
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,448
who made Into the Reach and FTL.

199
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:42,496
They do great work, they are world-class devs, and Justin Ma, one of the founders, told me

200
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:46,857
a couple of years ago that they are never going to run, he said at the time, another

201
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,437
Kickstarter after the FTL one.

202
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:54,199
The FTL Kickstarter was successful, they made a really good game, but they just didn't enjoy

203
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,780
developing in the spotlight.

204
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,128
So they went away and they made Into the Breach

205
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,370
over four years and polished it in the dark

206
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,092
till it glowed like a star and they released it,

207
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,015
which is again a perfectly acceptable way of doing it

208
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:08,538
if that's the kind of thing you want to do.

209
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:11,622
So think about how you want to approach your work.

210
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,764
There are a dozen ways to skin a cat.

211
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:17,525
Think about it not just now, but over the next decade.

212
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,486
What you want to do today may not be

213
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,586
what you want to do next year.

214
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:22,426
This caught me out.

215
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,607
So always keep an eye on what you're in this for,

216
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,908
what you want to spend your eight hours a day doing.

217
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,229
These are the design pillars for Failbetter

218
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,610
that we iterated towards.

219
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,631
2015, this was a slide at the all hands end of year thing.

220
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:42,172
The key things here were everybody keeps their job.

221
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,508
Everybody enjoys their job and we do great.

222
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:49,349
So the third one is the aspirational thing

223
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,129
you put at the end of a mission statement.

224
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,530
Because God help me, this is a mission statement.

225
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,771
Design pillars for a studio are a mission statement.

226
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,492
When you hear the phrase mission statement,

227
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,193
you tend to think it's some bullshit on a plaque somewhere.

228
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,694
And frequently, it is some bullshit on a plaque somewhere

229
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,975
because it's what people have compromised

230
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,715
to fit on a plaque on the wall of an office.

231
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,338
So what you want in your mission statement

232
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,360
or your design pillars is a clear idea

233
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,461
of what your priorities are.

234
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,422
Don't make your mission statement,

235
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,683
we are going to succeed,

236
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:22,925
because everybody wants to succeed.

237
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,347
Nobody puts a mission statement on their wall saying,

238
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,068
we are the kind of company that fucks up.

239
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,931
Think in terms of priorities.

240
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:34,574
These are those things, restated,

241
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,736
safety, fun, and profit, in that order.

242
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,697
And that's important.

243
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:38,978
There's no reason those three things

244
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:39,938
needed to be in that order.

245
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,645
We really wanted to make sure everyone stayed employed.

246
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,949
We wanted to make sure people had a good time.

247
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,492
And after that, money's nice.

248
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:50,836
There's a difference between going for the kind of money

249
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:52,358
that keeps everyone paid and the kind of money

250
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,820
that buys you a big gold house.

251
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,707
These are the priorities at Weather Factory,

252
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,148
which Lottie and I run now.

253
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,530
And you'll notice we switched the top two,

254
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,112
because Weather Factory is quite well funded

255
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,734
and it's got a very small team, so it's a low burn.

256
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:09,037
The whole idea was to do a bunch of interesting experiments

257
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:10,418
fairly swiftly, get them out the door.

258
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,200
So we're taking more risks,

259
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,082
we're compromising the safety a bit

260
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:15,023
in order to have more fun.

261
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:17,545
Think about what's important for you.

262
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:19,907
And one of the things...

263
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,840
I realize this can sound extremely theoretical

264
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,301
if you're at the start of your career

265
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,722
or the start of your studios journey.

266
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:32,005
If you are thinking, how the fuck can I get paid next week?

267
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,667
Then when I think about whether I'd rather be safe

268
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:38,290
or having fun, this can seem theoretical,

269
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,792
but I wish I paid more attention to it in 2009, 2010

270
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:43,033
when I was getting started.

271
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,835
And it will become, if you are successful,

272
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:49,678
a practical problem much, much quicker than you think.

273
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:56,405
So you've probably seen the documentary film Aliens.

274
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,907
Here are the two of the characters from Aliens.

275
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:07,148
On the left, we have the Colonial Marines M577

276
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,048
armored personnel carrier.

277
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,889
On the right, we have Rebecca Jordan, also known as New.

278
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,730
They have different character builds.

279
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:23,177
And if you've seen the film, you'll know that one of them gets a lot more screen time than the other

280
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:28,141
because one of them leans into her strength, hiding from aliens and ventilation ducts,

281
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:34,226
and the other one doesn't get to employ its fire-resistant polymer armour

282
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,170
or its outward-facing laser ablative tile in a useful way.

283
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,138
Think for a moment about which of these characters

284
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,480
you would tend to compare to Indy Studios

285
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:52,704
and which you'd tend to compare to AAA.

286
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:57,048
So, every talk you attend during the next four days,

287
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,490
think about whether the advice you're listening to

288
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,913
is useful to Newt or to the other personnel carrier.

289
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,133
One of the mistakes I made a lot

290
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,514
in the early days of Failbetter is I'd go to talks

291
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,354
given by people from big mobile studios, for example,

292
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,895
and they'd say, you need to do these eight things

293
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:20,156
in order to increase retention by 0.03%.

294
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,897
I'd do that, and we'd increase retention by 0.03%,

295
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,678
and that would mean we kept four extra players each week

296
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,718
because we were a tiny studio without big numbers,

297
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,159
so that was useless and didn't show up

298
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:31,999
in our bottom line at all.

299
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,253
Here's good advice.

300
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:38,834
It's good advice in the context of this talk.

301
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:39,935
I think it's good advice generally.

302
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:42,376
I don't know if paradox qualifies Indy.

303
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,577
I don't know if paradox know if paradox qualifies Indy,

304
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:49,319
but you are going to have dozens and dozens of things

305
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,920
your company is bad at or unremarkable at

306
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,500
and a few things your company is good at.

307
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:55,441
If you try to spend your energy

308
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:57,942
fixing all the things you're not great at,

309
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,263
you're gonna waste all your energy.

310
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:04,946
Here's some bad advice from a much more talented

311
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,607
and eminent game designer than me

312
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,608
for indies most of the time.

313
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,989
If you are making Nintendo's crown jewel

314
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,830
platform launch exclusive game,

315
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,931
and you need to hold it back for six months

316
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:19,852
to get 10 out of 10 rather than nine out of 10,

317
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,292
this is probably good advice.

318
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,458
If you are three indies working from their back bedrooms

319
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,344
and you're gonna hit a negative cash flow in three months,

320
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:33,531
then you probably won a game that isn't great

321
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,914
rather than a game that isn't hell.

322
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:36,857
Same guy.

323
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,103
Great advice for indies.

324
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:43,285
Just because it's not an indie source

325
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,447
doesn't mean it's bad advice for indies.

326
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:47,128
This I wish I'd listened to,

327
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,909
I wish I'd known when I was making Sunless Sea.

328
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,253
Sunless Sea, we made the home port for London first

329
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,234
and then did everything else.

330
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:57,596
And it worked out okay, but what we should have done,

331
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,778
and what I think is often good advice,

332
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,579
is to get the core loop of the game,

333
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,980
the core activity right first,

334
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,882
and then go back and look at the introductory experience.

335
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:08,813
Here is some more bad advice

336
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,454
from an unimpeachable indie source.

337
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,457
And I know it's bad advice, or I believe it's bad advice,

338
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,078
because Rami said it was bad advice

339
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,420
when he gave a talk last year here, I think.

340
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:24,443
Rami told a group of game design students when asked,

341
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:25,864
should I stay in school?

342
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,985
No, you should drop out because then you'll learn more stuff

343
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,026
and you'll get life lessons.

344
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:32,148
And afterwards, the talk organizer came up to him

345
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:34,809
and said, for God's sake, this is not the Netherlands.

346
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,350
South Africa does not have...

347
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:43,263
a social safety net, and what you've just told these students, you know, could destroy their lives,

348
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,403
because staying in school is their best chance of having a good life.

349
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,605
Every talk you attend, think about whether it's going to be useful for you.

350
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:56,366
The biggest trap is, you know, big studios will have advice that may not be useful for you,

351
00:16:57,246 --> 00:17:03,027
but even other indies may give advice that isn't useful for your specific circumstances.

352
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:03,987
Think about it critically.

353
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,874
These, I think, are the things that most indies

354
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:14,955
have in common as advantages that big studios often don't.

355
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:17,816
You don't have to spend all the money.

356
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,718
You don't have to do all the things

357
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,179
that big, real, serious studios with lobby art do.

358
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,601
You are not prevented from making decisions quickly

359
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,842
by five layers of management.

360
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,603
You're also not protected from the consequences

361
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,263
of your decisions by five layers of management.

362
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,364
I'll talk about that in a moment.

363
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:37,465
You've got a small team.

364
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,327
for the people who are engaged,

365
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:41,869
you will have a deeper bond than you will

366
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,669
in a big organisation where people

367
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,730
only meet at the water cooler.

368
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:46,651
All else being equal.

369
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,252
Low budget, it's really straightforward.

370
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,474
This is a UK based entrepreneur

371
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:54,635
who I asked for advice a few years ago.

372
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,397
What I said is the thing you would say

373
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,018
to a studio first that is trying to grow.

374
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,619
And he said this.

375
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,706
If you put more pounds into, or more dollars,

376
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:09,849
into a project, you don't necessarily get more dollars out.

377
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,331
There is a relationship, of course there is,

378
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,753
but the relationship is much less direct than people think.

379
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,714
And if you really, really, really, really

380
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,396
want a game to succeed, it's easy to start

381
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,637
playing your whole budget into it.

382
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,259
Every pound you spend on the game,

383
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,381
or every other currency of choice you spend on the game,

384
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:28,441
is...

385
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,827
a pound you have to make back in sales at the end.

386
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,968
If you don't spend it, you don't have to make it back.

387
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,350
Always bear that in mind.

388
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:37,631
Constraints.

389
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,574
So you will hear people say,

390
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,936
or you will say yourself something like this.

391
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:45,538
What does a proper business do?

392
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,440
So first of all, proper business has budgets,

393
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,282
schedules, revenue projections.

394
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,263
And you want those.

395
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:52,584
Those are essential.

396
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,586
Proper business has employees.

397
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:57,007
You probably want employees,

398
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,949
even if you're the only employee of your studio.

399
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:00,494
You need a team.

400
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,636
You can't make games without personnel.

401
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:07,580
Proper business companies, proper businesses have offices.

402
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,840
You don't necessarily need an office.

403
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:10,081
Lots of indies work from home,

404
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:12,523
remotely or from their living rooms.

405
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,025
You probably need payroll.

406
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,447
You probably don't need a payroll department.

407
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,289
You probably need an HR policy.

408
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,671
You probably don't need an HR department.

409
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:24,353
You definitely don't need lobby art.

410
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:27,375
Don't.

411
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,475
copy what proper businesses do

412
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:33,917
without thinking about it

413
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:35,939
in an attempt to become a proper business.

414
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,600
And here's a really good example of what I mean.

415
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:41,123
Press releases that look like this.

416
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,666
And I've put out press releases that look like this.

417
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,588
And I nod off rereading them.

418
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,411
We know what press releases look like.

419
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:53,574
We know what press releases are supposed to look like.

420
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,355
If we want to be taken seriously, we tend to put out things that look like this.

421
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,657
When we could do this.

422
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,808
Dan Marshall's a solo dev in the UK.

423
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:10,810
He's a very funny fucker.

424
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:15,322
And you know, you can't say this in a press release,

425
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:16,883
I'm not wasting my time day in, day out,

426
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:18,665
knee-deep in football without some sort of kickback.

427
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,107
We're very excited to release our new football game.

428
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:24,309
No, I don't know how well Kickman did,

429
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,112
pretty well I think, but I'm telling you about it

430
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:29,274
at GDC a year after release,

431
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,356
because he did something unusual and distinctive

432
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,518
and he didn't just try to copy other press releases.

433
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,659
Not everyone is as funny as Dan Marshall.

434
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,119
I'm not.

435
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,860
So not all of us can make entertaining press releases,

436
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,200
but don't just do things because they're done that way.

437
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:49,261
This is me in my living room with Sonia, my daughter,

438
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:53,002
doing a live stream for the Cultist Simulator Kickstarter.

439
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:59,243
Sonia is explaining what her Beanie Babies names are

440
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:00,804
and which one she likes more.

441
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,784
Because I was doing a stream and she wanted to get involved

442
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:04,805
and she insisted on getting in.

443
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,409
If you are doing a stream, if you're recording a Kickstarter video, it's very easy to get sucked into the idea that you need to look professional.

444
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:20,376
You need to have a printed backdrop and you need to sit there and look serious and give the impression that you're in a meeting room in a AAA studio.

445
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:24,200
People who are backing your Kickstarter know you're not in a meeting room in a AAA studio.

446
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,484
They know you are one or three or five people sitting in a room somewhere.

447
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,333
You don't need to pretend to be a proper business.

448
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,435
This is how Counter Simulator did in Kickstarter.

449
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:37,238
It wasn't a problem, Sonia being in the live stream.

450
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,621
It was a problem, Sonia being in the live stream,

451
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:42,103
because she now wants to be in every live stream I do, ever.

452
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:45,186
That's a separate issue.

453
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:46,487
Right, immediacy.

454
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,032
I said earlier that you can make decisions quickly

455
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,675
and you are not protected.

456
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,670
from making bad decisions by five layers of management.

457
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,972
So what you've got as an indie is very short iteration time.

458
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:04,334
Make a decision, act on it, see the effects,

459
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:07,556
change your decision, act on it again, see the effects.

460
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:09,857
In order to make this useful,

461
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:12,819
in order to catch the bad decisions

462
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,860
you're not protected from,

463
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:17,002
everybody has to know these three things.

464
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:19,364
What they're doing, why they're doing it,

465
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:20,264
and why they want to do it.

466
00:22:20,284 --> 00:22:22,626
So your job as a studio head or a team lead.

467
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:25,013
is to make sure they know those things.

468
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,454
This is your number one job, right?

469
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:28,155
It's managing information flow.

470
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,938
Think about how you would manage information flow

471
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,259
if you were designing a game.

472
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,022
A lot of information flow in companies works like this.

473
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:41,203
You get an email explaining what you want to do,

474
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,345
and you do that for the next month.

475
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:46,627
Imagine designing a game where you get a big text dump

476
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,567
at the beginning of the month.

477
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:49,728
Never refer to it again,

478
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:51,089
and then check in the end of the month,

479
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:51,630
see where it's done.

480
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:55,108
So you want small snippets of information constantly.

481
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:58,189
You want to work and inform people all the time.

482
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,670
You want to check their understanding

483
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,151
to make sure that they know, not just what they're doing,

484
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,251
but why they're doing it,

485
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:05,032
so they can change direction intelligently

486
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,132
so nothing goes wrong.

487
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:08,553
And here's a really useful tool

488
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,834
for giving people information constantly

489
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:13,815
in small digestible snippets, design pillars.

490
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,216
Safety, fun and profit, of course,

491
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,497
we're making a game that is going to have a modest budget.

492
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,217
in order to ensure that we all have jobs,

493
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,138
rather than pushing the boat out and ploughing money into it.

494
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,880
Same with actual game projects,

495
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,020
same with actual design pillars for actual games.

496
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,061
Loneliness exploration survival

497
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,622
was the core pillars of Sunless Sea,

498
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:36,502
and I banged on about this all the time.

499
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,463
And the effect of this was,

500
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,804
when I said the boat needs to look really small

501
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:44,565
in the middle of a vast, dark ocean,

502
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:48,219
My UI developer said straight away, of course, yes,

503
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,342
because loneliness is one of the core values of the game.

504
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,367
And you can have design pillars,

505
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,111
snippets of information you keep revisiting,

506
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:59,537
decisions you make up front and then refer back to.

507
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:02,088
for periods of time as well.

508
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:04,068
So last year, the game sold well.

509
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,709
We actually have more money than we expected.

510
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,749
This year, we're not gonna focus on

511
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,730
improving our cashflow, because that's okay.

512
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,750
We are going to focus on finding bigger audiences.

513
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:14,711
Everybody in the studio knows that.

514
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:17,392
Everyone in the studio acts on this all the time.

515
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,993
When you give somebody a jump button in a game,

516
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:25,074
you immediately give them a wall to jump over

517
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,374
to check that they've understood the jump button.

518
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:28,695
If you give somebody a crouch button, there will be a pipe.

519
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,960
If I'm trying to make sure my daughter knows

520
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,001
it's her bedtime, I will say,

521
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,962
what are you gonna do, Sonia?

522
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,023
And she'll say, clean my teeth and get into bed.

523
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:40,704
I'll wait for you to come and read a story for me.

524
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:41,164
Ah.

525
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,866
You need to check understanding with your team as well.

526
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,547
But if you check understanding with your team by saying,

527
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,128
repeat back to me what I've just said to you,

528
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,689
they'll lose patience fairly quickly.

529
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,311
So here are three non-annoying ways

530
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,212
to get them to indicate their understanding.

531
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:57,933
One is to have them explain it to somebody else

532
00:24:57,993 --> 00:24:58,694
while you're present.

533
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,636
This is the added advantage,

534
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:01,676
they will probably understand it better

535
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,516
while they're explaining it,

536
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,937
and the other person will understand it at the end of it.

537
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:08,078
You can pick up on issues of confusion.

538
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:10,399
Another is to get them to write documentation.

539
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,279
Another nice outcome of that is that you have documentation

540
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,740
at the end of it that other people can refer to.

541
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,101
And another is to build out a really quick prototype.

542
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:18,921
Do you get what I'm saying?

543
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,222
Okay, let's see how it looks in the build.

544
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:22,902
Let's spend half an hour doing it.

545
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:24,683
That's not quite what I meant.

546
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,603
Let's sort this out before we go further.

547
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:32,405
And one of the other advantages and disadvantages

548
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:37,488
of having an indie studio without five layers of management

549
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:40,370
where people are making decisions on the floor day to day,

550
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,131
is there is nowhere to hide from responsibility.

551
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,733
And that's great because you want people

552
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:48,474
to be responsible for their tasks.

553
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,456
To make them responsible, you need this thing, the buck.

554
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:55,358
Every task...

555
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:58,386
If you want people to be responsible for it,

556
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:01,068
one person has to be responsible for it.

557
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:02,669
If three people are responsible for it,

558
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,450
nobody's responsible for it

559
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,591
because everybody thinks it's somebody else's job to do

560
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,872
and they will focus on the task

561
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:10,853
that they are solely responsible for.

562
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:15,335
So make sure anything you want to be done in the studio

563
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:17,637
has one person responsible for it,

564
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:18,397
whether it's you,

565
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,218
whether it's a member of the team.

566
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:23,139
And they can pass on the buck, of course they can.

567
00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:25,645
You ask a team, need to get something done,

568
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:26,886
they will pass that to their team.

569
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:28,567
But it needs to be passed, not thrown.

570
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,388
Somebody needs to acknowledge they have the buck

571
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:31,649
and that they're responsible for it.

572
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,291
If somebody doesn't acknowledge responsibility,

573
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,033
they don't have responsibility.

574
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:38,775
And this is what you need to make sure

575
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:39,615
everybody understands.

576
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:43,638
If you have a buck, the task's problems are yours.

577
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,762
You have to ask for help or to call out delays.

578
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:49,843
That's essential.

579
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:53,125
If.

580
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:57,299
A team member has too many tasks or the tasks are delayed,

581
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,841
they need to be able to flag it

582
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,222
and you need to listen to that

583
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,264
because deadlines come in two kinds,

584
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,666
lions and sharks.

585
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:09,629
Deadlines that you can see coming,

586
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:13,432
deadlines that you understand your liability for,

587
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:15,393
whether you are gonna hit them or not, are lions.

588
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:16,554
They can kill you,

589
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:18,936
but you can see them coming a long time off.

590
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:23,039
Sharks, just as dangerous as lions.

591
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,234
but you won't know they're there

592
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:26,594
until your leg is already gone.

593
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:31,197
So deadlines are not less dangerous

594
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:33,458
if you think they're okay.

595
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,259
You need to make sure people can flag

596
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,480
when tasks are being delayed and when deadlines are at risk.

597
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,081
Right, the next four slides or so,

598
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:46,263
I'm going for possibly the highest profanity

599
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:49,244
to minute ratio of IndyTalk so far,

600
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:51,645
so I apologize if you have a sense of disposition.

601
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:52,526
Everyone fucks up.

602
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:57,548
Responsibility means that if you fuck up on a task,

603
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,190
it's your fuck up and you have to fix it.

604
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:03,052
You need to give your team room to fuck up.

605
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:04,773
If you are looking at people's shoulders

606
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,655
to the extent that they don't have room to fuck up,

607
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:10,897
then you are fucked because you have paid

608
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,319
a team full of people to do work

609
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:14,840
that you are now doing yourself.

610
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,196
If you give somebody ownership of a task,

611
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:19,877
that means giving them room to fuck up.

612
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:22,398
If you give them responsibility,

613
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,058
they will learn to avoid the fuck-ups themselves

614
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:26,259
without you doing care with their shoulder.

615
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:30,200
But if somebody fucks up in an indie team

616
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,321
where you have a number of self-motivated people

617
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:35,821
who care about what they're doing, are engaged,

618
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:37,682
usually the most you need to say is,

619
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:38,962
please don't do it again.

620
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:40,763
Let them know they've fucked up.

621
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:42,503
Don't belabor the point.

622
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:45,363
Don't try to make it a big deal.

623
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:48,464
Move straight away to how the problem

624
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:50,065
is gonna be fixed next time.

625
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:51,585
There's two reasons for that.

626
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:55,247
One is so that the problem will be fixed next time.

627
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,767
There's good intentions, please don't do it again,

628
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:58,568
often aren't enough.

629
00:28:58,608 --> 00:28:59,968
If they were, they probably wouldn't have made

630
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,908
the mistake to begin with.

631
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:06,450
The other is that you give somebody a way to save face

632
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,031
and channel their embarrassment or their annoyance

633
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:11,572
into fixing the problem.

634
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:13,533
Give them room to fix the problem.

635
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:15,459
Don't make a drama of it.

636
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,140
You very rarely need to make a drama.

637
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,824
Super important, when you fuck up,

638
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:27,306
and you will, tell your team.

639
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,748
There are three reasons for this.

640
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:33,410
Number one, they probably already know.

641
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:39,214
Number two, people respond very positively.

642
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,394
to leaders who admit their fuck-ups.

643
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,715
If you keep on admitting fuck-ups,

644
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,096
then you're probably incompetent and need to change jobs.

645
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,197
But if you do a good job, except when you don't,

646
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:52,618
people respect owning it.

647
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,559
The third, and by far the most important thing is,

648
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,200
psychological safety again and again comes up

649
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,181
as one of the things that makes teams work.

650
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,542
People need to be able to admit they fucked up.

651
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:07,003
If you, as the boss, find it embarrassing or difficult

652
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,464
to admit your own fuck-up,

653
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,506
it is gonna be twice as hard for your team

654
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,388
who aren't the boss and don't have higher firepower.

655
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:15,929
So if it's ever difficult for you,

656
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:17,030
it's more difficult for them.

657
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,710
Show the way.

658
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:22,494
So often this is fine.

659
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,395
Often everyone's on the same page.

660
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,997
Everybody wants to make a good game.

661
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:29,059
Sometimes people keep fucking up.

662
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,841
Here are some really practical pieces of advice

663
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,823
on how to deal with somebody who keeps fucking up.

664
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:37,185
Don't procrastinate.

665
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,801
If you lead the problem, it will just get worse.

666
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:44,502
As soon as you have, three is a good heuristic

667
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:46,082
for a number of things to bring,

668
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:48,143
three specific examples and then fuck you up.

669
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:51,004
And I mean specific, I don't mean I don't like your attitude

670
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:53,624
or I don't think your work is of a standard

671
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:55,185
that we think we should be doing.

672
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,145
Or I mean, this thing happened, this thing happened

673
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:59,226
and you said you wouldn't do that and you did.

674
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,326
As soon as you have three specific things,

675
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,707
sit down with them and talk about how you can make sure

676
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,868
things are going to be different in the future.

677
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:10,438
Come on with suggestions about how to change stuff,

678
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,299
but listen to theirs.

679
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,020
You never have the whole picture.

680
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:14,761
Maybe they didn't fuck up.

681
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:16,963
Maybe they did, but there were reasons for it

682
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:17,684
you're not aware of.

683
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:19,425
Maybe they have a better idea

684
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:20,566
of how to fix problems than you.

685
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:25,049
And make sure when they leave the meeting,

686
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,271
whatever steps you take to resolve it,

687
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,692
there is at least one thing they can focus on.

688
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,174
Indie studios are

689
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:37,809
places of complicated, intellectually demanding, absorbing work,

690
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,790
where people think about a lot of stuff all the time.

691
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,211
If you give them five things that they need to do in order to fix the problems,

692
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:45,332
they'll forget four of them before they're out of the room.

693
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:47,953
They'll forget the rest of them by the following morning.

694
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:50,755
Give them one thing they can focus on in between their other tasks,

695
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,836
so it makes it possible and practical.

696
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:59,178
You've got a team of five.

697
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:01,298
You're managing five people directly.

698
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,719
I think five people is about the number

699
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:03,639
you can manage directly.

700
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,080
You should be having a one-on-one with them every week,

701
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,881
and you should be spending probably half an hour.

702
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,422
That means two and a half hours a week.

703
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:14,382
It means 10 hours a month.

704
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:18,864
For an indie studio head, that is a lot of time.

705
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,544
If you're anything like me,

706
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,605
you can probably feel the creeping finger of panic

707
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,906
at the idea that you're spending 10 hours of time

708
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,626
away from doing the other things you need to do.

709
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,207
But look at the middle bullet point.

710
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:34,654
Remember your job as a studio head is to manage information flow above everything else,

711
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,018
and it's to make sure that everybody else works as effectively as they can.

712
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,222
You can focus on your own work being as effective as it can be,

713
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:46,586
or you can focus on five people's work being as effective as it can be.

714
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,348
The multiplier effect is much more powerful.

715
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,911
So one-on-ones take lots of time.

716
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:56,115
but they are a really valuable way to spend your time.

717
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:57,955
And here are two things about one-on-ones

718
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,156
that I think people often get wrong.

719
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:00,216
I've got them wrong in the past.

720
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,657
Don't think because you're sitting at the desk

721
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:07,638
next to somebody 40 hours of working week a week

722
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:09,598
that you don't need one-on-ones.

723
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:10,798
Let me say that without double negatives.

724
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:12,739
If you're sitting next to somebody 40 hours a week

725
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,160
talking to them all the time, you still need one-on-ones.

726
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,480
The kind of things they say to you when you're alone

727
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,381
and not in front of a team will be different.

728
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,069
there are things that you won't be comfortable

729
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:23,811
raising in public.

730
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,316
The kind of things they will say

731
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:29,103
when you ask them specifically to reflect on

732
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:31,483
What the problems are at the moment,

733
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:34,803
how the thing worked out last week you agreed to do,

734
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:37,744
are different from the kind of things they will think about

735
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,625
when they're sitting staring at a copy of Unity

736
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,065
trying to get the damn build to compile.

737
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:46,266
So give them space to think about what their block is,

738
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:47,046
what their problems are,

739
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,826
what the things in the studio you haven't noticed are,

740
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:51,747
what the relations with other people are,

741
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,167
what their concerns about the upcoming deadline are.

742
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,007
Give them time and space to tell you that.

743
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:57,528
Secondly,

744
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,632
Don't skip one-on-ones.

745
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:04,273
It's very easy to do.

746
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:05,634
You've got lots of stuff you need to do.

747
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:07,835
If you skip it, if you have to change it,

748
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,296
schedule it the next fucking day

749
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:10,336
or the next fucking afternoon.

750
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:12,617
Because if you skip a one-on-one,

751
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,759
you are saying to your report,

752
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:17,160
you are not my top priority.

753
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,722
And as a manager, your priority is your report.

754
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,503
You want to make sure they're as effective as possible.

755
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,076
Talking of which, mammal warmth.

756
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:29,979
One-on-ones are a really good way to build rapport.

757
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:31,840
I could have said rapport,

758
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,682
I really like the phrase mammal warmth

759
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,583
because it annoyed the hell out of my old co-founder.

760
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,205
But I like the greasy feel it gives.

761
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:46,092
If you're working in a team of less than two dozen people,

762
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,534
it's very hard to hide bad news.

763
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,241
And I've just spent several slides telling you

764
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:53,763
how important it is to share information

765
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:55,424
as effectively and constantly as possible.

766
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:56,945
If you try to hide it,

767
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,166
your left hand is hiding with your right.

768
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,228
And you probably won't succeed.

769
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:02,989
People who work in indie teams are smart.

770
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:04,990
People who work in game dev generally are smart.

771
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:08,053
It's an intellectually demanding job.

772
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:09,874
People will gossip.

773
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:12,075
People will find back channels to find information.

774
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:14,437
They'll either find out the bad news you're trying to hide

775
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,159
or they'll make up worse bad news.

776
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:18,880
And they won't trust you.

777
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,692
and when you have to give them actual bad news publicly,

778
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,514
they won't trust what you say about it.

779
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:27,356
So be as transparent as you can at all times.

780
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,278
I have a lot of other advice in this talk.

781
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,779
It's not just about doing the right thing,

782
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:31,700
although it is the right thing.

783
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,661
It's also about doing the pragmatically best,

784
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:34,702
most effective thing.

785
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:37,704
It takes a lot of effort to hide information in a small team.

786
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:39,726
Another.

787
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:44,600
pragmatically, another morally appropriate,

788
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,881
but also pragmatically useful thing is credit people by name.

789
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,143
Not every sentence you give every time you mention the game

790
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:53,764
recite the list of credits,

791
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:55,604
because that turns into an Oscar speech

792
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:56,545
every time you open your mouth.

793
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,446
But when somebody has done specific work,

794
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:00,487
when somebody is responsible

795
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,248
for a piece of really great art or UI work,

796
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:05,789
when somebody is responsible for keeping the backend stable,

797
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,169
and that's underappreciated,

798
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,390
because nobody ever looks at a really stable game

799
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,271
and goes, wow.

800
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:14,369
That's some great work as a player.

801
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,570
Mention people by name, be generous.

802
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,171
It costs you very, very little.

803
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,333
It's always tempting as a studio head to get egocentric.

804
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,814
And people really appreciate it when you don't.

805
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:30,037
So back to doing well by doing good.

806
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:33,859
Here are some ways to ensure

807
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,581
that your team feels well-treated and build rapport better.

808
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:41,263
This is an unglamorous one.

809
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:48,584
Every decision you make that affects how your team is going to interact,

810
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,545
how the business is going to work, get it in fucking writing.

811
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,806
And it doesn't have to be lawyered up.

812
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:56,066
Obviously, often you want legal contracts,

813
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:57,967
but if you just put something in an email

814
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,108
so everybody understands what's going on,

815
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:05,890
you're going to clear the ground for people having better relationships.

816
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,570
Some concrete examples.

817
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,071
Lots of teams get going.

818
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:10,451
They make a game.

819
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:10,991
People are...

820
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,780
coding together, they've got a prototype.

821
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,064
It's gonna be on Steam at some point,

822
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,246
and there's the indiepocalypse,

823
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,208
so we don't really know how much money there'll be in it,

824
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:23,993
and it's a bit vague, and we'll decide how, fuck that.

825
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:25,915
If somebody offered you a job,

826
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:28,018
and you said, how much does it pay?

827
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:28,719
And they said,

828
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:31,244
Oh, you know, we'll work that out later.

829
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:32,504
And you said, when do I get paid?

830
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,164
When's pay down?

831
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:35,985
They said, well, you know, it'll be at some point.

832
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,365
You shouldn't take the job

833
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:39,646
and you shouldn't make that arrangement

834
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,646
with other people as well.

835
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:44,987
Decide what the compensation is going to be

836
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,168
for working the project upfront with your team.

837
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:49,228
Be specific.

838
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,268
IP assignment.

839
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,255
You're all working on something,

840
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,057
people are doing little bits of writing,

841
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:58,319
somebody's done some art, it's all coming together.

842
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,021
The game might never be finished,

843
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:01,682
it might never be worth anything,

844
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,003
so you haven't talked about the IP

845
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:04,584
belongs to the company or the individuals.

846
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:05,805
Get it in writing.

847
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:08,367
Next week, somebody says,

848
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,589
I think this really should be science fantasy,

849
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:13,191
and somebody else says, no, we agreed it was film noir.

850
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:16,754
How do you decide who's right, who owns the IP?

851
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,656
One of you wants off the project.

852
00:38:20,077 --> 00:38:21,758
they still feel they have some sort of involvement with it

853
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:23,038
because they drew all that great art.

854
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:25,999
You need to know who owns the IP.

855
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,219
Even if you then do something generous,

856
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:29,719
you need to have a basis,

857
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,360
a firm basis to do something generous with.

858
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,761
Lots of indie teams have loose structures.

859
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,001
You'll get people who are core,

860
00:38:37,021 --> 00:38:38,921
you get people who are salaried employees,

861
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,102
you'll get people who are doing bits of freelancing,

862
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:44,543
you'll get people who have stock,

863
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,743
you'll get people who are sort of hanging around,

864
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:47,343
helping out.

865
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:54,714
If you go to GDC with a colleague who's a freelancer

866
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:56,335
and they want to give out business cards,

867
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:57,715
whose business cards are they handing out?

868
00:38:58,795 --> 00:38:59,976
Are they promoting your company

869
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:03,957
or are they promoting their own freelance work?

870
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:07,438
Both are perfectly reasonable approaches

871
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,599
but I've seen people fight over this

872
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,079
because their expectations are different.

873
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,859
You're at GDC, you're on my dime

874
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,360
so you should be handing out my business cards.

875
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,740
Well, you know, I need to make a living.

876
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:17,941
Make sure the relationship is clear.

877
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,061
This one's lethal.

878
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,122
We trust each other,

879
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:24,622
so why do we need to put things in writing?

880
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:27,443
If you are working with a trustworthy friend

881
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:28,263
you've known for years,

882
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:30,704
who does not and will not screw you over,

883
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:33,745
what happens when a close family member gets ill

884
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:35,605
and they need to leave town

885
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,126
and they can't work on the project anymore?

886
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:38,966
Maybe they do,

887
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,607
and maybe you come to a really generous arrangement

888
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,688
where they draw a salary

889
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,408
while they're off for six months,

890
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,449
or they keep their interest in the project.

891
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:54,149
But you need to have a firm basis to make that decision on.

892
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,750
Agree with them up front.

893
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,676
Things that proper companies do and don't do,

894
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:01,537
things that you might do.

895
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:03,158
People need to get paid.

896
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:11,340
There are a bunch of ways you can motivate people by paying them that aren't immediately

897
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:11,740
obvious.

898
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,740
The pink ones are the things I tried at Failbetter.

899
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,841
The lavender one, the attractive lavender one at the bottom left is the thing I wish

900
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:18,702
I had tried at Failbetter.

901
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:19,742
So I'll talk about that first.

902
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:25,724
I think in an indie studio people should know how much each other are paid.

903
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:28,545
I chicken out of doing this at Failbetter, I don't regret it.

904
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,952
It's hard to share this information.

905
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:34,034
People generally know if somebody is paid

906
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:35,875
what might seem to be over the odds,

907
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:37,656
whether it's because they're a founder,

908
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:40,298
or whether it's because they have an unusual skillset,

909
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:42,059
or whether it's because you had to pay them

910
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,801
to make them come on board more than you'd expect.

911
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,303
People want to know that.

912
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:49,544
If you get some sunlight on it,

913
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,566
at least people have a chance of understanding it.

914
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:55,088
Hiding information often breeds resentment.

915
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:58,871
Lots of projects have revenue share arrangements.

916
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,402
If you're running a studio, I kind of prefer

917
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:04,483
having a profit pool for the whole company,

918
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:07,144
to revenue share for projects, for a couple of reasons.

919
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:10,165
One is that if the company does badly,

920
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:11,226
it doesn't make much of a profit,

921
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:12,527
you can just withhold the profit pool.

922
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:15,628
But the other is that if you've got several projects

923
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:18,289
people are working on, one of them makes all the money

924
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,030
and one of them doesn't,

925
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,611
that could be resentment very quickly.

926
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,152
Everybody gains something from a

927
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:30,033
and the company doing well, everyone feels some participation in the business.

928
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:37,978
When you motivate somebody by paying them, giving them a salary rise is quite an inefficient

929
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:42,380
way to do it because they get a salary rise and the next month that's the salary they've

930
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,880
always had.

931
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:46,703
You have to keep on giving them salary rise in order to keep on increasing their motivation

932
00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:49,064
and that's usually not sustainable.

933
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,858
Profit pools are nice because they happen once a year,

934
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:55,341
because people get a burst of enthusiasm

935
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,123
for knowing that they have benefited from the work

936
00:41:57,163 --> 00:41:58,164
they did over the course of the year.

937
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:00,947
Minimum decent salary.

938
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,569
This is one of the things we did at Failbetter

939
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:03,770
that I believe they're still doing now,

940
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:05,391
which I'm quite proud of.

941
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:10,585
We decided a number that we needed to be able to pay people

942
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,205
for them to have a fair shot

943
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:13,946
at renting a reasonably nice place

944
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,126
and being able to cover transport

945
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,566
and not having to worry too much about money.

946
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,527
We never paid anybody less than that

947
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:20,047
once we'd established that policy,

948
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:21,567
however junior they were.

949
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:24,388
So that meant people understood

950
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:28,529
we had a basic commitment to our staff's wellbeing.

951
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:31,349
It meant that junior people at the start of their careers

952
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,550
were living in relatively comfortable circumstances.

953
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:39,518
And it meant that we could actually expect

954
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,680
a better quality of work from people

955
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,341
who didn't have to commute necessarily

956
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:44,922
for the very long periods of time

957
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:46,263
that you might need to live in London.

958
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:48,364
So you'll notice I put that at the right-hand end

959
00:42:48,384 --> 00:42:51,025
of the cost axis, because you can only do that

960
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,366
if you're a reasonably successful studio.

961
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:54,327
It's completely impractical for a start-out studio,

962
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,028
but think about it.

963
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:59,891
Talking of things that tend to be irrelevant to startups,

964
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:03,691
and very relevant to studios we've been going for a bit.

965
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:04,651
Think about benefits.

966
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:06,112
It's easy to think these are the things

967
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:07,413
proper companies do,

968
00:43:07,453 --> 00:43:09,675
but there are reasons people want this stuff.

969
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:11,536
Some companies, some countries,

970
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:12,517
it's more important than others.

971
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,219
Some countries are better social security than others.

972
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:18,581
Family friendliness is something that's very easy

973
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,123
not to think about when you are starting out,

974
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:22,404
especially if you have a young team,

975
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:24,805
and it becomes more and more important as the years go on.

976
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:26,086
Catch us up with you.

977
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:27,467
Sun and Sea wouldn't exist

978
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:28,848
if we hadn't been a family-friendly company.

979
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:30,669
I was having to pick my kid up at half past three.

980
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,030
and then work Saturdays.

981
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,071
It's also a concrete, tangible signal

982
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:38,171
where you can send you are interested

983
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,812
in gender parity on your team,

984
00:43:41,472 --> 00:43:42,652
because disproportionately,

985
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:44,212
although of course not exclusively,

986
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,733
maternity leave tends to be a point of tension in companies.

987
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,934
So it is if you are interested in diversity,

988
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:52,794
there's a tangible commitment you can make

989
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:55,295
to say that women are welcome on your team.

990
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:58,215
Right.

991
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,372
A topic I have strong feelings on.

992
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,699
This gentleman is Alexei Stakhanov.

993
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,788
Alexei mined coal in Soviet Russia in the 50s.

994
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:14,408
And on one occasion, he put a few hours extra in,

995
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:15,449
he worked really hard.

996
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,672
On a single shift, he mined 227 tons of coal.

997
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:20,033
Single-handedly person.

998
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,634
He didn't, of course he didn't.

999
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:23,356
He had a team of helpers.

1000
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:25,978
The thing was a propaganda operation

1001
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,022
to encourage people all across the country

1002
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:32,484
to break their backs, putting in extra time.

1003
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,047
This obviously has some similarities

1004
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:38,929
to labor practices persistently in...

1005
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:41,382
the software, in the games industry.

1006
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:43,584
Myth of the hero.

1007
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:45,845
And as I said at the beginning,

1008
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:48,186
all of us are subject to gravity.

1009
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,067
Just because you mean well,

1010
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,649
doesn't mean that you are immune to the allure of crunch

1011
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:56,690
and the dangers of staff burning out.

1012
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,411
So I'm really proud of this.

1013
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:00,793
This is a thing I posted in the Slack channel

1014
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:04,675
and fell back to when Sunless Sea was nearly done.

1015
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:07,554
People responded very well to it.

1016
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:10,536
The game launched on time and did well.

1017
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:15,780
But, this is the key point.

1018
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,321
I could give that speech because the hay was in the barn.

1019
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:21,724
Because the game was in a place to be released.

1020
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:24,125
If I decided the game actually needed

1021
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:26,247
eight more weeks' work in order to launch in two weeks,

1022
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:27,408
I couldn't have given that speech.

1023
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,472
20 years ago, somebody said this to me,

1024
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:34,152
I've never forgotten it.

1025
00:45:38,392 --> 00:45:40,793
The point at which you decide to crunch as a team

1026
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:44,174
is not two weeks from release when you say,

1027
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:47,116
well, can you put in a few hours extra at the weekend?

1028
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:53,239
It's when you don't build an accurate enough schedule

1029
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,300
or when you don't require your team

1030
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,461
to build an accurate enough schedule.

1031
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:06,425
And don't get me wrong, estimation is fucking hard.

1032
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,177
I've been making software for 20 years.

1033
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:10,898
I'm still not very good at estimating time.

1034
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,780
A couple of good talks yesterday

1035
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,381
about people having problems with estimation.

1036
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:16,863
It's difficult to do.

1037
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:19,105
I've got some tips about doing it.

1038
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:20,946
But first of all, I want to address this.

1039
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:22,928
It's a very tempting myth.

1040
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:24,830
You have to bleed into your keyboard

1041
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,432
or the magic phoenix of art won't arise.

1042
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:30,254
Nobody says this.

1043
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:35,678
Nobody says this.

1044
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,042
Buildings are late, but nobody pretends

1045
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:42,023
you can't schedule a building.

1046
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:44,107
And nobody thinks the Moscone Center

1047
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,709
is less complicated than the average game.

1048
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:51,198
I do not believe that the human body

1049
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,842
is less complicated than the average game.

1050
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:59,187
All these are complex, difficult fields of endeavor.

1051
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,688
All of them, people have to estimate for.

1052
00:47:01,948 --> 00:47:03,309
We can estimate for things.

1053
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,510
We can build better schedules.

1054
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,051
The fact that it's difficult should not dissuade us

1055
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,412
from trying because it's vital.

1056
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:10,353
And if you don't believe me, believe this man.

1057
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:11,473
Google it.

1058
00:47:11,493 --> 00:47:13,534
You may have seen this on Gamasutra a year or three ago.

1059
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:16,496
Money points there are.

1060
00:47:17,657 --> 00:47:20,198
Crunch generally makes things worse.

1061
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:23,320
Of course, if you manage to drag the game

1062
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,361
over the finish line, you'll feel you saved it.

1063
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:26,481
Maybe if you hadn't crunched.

1064
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:29,724
would have been a better game, it's very hard to say that.

1065
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:35,326
But again and again, Tuzor found that the 770 projects

1066
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:40,107
his team reviewed, ones where people had crunched did worse.

1067
00:47:41,268 --> 00:47:43,308
And crunch fucks people up.

1068
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:46,650
Look at this, health, productivity, relationships,

1069
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,310
morale, employee engagement,

1070
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,531
even increases the risk of alcohol abuse.

1071
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:52,272
So don't do that.

1072
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:55,153
The reason...

1073
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:57,884
There are lots of reasons, but the biggest reason

1074
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:00,945
that we are so bad as humans, as game developers,

1075
00:48:00,985 --> 00:48:03,225
as software developers, at estimating stuff,

1076
00:48:04,206 --> 00:48:07,487
is that estimation is something you tend to do

1077
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,567
at the beginning of a project or a sprint,

1078
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,328
and then you don't think about it again

1079
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,669
until you next estimate something,

1080
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,130
and you don't know whether or not

1081
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,330
the estimate was right the first time.

1082
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,430
So in terms of the iteration loop,

1083
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,731
in terms of improving your skills, it's very hard to do.

1084
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:23,932
So fix the loop.

1085
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:25,736
At the end of every sprint,

1086
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:27,777
are you assuming you're using some sort of agile methodology

1087
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:29,459
every month, some other time period if you're not.

1088
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:32,361
Look at the estimates you did in the previous sprint.

1089
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:35,443
See how accurate they were.

1090
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:39,506
Use that information to feed into your next set of estimates

1091
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:40,907
and make sure your team does the same.

1092
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,047
Nobody wants to.

1093
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:44,609
It's one of the least fun parts of game development,

1094
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:45,870
but it stops people crunching.

1095
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:46,911
It's like flossing.

1096
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:48,632
Nobody enjoys it.

1097
00:48:49,072 --> 00:48:50,614
Here are three ways to try to make people,

1098
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:52,575
including you, do it and do it a bit better.

1099
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:56,634
First thing, another pithy adage from Lottie,

1100
00:48:56,674 --> 00:48:58,416
which really struck home to me when I first heard it.

1101
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:00,759
You can be in the business or you can be on the business.

1102
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,521
It's very hard to be both at the same time.

1103
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:07,286
You want, ideally, somebody who is on the business,

1104
00:49:07,346 --> 00:49:08,267
looking at the big picture,

1105
00:49:08,307 --> 00:49:09,768
thinking about deadlines and estimates,

1106
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,252
and people who are in the creative and technical trenches.

1107
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,507
Ideally then you want a producer or a project manager

1108
00:49:16,627 --> 00:49:18,648
or somebody who's interested in the biz side.

1109
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:21,170
If you're in a small team, you can't always get that.

1110
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,010
That's life.

1111
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:25,012
In that case, put your producer hat on

1112
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:26,393
maybe one day a week.

1113
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:29,274
Stop thinking about when you're gonna add this feature

1114
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:30,695
and exactly how the code is gonna work.

1115
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:33,777
Pull back, look at the estimates, look at the deadlines.

1116
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:34,317
Don't put it off.

1117
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,932
Top down and bottom up, everyone's bad at estimating.

1118
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:41,636
I got better at estimating when I started thinking,

1119
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:46,141
top down, okay, this level will take three days.

1120
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:48,084
Other similar things have taken about three days.

1121
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:51,127
Bottom up, also, this level contains.

1122
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:55,289
these many assets, each of those takes that many hours,

1123
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,971
add 10% for this, add 15% for that.

1124
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:02,993
Okay, these are ballpark, same, let's meet in the middle.

1125
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:04,693
It's a really fudgy way of doing it,

1126
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,215
but it gives you a basic cross-sanity check.

1127
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:11,697
And any estimate is always better than no estimate,

1128
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,477
that's really important.

1129
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:15,318
The third thing is a dirty trick to use in your team,

1130
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,359
when they say, oh, I don't know,

1131
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:20,120
you know, how long does art take?

1132
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:24,561
And you say, OK, well, I put that on our Steam page.

1133
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:26,282
How long does that take?

1134
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,244
Release date, I don't know.

1135
00:50:29,264 --> 00:50:33,307
And at that point, they may, as they often do, but it's how

1136
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:35,389
I left fail better, say, fuck you, Kennedy, I know what

1137
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:35,789
you're doing.

1138
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,312
But often it's, fuck you, Kennedy, I know what you're

1139
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:41,854
doing, OK, it'll be five to 10 days, but

1140
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:42,834
don't hold me to that.

1141
00:50:43,495 --> 00:50:43,795
Brilliant.

1142
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,597
Five to 10 days, it's more information than you had two

1143
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:47,057
minutes ago.

1144
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:47,157
Also.

1145
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:52,298
Next time round, you say, last time you said five to 10 days.

1146
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:54,320
And they say, oh, yeah, actually, it was about six days.

1147
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,501
So it's a bit pessimistic.

1148
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:56,201
Maybe I can work with that.

1149
00:50:57,482 --> 00:51:00,484
Most important thing about schedules, this, 20%

1150
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,505
contingency.

1151
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,748
You put together a schedule.

1152
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:06,969
It's 100 days.

1153
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,552
You've only got budget for 90 days worth of work.

1154
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:13,294
You need 20% contingency, because people say that's a

1155
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:14,075
good heuristic.

1156
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:16,636
Broadly speaking, you can expect that kind of overrun.

1157
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,142
So you put in 5% contingency, 105 is closer to 90.

1158
00:51:21,202 --> 00:51:25,264
Remember deadlines, remember deadlines are sharks or lions.

1159
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:28,845
Contingency is time you put in a project

1160
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:31,546
for the stuff that will go wrong that you don't expect.

1161
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:32,927
And you can't know it to be 20%,

1162
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:36,148
but after two decades of making software

1163
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,608
and having talked to a bunch of other people

1164
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:40,009
who do the same, 20% is the, broadly speaking,

1165
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:42,910
the number that keeps coming up for this kind of thing.

1166
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:44,331
Not.

1167
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:47,572
Yeah, some of you's recognizing some of this stuff.

1168
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:51,335
Not you're a bit slow, or you're a bit lazy,

1169
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:52,496
or you could have worked harder,

1170
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,377
but shit happens that you cannot predict.

1171
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:55,618
It doesn't snow in England.

1172
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,480
It snowed in England over Christmas,

1173
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,361
and I lost two days because I had to look after my kid

1174
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:04,384
for two days out of a 10-day spring.

1175
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:05,105
20% contingency.

1176
00:52:05,945 --> 00:52:08,287
The only chart in this, I'm very proud of this.

1177
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:09,848
This is headcount at Fowl Basset

1178
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:10,749
during the time I was there.

1179
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,291
Only one person ever resigned

1180
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:15,012
because they...

1181
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:20,333
Actually, their spouse got a dream job in the US there to move away.

1182
00:52:21,674 --> 00:52:26,118
We lost three people in 2012 because the company was six weeks away from not making payroll

1183
00:52:26,138 --> 00:52:27,039
and had to lay people off.

1184
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,301
Some things about that.

1185
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:34,046
You want to retain people if you possibly can because the longer they're with the company,

1186
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:35,447
the more valuable they are.

1187
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:36,929
You treat people decently.

1188
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,711
This is the doing well by doing good thing, right?

1189
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,939
If you build a human studio, people are more likely to stay.

1190
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,800
And every time an employee of two years or three years

1191
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,700
or five years standing walks out of the studio,

1192
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,841
they have a head full of detailed information

1193
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,501
and knowledge about the processes,

1194
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:53,162
relationships they've built with other people,

1195
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:55,743
understanding of how the team works, all this stuff.

1196
00:52:55,763 --> 00:52:56,463
You want to keep that.

1197
00:52:56,563 --> 00:52:57,963
People get more valuable as they go on.

1198
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,404
People will eventually move on,

1199
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:00,724
and you need to bring in fresh blood,

1200
00:53:01,184 --> 00:53:02,344
but keep people as long as you can.

1201
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:06,946
And if people know that you're keeping them a priority,

1202
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:08,366
then they will trust you more.

1203
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:14,297
Sometimes, shit goes wrong and you run out of money.

1204
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:17,518
Here is some basic advice for the day

1205
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,199
that's a studio head you will probably

1206
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:20,199
have to face at some point.

1207
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,240
Get it done quickly.

1208
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,861
Do not leave people lingering.

1209
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:27,442
Give them an answer as soon as you can

1210
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:28,503
and get it over with.

1211
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:32,024
Think about how not to have

1212
00:53:32,994 --> 00:53:37,977
a colleague walking past a desk full of other colleagues,

1213
00:53:38,397 --> 00:53:39,738
island table full of other colleagues,

1214
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:42,020
carrying a cardboard box and weeping.

1215
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,761
If you have to send people to lunch early,

1216
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:47,183
or you have to meet with somebody early in the morning

1217
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:49,585
so you avoid the humiliation of the last day

1218
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:53,247
people will remember your team, find ways to do that.

1219
00:53:54,823 --> 00:53:56,744
Never say this, it's not true.

1220
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,625
If you are letting somebody go,

1221
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:00,105
you still have a job and they don't.

1222
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:06,047
And if you tell them that it's hurting you more than them,

1223
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:07,988
they won't react well and they shouldn't react well.

1224
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:12,409
And really important, when you are interacting

1225
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:14,390
with the people in your team who may become friends,

1226
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,531
who may invite to your house,

1227
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,791
whose shoulder you may cry on

1228
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:20,092
and who may cry on your shoulder,

1229
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:23,753
always remember that you may have to have

1230
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:24,653
this conversation with them.

1231
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:31,928
So I ran Failbetter for seven years,

1232
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:33,909
and it was my dream job for a lot of that time.

1233
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:36,832
And towards the end of that time,

1234
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:42,416
I became aware gradually that I wasn't having fun anymore.

1235
00:54:46,379 --> 00:54:49,582
I had lost track of why I was doing what I was doing.

1236
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:51,883
I was spending less and less time doing hands-on work,

1237
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,766
more and more time doing managing managers.

1238
00:54:58,368 --> 00:54:59,449
And the thing about Metal Pedigree...

1239
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,662
The thing about chronic human fatigue is it builds up over time.

1240
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:04,043
I'd be running the studio for seven years,

1241
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:05,584
so it'd be very tough times indeed.

1242
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:09,466
And I gradually started to realise I wasn't enjoying it,

1243
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:12,728
and then I quite suddenly realised I wasn't enjoying it at all.

1244
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,410
So I decided really quite suddenly to leave.

1245
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,032
It took me a week of thinking and soul-searching,

1246
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:20,713
having serious conversations, and then I wanted out.

1247
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:24,014
because I wanted to do something

1248
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,415
with very little responsibility

1249
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:27,816
during the roaming year I mentioned at the beginning,

1250
00:55:27,977 --> 00:55:29,357
working for larger studios.

1251
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:34,061
And I wanted to do smaller projects

1252
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,041
I was more hands-on with again.

1253
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:36,582
We had a problem.

1254
00:55:38,163 --> 00:55:39,824
And this is one of these problems that's theoretical

1255
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,866
and sounds like a great problem to have until it happens.

1256
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:43,347
I wanted to walk away.

1257
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:45,288
I owned most of the studio.

1258
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,030
There wasn't enough money in the studio to buy me out.

1259
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:51,284
We did have a couple of preliminary conversations

1260
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:53,545
about selling the studio, but nobody wanted to be sold.

1261
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:56,445
So what did we do?

1262
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:58,826
Fuck it.

1263
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:02,967
Boo fucking hoo, I only get 360K pounds.

1264
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:04,727
It's still more money than I expect to see in my life,

1265
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:05,227
honestly.

1266
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:07,948
I left a lot of money on the table

1267
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:10,128
so that the company could continue to exist

1268
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:11,328
without going bankrupt.

1269
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,569
Because priorities.

1270
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:18,477
Because you decide at the beginning,

1271
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:20,358
whether you're in this to make a lot of money,

1272
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,260
or whether you're in this to build a human studio,

1273
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,581
you decide which is safety,

1274
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:25,922
fun and profit is most important.

1275
00:56:25,942 --> 00:56:27,664
And I think this is true.

1276
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,785
And this may be relevant to you someday.

1277
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:32,528
The fact that you've been in the studio from the start

1278
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,869
doesn't mean that you are all there is to the studio.

1279
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:37,471
Quick advice.

1280
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,820
Plan for it, get a shareholder's agreement

1281
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,481
or whatever the equivalent is in your country,

1282
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:45,302
just in case you need to leave.

1283
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,724
Don't make the mistake I made as a typical founder mistake

1284
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,065
of acquiring jobs over time,

1285
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,307
accruing things I didn't quite trust to give away,

1286
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:54,507
so the fatigue built up.

1287
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:57,429
Keep your email addresses for your company

1288
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:58,449
and your home address separate.

1289
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:00,350
I nearly didn't come to the US to do this tour

1290
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:02,031
because my ESTA, E-S-T-A,

1291
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:06,867
Reminder, went to my old Failbetter address,

1292
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:07,747
my personal address.

1293
00:57:08,627 --> 00:57:11,528
And my ex-wife still gets mail addressed to Failbetter,

1294
00:57:12,408 --> 00:57:13,869
which annoys her to this day.

1295
00:57:14,409 --> 00:57:15,189
So keep it separate,

1296
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:16,230
even if you're convinced you're gonna stay

1297
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,630
with the company forever, it's just good sense.

1298
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,411
And do think of it like a divorce.

1299
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:22,012
It's gonna be weird when you walk away,

1300
00:57:22,752 --> 00:57:24,152
even if you do it in amicable terms.

1301
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:28,614
Always, always keep track of this.

1302
00:57:29,874 --> 00:57:31,595
Why you are in it, what it's for.

1303
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:40,747
Illustrative statistic about probably the number of things

1304
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:43,009
you'll want to do on any given day or any given week

1305
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:44,390
running in any studio.

1306
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:49,693
Illustrative statistic about the number of things

1307
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:50,614
you will actually get to do.

1308
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:58,419
Time or resources or energy.

1309
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,060
100 minus five.

1310
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:02,262
So you are going to have to reject

1311
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,200
most of the things you want to do.

1312
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:08,361
And either you can let that happen by accident,

1313
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:09,482
you can just let it fall on the floor,

1314
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:13,823
or you can decide which things to drop.

1315
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:17,105
So decide which things you focus on,

1316
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,205
make that a conscious decision,

1317
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,746
know you cannot do everything, and fix on it.

1318
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,627
And here, if you remember nothing else in this talk,

1319
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,208
are the five things I think are most important.

1320
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:27,424
Have a fucking budget.

1321
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:28,725
If you already have one, great.

1322
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,665
If you think you'll get around to one,

1323
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:32,206
do it before you write another line of code.

1324
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:35,308
Never forget why you are running a studio.

1325
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:40,170
Making games for a living is the how, it's not the why.

1326
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,491
If you fuck up, own it now.

1327
00:58:44,532 --> 00:58:45,772
Put everything in writing,

1328
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:50,455
and not 10% contingency, 20 fucking percent.

1329
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:51,595
And that's it.

1330
00:58:52,476 --> 00:58:53,076
Subliminal message.

1331
00:59:02,735 --> 00:59:04,376
We probably have time for one or two questions.

1332
00:59:04,396 --> 00:59:06,397
If you'd like to ask Alexis a question, please come to the

1333
00:59:06,437 --> 00:59:07,457
mic in the middle there.

1334
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,099
And I have one myself.

1335
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:14,060
So on your list of new priorities, it's the hands-on

1336
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,042
auteur kind of thing for your new studio.

1337
00:59:17,462 --> 00:59:19,683
Does that mean you're trying to hand off more of the studio

1338
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:22,244
head kind of things to other people in the team so that you

1339
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:25,245
can do more of the direct design, direct hands-on work?

1340
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:31,829
So right now, what I'm doing is the team is on this stage and in the front row.

1341
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,610
There's two full timers and half a dozen freelancers.

1342
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:41,674
So we're working more with freelancers, which keeps the studio small

1343
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:44,256
and it means that there's less management involved.

1344
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:45,156
In the longer term...

1345
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:52,042
I will want to grow. And I think, yes, one of the mistakes I made at Failbetter was not

1346
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:55,925
handing it off enough. It was a little bit of a benevolent autocracy. And I think that

1347
00:59:56,005 --> 01:00:00,448
what I said about giving people responsibility also applies to management responsibility.

1348
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:06,514
You mentioned one-on-ones being a really important thing,

1349
01:00:07,535 --> 01:00:09,096
sitting down and taking time with people.

1350
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:13,379
Can you give me an example, one or two examples of questions

1351
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:16,161
or topics that you brought up that you felt...

1352
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:17,482
Yes, so there's two things you should do.

1353
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:21,545
And this will basically get you three questions, really.

1354
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:22,645
One is, how's things?

1355
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:25,948
But the two questions to ask people are,

1356
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:28,449
what problems do you have right now?

1357
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,361
because everybody has problems and everybody,

1358
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:32,181
if they don't have problems,

1359
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:33,401
they'll invent them and they want to talk about them.

1360
01:00:33,942 --> 01:00:35,242
So ask people what problems they have,

1361
01:00:35,282 --> 01:00:36,362
what's stopping them doing their job.

1362
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:40,563
And ask them, the problems we talked about last week

1363
01:00:40,843 --> 01:00:42,564
that we agreed these things to fix,

1364
01:00:42,824 --> 01:00:43,924
how did that work out?

1365
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:46,385
Because it's very easy to forget doing that.

1366
01:00:46,405 --> 01:00:47,825
It's very easy not to plan for one-on-ones

1367
01:00:47,865 --> 01:00:49,766
and just kind of say, how's things,

1368
01:00:49,786 --> 01:00:50,706
what are the problems?

1369
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,287
And then people feel like they mention

1370
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:53,507
the same problems week to week

1371
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:54,827
and you don't address them.

1372
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:56,468
So specifically address the things

1373
01:00:56,508 --> 01:00:57,348
you raised the previous week.

1374
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:58,288
Okay, thank you.

1375
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:10,140
I had a question about fucking up. You talked a lot about the idea of being comfortable saying

1376
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:16,783
when you fucked up. But on the flip side of being comfortable being able to tell somebody

1377
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:21,505
like, you know, you fucked up, don't do it again kind of thing. My experience shows that

1378
01:01:22,825 --> 01:01:25,426
fucking up is never black and white. And there's a lot of...

1379
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,891
grey areas where somebody doesn't think that they fucked up, but you think that they fucked up,

1380
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:33,876
and that kind of, that whole realm of grey areas. Just curious about your thoughts on that.

1381
01:01:34,737 --> 01:01:36,619
My thoughts are it's a whole other talk, honestly.

1382
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:42,907
I was aware that there were simplifications, I did that slide when I was rehearsing it, I was very conscious of it.

1383
01:01:43,207 --> 01:01:43,648
But it's...

1384
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:49,657
The key point, I think, is that you have to be open about this stuff.

1385
01:01:50,718 --> 01:01:52,861
It is the most important bit, but you're absolutely right.

1386
01:01:53,621 --> 01:01:55,423
You may be wrong when you think somebody's fucked up.

1387
01:01:56,765 --> 01:01:58,707
You both may be going in a different direction.

1388
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:00,709
You may not have the whole picture, all this sort of stuff.

1389
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:05,234
And, yeah, a whole other talk.

1390
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,795
I don't have anything useful to say over the next two minutes.

1391
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:09,546
I think being open, I think that is.

1392
01:02:09,566 --> 01:02:10,847
Yeah, I think that's it really is.

1393
01:02:11,267 --> 01:02:14,430
People have to be able to talk about this stuff.

1394
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,171
And the moment.

1395
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:19,317
The moment anybody feels criticism is shut down,

1396
01:02:19,797 --> 01:02:21,938
the moment anybody feels that it's not possible

1397
01:02:21,978 --> 01:02:23,539
to point out things being wrong,

1398
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:25,981
that's when the studio starts to rock from the feet up.

1399
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:27,061
Okay, thanks.

1400
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:28,862
Okay, that's gonna be our last question.

1401
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:29,463
Okay.

1402
01:02:29,603 --> 01:02:31,464
Sorry, if you have further questions for Alexis,

1403
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:32,384
please come up to the front,

1404
01:02:32,484 --> 01:02:34,386
and if we need to, we can take it to a wrap-up room.

1405
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:37,127
And make sure that you fill out your email surveys

1406
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:38,928
to give Alexis feedback on his talk,

1407
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:40,990
but before we go, let's give him one last round of applause.
