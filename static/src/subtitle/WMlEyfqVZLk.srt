1
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:08,513
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,055
My name is Robert Coddington.

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:12,937
I'm a senior animation director at Insomniac Games.

4
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:23,265
And the title of this, named by Lindsay, is Thwips and Hugs, and it's very appropriate because those are two things that happen quite a bit when you work with us.

5
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,248
But yeah, I'm an animation director.

6
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:28,309
I'm not the only one.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,311
Or, no, that's just more me.

8
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:39,130
There's another animation director, and I'm going to talk a little bit about the structure that we set things up, and you'll see why in a second.

9
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,513
So Danny can't be here today, but he should be.

10
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,273
He should be right there.

11
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:51,500
So the way our animation team runs is broken into very specific pods.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,526
Each one of these pods will run for pretty much the duration of the product, having anywhere from three to five people per strong leader.

13
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:09,251
So then that would be Traversal, Combat, Boss Encounters, Missions, Living World, and then Story Cinematics.

14
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:13,013
That's a really big team, so it's kind of two pods, even though I only made one icon here.

15
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,634
Just go with me on that, it's cool.

16
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:21,057
So yeah, like I said, in each one of those pods, you'll see that there is a very strong leader and a group that they work with.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,561
And then today, I wish I could bring all of them here today.

18
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,262
That would be the perfect thing in my mind.

19
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,383
But we have four of them.

20
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:34,105
So Stephen Camardelle, James Hamm, Lindsay Thompson, and Bradley McLaughlin.

21
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:46,272
And they're going to tell you a little bit about what their life is like as an animator and as an animation lead or associate director at Insomniac Games in front of these pots.

22
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:48,273
And the first one up is Lindsay Thompson.

23
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:03,635
Hi, my name is Lindsay Thompson, and I'm an associate animation director at Insomniac Games for almost 11 years now.

24
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,236
Well, not in that role, but yes, I've been there 11 years.

25
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:11,338
And my focus on Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was our main story cinematics.

26
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:19,222
One aspect of that included the logistics behind bringing accurate representation of deaf characters and ASL to the game.

27
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:49,885
These cinematic shoots that we did and the construction of the scenes worked a bit differently than our typical Cine's So some of our key pillars for doing ASL work was we had ASL consultants and interpreters We had deaf actors and body doubles on the mocap stage a different and more extensive animation polish work Pipeline and then we also had playable Haley who is our deaf character in spider-man

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,601
So, our ASL consultants and interpreters.

29
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:58,764
Josh and Jules were our consultants from Hypernova.

30
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:04,208
They're both deaf and work in entertainment to advocate, educate, and consult on ASL.

31
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:10,993
They were there for any of our questions regarding deaf culture, consulted on the scripts, and how to interpret them into ASL.

32
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:21,802
And they worked with us on stage to make sure performances were clear, and then worked with us to go over every scene and shot that had ASL in it, and make sure that our signs were correct and clear.

33
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:29,026
So for each hearing cast member, we hired a deaf body double.

34
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:34,028
We made sure we hired diverse, role-accurate actors to double as our main cast.

35
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,648
Here you can see some of our deaf performers.

36
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:40,970
To the left, there's Justin Folk is in the foreground there.

37
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,410
He's Miles' double.

38
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:48,432
John Kim, in front of him in the middle, is for our Genki double.

39
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:52,293
And of course, we have Natasha Ofili, who plays herself as Haley.

40
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,082
Our main cast, Najee Jeter and Griffin Pateau, are to the right.

41
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:07,167
So we had to figure out the best way to shoot our hearing cast's spoken performances, along with our deaf body doubles that would work best for Natasha to play against.

42
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:16,392
So for this, we ran them side by side so Natasha had signing people to play off of, but could still see Najee and Griffin doing their speaking performance.

43
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:27,593
Each deaf cast member had their own interpreter so we could all communicate on set, and we also had the hypernovas on stage to help interpret the scripts with the cast and plan out the signing performance.

44
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:31,796
We ultimately determined that it really depended on each scene.

45
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:46,987
Sometimes it made sense to have all of our deaf cast standing and playing against each other like you see here, but other times it was more important to have Natasha face-to-face with Najee, while his body double Justin would sign next to or in front of him, so Najee could match his performance.

46
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,515
So in some cases, our cast were even able to sign themselves on stage.

47
00:04:56,356 --> 00:05:04,584
Seeing as they were playing a more inexperienced signer, it was authentic for them not to be signing as fluently as a deaf person would.

48
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,928
We had to consider each character's experience and knowledge with ASL.

49
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:13,989
So Genki, Miles's best friend, is working very hard to learn.

50
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,735
Miles is probably the most comfortable and experienced in speaking with Haley.

51
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:24,541
Rio, Miles's mom, is clearly just beginning to learn as Miles has just started dating Haley.

52
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,462
Spoilers!

53
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:30,888
So we made sure her double didn't sign as fluently and experienced.

54
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,053
So for example, at the end, this is a spoiler, sorry if you haven't played the game.

55
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:47,122
At the end when Albert Moon says, nice to meet you in ASL, we approached it as though he had literally watched a YouTube video before coming over and saying something to her.

56
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:55,389
So our interpreter was like, well, that maybe wasn't quite it, but that looks like somebody who's just trying to say a nice phrase to somebody.

57
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,512
So yeah, it was really cool.

58
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:13,311
Okay, so here, so in some instances, our main cast like Najee and Griffin were able to perform their own signs, but for more longer and more complex conversations, we relied on our deaf performers to make sure everything was accurate.

59
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:19,513
So you can see we had cameras shooting from all angles on stage, which became important for animators during polish work.

60
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:23,895
Here we have Najee capturing the emotional performance with Natasha.

61
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,299
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

62
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:28,599
Yes.

63
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,881
We wanted them to connect.

64
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:37,727
So behind Najee, you can see her interpreter is actually signing out to Natasha with Najee speaking.

65
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:43,952
And Najee is facing his double Justin so that his voice can match the cadence of the signing.

66
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:51,337
It took us a minute to find the most elegant solution for everybody's comprehension and the best performance.

67
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,640
And you can also see our consultant in pink

68
00:06:55,243 --> 00:07:00,347
behind Najee, making sure the signs were clear coming from Natasha and Justin.

69
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:05,611
You may also notice that normally mocap gloves don't have as many markers on them.

70
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:11,576
It's harder to capture intricate finger movement most of the time, and we often keyframe our fingers after the fact.

71
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:18,542
But for our ASL scenes, we added extra markers to our signing actors so that we would start off with a better, more accurate data.

72
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:24,010
So once we shoot the data for our scenes, we then move on to layout.

73
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,772
Our animators do everything.

74
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,155
They do cameras, layout, polish, key framework.

75
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,296
We are a department full of directors.

76
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:42,986
So this scene I personally took on myself, so I was able to direct it on stage, bring the data into Maya and set up the cameras, do the layout and edit, and I actually polished it myself.

77
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:47,089
So combining the two performances, this was our final result.

78
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,392
In this particular scene, we layered Justin's arm and hand movement,

79
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,875
onto Najee's body and face performance.

80
00:07:54,676 --> 00:08:04,585
So after laying it out and getting data combined, we finally worked with the hypernovas to go over this performance in video footage so that we can get clarifications on any signs that may be confusing.

81
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:12,911
We would often go through it sign by sign, and there were many times our animators had to go into the performances and add or remove signs after the fact to make it clearer.

82
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:18,136
This one was really wordy, so at times I had to hold the signs for an extra frame or two,

83
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,284
to make sure that they really stuck and that you could read them, but without feeling too staccato.

84
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:32,871
And as much as the additional markers helped on stage, I would say that we definitely had to touch or improve nearly every sign in the game, particularly when there was quick finger spelling.

85
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,686
Finally, just a quick touch on our playable Hayley mission.

86
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:42,008
Our designers and writers put together a truly unique experience as a deaf character.

87
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:50,153
From the audio design, to the emotes, to the text conversation, they found unique ways to interpret emotions and a story without a voice.

88
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:57,557
And bonus points, there's a cat on this mission, so it was really awesome and it's one of my favorite missions in the game.

89
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:58,037
Look at it!

90
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:02,163
So thank you so much.

91
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:08,306
I'm going to hand over to Bradley next to talk about it some more.

92
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:12,867
Thank you, Lindsay.

93
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,208
Hello, I am Bradley McLaughlin.

94
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,910
I was an associate animation director on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, doing cinematics along with Lindsay.

95
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:29,533
Today, I am going to be talking about our process of shooting performance capture on Spider-Man 2, but more specifically, the benefits of having our main cast

96
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,067
and stunt actors mirror each other on stage.

97
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:35,708
Why does it matter?

98
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:43,630
Keeping the timing and voice acting perfectly in tune with the body performances is a crucial aspect of putting a cinematic together.

99
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,331
How does it work?

100
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:52,032
Running stunt actors alongside our main cast keeps the performances synced and makes them feel more grounded and authentic.

101
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:58,094
Here's an example of our stunt actor Seth Austin mirroring our Spider-Man

102
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,144
slash Peter Parker actor Yuri Lowenthal.

103
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:04,926
Thanks, Tao.

104
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:07,548
Miles!

105
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,950
I've been calling you.

106
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:12,592
For hours.

107
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:13,652
Nothing.

108
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,655
You know Miles has been hunting Lee.

109
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:17,235
I'll find him.

110
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,057
I'm calling the hospital.

111
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,798
I said I'd find him!

112
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,320
I've got this under control.

113
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,443
All Miles talks about is how to be a better Spider-Man.

114
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,101
So, the challenges of shooting superhero performance capture.

115
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:56,106
Superhero actions frequently exceed the physical limits of our main cast, but we still need to synchronize all performances.

116
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,107
Running two performances

117
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:06,081
Two performers together introduces a greater physicality provided by our stun actors and allows subtle performances provided by our main cast.

118
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:13,526
The best part is everything is synced, making it easy to swap out the performance and keeping the timing of our video edit.

119
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:40,086
and here it is in game.

120
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,588
This also leads to another advantage.

121
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,409
Animators get to choose from multiple performances.

122
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,451
Sometimes an animator might want to choose from the options I mentioned in the last slide.

123
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:03,064
You might want the physicality of the stunt actor gives you, or sometimes you might really like the subtleties and performance of the main cast.

124
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:10,950
Another benefit is we can shoot more scenes throughout the day, not having to break up the stunt and main cast performances.

125
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,013
Here is an example where we ran, sorry, just one second.

126
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:17,034
Yeah, there we go.

127
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:24,479
Here's an example where we ran the stunt actors doing fighting choreography, then had our Craven actor, Jim Peary,

128
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:31,119
do a head slam followed by the Sun actors doing a more fiscal take of the head slam.

129
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:58,777
So as stated before, running stunt and voice actor gathers creates a seamless performance that is easier to edit.

130
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,517
And what makes this possible is collaboration.

131
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:11,640
When the stunt and main cast actors collaborate, it helps each of them become even more invested in the performance and creates a more grounded and authentic character.

132
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,421
The collaboration on set is truly amazing.

133
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,262
It's really the best part of working this way.

134
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,341
The collaboration on set is, again, it's amazing.

135
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:28,302
And it really feels like we're all moving as one unit when it's time to roll.

136
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:34,163
So shooting this way can bring up some challenges.

137
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,744
One of the main ones being audio interference.

138
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:39,144
There are several ways we can work around this.

139
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:47,006
We can implement wild takes, which are real-time playback of the stunt performances that the main cast can do voiceover on the stage.

140
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:50,667
We also can just shoot ADR in the booth if needed.

141
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,635
And we can offset the performances between stunt and main cast while still getting everything in one take.

142
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:01,157
And here's an example of that, of offsetting performances.

143
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:03,478
So we're going to have the stunt actors go first.

144
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:06,699
Then we're going to have the main cast go.

145
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,640
And we'll capture their audio-facial performance and their body performance.

146
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,822
So I'm going to show a version of it on stage and then what it looked like in game.

147
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:31,647
And here's what it ended up looking like in game.

148
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:10,515
All right, that's it for me.

149
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:14,357
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.

150
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:15,998
Up next is Steven Camardella.

151
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,362
Thank you, Bradley.

152
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:25,403
Hello.

153
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:29,605
My name is Steven Camardella, and I'm an associate animation director at Insomniac Games.

154
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:43,484
I was in charge of leading our boss pod during Spider-Man 2's development, and I wanted to give you a quick behind-the-scenes look at one of our more complicated boss encounters, our giant Sandman, during the opening sequence of the game.

155
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,566
So fittingly, with a big enemy come bigger challenges.

156
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:54,779
We'll start off from the very beginning with a glimpse into some very early exploration tests we did with our giant Sandman.

157
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:05,064
This video shows some really early gameplay and cinematic spectacle moments, as well as a quick gameplay test we did with our giant Sandman moving around in the city and what it would feel like to swing around him.

158
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:14,975
Shortly after we knew Sandman would be in Spider-Man 2, which was very early in production, we quickly knew we wanted Sandman to be absolutely massive in our Spider-Man 2 encounter.

159
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:19,279
Obviously, this would bring with it some technical challenges we'd have to find solutions for.

160
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,883
We knew that Sandman was going to be heavy, and fittingly slow.

161
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:31,497
Once development and animation started, we arrived at about a 20% to 25% speed decrease from the captured data to give us a good starting point for his movement.

162
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,419
We tweaked the speed on a case-by-case basis, though.

163
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:50,306
Attacks, for example, were given an exceptionally long tell window that were slower than most of his typical movement throughout the rest of the mission, but gave us the breathing room to provide that adequate speed during the attack portion while still maintaining the weight that we needed for him during the rest of the mission.

164
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:54,874
Once we knew it would be our opening mission, though, it brought with it some additional challenges.

165
00:16:55,415 --> 00:17:01,859
We knew the experience needed to feel unique, but the controls needed to be familiar to old players and teachable to new players.

166
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,684
That also meant that the player would have limited abilities at their disposal, so we needed to make this encounter work with basic abilities and combat.

167
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:17,277
With that ever-important wait and slow speed that we were trying to hold on to, we quickly ran into a pretty big design pickle.

168
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:24,219
Our heroes, even at their slowest speed from a brand new game, could literally swing circles around Sandman and be virtually untouchable.

169
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:31,180
After some attack tests of grabs and jabs, we knew large, sweeping attacks that covered huge areas would provide real threats to the player.

170
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:37,002
But we still had to get a little bit more technical help from our amazing programming team.

171
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:46,163
Even with the massive sweeps that Sandman was covering, the player could still easily swing to safety without much thought or even by accident.

172
00:17:46,784 --> 00:18:02,457
To make Sandman's attacks pinpoint accurate, our programming team and animation collaborated on using a technique we call focus tracking to slightly aim Sandman's shoulder and ultimately his weapon arm at the player by subtly manipulating his spine and clavicle during gameplay that was overlaid over our animation.

173
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:10,766
I like to call this reversed synced aiming, since we normally sync the player to the enemy during synced moves.

174
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:19,273
But in this particular case, we have Sandman focus on, or aim at, the player's sync joint, and then capture the position once the attack portion of the animation starts.

175
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:26,960
If the player dodges, the player's sync joint, which is Sandman's current target, would remain fixed in space until the dodge performance is complete.

176
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:36,834
This allowed our Spider-Man to barely and consistently skim over the weapon without colliding and giving them the dexterity only a superhero could have.

177
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:43,416
So here in this video, what you can see is one of Sandman's main attacks, which is the arm sweep.

178
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,937
And you can see a debug view of this arm sweep attack.

179
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:52,383
The pink arc that you see is the damage collision moving through the sweep range.

180
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:58,465
And the focus target that's labeled on miles and the end of that white line is Sandman's intended target.

181
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:05,567
As you can see on the dodge, the white line pointing to the intended target remains stationary on player input and throughout the performance of the dodge.

182
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:12,809
All throughout the attack, dodged or not, Sandman's spine and shoulder are being subtly manipulated to ensure accuracy to the given target.

183
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,750
The other end of the white line,

184
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:22,942
that's pointing at the focus target is at the start of Sandman's manipulated joint chain, which you may be able to see is about mid-spine on Sandman.

185
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:32,091
What this tells us is that everything from the mid-spine up to the clavicle is being subtly adjusted to make sure that that weapon arm ends exactly on that sink point.

186
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:37,757
This gives you a general idea of how we handled most of the attacks during the Sandman fight.

187
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:47,573
Now that we knew the player could get hit accurately and consistently, we needed to ensure that the hero's reactions matched the intensity and presence of our Sandman.

188
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:56,735
With Sandman being so large, we had to ensure the resulting performance from a hit felt just as large and visceral to really make the player feel like there were consequences to their actions.

189
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:02,076
To do this, animation and programming, again, closely collaborated to employ what we called super knockbacks.

190
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:06,617
These would launch the player far and away from Sandman with a quick recovery to keep the player in the fight.

191
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:10,018
This video shows a couple of variations of our super knockbacks.

192
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,917
These were intended to take into consideration the surrounding environment when Sandman landed a hit.

193
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:24,799
These knockbacks would target markup placed in the environment to steer the player while flying back after a hit, either into a building or a free space.

194
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:35,026
If the player was within the target cone of the markup, the player was then steered towards the target, and animation would cover up the majority of the visual oddities from any steering that we were doing through clever camera movement.

195
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:41,991
This video here is an example of a building super knockback that has our debug markup visible to help visualize the system and how it works.

196
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:48,959
The small blue and green squares dispersed across the area are our target markup, green for building and blue for open space.

197
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,862
The large red cone that we have highlighted is the target cone and the intended target.

198
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:58,044
Each markup target has its own targeting cone.

199
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:07,229
The large blue cone is a representation of the hit direction and where the player would be expected to go, or the acceptable steering angles to where the player could be directed.

200
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,570
The intersection of the hit cone and the target cones in the vicinity would determine the knockback target the player would be directed to.

201
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:25,448
There was still the very rare case, though, that these checks would still fail, and the hero animation would ultimately fall back on a simple air flail hit react that would keep the player from unnaturally colliding into the environment.

202
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:35,791
This usually happened when the player was in a bad position, usually really close to a building, where the trajectory to the intended target would have him actually penetrate through a building.

203
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,292
It was still rare, but we needed to have that in place just in case.

204
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:47,256
These super knockbacks ultimately fulfilled the fantasy of getting your block knocked off by our giant Sandman, so we think we hit the mark on that one.

205
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:54,380
We knew the Sandman mission, though, was going to be huge, both figuratively and literally.

206
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,461
But we had to keep in mind that this was still the opening tutorial mission.

207
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:03,545
This meant we had to make sure a new player would easily digest the control scheme and that they would be familiar for the rest of the game.

208
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:07,407
We knew we needed some basic inputs that would give the player spectacular results.

209
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,608
Basic melee combat and basic wham shot.

210
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:17,049
The inputs necessary were meant to mimic the standard webshop functionality as well as the cadence and responsiveness of a basic melee combo.

211
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,713
But we also needed it to fit the encounter appropriately to match the weight and size of our boss.

212
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:30,779
That ultimately led the team to what we called the wrecking ball combo, which would have the player use chunks of debris yanked out of Sandman's face to pummel Sandman during the boss fight, because that felt pretty good.

213
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:35,534
There were several challenges we faced while creating the wrecking ball combo, though.

214
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:40,517
We had to ensure the player could understand the sequence of controls, as well as the actions being performed by the hero.

215
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:45,781
And we also had to make sure that the combo remained responsive and felt very close to our base melee combat.

216
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:58,689
Due to its size, we had to make sure Sandman's blending was in perfect shape, because any pops or misalignment during these moves would move tens of meters in distance, rather than a few centimeters that we would get with a normal-sized enemy.

217
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:08,720
While in practice this is the same principle as a normal enemy, making sure Sandman's reactions didn't pop and the moves flowed together made this a bit more complex than typical combat.

218
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:17,527
Finally, making sure the characters and props remained in perfect alignment while traveling through the air took quite a bit of tweaking to get it to work correctly.

219
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:28,695
We had to switch the sync location mid-combo to ensure the player remained in relative space to Sandman rather than being stuck to follow Sandman's head reactions as during each move that would cause the player to shift back and forth with his head.

220
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:33,120
Testing and feedback obviously were a huge part of making this combo work.

221
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:41,224
We had issues with the combo being too slow, with the engagement distance, as well as the tricky note of not making it feel like we were ripping Sandman's eyeballs out of his head.

222
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:52,290
Ultimately though, these combos ended up working really well and gave the player an exciting payoff while still keeping our base combat control scheme in play.

223
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:05,175
Another goal that we set out to achieve early on in Spider-Man 2 was to showcase the power of the PS5 and what kind of Marvel hero spectacle moments we can achieve seamlessly during a tentpole boss fight.

224
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:09,235
The giant Sandman fight seemed like an opportune moment to showcase this.

225
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:25,614
It was early in the game, and we knew we had to push the streaming speed of the SSD, and what better way to do that than for Sandman to grab Miles, throw him half a mile away, through a building, all the way to Washington Square Park, stream some civilian and traffic data in, and then send him all the way back into gameplay seamlessly.

226
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:33,807
Our boss pod and design teams worked on getting the sequence to function technically, and our missions animation team stepped in to polish it up to a final product.

227
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:42,449
Ultimately, it was up to our VFX and optimization teams to handle the technical streaming aspects and put the finishing touches to bring the sequence home.

228
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,691
All the traffic and pedestrians seen in the sequence were streamed in on the spot using open world systems.

229
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:56,757
This moment clearly showcased the speed the PS5 SSD could handle and also gave the player a truly epic Marvel moment to witness, all while keeping them in the action.

230
00:24:58,358 --> 00:25:04,321
We hope this brief glimpse into Sandman's development sheds some light onto the challenges and spectacular collaboration needed to bring our massive foe to life.

231
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:11,966
While animation was a large part of it, it was just as much a technical environment, character arts, audio, and visual effects effort to bring this massive boss to life.

232
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:13,166
Thank you.

233
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:16,168
And now I'll hand it off to James Panton.

234
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:25,451
Hello.

235
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:27,072
Thanks, Steven.

236
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:29,634
My name is James Ham.

237
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:36,898
I was also an associate animation director on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and my focus was our mission cinematics and QTEs.

238
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,941
So in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, there were multiple types of QTEs.

239
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,042
These are a few that we wanted to highlight.

240
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:46,084
There's the fail forward, feat of strength, and play anon.

241
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:54,169
Feat of strength QTEs are a staple of the franchise, but we wanted to find new ways of incorporating them into the game.

242
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:59,344
So instead of just mashing a button, we started using them by pulling joysticks in a specific direction.

243
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:02,745
We also took advantage of the new adaptive triggers to find the sweet spot.

244
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:04,886
And here's some examples of their uses.

245
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,688
So on the top left, we used the sweet spot mechanic to take advantage of the triggers.

246
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:15,109
Depending on the pressure applied, it would reflect in his progression.

247
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:30,028
In the bottom left, we use the mashing setup to show progress as the player gets closer to completion.

248
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:44,340
Now the ones on the right are a bit more complex.

249
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,482
The top right example has moving parts on both ends.

250
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:52,307
They need to respect each other by staying in sync, as well as try to show some progression as the player can feel the change over time.

251
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:13,277
The bottom right has one of our more complex setups as the coaster has multiple moving parts, people in the coaster, our hero, webs attached to the part, to the coaster on both ends.

252
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:15,999
So everything needs to stay in sync while also showing progress.

253
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:21,602
So lots of moving parts just to get this set up that way people aren't floating outside the coaster, webs aren't flying everywhere.

254
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:24,183
So we had to make sure that everything stayed in sync.

255
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:35,402
Our fail-forward term is one of our ways to have branching moments in the game going into any QTE, we ask the question, what if the player doesn't press the button?

256
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:41,067
By failing forward, we allow the player to continue the story without having them replay the same thing multiple times.

257
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:47,091
It allows the player to stay in the moment without breaking momentum and helps give the player an experience we would like for them to have.

258
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:55,798
Granted, they take a bit more time to figure out and create, but it also allows us to tell slightly different stories, an alternate version, to move the sequence along.

259
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:11,102
So on the top left here, we have Miles getting ready to get grabbed by the lizard, and if the player succeeds, Miles is able to dodge, land on the lizard's back, and then continue moving the story.

260
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:20,446
If the player fails to do that, Lizard will then grab Miles, drag him underwater, but we still ended up getting it to the same direction to continue the story forward.

261
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:28,829
Then we have an alternate version of that, which is just multiple setups, where here the player is

262
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:36,727
has the ability to grab arrows coming at him, dodge them, then you have the option to use a firework and hit enemies with it.

263
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:51,094
If the player fails to do so, Spider-Man will then get hit by arrows, and then instead of using a firework, he'll find another way to keep the story going along in this version, just yanking the enemies down.

264
00:28:54,447 --> 00:29:00,210
Play Anim QTEs are one of our more powerful tools where we can do full animations on characters without branching to different shots.

265
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,152
This allows us to play individual animations on characters while still maintaining a cinematic feel.

266
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:08,114
These are more complex due to having a lot of moving parts.

267
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:10,195
And here's another example.

268
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:19,180
So in this mocap shoot, we have our actors, the two on the top left of the platform are our Spider-Man, Miles on the left, Peter on the right.

269
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,641
The person on the ground on the left is also Miles.

270
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,582
And then there's another person on the right

271
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,541
that's playing as Peter, and the person on his back is our Venom.

272
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:30,444
This is spoilers, so yeah.

273
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:36,608
But in this sequence here, you're going to see our Spider-Man fighting Venom, doing a combo.

274
00:29:42,193 --> 00:29:47,437
So you can see we have a breakdown of Miles throws a punch, Peter throws a punch, and we have Venom reacting.

275
00:29:47,857 --> 00:29:51,840
The reason why we have people on the ground, and we have two versions, is that way we have

276
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,890
multiple variations in case one data comes out a little bit better.

277
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,413
Also, our actors on the ground aren't fighting gravity in an unnatural way.

278
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:04,097
So it might give us a little bit better data to plug and play with which one's going to work the best in the overall scene.

279
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:13,245
And then to finish that sequence off, you'll see the same actors are in the same positions.

280
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:15,927
We have the two actors on the platform being Peter and Miles.

281
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,909
Then we also have the alternate versions on the ground, and we have Venom in the middle.

282
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,751
And this is to finish off that sequence.

283
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,617
and it looks like a mess.

284
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,221
But, the end result.

285
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,289
Thank you so much for watching our presentation.

286
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,890
We'll now open the floor for questions.

287
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:19,333
Yeah, if that wasn't clear, we're open for questions to the end.

288
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:20,273
Yeah, does this work?

289
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:21,673
Hello.

290
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,854
We have some mics to each side.

291
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:25,950
Hey.

292
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,491
Hello.

293
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:29,953
I've got a question about those QTEs.

294
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:36,818
I think that is like an incredibly elegant solution to like a common problem of that replayability.

295
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:45,445
Did players notice that there was sort of this, I don't have a more graceful word for it, but like unfailable sort of thing?

296
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:49,548
And if so, what was their reaction like to the sort of twofer?

297
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,189
Is my mic working?

298
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:52,090
Can you guys hear me?

299
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,331
Oh, there you go.

300
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:53,751
Check, check.

301
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:54,091
Cool.

302
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:54,411
There we go.

303
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:07,772
Yeah, I think players started to notice we started implementing that feature in Miles and we noticed it when players started finding out that if you failed the certain QTE when Miles, we called it save the baby moment in the mall.

304
00:32:08,352 --> 00:32:14,293
If you don't save the baby and you like go to photo mode and you look behind, Peter saves the baby and he gives Miles like a little thumbs up.

305
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:23,455
But I think players started to notice it and it helped it with replayability where it's something new that you can find

306
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,176
You can also see a different side of the story.

307
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,959
But also, you're not stuck with the, oh, I failed this.

308
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,060
I have to replay it again.

309
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,621
And then you're stuck doing that for five minutes.

310
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,723
And it's just going to help move the story along.

311
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,865
Yeah, it's less frustrating, I think.

312
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:37,387
I think it makes gameplay and progression more fun.

313
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:38,468
Agreed.

314
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:39,209
Thank you so much.

315
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,352
I think even if they don't notice, if they're happy.

316
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:42,872
Yeah.

317
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:43,833
If they're happy.

318
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:44,253
That's what we do.

319
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:45,615
If they're happy, we're happy.

320
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,414
Hi, first of all, thank you for being here.

321
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:49,214
I appreciate it.

322
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:59,099
My question was, for the workflow with ASL, do you think that this, did the people who helped you, was this a tried and true method or was it more of a work in progress?

323
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,581
I think it's definitely a work in progress.

324
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:10,905
I mean, it was, we've had Haley in previous games and we were certainly developing a pipeline and a system for it then.

325
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,307
But I think as we've

326
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:17,870
worked more with our consultants, that we've done it more times.

327
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,650
Thank you.

328
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:22,914
We're getting better and better at it.

329
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:28,278
So even as the shoots went on during shooting our ASL, we were able to kind of get up and running a lot quicker.

330
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:35,123
Knowing everybody was coordinated, we knew which direction people needed to face, where their interpreters were.

331
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:43,630
But it was certainly a learning process and something I hope that we continue to improve on.

332
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:44,534
Absolutely.

333
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:48,117
Do you feel like you're going to increase more lip sync animation?

334
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:49,718
I'm deaf.

335
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:57,064
So to be able to lip read was a huge deal to me in the game, because I was able to not read the captions, but look at the performance.

336
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:58,385
Do you think that's going to improve?

337
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:00,267
I hope so.

338
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:07,010
I mean, we always strive to make it better and better, and that's something that did come up with our ASL consultants.

339
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:22,019
You'll notice in a lot of our ASL scenes, we tried to make sure that whoever was speaking was on screen, whereas with other cinematics, sometimes we'll take more creative license to not show their faces.

340
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,362
That was something in those scenes we tried to make sure people could read faces a little better.

341
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,811
Thank you so much.

342
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:29,491
Thank you.

343
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,715
Hello, thank you for the presentation.

344
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,156
I have two questions.

345
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:40,440
The first one is about ALS as well, and specifically about localization.

346
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:49,368
Is this something that you ever considered, at least using procedural animations or something to kind of work with the ALS in different languages?

347
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:55,793
Because, you know, obviously we have the English ALS, but also other languages and changes in how they work.

348
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:56,786
I'm

349
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:32,968
English when it came to sign language for our game, but we in addition to subtitles We also had a pretty robust audio description system in the game to make sure that we Could localize that as well But yeah, we were limited in terms of signing that would have been

350
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,793
really a lot of work to do.

351
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:44,926
So yeah, unfortunately we did have to stick with one language there, but we hope that our subtitles and audio descriptions kind of backfilled that.

352
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:45,735
Absolutely.

353
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:51,360
And the second question I have is about cinematics and seamless transitions between gameplay and cinematic.

354
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,943
I think Spider-Man is a prime example of really well done seamless transitions.

355
00:35:56,644 --> 00:36:03,789
And I'm wondering if you have any mo-cap tips for how to shoot these and what your ideas are when it comes to seamlessness.

356
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:09,934
Hand it over to our cinematics gurus over here.

357
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:12,355
Yeah.

358
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:14,377
I'm not sure.

359
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:29,708
The most important thing you want to do is to, in this position you're between your narrative, your writers and your designers and you're going to have to really talk to them and you're going to have to basically imagine your way through that.

360
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:38,011
There's a lot of different, sometimes you need to get rid of the hero and bring them back in for it to be seamless and then sometimes you're going to hand them off.

361
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:45,101
I think at the beginning of every project, we all kind of go, they're all going to be seamless all the time.

362
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,123
Into and out, it's going to be amazing.

363
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:50,847
It's so much cheaper to cut, it's so much easier to cut.

364
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:54,050
Just show a reverse or show something else and have them walk back on screen.

365
00:36:54,351 --> 00:37:00,317
And a lot of times we go to that because maybe it's the right call for the story or maybe it's the right call for our schedule.

366
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:10,642
But yeah, we do try to imagine what the needs are from gameplay into the cinematic and make the most interesting and seamless way possible.

367
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:16,785
There's, of course, all different ways to do it, where you can funnel the player to a certain location.

368
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:21,547
There's ways that you can sort of tag the first shot to play hero relative.

369
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,668
That one doesn't get used a lot, but it's super powerful.

370
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:24,508
We should probably use it more.

371
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:26,723
there's

372
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,302
yeah and I mean

373
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:16,045
The real thing is making sure you hit your core poses when you go back to... When you call cut, they're hitting their core poses.

374
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:18,907
That's like 90% of getting you there.

375
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:26,031
I think another important... We've gotten pretty good to the point where we prep these shoots as well as we can.

376
00:38:26,111 --> 00:38:31,835
We prep them extensively by working with designers and going, how are we going into this and how are we going out?

377
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:38,804
and I think we always kind of cover our asses now and always plan to have a seamless transition whether we use one or not.

378
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:46,093
There should be a picture of what the gameplay out is while you're shooting and you can show it to the actors and you'll be standing here like that, you know.

379
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,911
Right foot forward.

380
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:50,813
But yeah, it's hard work.

381
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:57,438
But we do maintain, like, every pod or multiple pods meet, sometimes twice a week.

382
00:38:57,818 --> 00:39:03,843
And everybody just talks about it just like you would now and does the, you know, it would be cool, even if you can't afford it.

383
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:08,106
And it really gets ratcheted up by everyone.

384
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:12,249
You know, there's always somebody going, you know, it'd be cool if you, like, flipped over backwards and did that.

385
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,392
And usually it'll be quiet and they're like, you're right.

386
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:16,693
And someone will try to, you know,

387
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:17,614
Make it better.

388
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,255
They make each other better constantly.

389
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,376
So so thanks.

390
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:21,276
Thanks for that question.

391
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:41,070
Thank you Hi, I want to follow up on that thought and especially with the ASL shoot so you have your Main actor you have your stunt actor you have your voice actor And you have this poses that you have trying to match up

392
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:41,792
Right?

393
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,373
So you have all of these layers.

394
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:53,660
As an animator, which one do you prioritize when you're working with physicality or, you know, face performance or the stunt?

395
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,102
Well, I think the goal is to strike the balance.

396
00:39:57,182 --> 00:40:04,106
And so that's why we, I feel like we've kind of shown it in multiple of our presentations that we like to have options.

397
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:14,933
it was really important for us to shoot our main cast alongside our deaf actors as well so that we could pick and choose from those performances.

398
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:33,525
A lot of times our main cast actors would put in work to learn the signs and it was a much easier data to bring in and just use and improve upon but a lot of times we had some pretty extensive conversations and we wanted to

399
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,988
make sure that we had the most accurate data.

400
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:42,557
So it was always striking a balance, always having options, and always choosing the best performance.

401
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:50,148
I mean, we're a performance-forward studio, so we always want the most emotional and authentic performance.

402
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,749
That's where it comes into collaboration.

403
00:40:52,789 --> 00:41:03,592
Like, our deaf actors and our main cast, you know, they're treated equally on the set, and we want both of their performances.

404
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:12,615
So, yeah, it's a lot of... Just to follow up on that, so in your prep work, you are shooting everything you can at the same time?

405
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:13,155
Yes.

406
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:13,855
Okay.

407
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:16,176
So that we keep our timing the same.

408
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:20,317
So if I need to move in, if I take the first three seconds of this performance,

409
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:26,368
I can pretty seamlessly, as long as they're looking at each other and kind of performing the same thing.

410
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:46,419
You know, Najee, when he was doing a lot of finger speaking in that scene with Haley at the end, he was looking right at Justin, our deaf actor, and he was kind of speaking to it and trying to kind of move his body at the same time so that the inflections were the same so that I would be able to later move in and out of those performances when need be.

411
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:46,959
Thank you.

412
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:47,487
Yeah.

413
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,309
Lots of layers and blending.

414
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:51,090
Atom layers.

415
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,933
And to Lindsay's point, like when you synchronize that and you're running them together, it's really easy.

416
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:03,158
I think, Bobby, you kind of set that up on layers, and you can just really dial in and out kind of between performances.

417
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:05,779
And since they're synced up, it's pretty down.

418
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,300
Oh, that's right.

419
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:15,106
We were animating the layer slider in Maya, just sort of bringing up, which basically just on a layer baked the ASL performer

420
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:16,206
on

421
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:40,378
You know, we can dub the dialogue if it was, you know, unclean or something, but was it a heartfelt performance?

422
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:49,122
Like, that first, and then we can still fix, you know, hands and body or his hands not following him because somebody's moving and the other actor didn't.

423
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:55,824
Like, we're animators, so we approach it as, what can I fix and what can I not fix, you know?

424
00:42:57,086 --> 00:43:00,727
Well, my question is a kind of follow-up for that discussion.

425
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:09,069
First, Stephen, when you were recording all the actions at the same time, I saw that you might be using some real-time.

426
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:11,630
I wonder if it's Unreal.

427
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,230
Is it Unreal?

428
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:19,372
You're using Unreal for, like, visualize what's happening, everything at the same time.

429
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:21,553
Is that helpful for the process?

430
00:43:22,593 --> 00:43:28,038
Do you do any, like, after the session, during the session, do you cut the movement and try to put it together?

431
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:30,480
I don't know what program they used to show the real-time set.

432
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,180
On the stage?

433
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,401
Yeah, I'm not sure what they used either.

434
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:33,762
Like, you could see the video on the stage?

435
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:35,804
I could, yeah, I could see something.

436
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,846
I was wondering if it was Unreal Engine.

437
00:43:38,266 --> 00:43:40,748
They have the, they can, our studio can run Unreal.

438
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:41,329
We don't use it.

439
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:43,951
I don't know what program they use, but it's all the same to us.

440
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:48,595
Like we don't, we don't go with lighting or anything.

441
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:56,101
It's usually untextured, but a hundred percent, whatever, whatever condition the set is in at the time of shooting, we use it.

442
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:57,682
We measure everything to it.

443
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,363
We take the time.

444
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:01,506
It's really worth it to tape off feet and make sure people are hitting their marks.

445
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:03,928
To us, using that stage,

446
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,020
of

447
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:25,196
A cinematographer who's also being mo-capped or anything like that.

448
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:28,757
We just let them live the space as best as possible.

449
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:31,858
So yeah, we're not doing visors or anything.

450
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:38,220
They can see themselves on the TV and get used to the space, but they'll just have the gray mock-ups in the room.

451
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:46,543
But I feel like, and this is an opinion, but we get the best work and we don't complicate the day with cinematography.

452
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,084
We just have actors live in the space and act.

453
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:59,928
To me it works, but you know we can fight in the parking lot We do use the real-time playback a lot of times we'll we'll do a take and then you know if it's like a crowd

454
00:45:01,314 --> 00:45:12,225
and they're reacting to something, we'll use that for timing, so we'll take the real-time playback, play the previous take, and the actors will then act against that take, so they're using the same timing as they did in the previous.

455
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:20,895
Yeah, and they can even look at their old self, because you might have four to eight people on stage, and if they walk through themselves, we'll put a rope on the ground like, that's where you were.

456
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:22,246
Don't be there.

457
00:45:23,527 --> 00:45:32,755
I was just wondering if you do any edits during the session or like right after, just to see if things are matching, since it's all the actions at the same time.

458
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,156
Only when we need to.

459
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:34,717
OK.

460
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:37,779
We're very cocky, I guess.

461
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,321
Should we take a question from this side?

462
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,823
I think they were like here before me.

463
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:42,584
Oh, OK.

464
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:44,305
What you got amongst yourselves.

465
00:45:48,048 --> 00:46:00,684
Hi, so you talked a bit about being a performance-first studio, and another theme I'm noticing in the QTs and the knockbacks is you seem very concerned with how the animation impacts the game feel for the player.

466
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:15,155
So I was just wondering, in addition to those, if you could elaborate a bit on the direction pillars that you have as a studio, what you want to get out of the animation.

467
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:20,782
Our main pillar whenever we're working on the Spider-Man titles is always to make it

468
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:21,322
talk

469
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:41,866
We knew we needed to have that type of reaction.

470
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,648
We've seen it before in the, you know, NCU.

471
00:46:46,189 --> 00:46:56,814
And so we needed to figure out a way, like, how can we make this work with the environment and also keep the player with, giving the player that freedom still of being able to move around and not making it feel too canned.

472
00:46:57,474 --> 00:47:02,357
We needed something that was quick, but also gave the player the feeling of, like, I just got rocked.

473
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:04,918
So that's...

474
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:09,460
Yeah, I think a lot of the things what Steven just said is accurate.

475
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,081
Like, we go for the feeling.

476
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:13,422
A lot of times it's like, does this feel good?

477
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:16,863
And then does this serve the story elements of what we're trying to tell?

478
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:23,707
So going into that with pretty much every script, every QTE, we're like, cool, what are we trying to accomplish with this?

479
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:25,207
How do we make this feel good?

480
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:28,129
Does it reflect the gameplay buttons that the players normally press?

481
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:31,544
We try to make sure that's like the first thing we hit.

482
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:34,388
And then also then for us animation, we're like, how do we make this look cool?

483
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:42,737
You know, it's like, it's easy to say this goes from point A to point B, but what's all this stuff in the middle, you know, and how do we make that look good within certain time constraints?

484
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:47,543
So as long as it feels good for us, feels good for the player, that's ultimately what we're trying to get for.

485
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,144
Go for it.

486
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:50,186
Thank you.

487
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:53,824
Hi.

488
00:47:54,724 --> 00:47:56,826
My question is about blending animation.

489
00:47:56,906 --> 00:48:08,655
So when blending between animation during gameplay, during cinematics, and especially between cinematics and gameplay and vice versa, how much was relied on animation blending that already came in Unreal?

490
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:14,600
And I know that you guys also have an internal engine that you guys use.

491
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:19,324
So how much of that was custom built, and were there any specific challenges?

492
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,187
I mean, I can go ahead.

493
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:23,347
Yeah.

494
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:23,767
Yeah.

495
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:30,070
So we have our own internal engine and kind of what they talked about previously, like we have certain core poses that the player needs to hit.

496
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:37,113
So especially going from cinematics to gameplay assets, um, we'll either have the characters like, all right, they're getting ready to go into combat.

497
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:38,333
We'll have our aggro pose.

498
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,154
We need to make sure that is the correct pose.

499
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:46,297
But then especially for this game, because we had two heroes, uh, we had to make sure it's the correct pose for miles or the correct pose for Peter.

500
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:49,538
And then there, we do have blend settings to say like, if they're,

501
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:56,358
We want them to be in that specific pose, but if they're close enough, we have some blend settings like blend over this duration of time.

502
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,881
And that helps smooth things out going from cinematics to gameplay.

503
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:05,565
And then we also have a couple of events to help out with like making sure that the camera stays where we want it to be.

504
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:10,529
That way we can go into combat setups and have these cinematic sequences to start the combat setups up.

505
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:16,653
Or if we're going to traversal, making sure that the camera is at a specific distance and going into gameplay, and that takes a lot of debugging.

506
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:30,436
saying like oh the camera needs to be five meters away with this focal length and everything so we try to sync that up with the gameplay assets as much as possible but we do have some blending duration times to help filter that out and help smooth it out as we transition.

507
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:33,211
a look

508
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:54,142
But with Sandman specifically, he also took up a lot of screen real estate.

509
00:49:54,462 --> 00:49:55,603
And he was massive.

510
00:49:55,803 --> 00:50:03,368
So the issue was that if we used our typical blend times that we would use for any other enemy or for our heroes, you'd see him move drastically.

511
00:50:03,488 --> 00:50:04,889
And it would look really unnatural.

512
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:12,434
So Sandman's blend times were usually three to five times longer than what we would do elsewhere.

513
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:17,317
And that was just kind of feeling it out and making sure that everything would perform as we wanted it to.

514
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:19,419
So we just let everything down.

515
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:22,282
Thank you.

516
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:23,903
I have just one more question.

517
00:50:24,864 --> 00:50:32,147
I didn't see that in the video, but how much of the camera was mo-capped or if it was not mo-capped at all?

518
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:33,368
No mo-capped camera.

519
00:50:33,388 --> 00:50:33,788
Not at all.

520
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:44,734
Well, we made a camera that has motion that's been extracted from human hips and shoulders.

521
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:47,655
And that has been put into a loop.

522
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:53,932
and I made this just to clean up my life because when I worked on a title many, many

523
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:59,144
over a decade ago, where it was all mo-capped camera, and it was a nightmare.

524
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:09,109
And you know, there was like, people would give you like 40 takes of mo-capped camera, and they weren't synced up to it, and you're just like, oh, I don't even, I can't even find what this is supposed to be looking at.

525
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:16,953
So I made this thing that basically was just loops of motion capture data at different frequencies.

526
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:19,975
And so there's like Swell, which is like a big ocean.

527
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:22,316
It'll just do this to the camera, you know.

528
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:23,986
And it does it for a while.

529
00:51:24,306 --> 00:51:29,671
And it just keeps going down until you get to jitter, which is like you're sitting on a washing machine.

530
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:36,637
And so you can animate these up and do little shark fin ads in the graph editor to camera shake and fade it off.

531
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:38,179
And it's quirky.

532
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,099
It's not a perfect thing.

533
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:41,822
You get used to how to use the rumble cam.

534
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,165
But at the end of the day, you could take

535
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:47,272
you know, two keys.

536
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:50,653
I'll, you know, set a key at the beginning, set a key at the end, and then push in on you.

537
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:57,015
And then just add that, that drift that you get from wave or shake, or not shake.

538
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,635
Shake would be way too high.

539
00:51:59,276 --> 00:52:00,736
And then you sort of just dial that in.

540
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:02,076
And there's like, it's just beautiful.

541
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:04,237
There's like, I mean, two, two, two keys.

542
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,177
you know, not a bunch of crap in your graph editor.

543
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:12,399
If someone needs you to change it, you don't look at them in horror like, I can't change it, there's a thousand keys on it.

544
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:25,084
So it's just really simplified and it looks like mocap data and it, like I said, it simplifies the shoot date not to use it and there's always that learning curve, you'll get new people, they're like, I've never, I'm not a cinematographer, but like, you will be.

545
00:52:26,204 --> 00:52:28,745
You will be, by the end of this project, you're gonna be very good at it.

546
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:34,267
And I think that just, it just keeps it simple and beautiful and easy to manage, like, yeah.

547
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:35,993
All right, thank you so much.

548
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:38,855
Hi.

549
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:41,996
The final QT is really, really awesome.

550
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:43,036
Thank you.

551
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:48,839
And what is the working pipeline from the idea to the final product?

552
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:55,902
And because isn't there any suggestion that we can do at first before we shooting?

553
00:52:55,962 --> 00:53:01,905
Because we can know if it works at first.

554
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,265
Yeah, thank you.

555
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:12,559
We did like a previs, I had like a week, and it was like, hey, previs this whole thing, and I was like, I have a week, I don't know how far I'll get, but here's an idea.

556
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:20,226
And that whole final QTE sequence changed a lot over the duration of the game, especially like the last, what, three, four months?

557
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:23,069
It was like, hey, it's this thing, and it's like, no, it's not anymore, it's gonna go with this.

558
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:23,784
Yeah.

559
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:24,944
He was trying to add even more.

560
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:25,285
Yeah.

561
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:28,646
There was, there was a lot more, there was a, there was a whole bunch of truck sequences and everything.

562
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,886
And then they were like, it's too much James.

563
00:53:29,926 --> 00:53:31,967
And I was like, okay, so it was cool.

564
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:37,148
I was sad, but I was like, um, but a lot of it is just kind of like figuring it out.

565
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:42,030
And I kind of learned a lot on the go of like how I can manipulate this and kind of what we're saying before.

566
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,070
Like we wanted it to feel good.

567
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,631
We still want to have as much of it on the sticks as we can.

568
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,052
So like, even as they're like punching venom, um, a lot of that's kind of faked.

569
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:52,793
We didn't really have a system for that, but I was like, Oh, if I make

570
00:53:53,223 --> 00:54:22,050
his reaction to something look like in action so peter's reaction to miles was prepping for a punch and kind of alternating between the two we found out that that could work and it's kind of tweaking things to see what felt good and then just a lot of places like a does this work that i work with bobby a lot on the cinematography where it's like a put the camera here we want to be able to see this in the background we wanna see this we want to see them going in the right screen directions or bobby about like quite a bit on that just on that aspect of it but uh...

571
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,211
Yeah, it was fun to make, but it was very hard.

572
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,432
Make it up as you go and figure it out.

573
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:29,052
Figure it out.

574
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:31,233
Say yes and figure it out.

575
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:31,914
Get some help.

576
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:38,716
That's the previews combined with the gameplay or just animation?

577
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:47,440
The previews, I tried to get some of it in game, but for the most of it, it was just kind of a movie set piece of like, this is what it could look like.

578
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,560
Is this what you guys want?

579
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,341
And it was like, yes.

580
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:51,342
And I was like, crap, I got to figure out how to make it now.

581
00:54:53,315 --> 00:54:59,117
But yeah, a lot of it was just in a previz of Maya, just like a play blast.

582
00:54:59,717 --> 00:55:07,300
Then I exported it out into the game just so we can see where certain environments are, because trying to bring the city into Maya makes Maya super slow.

583
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,902
So I would do a rough draft, put it in game just to see like, oh, here's where this building is.

584
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:16,383
If I want them flying this way, trying to figure out what the path would be.

585
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:19,164
And then ultimately, we were just like, just shoot them up into the air.

586
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:20,045
And I was like, that's easier.

587
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:21,265
So we went with that.

588
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:23,220
Okay, thank you.

589
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:27,916
Hi.

590
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:39,345
In a production that's so high value with so many different disciplines coming together, I imagine that you have to concept a lot of things out ahead of time.

591
00:55:39,825 --> 00:55:44,849
So how does that impact, in your experience, your artistic ability, like your freedom?

592
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:51,094
Once you have a performance, do you have to get a lot of your ideas out in the storyboards?

593
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:56,258
And then do you feel like that constricts what you can then do once you're actually animating?

594
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:00,302
You haven't talked in a while.

595
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:01,043
Yeah.

596
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:10,328
I mean, honestly, on this project, we didn't do a whole lot of previs or anything.

597
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:18,792
A lot of it is getting together with the writer, the designer, everybody getting into a room and talking things out.

598
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:22,754
And then we might pitch something.

599
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:24,976
And everyone's like, that's awesome.

600
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:25,616
Go make that.

601
00:56:26,697 --> 00:56:27,577
And then, yeah.

602
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:33,389
I never really feel that stifled artistically at Insomniac.

603
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:40,175
It's great, and usually people... I think we've built up enough trust in the studio.

604
00:56:40,215 --> 00:56:43,298
They're like, you make awesome stuff, just go do that.

605
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,723
Yeah, I think that's been one of the coolest things as we've worked on three of these games now.

606
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:49,929
as

607
00:57:07,198 --> 00:57:08,039
This isn't working.

608
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,001
We wanted, oh, this would be so cool.

609
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:15,507
Maybe we can find another piece of data that we already shot, or maybe we can get back onto the mocap stage and do this.

610
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:21,334
But generally, yeah, we kind of get to pitch our ideas.

611
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:23,375
and make them work.

612
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:29,737
So no, I have never felt more creatively fulfilled than as I have at this studio.

613
00:57:30,397 --> 00:57:31,897
The trust is off the charts.

614
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:39,619
I think all of us have worked together for anywhere from 10 to 15 years in one capacity or another, or even at different companies.

615
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:40,859
So we are a family.

616
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,080
And people trust us now, which is nice.

617
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,501
Because when we kicked off Spider-Man, they were like, can you guys even do this?

618
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:50,962
And they don't ask us that anymore, which is great.

619
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:54,544
So yeah, there's a super high amount of trust.

620
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:59,729
We do still pre-vis some things if you know it's going to be a mess.

621
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:08,977
If you know you don't even see it clearly in your own head, we will send our creative people after it to sort of figure it out.

622
00:58:09,017 --> 00:58:10,418
But never at any point.

623
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:13,801
There are storyboards as well, but we don't really use them.

624
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:17,785
And most of the time, just because of the way games are developed and the way missions are developed,

625
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:20,986
They're kind of obsolete by the time we start to make them.

626
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:25,107
But whatever it is, we use it and we put it together.

627
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:31,950
If someone has a good idea, the whole good ideas come from everywhere thing, that's all true for us.

628
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,631
So we'll take as many sources as are available to try.

629
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:37,512
But even if it's concept art, they'll have a picture.

630
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:38,192
Like, that's rad.

631
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:40,933
We'll try to get that in one of the shots.

632
00:58:41,553 --> 00:58:41,813
Yeah.

633
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,555
I mean, that's kind of the, you kind of touched on that.

634
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:51,077
We don't always have a good idea of what it is yet.

635
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,580
We can write it in a script as many times as we want to, and we can talk to designers and things like that.

636
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:06,728
But sometimes, if somebody has a really good visual in their head and they put that visual out, that's kind of what makes something real, is getting the rest of the team excited about it.

637
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:14,827
So, like, you know, James's awesome finale, like, he put that visual out there, and then everybody kind of, like, rallied behind it, and then you kind of push it to the final product.

638
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:15,487
Spider-Cat.

639
00:59:15,587 --> 00:59:16,808
That's how Spider-Cat came to be.

640
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:17,348
That is awesome.

641
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:17,508
Yeah.

642
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:19,389
Somebody made it, and we put it in the game.

643
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,789
Yeah.

644
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:25,612
I mean, and even to that, like, we, especially on stage, like, we have awesome stunt performers.

645
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:31,154
We have a lot of awesome actors, and, like, sometimes we'll have an idea, and I might be like, hey, I have this idea.

646
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:36,897
Here's, I want these specific punches and stuff, but I'm also like, hey, you guys think while you're doing this, and if you come up with something better,

647
00:59:37,304 --> 01:00:04,104
let's shoot it because I'd rather us have the data and that way we can pick and choose because sometimes we might have data and it's like it works but it could be better and we'll filter out and a lot of it's just scrappiness like well let me look for data let me search kick what kind of kicks do we have what kind of options can I have can I is this something that we can keyframe real quick and getting a better visual so I don't feel like we really stifle ourself we try to push creativity and that's also one of the benefits I really enjoy about like not locking in to

648
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:26,270
specifically having a camera going to a mocap shoot because sometimes discovering what that cinematography is comes from after putting the whole sequence together and you're like oh if I put the camera here this is dope versus if I go into the mocap shoot I might feel like oh this is cool then I realize later I'm like well I'm locked in now you know so it just gives more freedom for creativity and it's like that's something that I

649
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,720
we really push for.

650
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,341
I'd say that goes with every decision we make.

651
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:46,466
You need to show up prepared, but you need to not be, that preparedness should not lock you out of all the great ideas that everyone else is going to try and bring to it.

652
01:00:46,606 --> 01:00:49,667
I know we're getting close to time, but we could probably get another question.

653
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:53,698
Hello, yeah, so this is again regarding ASL.

654
01:00:54,278 --> 01:01:05,848
So in the slides I saw that you used motion capture data and then refined it to create readable ASL, but in the future, or like in this project, did you consider, or would you consider

655
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:23,774
building a library of isolated animations for hands and like signage that you can reuse and omit, sort of create like a ASL Google Translate for your animation pipeline, or would that affect readability since it's more mechanical and not motion captured?

656
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:29,483
I think that's something we've definitely thought about moving to the future.

657
01:01:29,503 --> 01:01:36,893
I mean, that's something that we do with poses, we do it with facial poses, we create libraries so that we can quickly do handshapes.

658
01:01:36,913 --> 01:01:40,317
We do it with just normal handshapes, you know, fists, this, that.

659
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:54,042
So having a pose library of sign letters and things like that could be incredibly helpful moving forward if we had more in the game.

660
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:59,284
And that's absolutely something to consider going forward.

661
01:01:59,744 --> 01:02:03,125
Speeding up that process, because it is a very labor-intensive process.

662
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:09,186
So that would absolutely, if we had the time and the ability to do.

663
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:11,027
Thank you.

664
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:17,115
Oh.

665
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:32,827
like that doesn't happen in cutscenes?

666
01:02:48,593 --> 01:02:57,220
Sometimes I have to check because they're, you know, like... Yeah, we have procedural events that we will drop on specific animations, so like synced moves or things like that, finishers.

667
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:04,186
There's procedural shake events that we drop on those animations, but they're not driven from Maya.

668
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:11,231
Yeah, the only times we would... There's a few certain circumstances where we would do that, and that's like finishers.

669
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:17,636
Finishers have custom cameras where we can introduce that, and it uses the gameplay camera, but lets our cameras override it.

670
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,863
majority of the time we have a different system for gameplay stuff.

671
01:03:24,006 --> 01:03:25,588
I think we are at time.

672
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:29,132
I'm sorry, but thank you guys for all the questions.
