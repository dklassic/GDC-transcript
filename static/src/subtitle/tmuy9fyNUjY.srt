1
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,087
I'm Chris Wilson from Grinding Gear Games,

2
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:08,968
and today I'm going to talk about how we design

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,609
Path of Exile to be played forever.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,091
I'd like to thank Jonathan, my co-founder,

5
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,912
for helping me extensively with this talk.

6
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,574
Half of it is him, I'm just presenting it.

7
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:18,275
I've been asked to make sure that everyone

8
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,877
mutes their phones so it's quiet,

9
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,838
and thank you very much for staying

10
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:24,459
to the last day of GDC to see this talk.

11
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:25,340
Hopefully it's worthwhile.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,981
I'm going to talk very fast,

13
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,302
so there's a lot to get through.

14
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,744
It's like 90 plus slides and 45-ish minutes,

15
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:32,245
so we'll see how that goes.

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,006
Okay.

17
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:34,807
Thank you.

18
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,853
Early on in Path of Exile's history,

19
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,153
we discovered the truth here.

20
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:42,014
Player versus player games, like League of Legends,

21
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:43,574
are endlessly replayable.

22
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,435
You can play against different opponents every time,

23
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,695
different stuff happens, and they grow over time

24
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:48,276
because of that.

25
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,116
But a PvE game like Path of Exile is difficult

26
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:53,437
because it has a clearly marked set of content,

27
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,297
you know, a single player story you can play through.

28
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:56,818
And because of this, some players,

29
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:57,718
when they play the story,

30
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,618
they then don't play the game anymore.

31
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:02,259
And so it's very hard to get these PvE games

32
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,059
to grow over time.

33
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,159
And one could argue there aren't many good examples

34
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,260
of PvE games that have.

35
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,640
have grown.

36
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,165
And World of Warcraft is the type of game I'm talking about.

37
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:13,350
They threw a ton of content at it for a long time and they got some really good growth

38
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:13,731
out of that.

39
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,995
The tricky thing is how do you do that on a shoestring budget when you're a few guys

40
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:18,518
in New Zealand who haven't made a game before?

41
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,756
So, we found out the reality of this when we released Path of Exile back in 2013.

42
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:29,643
You can see here we had respectable user numbers, 150 million player hours that year, and less

43
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:33,648
in 2014, and less in 2015, and it just wasn't growing, right?

44
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:36,391
Like, you know, people were treating it as a PvE game, and we were doing the best we

45
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:38,034
could and we couldn't keep the player numbers up.

46
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:39,735
So we changed our strategy.

47
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:41,417
We had some hard learnings to do.

48
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,438
We changed what we were doing.

49
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,139
And that's what I want to talk about today.

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,002
How we managed to achieve the honestly ridiculous growth

51
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:47,963
that we've seen since then.

52
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:50,325
And there's a lot to cover.

53
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,327
It's also worth noting that the graph here

54
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:55,309
is showing only our PC Western English server.

55
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,311
This is meant to be an apples to apples comparison.

56
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:59,513
We're not cheating by throwing in like China and Xbox

57
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,414
to make the graphs bigger.

58
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,556
The other realms, the other platforms

59
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:03,717
are not included in this graph.

60
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,658
So I'm going to briefly show you some footage of Path of Exile.

61
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,009
This might be very loud, so we'll just turn it down if it is.

62
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,184
So, it's an online action RPG.

63
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:14,685
I'm sure you're all familiar with this game,

64
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:15,926
or at least this type of game.

65
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:17,827
It plays a lot like, you know, the Diablo series.

66
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,529
And it's all about deep character customization,

67
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,450
finding awesome items, leveling up.

68
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,152
It's got a lot of replayability in the league content

69
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:26,473
where you come back every 13 weeks

70
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,613
to play more Path of Exile.

71
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:30,215
And basically, it's a game that we're very proud of.

72
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:31,576
Entirely made in New Zealand.

73
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:32,817
It's the game with that skill tree,

74
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:34,838
the one that intimidates all the new users,

75
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:35,739
but we're keeping in there.

76
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,601
And so, anyway, that's Path of Exile.

77
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,841
You can Google it if you want more info.

78
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:46,454
So back in the mid-2000s, my co-founders and I had played a ton of Diablo II,

79
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,655
like thousands and thousands and thousands of hours.

80
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,356
And as we, over time, tired of the game, we looked at other action RPGs that we wanted to try out.

81
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,877
You know, we tried out Dungeon Siege series and Titan Quest and so on.

82
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,118
And we played those games too and enjoyed them,

83
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,279
but only for dozens of hours rather than thousands of hours.

84
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,220
And so this caused us to ask, why did we sink so much more time into Diablo II?

85
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,020
What was perfect?

86
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,621
What made that game the best action RPG that had ever existed?

87
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:13,285
And so we came up with a bunch of design pillars that we feel a perfect action RPG needs that some

88
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:18,289
of the other games hadn't quite hit in all cases. And so those design pillars are as follows.

89
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,054
The first one is visceral action combat.

90
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,855
This goes without saying, it's an action RPG.

91
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,956
You need to have immediacy.

92
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,538
You hit a monster, it dies.

93
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:26,378
Blood goes everywhere.

94
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:29,141
It falls back, and it's nice and fast and action-based.

95
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,622
And you have to remember, back in 2006,

96
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:33,344
the atmosphere of online games,

97
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:35,686
like the climate they were in was World of Warcraft clones.

98
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,088
The way combat worked is you walk up to a monster

99
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:39,189
and you target it,

100
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,970
and then your character starts hitting it on a timer

101
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,432
and you press your cooldowns occasionally,

102
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,312
and there's no real action.

103
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:44,994
You're not dodging out of the way when it attacks

104
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,015
because it's gonna hit you anyway.

105
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:50,358
And so nowadays, of course, everyone's doing a much better job at visceral action combat.

106
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,861
Even strict MMOs that come out have great combat in them.

107
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:55,843
Games like Black Desert Online, for example, feel really good to play.

108
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,705
So that's a pillar that everyone understands.

109
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,427
There's no particular secret that you need action in an action RPG.

110
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,226
Second, we have randomly generated levels.

111
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,047
Now this is secret sauce for sure.

112
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,928
There were games like Titan Quest that came out

113
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,830
where I played through it and said, this is amazing.

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,011
This is the new game I'm gonna play.

115
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,332
And I started my second play through

116
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,753
and didn't get a quarter of the way through it

117
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,754
because I played it before as far as I was concerned.

118
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,316
And so random levels dramatically help people

119
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:17,977
replay the game.

120
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:19,198
And when you want a game to be played

121
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,700
for 10 to 20,000 hours over the life cycle

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,701
of some of your longest users,

123
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,363
it needs to have the randomness that enables them

124
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:26,904
to play each individual tile set

125
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:28,025
two or three or 400 hours worth.

126
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,117
of gameplay.

127
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,202
And so I'll be talking a bunch more about random level generation later on in the talk.

128
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:37,926
I understand that procedural generation got a bit of a bashing in the last few years because

129
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:42,472
some games have not used it particularly well, but used carefully with a lot of good theming,

130
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:43,513
it can work really well.

131
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:45,775
So next we have randomly generated items.

132
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,577
Now I kind of wanted to just do an items talk,

133
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,018
like just focus on this one for an hour,

134
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,799
and I think I could do a good job of that,

135
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,281
but I'm gonna briefly say that if you get

136
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,803
your random item system good, it makes your game replayable.

137
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,885
And the reason why is because in these kind of games,

138
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:59,506
your items are your progress, right?

139
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:01,167
The character level number doesn't matter so much.

140
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,569
No one really cares if you got to level 97 or 94.

141
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,631
What they care about is the cool items you found out

142
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:06,672
that you got on the way.

143
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:08,954
And the other nice thing about randomly generated items

144
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:10,495
is it's not just a linear progression

145
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,296
where the player knows they've got three items left to go

146
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:12,977
and then they're finished.

147
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:18,079
We're dealing with ones where the stats are all over the place, who knows what the next best item is, how far it can be pushed.

148
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,001
And because of that you get this cool diminishing returns, so that players really appreciate the small upgrades they find.

149
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,162
Because it's a 1% power increase for their character, but it makes them so much better than more of their friends.

150
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,923
The next one is a secure online economy.

151
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,305
Now this is one of the things that sounds obvious, clearly games need a secure online economy.

152
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,926
But if it's obvious, why does everyone screw it up so badly?

153
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:39,408
Like, the first thing is, so many games these days just remove trade.

154
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:42,330
They're like, oh, there's gold sellers, we can't deal with that, we're just gonna get rid of trade.

155
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,591
This is not the right direction.

156
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:47,573
You need to have trade in your games that are about items, because that way the items have some value.

157
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,475
If you find an item, and you're the only person that can ever consume that,

158
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:53,757
it's not really something that you've achieved that you can actually, like...

159
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,158
feel good about having, it doesn't have any weight to it.

160
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,240
If you get a game where you get an item that you could give to your friends

161
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,422
if you wanted to, but you're not going to because it's your item, but you could give it to them,

162
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,003
that's something you feel good about having.

163
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,165
And the ability for the item to actually transact with other players

164
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:11,308
is a critical part in that item having worth in the economy and representing your accomplishment.

165
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,790
The second part of this is the secure part, which again sounds obvious, but so many games these days,

166
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,672
often from console developers who aren't used to proper secure client or server authoritative code,

167
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,373
write their games in such a way that it's really easy to exploit them, there's dupe methods,

168
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,095
there's various dumb stuff that goes on with the PC versions, you know, there's...

169
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:34,389
There's a lot of horror stories there, but the key takeaway is that there are very few games that actually respect items to the degree that we try to.

170
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,311
We want to make sure this is an online economy where the items are sacrosanct.

171
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:39,092
They are the progress of the players. They're going to matter.

172
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:41,933
We don't invalidate them too quickly with new releases of content.

173
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:45,995
It's a big rant that you can tell I feel passionately about, but needless to say, get your items right.

174
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,916
Anyway, the final one is deep character customization.

175
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,618
This is merely the fact that if you have thousands and thousands of ways of playing your game,

176
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,679
then when someone comes back to play it the second, third, fifth time,

177
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,420
they have a different way that they can play it.

178
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,521
And in some games where they just have a few simple character classes,

179
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,602
and it's pretty straightforward,

180
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:04,343
you'll play it with the first class, then you'll play it with the second one, then the third,

181
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,424
and eventually you run out of new classes you haven't tried.

182
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:10,065
Path of Exile tries very hard to make sure the class doesn't actually matter that much,

183
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,706
it's more about what you're doing with it.

184
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:19,051
Anyway, so there's the Preach E5 design pillars, and we felt that many of those other games that were released failed in a few areas, right?

185
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,693
They didn't have the secure servers, they didn't have the random levels, the items were bad, and so on and so on.

186
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:26,977
Very fun games to play through, totally worth their money, but not something you can actually sink your 20s into.

187
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:32,847
All right, so the next, yep, the next topic is,

188
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,929
we wanted to run this as a games as a service.

189
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:35,970
This is something we knew back in 2006,

190
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,871
though we didn't know the buzzwords for it,

191
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,753
but it was something where we looked at Diablo II

192
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,855
and they had tens of thousands of people

193
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:44,697
coming back per realm for each one of their ladder resets.

194
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,599
People were excited to jump back into that game

195
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,400
because of the fresh economy and keep playing,

196
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,701
even though the game was not being

197
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,162
substantially updated during that time.

198
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,344
There was a single expansion, a few tiny balance patches.

199
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:58,130
no real additions. So we felt if we update our game every week with new items, new

200
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,157
Keystone passives, new skills, and we keep Path of Exile updated incredibly fast. How can we not grow? This was the plan

201
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,119
I mean, this is you know, 12 years ago now that we're planning it

202
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,307
And this analysis also helped make us realize that we'd be economically viable at 10,000 average concurrent users

203
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,309
So that means if you sample a number of players online

204
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,110
And if there's 10,000 on average, we'd be totally fine.

205
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,831
We were running a skeleton crew out of New Zealand,

206
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,012
very few people on the team.

207
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,793
We paid for the game ourselves.

208
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,393
We didn't have any investors or publishers

209
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,514
and all that kind of stuff back then.

210
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:27,175
And we felt 10,000 people is enough to generate

211
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,396
from cosmetic microtransactions,

212
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,377
enough people to generate enough money

213
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,178
to pay for the game service, to pay for development,

214
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,179
to pay for the costs, and then have some money

215
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,920
left over for ourselves if the business goes well.

216
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,141
And so that was our target.

217
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,661
We were aiming low and we tried to hit it.

218
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:43,464
So, we scaled up from a team of three friends in my garage

219
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,224
to this motley crew of 18 guys.

220
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:47,224
This is a terrible photo I got on Google Image Search.

221
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,145
These are the initial part of Excel team

222
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,165
that launched the open beta.

223
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,686
We had like one person per department basically.

224
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,606
And we spent six years on it.

225
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,847
And so when we launched, it went really well.

226
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,127
We have two key stats there.

227
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,888
There was massive internet virality.

228
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,868
We had 70,000 peak concurrent users.

229
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,888
This is like pre-Apex Legends kind of numbers.

230
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,789
At 1.5 million signups, we're on top of the world, right?

231
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:09,890
Like our random garage game had just suddenly

232
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,270
like hit a.

233
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,432
And so we were very keen to see what happened with the player numbers.

234
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:17,095
So they declined. And it's not unexpected, right?

235
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:19,917
Like, you know, you release a game and everyone knows the numbers go down eventually.

236
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:22,939
And so they declined from 70,000 concurrence to 10,000.

237
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,180
Which is great, because we're happy with 10,000. That's where we want to be.

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,743
So this is still good news, you know. It was popular and had declined.

239
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,813
point out on the graph where the weekly patches were.

240
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,753
Well, they were every week all the way through there,

241
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:34,814
and they made no difference.

242
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,194
Like we never, and to this day,

243
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,495
have never seen a rise in player numbers

244
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,135
due to changing a small thing about the game.

245
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,175
It's all about the big changes.

246
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,556
So we switched to doing three weekly updates

247
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:44,496
because one week patches

248
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,137
just completely paralyze your studio.

249
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:49,017
You dream about the patch cycle every day, and it's bad.

250
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:50,818
Anyway, so at this point,

251
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,239
we'd declined from 70,000 to 10,000 users.

252
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,359
The business is still going well.

253
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,559
We're making some money for once,

254
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:56,420
and things are looking great.

255
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,794
But we need to get our user numbers back up.

256
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:01,595
We've tasted the sweet fruit of 70,000 concurrent users

257
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,275
and being at the top of the Steam charts

258
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:03,915
and all that kind of stuff,

259
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:04,896
and we need to get back up there.

260
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:06,456
And so we figured, well,

261
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,416
we know that economy resets are important.

262
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,017
They were critically important in Diablo II,

263
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:11,217
so let's release some leagues.

264
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,917
And the way leagues work in Path of Exile

265
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:14,958
is that they are basically economy resets.

266
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,758
In this case, it's the Anarchy and Onslaught League.

267
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,179
The Anarchy one adds some rogue exiles to the game,

268
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,779
which are some bad guys you get to find occasionally,

269
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,279
and Onslaught made the monsters attack

270
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,040
and move more quickly.

271
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,263
We also put some challenges in there, and this logo is from the challenge t-shirt that we gave out to the top 50 people.

272
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:32,905
And those t-shirts are like $1,500 on eBay now, I think? Anyway.

273
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:39,029
So we gave some t-shirts out to the top players at the start, and this motivated people to perform well in these leagues.

274
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:42,691
And so the result of this was a hefty 40% increase in player numbers.

275
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:46,394
We released this content, 40% extra players come back, it's validated.

276
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:52,217
Except when you look at it in the grand context, that's 40% of somewhere near the 10k mark, and then it declined below 10k.

277
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,520
So we learned to ourselves, we learned that challenge leagues are important, they bring players back, people care,

278
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,801
but we did a really terrible job at marketing these.

279
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:04,344
A lot of people don't even remember the release, we put them in, we just turned the leagues on basically with a thing on our website.

280
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,846
And so we learned that you have to bundle these economy resets with significantly marketable content,

281
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,788
like new characters, new acts, all that kind of stuff, because then the players and journalists will want to talk about it.

282
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:19,875
The good news is, since we entered open beta, we've been working on a new character and a new half of an act.

283
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:22,338
And so that's what Path of Exile 1.00 was.

284
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:28,244
This is the Scion character class, and that's the Act 3x, as we called it, second half of Act 3 in the background there.

285
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:30,126
And this is the official 1.00 launch.

286
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,009
And our goal was to get back up to 70,000 concurrent users and keep them.

287
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,312
And so we launched on Steam, we dropped all this content in.

288
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,574
And I have to note, you can't launch on Steam in 2013

289
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,075
when it actually works really well for marketing.

290
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,176
You can't do that every day.

291
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,338
And nor can you make this amount of content every day.

292
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:44,998
It took a long time.

293
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:46,380
Use the numbers.

294
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,321
Back up to 70K just like we wanted.

295
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:50,723
Holding steady, we're feeling really good.

296
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,624
This time we know what we're doing, got a lot of experience.

297
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:53,785
The numbers are staying up there.

298
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:54,666
It's awesome.

299
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,497
Okay, so they went down again, that's fine,

300
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:58,757
games do this, right?

301
00:11:58,777 --> 00:11:59,838
Like everyone's game goes down.

302
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,819
And that bump there is Christmas, by the way.

303
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,160
I don't have a pointer, but the one on the right

304
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,721
is the effect of Christmas, if you're interested

305
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,261
to see what that looks like in a declining game.

306
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,862
So we realized here that we needed,

307
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,403
it's the only thing that causes player numbers

308
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:13,504
to ever go up, by the way, without releasing new content.

309
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,905
Anyway, so we realized we needed more content.

310
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,986
So we started work on our first Path of Exile expansion

311
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,147
called Sacrifice of the Vile.

312
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:22,373
Sacrifice of the Vaal introduced new endgame bosses

313
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,593
and introduced side areas and Vaal skill gems

314
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:26,194
and a couple of new leagues and all the things

315
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,094
a Path of Exile expansion needed roughly.

316
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:29,154
And how did it do?

317
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,075
Well, that's the bump on the right there.

318
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,735
It's reasonable, we got some more users,

319
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,895
we got some more money, things are good.

320
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,396
Like I have to stress, morale at the company is excellent.

321
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,556
We control our own destiny, everything's awesome,

322
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:39,537
people are having a good time,

323
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:41,037
it's great running this game as a service

324
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,237
for almost every team member.

325
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:43,398
It was their first released game.

326
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:45,498
We're on top of the world and we're finding

327
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,518
that releasing expansions bumps the player numbers up.

328
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,799
So now we have a button we can push

329
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:49,899
that makes the player numbers go up.

330
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,761
So let's push it a bunch more times.

331
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:54,604
We decided to scope out the second expansion to be bigger,

332
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:58,789
because the key question is, what is the cadence and size that we need to hit for these Path of Exile expansions?

333
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,591
Right? We're all scientists, we want to optimize this.

334
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,980
So, Forsaken Masters comes along.

335
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,221
This is an expansion that augmented the game thoroughly

336
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,942
all the way through with these master missions

337
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,324
and there's like customizable player housing

338
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:09,984
and that kind of stuff.

339
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:11,305
It was a good expansion.

340
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,606
And it took about five months to make.

341
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,587
And during which time the player numbers

342
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,648
were pretty flat down the bottom.

343
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,429
But the spike was bigger.

344
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,190
So bigger expansion, bigger spike.

345
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,951
This is looking good.

346
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,792
We have a bigger button we can press if we want to.

347
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,713
But this is tricky because it took longer to make.

348
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,214
So is it even worthwhile sitting at 10,000

349
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,915
concurrent users for so long?

350
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,496
So we decided that we would try an even bigger expansion

351
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,716
while interleaving some smaller updates in.

352
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,697
So we started work on,

353
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,817
well, started work isn't completely correct

354
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,938
because the ACT content guys have been working on this

355
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,058
since we finished ACT 3X,

356
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:42,959
but we formalized the Path of Exile The Awakening expansion,

357
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,159
which is Path of Exile 2.00.

358
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,020
It adds ACT 4 to the game.

359
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,720
It adds a whole bunch of cool new stuff.

360
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,660
There's socketable jewels that go in the passive tree.

361
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,641
We completely rewrote our networking code,

362
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,921
all sorts of cool stuff that players were gonna love.

363
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,002
And we didn't tell them about it yet

364
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,462
because we're waiting until we can show them

365
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:57,162
something impressive.

366
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:01,885
And so this is going on in the background, and we know it's going to be a big spike, or at least that's the theory according to this.

367
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:03,546
But let's try some stuff in the meantime.

368
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,808
Two more leagues. This is Torment and Bloodlines.

369
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:11,892
And we released these alongside some probably pretty misguided PvP stuff that we did in December of 2014.

370
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:16,735
And they were okay. Like, the numbers jumped up again.

371
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:19,197
Kind of proportional to the size of the content. In this case...

372
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:23,363
In this case, the Torment and Bloodlines leagues were worthy of a spike about that big.

373
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,467
Certainly not as important as the bigger spikes from the bigger updates.

374
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,093
So far this is validating the thing. Release bigger content, get bigger spikes.

375
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:33,117
But we're able to make them pretty easily while working on other stuff.

376
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,159
So we're pretty happy with this.

377
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:37,166
All right, next up is the one month league experiment,

378
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,468
called being really desperate to get your players back

379
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:40,629
and then calling it an experiment

380
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:41,890
five years later retroactively.

381
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,013
So we decided to try some one month leagues

382
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:45,854
to see what would happen.

383
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,816
The idea is we just put some cool game modes on there,

384
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,177
it doesn't take a lot of development work,

385
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,238
and we'll see what happens.

386
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,740
Maybe one month is the ideal cadence

387
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,821
for Path of Exile releases.

388
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,283
So there's the two one-month leagues at the end there.

389
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,664
It's hard to tell where the second one is.

390
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,666
And this is because your players quickly get inoculated to this kind of stuff.

391
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,448
One month is not enough time to play Path of Exile and enjoy all the stuff,

392
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:03,669
especially for the slower players.

393
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,771
There wasn't new content, there was no marketing.

394
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,632
A lot of people here probably don't know we did them.

395
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,514
The second one was Dark Shrine, by the way.

396
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,175
A fan favorite with like 10 people.

397
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:12,716
I mean, you can see it at the bump there.

398
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:13,377
Anyway, so...

399
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:17,240
This was kind of a failed experiment as far as we were concerned.

400
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,982
It was keeping the players somewhat entertained, like the core audience was good,

401
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,684
but you can see the graph there is trending downwards throughout 2014.

402
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:25,086
This is the point where we're getting a little bit concerned.

403
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,728
We're still over 10k, you know, we're still making money and it's profitable,

404
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,309
but it's not looking great.

405
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,690
Like, this is the point where we have to question,

406
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,232
do we just make another game instead?

407
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:32,932
Like, what's going on?

408
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,714
But we had the Awakening coming out.

409
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:35,995
That was Path of Exile 2.0.

410
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,096
So that was the saving grace.

411
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:38,216
We wanted to see how that performed.

412
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,651
So, we finished The Awakening, got it released,

413
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:44,295
and it had a big spike, exactly as we had expected

414
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,376
because it was a lot of content.

415
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:47,419
So this is like, everything on this graph says

416
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,181
that the more work you do, the better the results are,

417
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,883
which is great, that's a good moral to live by.

418
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:53,707
And the problem was, this just wasn't sustainable for us.

419
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,930
We had this awful situation where...

420
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,173
We'd work really hard to release some stuff, the player numbers would spike up briefly,

421
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,757
then they're back down to the borderline unprofitable mark, and we have to make more content.

422
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,538
And we just get to press the button really infrequently.

423
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,180
We wanted to change the whole paradigm.

424
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,042
So let's look at what we've learned so far.

425
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:13,066
Number one, economy resets. That's the key thing here for Action RPG.

426
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,727
If you start a fresh server, everyone rushes in, they take time off work, they want to

427
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,948
get to level 100 the fastest, they find all the good items.

428
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:20,648
Economy resets are amazing.

429
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:25,749
They're an opportunity to have a fresh start and a fair playing field for players.

430
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:29,590
If you've disengaged from the game, the economy restart is the perfect time to get back into

431
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,071
it because it lets you have an equal footing with other people who are much better than

432
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:34,211
you.

433
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:37,152
You believe you're better than them and everyone's happy until they're not.

434
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,753
So economy resets were great. The next note was about small content patches.

435
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:45,254
They never helped us in any way actually increase player numbers. Now don't get me wrong,

436
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:50,376
releasing content is always good for the game, right? At the beginning when we're doing one weekly updates and adding new items and skills,

437
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:53,457
that's vitally important to have the game actually have some content for people to play,

438
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:57,478
but it never moved the numbers up. And the reason why is there are two benefits to content.

439
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,200
The first one is it makes your game better,

440
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,581
and the second one is marketing.

441
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,663
And you want marketing when you're doing this kind of thing

442
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:03,764
and trying to get your graphs higher.

443
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,085
And so it's very important,

444
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,286
if you batch your content together,

445
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,708
you get both the marketing and making the game better.

446
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,770
So it's gotta be above a threshold

447
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,971
of people wanting to talk about it.

448
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,872
When we release Path of Exile expansions now,

449
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,074
people will message each other excitedly to say,

450
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,435
look at this cool stuff in Path of Exile.

451
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,856
It goes to the top of overall Reddit.

452
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:19,877
It does all that kind of good stuff.

453
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,919
Back then, no one was calling anyone

454
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,641
when you release a single new skill gem.

455
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,642
And journalists were not covering it, but they are now.

456
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:28,564
The next thing is balance changes during a league.

457
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,525
If you decide you want to fix something,

458
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:31,626
you know, to make the game better,

459
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:33,807
then the people who are doing that thing will be angry.

460
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,348
And if you make something more powerful

461
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:36,188
because it was too low,

462
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,929
the people not doing that thing are angry

463
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,850
because they missed out on choosing that character build.

464
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,772
And so basically making any kind of mid-season tweaks

465
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:44,573
is just a very negative experience

466
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:46,153
for a lot of players who care about fairness.

467
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,155
And so we learned to push these balance changes

468
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,095
to between the leagues,

469
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,576
because that's the point when players

470
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,756
are choosing what character to play.

471
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,718
They can see what's been reduced and what's been improved

472
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,258
and choose to play based on that.

473
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:59,388
The final story is one that I did not realize myself.

474
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:00,989
I wish I was smart enough to think of this,

475
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,590
but this actually came from Kriparian,

476
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,191
the awesome streamer who played a lot of

477
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:05,412
Path of Exile at the time.

478
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,633
And so Kriparian and I were chatting on Skype,

479
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,094
as I like to say that we did, occasionally,

480
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:11,856
and he said to me, you know what, Chris,

481
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:13,717
I've got a lesson for you that really helped me

482
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:14,777
with my streaming.

483
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,859
He said, every day, I will wake up

484
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,200
and I'll stream at a reliable time.

485
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm there, right at that moment.

486
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,121
And I'm gonna stream until a predictable time.

487
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,702
And then I'm going to work on my highlights video,

488
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,302
and I'm going to post that at a predictable time.

489
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,423
And then I'm back tomorrow doing exactly the same thing.

490
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,903
And I'm going to try not to take days off.

491
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,443
I'm just going to stream at these times.

492
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,084
And the reason he explained was because that way,

493
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,504
when someone comes home from work

494
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:34,724
and they're wanting to watch Kripparian,

495
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,185
if that's the time of day that he's streaming,

496
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,125
then they'll be able to watch him.

497
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:38,805
And if they want to watch a video before they go to bed

498
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,666
or whatever the timing is, it will be there.

499
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,006
And the day that it's not there

500
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,386
is the day they look on the internet and say,

501
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,147
what will entertain me?

502
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,187
What else is there in the world?

503
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,367
And they'll find some other thing,

504
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,087
maybe another streamer, maybe a TV show.

505
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,728
And now that's the thing they're doing for entertainment.

506
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:54,173
and he felt that his numbers dropped significantly if he deviated from his very rigid schedule.

507
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:57,237
Now, you know, he's a powerhouse of streaming, right? He's amazing.

508
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,761
And he recommended that we do a similar schedule with Path of Exile.

509
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:03,964
Because he said, look at your graph of what you've actually done in 2014.

510
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,028
I made this graph, not him. But this is...

511
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:11,712
It was all over the place, right? We've got medium leagues at 20 weeks, big ones at 16,

512
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:15,796
they arbitrarily get small and close together. No Path of Exile player is going to think anything

513
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:18,998
other than, is that game dying? Like, what's going on with them getting smaller and what's

514
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:23,242
with the timing? No one can predict anything. And so he strongly suggested we have a rigid schedule

515
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:26,244
because that way it's more convenient for him because then he knows when to stream it,

516
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:29,347
but it's also convenient for everyone else. And so we tried this out.

517
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,930
So this was our new schedule, the new era of leagues,

518
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,510
as it's called.

519
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,111
And so they're every 13 weeks.

520
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,512
So this means exactly four of them fit into a year.

521
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,173
That means that we know that they're going to be

522
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,475
on the second weekend of the final month

523
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:42,775
in each quarter or whatever we do.

524
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,456
And this perfectly fits having one a few weeks

525
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:46,718
before Christmas and a week before GDC

526
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:47,798
and a week before E3.

527
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,819
It just matches everything and it's great.

528
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,801
So we started doing this and we were initially

529
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:52,641
doing some pipelining.

530
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,962
We work on a small one while working on a bigger one

531
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:55,623
in the background.

532
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,004
And then in the second part of the cycle,

533
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,805
we release the big one and then repeat this.

534
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,308
And that enabled us to experiment with scope and so on,

535
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:03,813
because at this point we still weren't 100% sure

536
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:05,796
how large these had to be to have the correct effect.

537
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,278
We were pretty sure 13 weeks,

538
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:09,722
which is roughly three months, was the right amount of time.

539
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:12,527
So, that was the new schedule.

540
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:17,262
Now the key philosophy here is players will stop playing your game.

541
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,183
That's unavoidable.

542
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,606
At some stage something's going to happen that makes them stop playing.

543
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:23,929
They get a new job or whatever, they get burned out, another game comes along.

544
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,893
But the key thing is to give them a lot of opportunity to re-engage.

545
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:29,636
And that means they have to really clearly know when the next coming back.

546
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,760
It is inexcusable for a player to be able to leave your game without knowing the date

547
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,102
that they are returning to it, as far as we're concerned with this.

548
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,285
And so that's why we want to make sure that users quit with a plan to come back.

549
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,967
Because before we clearly signaled when the next release was,

550
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,069
players would get horribly burnt out and then they would just never play again.

551
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:47,490
Whereas now, they can quit before they get burnt out.

552
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,192
They can say, you know what, I've finished this league, I've seen this stuff,

553
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:51,593
I'll just come back for the next one.

554
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:54,015
And that's amazing for us because then the users are fresh,

555
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,977
they get chances to play their AAA games or Fortnite or whatever they do,

556
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:58,758
and it works really well.

557
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,800
Also, we monetize very heavily towards the start of our leagues.

558
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,223
That's where we introduce new cosmetic microtransactions and supporter packs and so on.

559
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,165
So it honestly doesn't matter a lot if we lose users right at the end,

560
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:11,508
because they'll come back and monetize again at the beginning of the next league.

561
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:13,668
So let's have a look at some results.

562
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,871
So this tiny little bump at the bottom

563
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,454
is the same size as roughly Forsaken Masters was.

564
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,616
Just for, I've rescaled this because it's foreshadowing.

565
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,979
Anyway, so this was Talisman, right?

566
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,922
Talisman was a great league, it was a decent size.

567
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,984
If we could release Talisman every three weeks,

568
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,246
every three months, I'd be pretty happy.

569
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,888
And so Talisman went well.

570
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,490
And that was one of the small ones in our cycle.

571
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,053
All right, so the next one was the Ascendancy slash Parandas update.

572
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:38,136
This was a bigger one because as you saw, we're going small, big, small, big.

573
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,859
So, so far there's no unexpected results, right? Small, big, all good.

574
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,222
Next one is a small one again because it was Prophecy which wasn't as big.

575
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,744
But you'll notice it was actually a little bit bigger than Talisman.

576
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,726
So, this is how we rationalize. The numbers went down,

577
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:51,409
but in a good way, right? Because they're bigger than the previous small one.

578
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,810
And then sure enough, we released the next big one,

579
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,690
nothing surprising.

580
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,551
This is Atlas of Worlds and Essence League.

581
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,072
And at this point, we decided we hated pipelining

582
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,553
because we're getting so much attention split

583
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:02,333
between these two leagues.

584
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:04,374
We wanted to see what happens if we just focus

585
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,674
on one thing at a time and do it well.

586
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,535
So we said, if we could make one thing, what would it be?

587
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,696
So we made Breach, and Breach is very popular,

588
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,297
and it was our best release ever.

589
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,037
So then we said, well, what are we gonna make next?

590
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,038
What about Legacy?

591
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:15,538
So we made Legacy, best release ever.

592
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:23,863
And at this point, the background process of making a new act that trundles along all ways in Path of Exile's background had Act V almost ready.

593
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:28,425
That's the 3.0.0 expansion, the fall of Oriath, and that was sitting in our back pocket ready for release, so we did.

594
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:31,067
And that was huge. Definitely our best release ever.

595
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:33,936
We were feeling really good at this stage.

596
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,717
User numbers are big, we just launched in China,

597
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:37,538
we've just launched on Xbox.

598
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,859
This is just PC here and it's already very high,

599
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,219
dwarfing all our previous results.

600
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,020
And so the question is what would happen

601
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,481
with our 13-week cycle going forward?

602
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,842
Now we knew, and this happened,

603
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,063
we knew that the next release would not be as tall as 3.0

604
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,524
because it was just a regular 13-week cycle.

605
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,184
It wasn't an entire expansion

606
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,345
that took 18 months and 80 people to put together.

607
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,238
The war for the Atlas one was not as big as 3.0,

608
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:02,440
but it was bigger than the previous expansion before that.

609
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:05,142
And then Bestry, and then Incursion,

610
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,203
and it just keeps climbing.

611
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,824
The 13-week cycle is working really well.

612
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:10,066
Then we released Delve, which was great,

613
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,407
and actually down a little bit,

614
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,908
which we're not blaming on Delve,

615
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,689
because it's probably a lack of retention

616
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,070
during Incursion or something like that.

617
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,092
And we're a little bit disappointed it was down.

618
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:19,273
Like, this is the point we are questioning,

619
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:21,114
you know, is this parabola finally, like, hit the top?

620
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,671
But betrayal was really, really, really big.

621
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,773
And so when you look at it in the context

622
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:28,855
of all of the Path of Exile history,

623
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,656
you can see that we were clearly declining.

624
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,618
There's no argument about that for the first few years,

625
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:33,999
and then really clearly climbing.

626
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,981
And so this is the brunt of what I'm now gonna talk about

627
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:37,822
for the rest of the talk,

628
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,124
is what we do to actually make these,

629
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:42,105
and how we scope them out,

630
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,346
and how we deliver them fast enough.

631
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:44,687
Okay.

632
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,185
I'm gonna go through the marketing page

633
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,566
for Path of Exile Synthesis,

634
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,726
which is our most recent release.

635
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,107
And what I'm gonna focus on specifically here

636
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,709
is the way that we target specific groups

637
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:56,609
of Path of Exile users.

638
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:58,190
Because everyone likes something about the game,

639
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,411
that's why they're playing it.

640
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,492
And so we've identified a big set of categories

641
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:02,472
of things that people enjoy.

642
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,213
We've broken all the players into psychographics,

643
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:06,615
and we're gonna target each one with a specific slide.

644
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,616
And the goal here is when they're reading through the page,

645
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,237
they'll look at the features, they'll say, oh this is cool.

646
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,737
And then they'll find the thing that clicks for them.

647
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,018
They'll find the reason they're playing,

648
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:14,439
and they'll say, whoa, that's good.

649
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,639
Okay, time to tell all my friends.

650
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:20,638
So first of all we start setting the scene, the setting and the story and new characters and so on.

651
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:24,682
And there are players who really like discovering about the story in a league.

652
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,666
This is the thing that turns them on and makes them want to play, and so we lead with that.

653
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:29,488
And at this point some players are going to say,

654
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:33,673
OK, cool, this looks really nice. It's got this awesome blue portal and this dude and you can explore memories.

655
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,215
I'm going to go and get excited about it.

656
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:40,235
The next thing we do is we talk about a unique gameplay mechanic in combat that we've introduced.

657
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:44,218
In this case, it's the ability to explore these decaying memories and run away from this wall of decay.

658
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:48,241
And this is something that for many players, that changes completely how Path of Exile plays

659
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:51,403
because now they're running away from the decay wall, they've got to use movement skills differently.

660
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:54,245
And this is a thing which causes them to become excited

661
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:57,407
because that group of players loves the idea of combat being slightly different.

662
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:01,795
The next group of players don't necessarily care about the story, they don't necessarily

663
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,878
care about combat, they care about long-term meta progression within a league.

664
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,720
The concept of building something up over time.

665
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,624
And so we often implement kind of meta mechanics in Path of Exile which are like games unto

666
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:11,164
themselves.

667
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,888
And this really appeals to types of players who want a meta layer on top of the regular

668
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:15,248
gameplay.

669
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:20,160
And so for example, in Synthesis, you could get these puzzle pieces that you connect together

670
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,661
a bit like Carcassonne and explore the memory map with that.

671
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,141
And this is entirely a meta mechanic.

672
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:27,382
It doesn't have any impact on the actual moment-to-moment gameplay of the game.

673
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,504
This just dictates how you access the advanced content of the league.

674
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:34,025
And that really appeals to groups of players who want to make sure they're doing a different

675
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,165
meta thing with each league.

676
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:39,097
Next we have what I call endgame aspirational content.

677
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,618
So these are like final boss fights.

678
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:41,759
They're really hard to get to.

679
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,740
You've got to do a lot of meta progression to get there.

680
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,841
They're very difficult encounters.

681
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:46,721
They've got good rewards.

682
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,222
You have to learn the strategy of a fight.

683
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:49,282
They're big multi-stage ones.

684
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,303
And they take a lot of development time to make.

685
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,325
And they're only accessed by maybe 10% of our players,

686
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,226
the top players who can get through to the end of the game,

687
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,426
get a chance to see this content.

688
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:03,089
And you may ask yourself, why are you guys spending like 20% of your development effort on something that affects 10% of players?

689
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,532
And the reason why is there are groups of players in there who want to know that there is content that only they can get to.

690
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:10,874
Stuff that's actually hard and they're an exclusive club for being able to do it.

691
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:17,417
And so those players will work incredibly hard to identify the content, work out how to get there, rush there as quickly as possible, build characters custom made for it,

692
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,701
do time runs, try to do it in hardcore, try to do it without getting hit, all of these things, and then repeat it over and over to get all the good items.

693
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:24,361
And so...

694
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:27,264
we found that it's incredibly useful to have this end game content,

695
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:30,426
even if not everyone gets a chance to experience it themselves,

696
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:35,390
because there's a good strong overlap between streamers and these top 10% of players,

697
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,251
because streamers are generally the better players in the game,

698
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:40,594
and so they can consume this content on stream and everyone else can watch and think,

699
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,276
oh, I wish I was that good, I wish I could get characters that strong

700
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,398
and be able to play the top Path of Exile content.

701
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:47,359
And so we try to appeal to that group there,

702
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:51,102
which has a lot of overlap with the rest of the player base from an aspirational point of view.

703
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:53,454
Next, we talk about league rewards.

704
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:54,794
Everyone loves finding items,

705
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:56,035
that's why they're playing these games,

706
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,336
and so we introduce new rewards

707
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,018
that synergize with existing systems in the game.

708
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,419
And this is for players who want to improve their characters

709
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,240
and find out how they're going to be subtly different

710
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,341
in terms of what items they're getting.

711
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,083
In this case, it's the fractured and synthesized items.

712
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,383
We talk about crafting.

713
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,184
There are Path of Exile players who love crafting.

714
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:13,885
There are ones who will be really bored

715
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:14,686
looking at all the other stuff

716
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:15,726
until we talk about crafting,

717
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,467
and then the world opens up with possibilities

718
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,829
of what kind of stuff they can make using the new systems.

719
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,291
And this is also important from a gameplay point of view.

720
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,893
As any Path of Exile players know here,

721
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:25,955
if you can get a head start on the crafting in the League

722
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,697
and make the best stuff before other players,

723
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:29,118
you're kind of the source of the best items

724
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:30,239
and the exalts come rolling in.

725
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,982
And so this is actually one of the power game strategies

726
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,225
here is to care about the crafting for Path of Exile.

727
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:39,049
We like to do meta balance changes.

728
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:41,090
So for example, we did a spell casting rebalance

729
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,691
and synthesis.

730
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:42,891
And one of the reasons we do this

731
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:45,733
is because there are players who will play the best character

732
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,254
build and only the best character build.

733
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,315
And if that's the same for two leagues in a row,

734
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,356
they're playing the same character

735
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,957
for two leagues in a row, which might be fine.

736
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,918
But it probably is boring to play the same character

737
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:54,759
for two leagues in a row.

738
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,920
And so it's really important that we mix things up.

739
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,121
I mean, hopefully not completely arbitrarily.

740
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,202
We're trying to solve problems here.

741
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,643
We're trying to take the things that are overpowered

742
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,524
and make them a bit worse and take the things that

743
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:05,345
haven't been used for a while and make them really exciting.

744
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:12,252
But this is very important because it means that people will get a chance to see different aspects of Path of Exile from league to league.

745
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,535
Now, an important thing here is it doesn't require developing new content.

746
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:17,197
We're literally just rebalancing and so on.

747
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:22,823
And that means we get to leverage all of Path of Exile's hundreds of existing skills and systems when creating,

748
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:25,445
and kind of make pseudo content by bumping it up to be top tier.

749
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:29,577
Having said that, it's very important that we actually do introduce new skills

750
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,778
in order to appeal to players who are keen to play a new powerful character

751
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,720
and want to make sure they're doing something snazzy that hasn't been released before.

752
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,462
And so we shine a spotlight on various new skills and archetypes of players

753
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:40,263
so that they...

754
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,625
so that players who enjoy playing what's new and hot

755
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:46,226
get a chance to clearly see what it is on the marketing page.

756
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,340
Finally, I know I've talked about item rewards,

757
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,321
but the items we're talking about here are subtly different.

758
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:53,182
And you can tell this game's got a lot of items in it.

759
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,583
And this is referring to the items

760
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:56,364
that regular monsters in the game can drop.

761
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,466
Just the idea of playing normal Path of Exile content

762
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:00,067
and many people wanting to know

763
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,248
that regular monsters drop more interesting stuff

764
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:02,608
than before.

765
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:04,509
There's new divination cards, there's new unique items,

766
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:05,430
there's new mods available.

767
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,371
This is really important because for some people,

768
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,652
they kind of ignore the league.

769
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:09,372
We put a bunch of F in it,

770
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:10,633
and they just want to play Path of Exile,

771
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:11,553
and they kind of ignore it.

772
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:12,374
And it's fine.

773
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,275
We just have to make sure that those people understand

774
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:16,316
there is more regular Path of Exile for you as well.

775
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,999
Now there's plenty more sections in our marketing materials, obviously, we try to sell them some stuff as well,

776
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,482
but that's completely irrelevant for this talk.

777
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:28,667
Here's the checklist of all the things that, for Path of Exile, we find are important to push to the players.

778
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,691
And so that's basically the scope of what one of these updates is.

779
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:34,954
Now if you've been involved in game production, you may ask,

780
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,637
that's an awful lot of work to do in 13 weeks, how do we do that?

781
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:38,879
And so the remainder of the talk...

782
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:40,827
which we have about 20 minutes.

783
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,510
The remainder of the talk is about how we achieve this

784
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,711
in a 13-week cycle.

785
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,132
So I'm gonna give you a bunch of advice.

786
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,535
Some of it is going to be a bit weird, but bear with me.

787
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:50,296
Okay, so let's start with the easy stuff.

788
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,398
Fast prototyping.

789
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:53,420
Obviously, you should do fast prototyping, right?

790
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,501
Why do I even have the slide?

791
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:55,842
Because it's actually really hard

792
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:56,943
and we fail at it all the time.

793
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:59,566
Like the fast prototype for synthesis came in really late.

794
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,187
I was initially gonna say how late,

795
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:02,408
but that's really embarrassing.

796
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,409
So let's just say it was late.

797
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,792
And that reduced the amount of iteration we could do.

798
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,774
And potentially that affected the quality of the league.

799
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:09,455
We're having to do a lot of catch-up work at the moment,

800
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:11,597
changing some mechanics based on the fact that our prototype

801
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:12,658
was not ready early enough.

802
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,502
Thankfully, the fast prototype for 3.7.0 has already been completed

803
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:18,324
and thrown away once and completed again,

804
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:19,585
and that's a really good process.

805
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,162
Try to do this right, it's the easy part.

806
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,463
Now to get on to some harder stuff.

807
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,705
Okay, procedural level generation.

808
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:29,446
This is a multi-hour talk that I'm condensing

809
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:30,187
down to a few minutes.

810
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,149
Okay, procedural level generation is critical

811
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:35,010
because your leagues, or whatever is appropriate

812
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,571
for your game, need new content for players

813
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:37,852
to actually play through.

814
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:39,354
And that means making new areas,

815
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:40,555
because you've got to go to new places.

816
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,516
But the traditional way of making levels in games

817
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,518
can be slow and involves placing a bunch of things around

818
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,159
and involving artists and taking time.

819
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,080
Let's try to make a level in 60 seconds.

820
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:52,305
So, I load up the tool and I draw a line across horizontally, which is a river,

821
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:55,488
and then I draw a path going downwards, which is the white path there,

822
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:56,630
and then I put forest around it.

823
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,074
And I press the button to say go, and it makes a path of XL level out of tiles.

824
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:05,321
and there's a river and a path intersecting, and the engine knows it can put a bridge there and all this fancy stuff,

825
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:08,742
and I click go again and I get a completely different one, and go again and I get a different.

826
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:11,464
So, by default here, it's producing random levels.

827
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:15,906
Now, these are relatively similar, because it's just a relatively simple one, but I'll make it more complicated.

828
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:19,988
So, I can then play this in-game, and sure enough, there's a pretty bridge over the river,

829
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:23,270
and it works out the direction of the water flow, and does all the fancy foam generation.

830
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,291
All this cool stuff just happens, because we've got mature tools for that now.

831
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,296
And so I say, okay, so this is a forest.

832
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:30,397
I need some stuff to fill it with.

833
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:32,318
So I make a set of tiles that can go in there,

834
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:34,739
some trees and some fallen over trees and bandit camps

835
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:35,940
and tents and some rocks.

836
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,381
And it puts them throughout the level.

837
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,722
And then I generate again and get a different set of stuff

838
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:40,962
and again and get a different one.

839
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:43,184
And the player story is subtly different each time.

840
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:44,825
The crossing is at a different place.

841
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:46,145
The bandit camp is in a different place

842
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:47,166
if it's even there at all.

843
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,867
And you have to bear in mind that this was like

844
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,188
literally just a cross in the editor,

845
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,369
like the simplest possible graph that took seconds to do.

846
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,091
So here's a real level from Path of Exile.

847
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,092
This is the river crossing that's to the left of Act 2 town.

848
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:03,034
And the way that this all works is instead of doing levels like this,

849
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:04,895
where you just make one and hope it's random enough,

850
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,877
you make like 20 different variations.

851
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:09,438
You have two rivers, you have five rivers, you have no rivers.

852
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:12,420
You have it so that there's multiple roads or a fork in the road.

853
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,520
You have all of these crazy things.

854
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,541
And then when the game is generating the level,

855
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,522
it picks which topology to use first,

856
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:19,424
and then it does the random generation within it.

857
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:21,225
And so you've got two levels of randomness there.

858
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:25,328
And so this is an example topology from the river crossings, and here's some examples of what it can make.

859
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:27,470
So, there are many ways across the rivers.

860
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,253
There's paths, there's broken paths, there's little stones, there are fallen logs and so on.

861
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:33,375
You've got various boss encounters in here.

862
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:36,718
You've got different exits going off into different levels, waterfalls, that kind of stuff.

863
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,220
Here's a completely different variation of it that's generated.

864
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,363
In this case, there's like a different user story as they play through and get different bosses and so on.

865
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:47,347
This one here has like an island in the middle with a big like thick copse of trees there.

866
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:50,188
And so this area feels different every time you play

867
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,128
and did not take the artists very long to do.

868
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,089
For Synthesis, we said, oh, we need like 50 or 60

869
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,309
of these areas made that the players can play through.

870
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,590
And we kind of need them right now, like today preferably,

871
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,390
because we have to actually like use them

872
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,651
to put the monsters in and playtest.

873
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,551
And so they took minutes to make each one.

874
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:05,491
I think it was like 20 minutes.

875
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:06,812
But the point is they did it pretty fast.

876
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,092
And that's something we can do

877
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,093
because of a procedural level generation tool suite

878
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,593
that we've made.

879
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,213
And I should note all of Path of Exile's tools

880
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:13,353
and engine are entirely custom.

881
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,334
Not something I necessarily recommend,

882
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:16,294
but it's great when you've got it.

883
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,033
Okay, so I'm now going to show you why the level generation is good in another way.

884
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,495
It understands about your league mechanics.

885
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,276
So this is Abyss.

886
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:27,318
This is where when you're playing through the area, there's a crack that you can follow

887
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,259
and monsters come out of it.

888
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,563
And so when we're generating the level, the generator can place the Abyss cracks throughout

889
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:36,006
the level in an interesting way, aware of the context of where players can go.

890
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:37,367
So that's an outdoors one.

891
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:38,468
This is an indoors one.

892
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,810
It will follow the paths and go through the doorways and along the little narrow walkways

893
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,253
and all that kind of stuff because it understands about the walkability because it just generated

894
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,094
this maze for you.

895
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,331
And so because of this, Abyss is a fun mechanic.

896
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,992
It's different every time you play it

897
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,794
because of the level that it's present in.

898
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:54,055
It's a completely different story.

899
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,897
And this kind of leads on to the next topic.

900
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:58,578
And this is a topic about

901
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,319
multiple overlapping axes of randomness.

902
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:01,080
Now to give an example,

903
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,481
imagine you're a Path of Exile designer,

904
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,222
your job is to make encounters like fights.

905
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:05,924
So you're sitting at your desk and I come over and say,

906
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:07,004
we need lots of these.

907
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:09,126
We have a encounter that needs a ton of variety

908
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,787
because we expect the players to play it like 500 times.

909
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:14,129
And you say, wait, wow, I can't make 500 variations of this.

910
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:16,791
So you try and you have 10 encounter types to start with.

911
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:18,612
You've got the one where the monsters drop down from the ceiling.

912
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:19,992
You've got the one where they crawl up the walls.

913
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:21,313
You've got the one where they teleport in.

914
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,234
You've got the one where they're in a big sphere that breaks open.

915
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:25,895
You do as many encounters as you can do and you hit about 10.

916
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,596
And then I say, look, 10 isn't enough.

917
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,137
I said 500 retries of this.

918
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:31,659
So you make another 10 and now they're getting diminishing returns

919
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
and it's really hard to think of them.

920
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,620
So that's the point where we add another axis.

921
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,042
In this case it's like, okay, well all of that was with spiders, let's make zombie versions.

922
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:41,103
So you make it so it can spawn zombies, and then bats, and so on and so on.

923
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,963
So that's another axis.

924
00:34:42,223 --> 00:34:43,844
And then we're like, okay, random bosses.

925
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,305
Randomly, some of these are going to be bosses.

926
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:48,486
So sure enough, the fight's no different because you get lucky or unlucky with how many bosses there are.

927
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,687
Then we're going to add some random mods to the fight, and so on and so on.

928
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:55,549
So each axis increases it, and it gets to the point where you've done five times the work,

929
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:59,330
but got ten thousand times the amount of randomness out, versus just making 50 encounters,

930
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,552
and then it gets boring once they've played all 50, which is the prophecy league.

931
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:03,412
Okay.

932
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:09,050
So, I'm going to show you a video of Breach, which is an example of a league with lots

933
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,711
of these axes.

934
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:13,655
So you tag this spooky hand, and it opens up a breach, which is kind of like a parallel

935
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,600
dimension where you fight these monsters, and if you kill them fast enough, the radius

936
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,644
keeps increasing, and it gets harder and harder to keep it open until it collapses.

937
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,527
Now there are good and bad things that can occur. This is a great breach because it's outdoors and

938
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:28,091
so you get a big circle you can kill a lot of monsters. This is an indoors one where you got

939
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:31,534
super unlucky and it's up against the side of the level and that's a bad breach because now

940
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:34,837
it's harder to fight all the monsters and that's okay because I'll look forward to the next good

941
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:39,761
one but there's way more axes. The monster density can vary, you can get these like special chests

942
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:40,282
that spawn.

943
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:45,144
very rarely within it, so you're lucky there's some chests up here that are like class pans that you can tag.

944
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:48,705
There are different varieties of flavour of Breach. You want to get the Chaos ones

945
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:52,526
rather than the Fire ones potentially because they've got better meta progression associated.

946
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:57,567
You can find Breach Lord bosses that maybe you do or don't want to spawn depending on how hard they are.

947
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,908
And so there's so many things that can happen inside of Breach,

948
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:02,969
you're always left feeling that the next one is going to be better

949
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:05,270
because you've never seen a perfect one on all axes.

950
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,881
All right, so let's talk about asset reuse.

951
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,082
This is another obvious thing.

952
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:12,303
If you're making a game like this,

953
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,443
as a games as a service model

954
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,784
where you want to make content really quickly,

955
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,206
then it's important to reuse your assets where you can.

956
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:19,368
It would be criminal to make entirely new assets.

957
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,809
The artist would be really, really,

958
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:21,750
really put to a lot of work.

959
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,031
So let's have a look at how we've done that in Path of Exile.

960
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:25,592
These are the same area.

961
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:27,534
On the right, we have like Kalm's lava cave,

962
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:29,395
and on the left, we have a plateau area.

963
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,617
Now, what we did is we removed the lava

964
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,498
and changed the environment lighting so it looks different,

965
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:34,439
but the tiles are the same.

966
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,040
I think many of the textures are the same as well.

967
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,981
That was really fast to do.

968
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,861
Now this is why you shouldn't add a day-night cycle to your game like this.

969
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:43,902
So many people make action RPGs and it's easy to add a day-night cycle.

970
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:46,603
So they do, because look at how awesome it is on the trailer to have to show off the

971
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,304
day-night cycle.

972
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:52,225
But that means you're throwing away the ability to hide versions of areas that use a different

973
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,486
environment elsewhere in the game.

974
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:57,287
As long as they're far enough away and look sufficiently different, then people will not

975
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,108
necessarily feel when they're playing through.

976
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:01,929
The players don't care in principle that you've reused content, they expect it.

977
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:03,249
But they care when they can notice it.

978
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,676
And so if you have a day-night cycle for each of your areas,

979
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:07,442
you've thrown away so many permutations

980
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,669
you could use to add actual meaningful extra content

981
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,372
elsewhere in the game.

982
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:15,397
Here's another area where we took the icy glacier area,

983
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:17,158
I think this is the ascent area,

984
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:18,938
and we made it yellow and took the snow away

985
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:19,858
and now we've got a desert.

986
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:22,299
And so we do this extensively throughout the game.

987
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:25,059
I think like acts six through 10 show a lot of examples

988
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,740
of both this and actual new assets mixed together

989
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,320
in a way that's very hard to tell,

990
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,301
but was actually very, very cost effective

991
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,021
at making content.

992
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,081
Here's another example with monsters.

993
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:38,886
So on the left here you can see a green flying monster, you can see a spiker and a bone wheel skeleton.

994
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:41,929
And at the top you can see a random portal frame made of metal.

995
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,612
Now we had a sudden and urgent need for a pile of synthesis monsters that looked cool.

996
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:49,716
So we said, that metal stuff looks cool, let's take that and let's put it on the rigs of the monsters on the left.

997
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:53,838
And so sure enough, we immediately have instantly animated and rigged monsters we can use.

998
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:57,239
And all we had to do was give them new names, give them new sounds, give them new effects,

999
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:00,399
and give them new skills so they have a meaningful different combat interaction with the player.

1000
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,720
And then suddenly we had our synthesis monsters sorted out.

1001
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,781
To make monsters on the left involves spooling up an asset creation pipeline that involves

1002
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:11,502
concepting and high poly models and low poly models and texturing and all that UV stuff.

1003
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:12,503
And I don't know any of this.

1004
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:17,187
Animation rigging the whole works, you know getting effects. It takes months to make monsters

1005
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:19,089
But if you do this like cheap approach here

1006
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:23,974
You can make stuff that looks different than what you have in the game at the moment or relatively quickly and

1007
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:27,177
We often have to make monsters with days of notice when we're putting these leaks together

1008
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:32,342
So techniques like this really help and the best thing is these synthesis monsters don't feel like reskins

1009
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:35,745
They've got their own new skills and stuff. It isn't just a blue version of the flying thing

1010
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:37,447
It's like a cool metal version of the flying thing

1011
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:41,617
Okay, so now we're going to talk about content reuse, which is different than asset reuse.

1012
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:44,818
Because I'm talking about taking like a wholesale block of content and reusing it.

1013
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:47,639
So this is Breach, which I just showed you.

1014
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,300
And in the regular game, you'd find these hands and fight the monsters,

1015
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,741
and players understood it and they liked it.

1016
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:53,062
And then we...

1017
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:56,223
We turned the Breach League off and had them relatively scarce within the game, but it

1018
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:58,323
was available as a reward for later elsewhere.

1019
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:01,624
So when we did Incursion, sure enough, the Vile have been researching Breaches in the

1020
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:04,005
Temple of Atzoatl, and so you find Breaches in there.

1021
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:06,866
And when the player sees that purple hand, they immediately notice.

1022
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:10,127
They know exactly what it means in terms of the fact they're about to get a big fight

1023
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,168
and lots of monsters, lots of experience, lots of items.

1024
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:13,188
They understand the rewards.

1025
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:16,449
They understand that if you find Splinters inside the Breach, it lets you create Breach

1026
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,491
Stones, which lets you go and fight some endgame meta stuff entirely by seeing a purple hand

1027
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:20,671
there.

1028
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:23,846
This is a breach inside the Delve content.

1029
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,748
So deep underground, there's Purple Hands,

1030
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:26,969
and we just chuck it in there,

1031
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,472
and it's really, like, it's entirely positive for players.

1032
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,312
They hit a whole system

1033
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,554
that they really enjoy engaging with.

1034
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:34,837
Here we have some Harbinger fight in the regular game

1035
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:35,838
when that was a main league,

1036
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,280
and sure enough, you get the same fight

1037
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,381
deep underground in Delve,

1038
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:39,402
where there's a Harbinger portal

1039
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:40,383
that the monsters come out of,

1040
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,544
and it means you get access

1041
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:42,865
to all of the rewards for that league.

1042
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,122
This gentleman here is called Kadiro. He gives you bro deals for awesome items.

1043
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:50,984
He's like a traveling salesman and we used him in the Parandus League and in very little since then.

1044
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:58,028
But when we're designing betrayals rewards, of course one of the 200 or 300 outcomes has to be Kadiro's in a cage and he's very happy to do a deal with you.

1045
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:01,310
And this is cute because of course, like, why is he in a cage in this area?

1046
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,332
But it was something the players really liked because now when they want access to the Kadiro content,

1047
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:08,573
they know they can go and find him in this outcome and all of that stuff is available.

1048
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:14,857
So we found that wholesale content reuse has been incredibly useful at both bolstering the rewards in the game,

1049
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,878
but also making sure that players immediately say,

1050
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,419
oh, I know this, I know this, it's going to be great.

1051
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:22,481
Okay, so now is the time for us to talk about some more controversial lessons.

1052
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,042
This is the point where I get labeled crazy.

1053
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:26,543
Alright, so this is the quality curve.

1054
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,744
This is relatively obvious.

1055
00:40:27,784 --> 00:40:29,305
You have your work versus quality thing.

1056
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:30,645
And this has an asymptote.

1057
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:33,067
That means that you can never get to 100% quality.

1058
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,788
It's going to take infinitely long in terms of work,

1059
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,889
because people want more and more and more fixes.

1060
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,169
But you can get pretty close.

1061
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,892
The question is how far along the curve do you go?

1062
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:43,115
And when you're left with 13 weeks, you can't apply the

1063
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:45,437
when-it's-done philosophy, and you have to pick somewhere.

1064
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,620
So for example here, for 50% of the effort,

1065
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,841
you get 90% of the quality.

1066
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:51,444
Now I'm not saying to release games that are only 90% quality,

1067
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:53,967
but the way you do it is by putting the quality in the right places.

1068
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:55,428
Polish the things that matter,

1069
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:57,551
and don't care about the stuff that doesn't matter.

1070
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,472
Now this means that you have to make some very difficult decisions about what things to pay attention to

1071
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:06,833
and therefore the best skill for a developer to have on your team is the ability to know what actually matters.

1072
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:12,515
Relatively few people on the Path of Exile team are able to actually gauge that as accurately as we would like

1073
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:17,257
and so it's very important that we do focus everyone's efforts on the things that really, really pay benefits

1074
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,177
for the actual content we're releasing.

1075
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:23,379
And this is also why we hire our player base to be in the QA team and Dev team

1076
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:27,180
because Path of Exile players will understand what's important because they've played through it a whole bunch.

1077
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:28,615
and know how they interact with it.

1078
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:32,244
All right, pipelining, we tried it, we really did.

1079
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,145
We wanted to have two or three releases on the go at once

1080
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:36,265
and it just really failed.

1081
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,006
And we found several problems with this.

1082
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,927
The first one was that when we're focusing

1083
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:41,207
on too many releases at once,

1084
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:43,408
we always have an excuse to go and look at the other one

1085
00:41:43,428 --> 00:41:44,188
when things got hard.

1086
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,769
If you assign a developer, do all this stuff for release A

1087
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,690
and then maybe do this stuff for release B later,

1088
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,270
they'll work on A like they're meant to

1089
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,651
until they get stuck.

1090
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,471
And instead of then solving the hard problem,

1091
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,591
they would often say,

1092
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,172
oh, well, there's some easy stuff I can do on B,

1093
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:57,773
so I'll just work on that for a few hours instead

1094
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:58,413
to clear my mind.

1095
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:00,754
And that's great, but then A is completely stalled.

1096
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:02,555
And when you have precious few weeks

1097
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:03,576
in order to get this stuff done,

1098
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,317
you really can't handle those stalls.

1099
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:08,859
The second thing is, if you pipeline releases,

1100
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,280
you do not have time to react

1101
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,861
to what the game actually needs.

1102
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,382
By the time it's apparent that the game

1103
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:16,343
needs a new end game, you're like three quarters

1104
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:17,904
of the way through making a new beginning to it

1105
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,765
or something like that, because Reddit will suddenly decide

1106
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:20,866
there is a thing that needs fixing.

1107
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:22,547
And if you have the ability to say, yes sir,

1108
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:23,888
and get that done in 13 weeks,

1109
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,989
that's not even good enough some of the time for them.

1110
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:29,933
But having to spend like, you know, oh wait, wait, we've got the next two expansions almost finished, kind of,

1111
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:32,235
we'll do this one next year, it's just not going to work.

1112
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:34,217
The game is on fire until that thing is fixed.

1113
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,433
It's also important not to stall content for later.

1114
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:40,074
We get into a situation where we're like,

1115
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:41,896
we finished all the skills we said we were gonna make,

1116
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,819
and we've got two extra ones that got out of prototyping

1117
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,519
and they're kind of finished.

1118
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:45,100
Do we wait?

1119
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,401
Do we leave them for the next expansion

1120
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,182
so we have less to do?

1121
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:48,764
No, put them in the game now.

1122
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,687
The game needs to be in its best form now, all the time,

1123
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:52,988
because you don't get second chances.

1124
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:54,891
As much growth as possible every league,

1125
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:56,272
otherwise you'll start to decline.

1126
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:59,241
People express concern about creativity here.

1127
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:02,706
They say, look, Chris, you've got this plan for like another 10 years of Path of Exile

1128
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,888
with four releases per year.

1129
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:05,009
That's 40 more leagues.

1130
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,331
I can think of two good ones.

1131
00:43:06,352 --> 00:43:07,794
Where are we going to get 40 from?

1132
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:09,917
And I always refer them back to Magic the Gathering.

1133
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,683
They have released new sets, four per year or whatever,

1134
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:17,645
for so many decades now, like 26 years in or something,

1135
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,986
hundreds of these things, and there's always new ideas.

1136
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,068
It's amazing the fact they can go back to the well

1137
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:23,709
and find really cool, compelling stuff.

1138
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:25,970
And so whenever I hear that we're not gonna come up

1139
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,551
with another 10 or 20 or 30 of these,

1140
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:28,852
I go, they did 100, you know,

1141
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:32,174
and I'm certain we'll be able to, the well will refill.

1142
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,742
Now if you're a project manager, you're probably asking how we can make all of this stuff in 13 weeks.

1143
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:39,744
Because it's not just we start work and in 13 weeks later we release it.

1144
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:42,165
Consider how the schedule actually works in reality.

1145
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:45,427
So we release the content and now there's problems with it, right?

1146
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:49,169
Right now there's a bit of a fire where we're fixing some stuff with synthesis that the community didn't like.

1147
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,890
That's cool, we'll have that fixed early next week.

1148
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:53,532
But this has taken the first two weeks of the schedule to do so.

1149
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:57,294
So there's some time spent doing live ops work on the existing release you've done.

1150
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,095
Then you've got to prototype the new stuff, right?

1151
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,617
Ideally that's a bit pipelined in there, but still it takes time.

1152
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:04,259
It's going to be another week before we really know for sure what 3.7.0 is.

1153
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:06,980
So that's three weeks gone. Ten weeks left.

1154
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:11,203
And coming from the other end, we like to renounce our content three weeks before the end.

1155
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:14,685
We put our page up, we get the players hyped, they have time to tell their friends, there's a countdown.

1156
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:17,927
You know, it makes sense for people to book time off work. So that's three weeks gone there.

1157
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:21,530
We then have to actually do a press tour where we show all the journalist stuff.

1158
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,671
It's very important to actually do real marketing and PR.

1159
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,094
So we spend two weeks showing all the people stuff and preparing the marketing page.

1160
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,596
But in order to do this, we have to actually have content ready to show them,

1161
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:31,497
like a trailer and slides and this kind of stuff.

1162
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:32,498
And that takes a week.

1163
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,700
So now we've got this like four or five week window in the middle

1164
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,281
to actually make all of the stuff.

1165
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:38,562
And that's difficult.

1166
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,512
And that's where the next counterintuitive advice comes in.

1167
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:43,774
This is how you get your art so quickly.

1168
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,236
Create content you have no plan for.

1169
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:49,039
We have themed assets that we commission

1170
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,940
because we know one day we're keen to use them.

1171
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,162
And a great example of this is with the Betrayal League.

1172
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:55,324
We decided we're gonna make this very complicated

1173
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:57,406
evil organization with 19 members

1174
00:44:57,426 --> 00:44:59,448
who all have backstories and they all look different

1175
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:01,410
and they feel different from any Path of Exile characters

1176
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,090
we've had so far.

1177
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,833
But where are we gonna get 19 fully modeled, rigged,

1178
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:05,493
voice acted?

1179
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:08,494
fleshed out characters like that in three or four weeks.

1180
00:45:08,854 --> 00:45:11,375
And the answer was, we go to our giant store of content

1181
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:12,655
that we just have because we made it,

1182
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:14,176
and we pick a bunch of characters.

1183
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:16,176
We're like, this is a microtransaction armor set.

1184
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:18,097
We were gonna sell it, but if I put it on a bandit

1185
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:20,298
and sell it in two years, this is a new character.

1186
00:45:20,778 --> 00:45:23,719
And so, we found, we have just a catalog

1187
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:25,579
of Path of Exile stuff that the team have made

1188
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,320
because they can slot it into the art pipeline,

1189
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,320
which is going to have a place in the world one day,

1190
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,761
and we just pick some things for the league.

1191
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:32,321
And I'll give you another example.

1192
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:34,022
So this is not a real example.

1193
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:36,262
We are never going to do a Path of Exile expansion

1194
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:37,143
related to dragons,

1195
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:38,783
because we don't want there to be dragons in our world.

1196
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,764
However, if we decided one day that dragons were okay,

1197
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:42,684
we'd say to the team,

1198
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:44,004
hey guys, make some dragons,

1199
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,485
and tell me in a year when they're finished.

1200
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:46,505
And then there'll be dragons

1201
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:47,725
sitting there in the library of stuff.

1202
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:49,086
And when we're looking at league ideas,

1203
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:50,406
we're like, could we do dragons this time?

1204
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:51,226
Sure, how would that work?

1205
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:52,247
And when we hit the prototyping,

1206
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:53,387
the dragons are ready to go.

1207
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,808
And so we have so much stuff being made for the future.

1208
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,029
We have bits and pieces for expansions next year

1209
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:59,609
where we don't know what that expansion is,

1210
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,790
but we have an idea of a theme that we would like to do.

1211
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,991
And maybe it's finished early.

1212
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,111
Maybe we can use that this year.

1213
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,451
Maybe we can take a few of those assets

1214
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:06,752
for this current league, potentially.

1215
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,453
And it's just so good to have that giant library of stuff.

1216
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:11,934
Okay, so in conclusion.

1217
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,475
We initially released Path of Exile,

1218
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:15,757
kind of failed at getting any growth,

1219
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:16,798
then we turned things around

1220
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,421
with this aggressive 13 week schedule,

1221
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:20,544
and I've talked a lot about how we actually manage that

1222
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:22,647
and various takeaways that are a bit counterintuitive

1223
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:23,749
to regular industry advice.

1224
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,372
There's one last thing I'd like to end on.

1225
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:30,628
People quit Path of Exile while they're playing the league and come back in the next one.

1226
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:36,375
But what's fascinating is that the graph of people quitting accessing the community is a lot less steep.

1227
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:38,777
So the yellow line there is people quitting the game.

1228
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:40,479
It goes from 100% down to 20% by the end,

1229
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:42,902
because there really isn't much point in playing in the last week,

1230
00:46:42,942 --> 00:46:46,646
because the new thing's coming out a few days later and you're about to essentially have your progress reset.

1231
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:50,929
But people still use the website at no less than 50% of peak.

1232
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:53,630
And these are players who are still engaged in reading the patch notes,

1233
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,132
telling us we did it wrong, looking at all the changes, and buying stuff.

1234
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:01,254
People who are not playing the game will come back and buy microtransactions

1235
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:04,055
and supporter packs because they're available for when they next want to play.

1236
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:06,317
And this is amazing because this is actually what we care about,

1237
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:07,777
is keeping the community engaged.

1238
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:10,799
And that community is never going below 50% during the quiet periods.

1239
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,963
What's also interesting is the size of the community right at the end there, in terms of people accessing the website,

1240
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:19,065
is a perfect predictor for server numbers for the next league.

1241
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:23,568
So far, for like, you know, three years in a row, we've been able to predict server capacity for each launch

1242
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:28,172
because of just looking at the website activity and using some ratios, and that's worked really well.

1243
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:32,395
So anyway, the vindication we have with this whole plan is the fact that...

1244
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:39,630
The fact that year after year we've managed to both grow our player numbers, but also get to the point where people never really leave Path of Exile.

1245
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,711
They're still playing it, even if they say, I'm done with this league, I'll see you guys in a few months.

1246
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:46,293
We know they're coming back, and they reliably do, they reliably keep spending and having a good time.

1247
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:49,034
And this is the motivation we need to keep releasing quality content.

1248
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,354
All right, so slight plug, we're hiring.

1249
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:54,355
We're in New Zealand, so that's hard.

1250
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:55,616
It's hard to get work visas,

1251
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:57,517
and we don't pay as much as the Bay Area,

1252
00:47:57,577 --> 00:47:58,597
but if that's no problem,

1253
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,058
and you wanna work on Path of Exile

1254
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,038
and like everything you saw,

1255
00:48:01,098 --> 00:48:02,099
there's the contact details.

1256
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,320
And also, please fill out the speaker survey.

1257
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,501
It's very important to GDC

1258
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,781
so they can get high-quality speakers.

1259
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:08,902
And of course, I would love to answer any questions.

1260
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,804
Timeline-wise, it looks like we have like five

1261
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:14,545
or 10 minutes, so use the microphone

1262
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:15,686
if you would like to ask something.

1263
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:29,755
So first I just want to say thanks for making the game

1264
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:35,046
I've been playing since open beta and every league since it's just incredible kind of inspired me to enter this industry

1265
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:36,589
but my question is that

1266
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,611
You talk about reusing content and Path of Exile now.

1267
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:41,973
There's so many options in end game, right?

1268
00:48:41,993 --> 00:48:43,314
It used to be just grinding maps,

1269
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,436
but now we have lots of these meta systems

1270
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:46,276
that we can engage in.

1271
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:49,278
And I'm curious, with player retention,

1272
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:50,900
games like Warframe allow players to

1273
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,341
very specifically choose what they go into, right?

1274
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:55,223
They're like, I want to grind out this meta system

1275
00:48:55,303 --> 00:48:56,284
and make a lot of progress there,

1276
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,505
but in Path of Exile it feels widespread.

1277
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,707
Like you kind of progress in all things slowly

1278
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:01,988
as you work through the end game map system.

1279
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,449
So I'm wondering if you have any opinions on

1280
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:08,312
Path of Exile going forward in regards to allowing more player choice in what types

1281
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:11,915
of previous league content they engage in throughout their experience in the endgame?

1282
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:12,695
Right.

1283
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:16,438
Okay, to repeat the question just for the recording, so you're basically asking, in

1284
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:20,401
Path of Exile there's a lot of content in the endgame and you get access to it as you

1285
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:20,841
find it.

1286
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:25,104
It's very hard to actually focus on narrowing down to specific content you want to engage

1287
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:25,205
in.

1288
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:28,048
So this is something we've been experimenting with in the last few leagues.

1289
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:31,772
We introduced Scarabs in the Betrayal League, which is something that's a tradable way of

1290
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:34,195
augmenting the amount of a specific type of content that you find.

1291
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:37,559
This is something we are planning to work on more because we do think that someone being

1292
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:38,960
able to specialize is an important thing.

1293
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:41,563
It's kind of like a trade skill or profession in another game.

1294
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,927
If you're just a really good person at playing delve content or synthesis content,

1295
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,068
that's something that's good for you to have a specialization in.

1296
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:49,128
So this is a direction I would like us to go further,

1297
00:49:49,368 --> 00:49:51,609
but we are very careful, because everything here is tradable.

1298
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:54,529
If we go slightly over the line, suddenly everyone is doing exactly that

1299
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:57,470
and farming the optimal thing, and it's hard to get items out of the economy

1300
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,631
once you've put them there. So we're probably too cautious with addressing that.

1301
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:02,831
Hey, thank you so much for the talk.

1302
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:05,692
How do you keep your team engaged with working on a game this long?

1303
00:50:06,322 --> 00:50:09,143
So the question is how we keep our team engaged for working on a game this long.

1304
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:11,725
It helps to be the only big game development company in New Zealand.

1305
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:12,565
I'm kidding.

1306
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:16,867
Our team have amazing, amazing staff retention.

1307
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:18,828
We love working with them, we treat them as well as we can

1308
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:20,228
and it really helps.

1309
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:26,037
To them, we're not necessarily working on Path of Exile for this long, but we're working on these 13 week game jams

1310
00:50:26,277 --> 00:50:29,759
where we're releasing new things. Like last year we said, who likes Pokemon? We all like Pokemon, let's do Beastory.

1311
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:34,541
And we made a league based on that. And the team we're engaging, they're drawing the art for the little book that you can tick them all off.

1312
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:39,143
And everyone's having a great time. And it's the frequent release cycles which let us actually, like, kind of,

1313
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:44,766
everyone, when you join the Path of Exile team, you get an experience of designing and working on and releasing and then maintaining

1314
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:47,027
a complete game four times a year, basically.

1315
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:47,908
Awesome, thank you.

1316
00:50:49,158 --> 00:50:51,561
All right, so you have told us about your numbers

1317
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:54,103
and how did you manage them on your own efforts, right?

1318
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:57,806
But I subjectively think that it's

1319
00:50:57,866 --> 00:51:01,649
because of yours, good decisions,

1320
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:03,811
while your competition was not doing really well.

1321
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,273
So I feel obligated to ask the question,

1322
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:11,498
how did the out of season, April Fool joke, actually,

1323
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:14,440
that happened in BlizzCon actually affected Path of Exile?

1324
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,501
I have a graph.

1325
00:51:16,202 --> 00:51:16,642
You've seen it.

1326
00:51:18,272 --> 00:51:21,875
So that was the spike there at the end.

1327
00:51:22,055 --> 00:51:23,877
And I do think that the spike was larger

1328
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,218
because of what you're referring to.

1329
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:27,880
For the recording, he's referring to the...

1330
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,949
Diablo Immortal announcement at Blizzcon last year.

1331
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,871
This did drive traffic to Path of Exile.

1332
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:34,932
Having said that, Betrayal was still our best release

1333
00:51:34,953 --> 00:51:36,314
from a content point of view, and we believe

1334
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:37,695
it still would have been our best release,

1335
00:51:38,175 --> 00:51:39,336
even without the additional traffic.

1336
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:40,617
We can tell who the new users are.

1337
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:41,458
It was certainly helpful.

1338
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:45,221
But yeah, it is useful when fortuitous events happen.

1339
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:48,683
Having said that, it still means we have to stay vigilant.

1340
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:50,245
There are gonna be a lot more competitors this year.

1341
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:51,986
There are a lot of action RPGs that look really good

1342
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:52,667
that are being developed.

1343
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:55,944
Hey Chris, thank you for talking so fast

1344
00:51:55,964 --> 00:51:56,705
and covering so much.

1345
00:51:58,227 --> 00:52:00,290
My question is about one of the pillars

1346
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,231
you talked about in the beginning

1347
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,614
about a good RNG item system.

1348
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:06,078
Could you talk about some common problems

1349
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:08,000
or things not to do that maybe you've seen

1350
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,502
in the industry or that you guys encountered

1351
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:10,463
with these item systems?

1352
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:13,588
So you're wanting to hear about some problems with item systems that other games do.

1353
00:52:13,888 --> 00:52:17,090
This is like, getting to know me in person is hearing about this stuff forever.

1354
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,611
Um, okay, so...

1355
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:22,093
In my opinion, the biggest mistake that games make with their item systems

1356
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:24,754
is they have item mods that are individually hard to feel.

1357
00:52:24,994 --> 00:52:27,836
Like, the goal with Path of Exile is if you strip your character down to be pretty simple,

1358
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:29,637
and you put an item on without looking at the mods,

1359
00:52:29,677 --> 00:52:33,079
you should be able to play and say what the mods do based on how the game feels.

1360
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,480
Now this isn't something we always meet.

1361
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,621
Obviously there's 11,000 stats in the game,

1362
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:37,721
so it's hard to meet it with all of them.

1363
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,502
But the core thing is we want them

1364
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:40,923
to individually be impactful.

1365
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:43,184
There's none of this like, plus one strength,

1366
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:44,145
what does that even mean?

1367
00:52:44,285 --> 00:52:45,766
You know, we make sure the amount of strength

1368
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:47,186
is actually meaningfully increasing your life,

1369
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:50,228
meaningfully making at least 5% boost to damage

1370
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:51,088
so you can feel the difference.

1371
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:52,409
That's one example there.

1372
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,732
Another example of what people do with their item systems

1373
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:57,074
is they'll come up with a basically set of sequential items

1374
00:52:57,114 --> 00:52:59,176
where you can get this one, then you get this one, then you get this one.

1375
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:00,958
And this is setting up a content train

1376
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:02,940
that players, when they get the top item,

1377
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,782
they're then saying, well, what is there to find now?

1378
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:06,844
And you as the developer have to go and add more items on the end.

1379
00:53:07,304 --> 00:53:09,266
In Path of Exile, we go, yeah, there's random mods.

1380
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,927
You'll get a top 10% item, you get a top 8%,

1381
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:14,129
maybe a top 5%, but we believe that there are not,

1382
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:17,111
like, the best items that were possible in 2013

1383
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:18,872
have not necessarily been found yet

1384
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:19,813
in any reasonable numbers,

1385
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,794
just because of the harsh diminishing returns.

1386
00:53:22,134 --> 00:53:23,715
So to some extent, the initial levels

1387
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:26,817
and mods that we set up six years ago are still working

1388
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:29,079
and we haven't had to go and pile on additional higher mods

1389
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,180
in Path of Exile, at least not to any large degree.

1390
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,762
Thank you.

1391
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:34,703
Hello, and thank you for the talk.

1392
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:41,585
So you guys mentioned that your motivation for making this game was traditional boxed games like Diablo 2 and so on.

1393
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:46,026
There the monetization model is well you like the game, you buy it and you enjoy it.

1394
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:49,007
But for you guys it was not that sort of model.

1395
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:53,488
It was mostly external visual updates and so on.

1396
00:53:53,848 --> 00:53:57,489
Moreover, a point of innovation I believe was your support packs.

1397
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:01,390
Could you tell us a little bit about how you derived that business model?

1398
00:54:01,722 --> 00:54:06,084
That's a great question. So the question was, given that the other action RPGs were premium paid games,

1399
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:09,445
why did we go free to play, have cosmetic microtransactions and supporter packs?

1400
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:13,306
It was our plan to go free to play before that was a thing. We wanted to be the first free game.

1401
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:17,547
It sounds silly, but that was 2006. We'd seen MapleStory, they were making a lot of money in Korea,

1402
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:19,668
and we thought we'd revolutionize the Western gaming market.

1403
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,691
Now I try not to say this because it's dumb because then if you spend seven years making the game

1404
00:54:22,731 --> 00:54:27,255
Everyone's free to play by the time you release in fact when we did release free to play was a bad phrase that you say

1405
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:30,399
Free to play they assume bad monetization. We lost users by saying we were free

1406
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,522
We tried very hard to make it seem you've got to pay for it anyway

1407
00:54:34,683 --> 00:54:40,028
So the ethical cosmetic microtransactions thing was because when we initially scoped the game out that was the only thing that made sense

1408
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:43,311
We didn't realize that selling power was even this possible strategy, right? So

1409
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:48,855
We scoped this out because it's a competitive game, people want to play a fair playing field,

1410
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:52,598
and that was the way to design games. And thankfully this is now, you know, the tide

1411
00:54:52,618 --> 00:54:56,100
has turned on this to the point where most new games coming out these days are doing proper

1412
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:00,383
ethical microtransactions in a good way if they're competitive. The Supporter Packs thing was we

1413
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:04,246
needed to, we were about to start selling beta access in 2012 because we wanted to trickle a

1414
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:06,947
few more people in and they were spamming us with threats if we didn't let them in,

1415
00:55:06,987 --> 00:55:07,928
so we figured we may as well take $10.

1416
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:11,492
And so we made a page where you can spend $10 to get beta access.

1417
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,115
And then we realized, considering Kickstarter was so big,

1418
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,817
why not model it like what they were doing?

1419
00:55:16,038 --> 00:55:18,961
And so we added the $20 pack, and the $50 pack, and the $100 pack,

1420
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:19,903
and we just kept going to $1,000.

1421
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:23,647
And then that sold a lot of copies and gave us a lot of obligations

1422
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,429
that we had to then fulfill for many years.

1423
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:29,975
We've iterated now, I think we're on our 12th or 13th set of these supporter packs,

1424
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:33,158
and it's something I also care a lot about, is supporter pack design.

1425
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:37,783
So if you're doing anything on Kickstarter or other games where you're doing like a founder pack or supporter pack modeling,

1426
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:40,326
and you want advice, I would love to give advice on that. I have opinions there.

1427
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:42,348
Anyway, there's the summary of that.

1428
00:55:42,368 --> 00:55:43,289
Thank you.

1429
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:45,731
Cool.

1430
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:49,170
So, thanks again for making this game and this talk.

1431
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,370
It's all amazing.

1432
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,011
I play this game a lot, and I've been the guy

1433
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:56,231
who is like, I'm done, but I'll play next league a lot.

1434
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,932
And the question I have is,

1435
00:55:57,972 --> 00:56:00,632
how do you think about burnout burnout?

1436
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,913
In this, like, you have these four releases a year,

1437
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:06,734
you, people are ready to, like, come back,

1438
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:07,854
and they're ready to come back,

1439
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:10,995
but have you thought, like, what's the take on,

1440
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:14,616
is, like, what if people run out of wanting to come back?

1441
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:15,976
Like.

1442
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:20,157
how do you deal with the, like, over time,

1443
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:23,257
people getting bored of restarting over again,

1444
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,418
even though it's something new, it's the same new thing?

1445
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:28,418
Yeah.

1446
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:30,799
So the question was how do we deal with meta burnout,

1447
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,399
which is basically the next level above of, you know,

1448
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,499
having to come back every league until eventually

1449
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,060
you come back so many times.

1450
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,500
This is partly what our big, big expansions are for.

1451
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,800
That's the next meta level above there,

1452
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,821
the 2.0.0, the 3.0.0, next year's 4.0.0 is gonna be nuts.

1453
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,662
Anyway, those are the things that really drag people back.

1454
00:56:47,063 --> 00:56:50,304
And like, I mean, I was talking to a good friend of mine who works at Jinx,

1455
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:53,686
and he actually started playing Path of Exile way back in the early alpha.

1456
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:56,548
And he was saying he recently returned to it, has been having a blast.

1457
00:56:56,948 --> 00:56:59,409
And this is something where he took several years off, but now he's back,

1458
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:02,331
spending money and playing characters, and it's all good.

1459
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:03,851
Cool, thanks.

1460
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:04,072
Thanks.

1461
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:17,728
Hi, great talk. You mentioned that you generate content in the background so that it's just ready for use in expansion because that's the only way to do it.

1462
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:21,490
What about tools engineering and things like that? How do you handle that?

1463
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:22,790
The tools you were saying?

1464
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:28,704
We have a tools team internally, so the question was what do we do about tools in terms of content generation and so on.

1465
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:32,865
We have a tools team internally, probably not as large as we should have, it's obviously an evolution over many years,

1466
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:34,765
and they're trying to stay abreast of the tools.

1467
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:40,047
We made a decision a few years ago that instead of replacing our engine, we were just going to make it as modern as we can,

1468
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:44,188
so we have a lot of advanced stuff there now which is beginning to be used in the game,

1469
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:46,428
and therefore the tools team really got scaled up a bit.

1470
00:57:47,468 --> 00:57:49,609
It's kind of the heart of things like procedural generation.

1471
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,169
When we do our, I don't know,

1472
00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:53,070
we revamp the Atlas of Worlds occasionally,

1473
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,310
and that now has a complicated tool

1474
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,670
that lets people move all the stuff around,

1475
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,631
and it really is paying off in terms of time

1476
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:00,951
and effort invested in the tool stuff.

1477
00:58:01,431 --> 00:58:03,272
It's kind of completely separate from the concept

1478
00:58:03,312 --> 00:58:04,792
of making art assets, though, for the most part.

1479
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:06,212
I mean, the tool we're using to make this,

1480
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,153
you know, endless supply of content is Maya,

1481
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:10,513
for the most part, but all of the stuff we use

1482
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,774
to actually hook it up into the game

1483
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:13,134
is our ever-evolving set of tools,

1484
00:58:13,154 --> 00:58:14,974
which certainly pays off when we improve it.

1485
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:16,315
One more question?

1486
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:18,304
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1487
00:58:19,004 --> 00:58:20,205
Love the entertainment from it too.

1488
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:22,587
So my question was for the economy part of it.

1489
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:24,749
You said you reset the economy each time you do a release.

1490
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:25,089
Yes.

1491
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,550
How do you do that without upsetting users

1492
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,532
who have spent for like all this effort and put into it?

1493
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:31,974
This is a great question and something that I did gloss over.

1494
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:33,736
So we reset the economy with a release,

1495
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:34,917
but who wants to be reset?

1496
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:35,717
That sounds really bad.

1497
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,999
The way we do it is we make a new economy

1498
00:58:38,259 --> 00:58:40,081
and we say, you should play the release in that one.

1499
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:41,802
and you've still got your old characters.

1500
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:43,263
So we have what's called standard league,

1501
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,985
where all the characters from the past economies get moved.

1502
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:49,007
You're welcome to play there, maybe 15, 10% of players do play there.

1503
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,069
And you've still got all the characters you've ever played in Path of Exile.

1504
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:56,012
But the exciting place, where the economy isn't trashed with all the old items,

1505
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:56,992
is the new league.

1506
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:00,695
And so we make sure that the new league content is generally only available in the new economy.

1507
00:59:00,935 --> 00:59:02,916
So that's kind of your reward for starting a new character.

1508
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,638
And this took a little while to train players,

1509
00:59:04,938 --> 00:59:06,499
but it really works well. It's the lifeblood.

1510
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:08,420
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the fact that this works.

1511
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,380
Well, thank you very much, everyone.
