00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:12,462
Hello. Welcome to VRDC 2016. My name is Justin Achille. I am the lead social systems designer

2
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:16,305
at Red Storm Entertainment. And today I'd like to talk to you a little bit about Werewolves

3
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:22,070
Within, which is our VR social deduction game title that's due out at the very beginning

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,576
of December. So December 6th, really looking forward to that. And real quick agenda here.

5
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,214
First thing we'll be covering is coming up with a definition of social VR.

6
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:36,117
I know it's a pretty hot term, but I want to give you a little bit of grounding in what

7
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:37,138
I mean when I say it.

8
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:44,244
Second, we designed Werewolves Within to specifically be for a social VR experience.

9
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,967
So we'll go into some of the systems that we built for that.

10
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:52,192
Then we'll go into some of the practical results that came out of our user testing.

11
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,334
And finally, we'll finish with some takeaways.

12
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:02,536
First, obviously, starting with a definition of social VR.

13
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,617
This is AchilleCon 16.

14
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:07,618
It happens twice a year at my house.

15
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:09,199
A couple of us get together.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,899
We all come over.

17
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,320
We bring board games, card games.

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,080
You're all invited.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,101
Most of you are invited.

20
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,602
Please bring a drink to share, bring a side dish.

21
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,603
But the idea here is that we all get together.

22
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,544
We all play games together.

23
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,245
And so building on that idea.

24
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:32,008
In a review of the Oculus toy box demo that came out last year, popular science said a virtual

25
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:36,432
reality can potentially connect people around the world and let them inhabit the same immersive

26
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:42,278
digital world more closely replicating actually being together in real life. So again, that idea

27
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:47,383
of like Achille con, where you're all coming next year, we're all going to be together here in this

28
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,164
virtual space.

29
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:53,426
And then another quote here that I think is particularly relevant, consumer VR that can

30
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:58,769
induce presence marks a phase change in the relationship between humans, computing and

31
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,489
information.

32
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,290
And I predict that VR will be the most social medium ever.

33
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:08,832
Michael Abrash, who is the chief scientist at Oculus said that at Carnegie Mellon University

34
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:09,573
a couple years ago.

35
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:15,315
And really we want to trade on that prediction, on that idea of being able to share that space

36
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,636
just like we are here but virtually.

37
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:23,775
So that kind of gives us a good definition to work, to move forward with.

38
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:29,357
Social VR is a virtual world in which the sense of presence is enhanced when shared

39
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:31,177
with other actual individuals.

40
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:36,059
And I want to call attention to that word actual because we're not using social VR in

41
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,320
this case to indicate AIs, bots, NPCs.

42
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,341
Actual individuals like you, like me, like everyone else in this room, you're going to

43
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,822
know that they're actually a person.

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,331
So with that in mind, we'll talk about Werewolves Within and how it was specifically designed

45
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:52,352
for social VR.

46
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:54,332
We're not going to touch a whole lot of gameplay.

47
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:57,533
We're going to focus on the interaction between the players.

48
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,034
A quick introduction to the game.

49
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:05,755
In the village of Gallowston, one or more of the players are werewolves here around

50
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:06,196
the table.

51
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:10,037
And the townsfolk players are trying to figure out who the werewolves are.

52
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:12,777
The werewolves know each other's identity.

53
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,178
The townsfolk don't.

54
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:22,001
And everybody gains information over the course of play. So how you use this information, the

55
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:26,922
game revolves around sharing that information, what you hide, what you share, and the amount

56
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:30,163
of trust that you're building with the other players. Obviously if you're trying to find

57
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:34,424
the werewolf and there's a secret werewolf or more in the group, you're going to not

58
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:38,225
want to trust someone. So let's see it in practice here.

59
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,943
Holy Jesus!

60
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:44,863
Whoa!

61
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,644
It's totally Xavier.

62
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,025
It's totally Xavier.

63
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,385
How the hell do you know?

64
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,146
I think it may be Garrett!

65
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,667
You're talking all this good good...

66
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:54,147
I'm drifting!

67
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:54,807
I'm drifting!

68
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,547
That's why I said it!

69
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,468
How do you know?

70
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,709
How do I know? Because I can see it.

71
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,451
Because it is a epic bash.

72
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,312
Yeah, you can see it, but it's also, it could be true or it could be false.

73
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,932
I guess we're all picking Andrew.

74
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,593
Everybody pick Jacob.

75
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:13,373
These are wolves.

76
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,033
I'mma see if he's...

77
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,114
Don't let him die.

78
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,654
Yeah, I'm 110% sure.

79
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:20,115
I'm 110% sure. 125.

80
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,155
We all know it's Andrew.

81
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,856
Oh my gosh, it's Jacob.

82
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:27,797
What's it even matter? We're all gonna die anyway.

83
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:28,577
Oh no!

84
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:29,257
No!

85
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,498
What are y'all doing?

86
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:46,009
What does it matter? We're all going to die. But that shows you a little bit the player

87
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:50,450
is going to be in the first person perspective. They're seating around a circle. The players

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,151
are gaining some sort of information and at the end they cast a vote for who they want

89
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:54,812
to eliminate.

90
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,203
The gameplay itself is an inherently social activity.

91
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:05,445
Building the game itself started out with creating the experience of being together,

92
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:11,368
sharing a space, and then layering the gameplay components on top of that social framework.

93
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,230
So what's happening in a space that was built to be together in the first place, the game

94
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,612
isn't secondary, but the game is built on top of this social foundation.

95
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,413
And so you're going to see that a lot.

96
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,834
You're going to see it in the box art.

97
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,555
You're going to see it in the concept art here,

98
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,776
where all the characters are together.

99
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:27,657
It's reinforced in the setting,

100
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,938
where you're all sharing a village in Gallowston,

101
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:31,199
or you're around the campfire,

102
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,720
or you're in the castle together.

103
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,941
It's in the lobby state of the game,

104
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:37,643
so there's no choose a server sort of situation.

105
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,124
You'll be put into a room,

106
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,485
and before the game happens,

107
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,506
you're actually still sitting around that circle

108
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:43,707
with the other players.

109
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,728
So you're seeing their avatars move in real time.

110
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,910
It's all happening together from the get-go.

111
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,886
The game itself emerged from a prototype.

112
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:58,911
We had built a kind of secret heist prototype where the players were discussing who among

113
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:01,372
them is going to backstab the group as they go in to steal something.

114
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:07,836
And this really proved for us this sense of togetherness, of presence of the other players,

115
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:09,757
made a believer out of me at the very least.

116
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:14,019
I was a VR skeptic to begin with, and the moment I put on the HMD and I played that

117
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,541
initial prototype, it made a believer out of me because I knew.

118
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:22,845
Going back to that quote earlier about the Oculus toy box demo, when you see that other

119
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:26,608
person there playing with the toys or throwing things around the environment, you know that

120
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:27,509
that's another person.

121
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:28,970
You know that's not a logic tree.

122
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,371
You know that's an individual.

123
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:36,338
And so our initial meeting with HQ when we were pitching the game, we played it with

124
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:36,498
them.

125
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,561
They got in and we backstabbed each other and committed some treacheries.

126
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:43,845
And we had the debrief meeting around the campfire.

127
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:49,130
We stayed in VR around the campfire in the game to continue the meeting after the prototype

128
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,931
gameplay session.

129
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:54,395
And that to me was very much a proof of HQ believed in us and had that same kind of...

130
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:58,877
come to it moment where they realize that, oh, we are in the same space.

131
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,239
This is better than conducting this call via Skype.

132
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,142
The gameplay itself is also an inherently social endeavor.

133
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:11,444
The gameplay revolves around solving this information disparity.

134
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,506
There are some secrets that need to be revealed.

135
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,348
There are pieces of information that need to be revealed.

136
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:23,235
And everybody has some amount of information, but no player has exactly the right amount

137
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:24,938
of information to solve the puzzle.

138
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:30,245
So here the idea that sharing information and getting you to trust me is very important.

139
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,771
It makes the game much more of a social deduction is Justin telling the truth and wants me to

140
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,272
vote with him.

141
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,274
or is Justin lying and trying to get me to vote for someone else,

142
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:42,056
that breaks it away from purely a logical deduction sort of situation.

143
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,517
It's not like Clue where,

144
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,678
oh, I didn't know I killed Professor Plum.

145
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:47,820
You know, it's something where I know that I'm the werewolf

146
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,921
and I'm trying to divert attention away from myself.

147
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,950
So it's also important that the game provides you a structured autonomy here.

148
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,352
If you're familiar with self-determination theory or the Penn's model of games, you'll

149
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,052
be familiar with the idea of autonomy.

150
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:08,214
Here we give you the objective, find the werewolf, but we don't tell you how to do it.

151
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:10,715
Do you want to do it by talking to other players?

152
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:13,916
Do you want to do it by gesturing that you think another player is suspicious?

153
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:18,317
Do you want to do it by building a coalition against somebody? Are you going to try to shift

154
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:23,698
attention to someone who probably isn't the werewolf but you've got some other motive? How

155
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:29,560
you accomplish it is up to you but that idea that here's what we want to do serves as the kind of

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,401
icebreaker in the social space to get us talking. If you just put us in a room and say talk,

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,602
It requires a lot of volition on our part.

158
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,383
Somebody's got to take that initial risk, right?

159
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,486
But here, where talk among yourselves, share what you know,

160
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,388
find the werewolves, then we have something

161
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,869
we can start moving on right away.

162
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,949
It's also built on the player using intuitive, familiar

163
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,032
movements. The players move their avatars by performing

164
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,113
things that they're going to do in the real world. So for

165
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,636
example here, we've got players leaning over next to one

166
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,738
another to whisper. In this case, this creates a private

167
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,760
VoIP channel where only these two players will be able to

168
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:12,282
hear each other. All the rest of us around the table will

169
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,603
only hear, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst,

170
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:14,723
psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst,

171
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,767
And the players perform this by literally leaning over left or right to the other to the player next to them

172
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:27,438
So if I tell you you control yourself by leaning to lean that's fairly intuitive, right? You know how to lean

173
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:31,538
You can also stand up to perform a monologue.

174
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,563
The way this works is the player stands and all of the rest of the player's VoIP is turned

175
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:40,248
off so I'm up here commanding that you listen to me, all of the rest of you can't speak.

176
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:45,574
We did find out through testing that we needed to put a timer on that, otherwise a player

177
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,016
would kind of run away with it.

178
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:48,537
So you can do this for 10 seconds.

179
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:57,630
But again, we're reading the tracking position of the HMD. So to stand up, you stand up. So all

180
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,272
of these are intuitive, they're familiar, they don't require a complex series of commands,

181
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:06,174
they're not nestled in menus, you don't have to dig them up. The players can also use very

182
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:09,576
expressive emotes here. For example, pointing is on the right trigger.

183
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,471
You can also do another variety of emotes that are bound to the D pad on the controller that

184
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:19,752
ships with. In this case we've been testing on the Oculus but obviously it will work on the

185
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:26,474
PlayStation VR as well and also on the HTC Vive. But once you know where those controls are,

186
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:30,395
they're easy to go back to. Again, they're not buried in menus. You don't have to open some

187
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:32,395
subset of functions. You just do them.

188
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:39,022
And so seeing these movements performed at the user's will as opposed to them coming

189
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:44,207
automatically as a result of logic tree, they really let you know that that's another person.

190
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:48,671
When I point at you, it's because Justin is choosing to point as opposed to 30 seconds

191
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,054
into the game, logic dictates this character points.

192
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:55,455
This goes back to another something that Michael Abrash said in that same presentation at Carnegie

193
00:10:55,475 --> 00:11:00,616
Mellon. He was describing sharing a social space in VR and his phrase was, all of a sudden,

194
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:06,278
it was a person. Seeing that head that had moved up from the ground and started moving

195
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:11,239
around as the person placed the HMD on their head and was turning around to look at things,

196
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,421
that conveyed the ever elusive sense of presence that VR thrives on and trades on and really

197
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:17,981
depends on.

198
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:24,455
Some other systems that we've got in play are eye magnetism.

199
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:28,178
This goes a huge way for us in fighting the uncanny valley.

200
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,060
When characters look at one another,

201
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,762
the eyes are automatically drawn to.

202
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:32,362
I'm looking at you.

203
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:33,383
I don't know why I singled you out.

204
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:34,304
It's just convenient for me.

205
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,586
But now our eyes are looking together as opposed to me

206
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,947
looking slightly over your shoulder and you feeling that

207
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,788
okay, this is kind of a bot here that's not looking at me.

208
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,571
And also when players look at one another, we duck the audio

209
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:50,652
for anyone who's not those two players. So when I'm looking at

210
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:53,153
you, you know that I want to focus on you and I'm hearing you

211
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:55,815
at 100 percent. Everyone else is ducked to some lesser level.

212
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:01,256
So these are nice simple ways of nonverbal communication,

213
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,817
communicating that you have my attention.

214
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,857
We also use a fairly elaborate lip sync process.

215
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:12,438
We read the microphone input and we detect the phonemes of the words

216
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:17,099
that you're speaking and we translate those in real time to the player's

217
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,960
faces so when you see my mouth moving you know that I'm one of the characters

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,360
speaking.

219
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,603
In a lot of cases you're not seeing this in models or you're

220
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,644
not seeing it done in real time. They just have a simple

221
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,687
movement. But here when you see the character speaking, when you

222
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,209
see them gesturing, you know that this is someone who wants

223
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,010
my attention, who is saying something that I potentially

224
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,475
need to hear. Speaking about those gestures, body language

225
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:45,339
itself conveys a huge amount of communication detail. What we do

226
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,502
is we analyze the intensity of what you're saying, your speech

227
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:50,403
coming into the mic.

228
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:55,386
And if you're speaking fairly calmly, you'll perform some automated what we're calling

229
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:59,487
minor gestures here in the yellow box where your hands will move fairly simply.

230
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:03,029
But when you're really agitated and frustrated and why won't you vote for this werewolf,

231
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,771
your hands start to move in this greater sense of area here that we have in the major gestures

232
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:08,231
area.

233
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:13,734
So the intensity, the volume with which you're speaking helps us translate that into gestures

234
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,795
that make the avatar seem more alive.

235
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:22,072
And then as well, we've confined the emotes to a higher plane, kind of a stack above where

236
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,113
those gestures are happening.

237
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:27,537
So at this point, you know that I'm consciously choosing to point at you, or I'm consciously

238
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,520
choosing to say, you should make me the ringleader.

239
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:39,035
The seating arrangement as well plays on some longstanding sociological knowledge.

240
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:44,159
All of the seating arrangement in Werewolves Within is circular, and there's a reason for

241
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:44,360
this.

242
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,182
A circle doesn't have a head or a foot.

243
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,664
It doesn't impart any sense of leadership, right?

244
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:55,766
So leaders can absolutely emerge over the course of a match because a charismatic person is

245
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:59,627
going to steer the way or a very forceful person is going to make himself heard or herself

246
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:06,308
heard. But there is no implied this is the person you have to listen to in a circular table. As

247
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:10,649
well, for each match we shuffle the position of the players so you're not always stuck

248
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:14,710
sitting next to this guy and you know how he's going to play because we shuffle you every

249
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,411
time. There's one more category of difference there between each session.

250
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:25,478
Some players just don't like to whisper, you know, but next game you'll be put next to a player who may be more receptive to your whispering.

251
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,659
Players are also spaced with enough distance between them

252
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,963
that they can't grief one another. It's not possible for me to lean in and put my hands

253
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,906
in front of your face and all of the gestures, all of the emotes that we have put in play

254
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:47,710
as well, those are pre-recorded, those are established, those are defined so we don't

255
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,012
have any lewd gestures in there as well.

256
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:54,697
Making sure that players are comfortable, making sure that we're not challenging anybody's

257
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,223
boundaries of comfort or appropriateness. We didn't want people to be able to harass

258
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:04,169
one another or to be able to make one another feel like something inappropriate is happening.

259
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:10,808
The stylized avatars, I'm sure you've seen as well, the character's heads are pretty big,

260
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:15,051
their facial features are pretty big, eyes are big, the mouths are big because we want you to

261
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:19,834
be able to see when the players are speaking. The hands are large, they move emphatically.

262
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,956
And all of this is kind of helping us

263
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:28,485
Because it's an avatar and not an exact representation of you

264
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:32,227
proper, it helps the player feel a little more comfortable. It

265
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,769
reduces some of the anxiety of sharing the social space. The

266
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,031
players don't feel necessarily like they're on display. I'm

267
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:42,593
going to give you a quote here from a journalist who reviewed

268
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:43,394
our game a little bit.

269
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:51,138
She said that Werewolves Within strips away the game's inbred anxieties and morphs it into something still social, but I dare say more fun.

270
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:57,882
It's a digital mask to hide behind, making your deception a little bit more simple and your fellows hunt a lot harder.

271
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:04,317
So here's an example of this particular journalist has played actual physical around the table

272
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:05,898
werewolf and she doesn't like it.

273
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,261
It makes her feel uncomfortable, it makes her feel like when she lies she blushes, it's

274
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,021
easy to catch her.

275
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:17,926
But here there's a level of remove that not only hides her physical cues but kind of brings

276
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:21,248
her out of her shell, you know, inclines her to be less withdrawn.

277
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:23,670
It's not me who's playing this, I'm the moor.

278
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,511
I'm not the one who's on display here.

279
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:28,133
It's this wacky character in this kind of comical town.

280
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:34,310
There's also another point here that I want to bring up from Oculus Connect a couple weeks

281
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,591
ago.

282
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:40,536
Ben Popper at The Verge saw the Facebook demonstration there and said, adding hands and facial expressions

283
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,939
makes virtual reality a much more intimate medium.

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,861
And we've definitely seen that here.

285
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,362
The players really feel like they are sharing a space with actual people.

286
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:52,464
They're not just kind of looking for the logical deduction.

287
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:56,966
They're not following this path, like I said, of clue where they're going to get the answer.

288
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:58,627
They feel like they're sharing a space.

289
00:16:58,687 --> 00:16:59,868
They need to build trust.

290
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,950
And if they don't have that intimacy with another player, if they don't have that trust,

291
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,332
they're going to have a hard time convincing those other players that what they think is

292
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:08,652
true.

293
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:10,673
Even if I know the answer.

294
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,355
There is one role who finds out without fail.

295
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,238
So, I'm not going to get that vote.

296
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:17,339
I appreciate you being the werewolf.

297
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:17,840
Thanks for that.

298
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,971
So that's all great theory. It's all great to kind of have that grounding there.

299
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,532
But let's take a look a little at it in practice.

300
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:42,074
We have our user research lab in North Carolina at Red Storm Entertainment

301
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:46,175
headquarters. We also have a user research lab in Paris at Ubisoft headquarters.

302
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:50,497
And so the data you're going to see here coordinates those two two separate

303
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,598
sessions there. We have more data from the U S lab,

304
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,059
but we did want to compare with other.

305
00:17:57,215 --> 00:18:01,298
Users as well. First of all is appreciation of the avatars. We

306
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,940
saw overall that players really appreciated kind of going back to

307
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,463
that point that the journalist brought up about being able to

308
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:09,384
represent oneself in the avatar.

309
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,104
We also noticed that when the players didn't know each other's names when they were XYZ

310
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:19,349
or seat 5 or whatever, they would refer to each other by the avatar's characteristics.

311
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,372
You saw one with a bushy beard, sometimes you're the really hairy guy.

312
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,415
Or there's a character who's wearing an eye patch and they would call him One Eye.

313
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:28,458
So these distinguishing characteristics that are built into the avatar

314
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,362
Don't quite feel like you're being mocked because it's not you.

315
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:36,106
You know, if you're calling me, you know, the really bushy, hairy guy, well, it's because

316
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,167
the avatar is hairy.

317
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,249
Justin's not embarrassed.

318
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,354
It's this poor blacksmith who is stuck in this town full of werewolves and for some

319
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:44,515
reason refuses to move away.

320
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:49,421
Yeah, this goes back to that point about having the digital mask to hide behind.

321
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:57,382
The victory conditions, in terms of the gameplay itself, we found that the werewolves win just over half the time.

322
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:02,525
So remember that the werewolves are the uninformed, or they're the informed minority.

323
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,106
The townsfolk are the uninformed majority.

324
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:08,808
They're winning a little bit less, and that feels good to us.

325
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,748
That was our design intent going into it,

326
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:14,750
because we didn't want the players who felt like they were outnumbered to want to drop session.

327
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:18,332
In fact, they win a few more, so you're kind of encouraged to stick in that way.

328
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,893
And then there's the deviant role as well.

329
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:23,253
The deviant is a solo role.

330
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:27,654
The werewolves win if the townsfolk don't manage to eliminate one of them.

331
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:30,815
The townsfolk win if they do manage to eliminate werewolves.

332
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,156
And the deviant just wants an end to it all.

333
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,957
The deviant wins if everyone votes and eliminates the deviant.

334
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:41,598
So it's a really difficult role to play to convince everyone that you're the werewolf

335
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,979
or you deserve to die but you're not really the werewolf because you're the deviant.

336
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,840
He operates as kind of a spoiler and that role is really difficult to win with.

337
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:51,319
And so we found that in terms of offering game rewards,

338
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:54,064
things like achievements or trophies for the PlayStation,

339
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:56,409
that that particular role being so difficult,

340
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,296
we offered a little more point reward for that one.

341
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,323
Overall appreciation of the game started out pretty strong.

342
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:09,626
We were pretty happy with this, but then after the course, and this is our appreciation over

343
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:14,989
the course of three games, over the course of six games, we had players who were kind

344
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:19,092
of on the fence actually decide, no, no, they really like it more than they had initially

345
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:19,673
thought they did.

346
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,175
And so here we've observed that as the player's familiarity with the game grew,

347
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:26,016
so did their appreciation of it.

348
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:30,359
And that stands to reason as well that the more the player felt that they had mastered the game,

349
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,161
the more that they felt that they were able to influence things to their own desires,

350
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,544
they liked it more, they felt like they had a greater sense of getting better at it.

351
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:42,405
So we can see that over time, that increased as well.

352
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,650
The whisper usage.

353
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,195
So overall players we saw kind of had to warm up to using the whispers.

354
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:53,338
Whispers are a great way to share private information.

355
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:56,981
I am the gossip and I think that this player over here is the werewolf.

356
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:59,704
But then requires a little give back from that other player.

357
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:00,805
A little bit of trust.

358
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,747
And we see that trust building over time.

359
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:08,050
There are some risks to whispering in the game. If you whisper with a werewolf, the werewolf will

360
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,333
sniff you and find out what role you are. So there's always some danger to whispering with

361
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:19,136
people. But we saw players willing to take that risk because it allowed them to build coalitions.

362
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:26,450
Interestingly, the U.S. players whispered a lot more over the course of play than the

363
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,770
French players did.

364
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:32,913
The French players initially were introduced to the feature, tried it out a little bit,

365
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,274
but then, I don't know, maybe the French were afraid of werewolves or something.

366
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:41,537
So they are either an entirely guileless people or they are just unable to perceive what masters

367
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:42,818
of secrets they are.

368
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:50,161
The game actions that I mentioned before, using the emotes to point or to indicate myself

369
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:56,205
or to express frustration or to kind of cross your arms and be sort of surly, why are people

370
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:56,605
doing this?

371
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,948
We saw that players thought they were fun, a little bit less useful.

372
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,871
The monologue feature, that ability to stand up and turn off all of the other VOIP for

373
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:10,033
the other players, we found that players found that about equally fun and useful.

374
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:11,894
And whispering as well.

375
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:13,215
Whispering I think is interesting.

376
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:20,972
Because players found it more useful than fun but still roughly on par. So specifically

377
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:25,175
that came out of the feedback, we saw nine players out of the 24 in this one particular

378
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:30,138
test. Players thought the emotes were fun but they felt that they served no strategic

379
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:34,180
purpose. And that was interesting to me that nine different players chose that particular

380
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,441
phrase, that they were forming strategies in their head.

381
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:41,584
And while this social feature was kind of fun to do, they were always still kind of conniving.

382
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:43,565
They were still thinking about, what's my next step here?

383
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:48,788
It was less about the sharing the social space and more about using the social tools

384
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:51,450
to convince others of what I'm trying to achieve.

385
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:56,650
Also going back to that whispering column, whispering is used to communicate privately,

386
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:02,855
but it's inherently useful, and so it's interesting to me to see it considered roughly as fun

387
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:07,258
as it is useful, and I think probably some of that comes in just the enjoyment, that

388
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:11,141
feeling of power, of having a secret, that the things you and I are talking about, they

389
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,003
don't know about, which lets me feel, and you feel, a little bit elevated.

390
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:19,254
Specifically going into the individual emotes, we had four

391
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:22,756
emotes available at the time of the testing. We had pointing at

392
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:25,437
others, so a very direct point. Whoever you look at, you point

393
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:28,658
at. So it's very useful non-verbally to indicate one

394
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:32,240
particular individual. We have this guy. So you know who should

395
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,121
be elevated to the position of ring leader? This guy. My vote

396
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:38,483
should count double. We have the exasperated and we have the

397
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,704
cross arms emotes. So pointing at others obviously was perceived

398
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:45,486
very, very well by players and they also considered it pretty

399
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:45,726
fun.

400
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:50,690
This guy as well, a good way to indicate do something for me.

401
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:56,023
And then they fell off a little bit here in the crossing arms and exasperated because

402
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:58,505
they didn't indicate who.

403
00:23:59,125 --> 00:23:59,485
I think.

404
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,106
That's what I'm taking away from this.

405
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:05,088
So I was able to point to myself or point over there.

406
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:08,069
So these were good ways to communicate non-verbally directly.

407
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,532
And the other ones were more expressive, they were more comical, they were more used for

408
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:16,734
punctuation than they were to indicate, you know, if I'm a player who doesn't speak much,

409
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,616
I can still be effective in the game by indicating I think the werewolf is over here.

410
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,194
So, with all of that data in mind, with all of those observations that we've had, what

411
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:28,035
were the takeaways?

412
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:33,179
The first, I think, is that social VR is very foundational.

413
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,042
You can't just throw some social elements in there.

414
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:39,425
You can't just say, and we'll put guilds in there, or you can't just add a chat.

415
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:43,548
You can't expect those sorts of secondary treatments to be very effective.

416
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:49,373
For truly social VR, the interactions between the users have to be supported at the platform

417
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:49,814
level.

418
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:56,478
The game or the activity or whatever you're building is layered on top of that idea of shared space.

419
00:24:56,858 --> 00:25:00,720
When we all get together at my house to play games or to have this work conversation,

420
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:05,343
we are first and foremost at my house, we're interacting with one another, we're sitting around the table,

421
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:09,726
we are there together to play games, to talk about work, whatever.

422
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:13,068
That idea of being together is paramount in social VR.

423
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,810
Presence builds relatedness between players.

424
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,772
Here, I think you want to reduce the barriers to participation,

425
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,353
whether you're building a game or an application.

426
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,314
Performing the actions in your game or application

427
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,815
should be easy, familiar, intuitive.

428
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,236
If you want players to lean, just track them leaning.

429
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:33,216
They're going to do it anyway.

430
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:37,341
Engage users by allowing them to relate to other people.

431
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:40,765
And remember, these are other obvious actual people.

432
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:41,726
These aren't bots.

433
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,809
And they're sharing the virtual world with those people.

434
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:50,596
But you also want to allow the user ways to ‑‑ you want them to close off channels of communication

435
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,520
or if they feel threatened, you want to allow them to opt out of interactions with players.

436
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,764
For example, in Werewolves Within, if I choose to mute a player, that will also turn off

437
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:00,865
the animations for them.

438
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:05,108
So even though I can't hear them, my attention won't be drawn back to them, their negative

439
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,090
influence on me will be turned off entirely.

440
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:12,718
And finally, the activity providing the impetus to use

441
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,159
the application or the game. It's the icebreaker, right?

442
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,360
That idea of structured autonomy. We're going to go

443
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,901
here to find the werewolf. We're going to go here to edit

444
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,302
a wiki. We're going to go here to share create a document. The

445
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:28,423
structured autonomy gives a framework for what the players

446
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,645
or the users are going to be communicating about. And so

447
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,626
without this activity in place, without this common ground,

448
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:37,806
without this item to pursue together.

449
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,598
You rely a lot more on the player's volition to say,

450
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,740
notice me, take notice of me.

451
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,781
If you're giving me the activity to do it,

452
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,842
that's my opportunity to step in and say,

453
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:48,963
of course, I'm the werewolf,

454
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:50,524
or no, no, I'm definitely not the werewolf,

455
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,665
as opposed to, hey all, we're together now,

456
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:55,247
let's talk about whatever it is that intrigues us.

457
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,923
So that is pretty much my conclusion today. I want to thank you for being here. If you

458
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:07,605
have any questions for me, I'm happy to entertain those. We can do that either ‑‑ I don't

459
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,648
know what kind of time we're looking at. I feel like I sort of blazed through that. Oh,

460
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:15,730
no, I'm right on time. So feel free to come up and ask me questions or if we still have

461
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,151
a minute or two left, someone wants to step up to the mic here, we have any questions

462
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:19,352
for me?

463
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:31,252
Hey, I had a question about, are most of, so is the social

464
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,795
aspect designed to be played with strangers over the

465
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:38,220
internet? Or how do you find people to play with? And did

466
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,041
you experiment with that?

467
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,794
For someone like me who ends up going to a lot of shows and playing a lot of demos and

468
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:49,358
playing with a lot of random people, I'm perfectly comfortable with it.

469
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:53,742
But we assume that most players are probably going to be playing with their friends.

470
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:58,726
And in fact on a variety of services, like for example if you're playing on the PlayStation

471
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:03,030
VR, your PSN friends that you already have will be pushed to the top of the queue so

472
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,033
you can say, oh, I want to join Justin or I want to invite him to a game.

473
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:10,959
So we assume that most people will probably want to be playing with some number of friends.

474
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,205
I didn't go too much into it in the data, but we did a couple of different tests there.

475
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:20,790
The first test was groups of people and players who did not know one another at all.

476
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,752
And then for the second test,

477
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:27,675
We had multiple people in each session who did go into the game knowing each other beforehand

478
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:29,456
and having preestablished relationships.

479
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:34,759
And we found that almost ‑‑ there was almost a perfect accordance there of they

480
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,942
were more willing up front to chat, to whisper, to perform these things that other players

481
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:42,243
had to slowly warm up to.

482
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:45,745
But really we look at this as an opportunity to ‑‑

483
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:50,713
You can play the game with as few as five people or up to eight people. And we will

484
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:55,434
randomize any empty seats you have that you want filled additionally. So we figure that

485
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:58,735
this is also a good place for you and two or three of your friends to start a session

486
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:03,096
and bring a couple of random people in and hopefully make friends with them over the

487
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:07,017
course of play there. You can play a private session. It doesn't have to be open to the

488
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:11,598
public or you can play a completely public randomized session. So we're offering players

489
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:14,538
basically the opportunity to do whatever they feel most comfortable with.

490
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:25,516
So you said that you made it so that there was social awareness and not being able to make people feel uncomfortable.

491
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:33,628
How are you guys dealing with the aspect of people pulling other people, vulgarities in the game, verbal abuse and stuff like that?

492
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:41,636
Sure. We definitely want this to be, part of it starts at like literally a fundamental

493
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:46,600
level of it's a cartoony sort of town and the characters are kind of comical so there

494
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,864
isn't a lot of gore, there isn't a lot of physical threat actually communicated in the

495
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:56,348
environment itself. So the sort of lighthearted approach itself kind of steers players more

496
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:56,848
toward that.

497
00:29:57,168 --> 00:30:03,412
that comical or lighthearted disposition anyway. We also have some social features whereby

498
00:30:03,432 --> 00:30:08,834
if you own the room that the game is taking place in, you can kick out anyone that you

499
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:13,417
don't want in it. If the players ‑‑ if they don't know who owns the room or if it's

500
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:17,719
randomly match made, players can initiate a kick vote. So if you're obviously cursing,

501
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,420
threatening me, being awful, being whatever.

502
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,243
I can initiate a kick vote and with enough other players in agreement there, we can push

503
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:28,706
you out of the room, thereby you won't be able to make it back into that room.

504
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:34,750
Also we have the opportunity for players to mute other players, so if I just don't want

505
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:39,013
to hear you but I don't have the votes to get you out of the room but I just don't want

506
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:43,816
to play with you anymore, I can turn off your VoIP and that will also, uh...

507
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,883
prevent your animations from being played from my perspective.

508
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:52,047
So I can still vote for you, you are still a presence there in the game, but you're unable

509
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:54,249
to be as hostile to me personally.

510
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,535
And we found that this actually tested fairly well because there are in many cases players

511
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:03,659
who don't want to run the risk of, oh, Justin's being a real jerk, let's kick him out.

512
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,642
They'll take a path of least resistance and just...

513
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,944
isolate that player from being able to interact with them and that other player won't necessarily

514
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:17,225
even know that they've been punished. We don't want to have this kind of negative karma system

515
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:22,326
because that can often backfire, be used against players who aren't actually being disruptive.

516
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:27,268
Instead, if you're being a real bother, I can just isolate you and not be affected by

517
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:29,988
you at all. Other questions?

518
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:42,157
Okay. That's actually a great question and it kind of dovetails into this. One of the

519
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:46,139
reasons that we aren't supporting the touch controllers is the fact that we don't want

520
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:50,381
players to have that full free motion of hands. We don't want them doing their own lewd gestures.

521
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:56,825
And so the game pad really sits very comfortably in your hands and becomes very secondary.

522
00:31:57,145 --> 00:32:02,048
Most of the actions you're taking are done by looking around or, you know, we'll press

523
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,069
a button to open your book.

524
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:08,072
The book contains information in the game. So you're actually turning your head to look at this

525
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,395
sort of diegetic UI. Whenever you want to select something, you look at it and then just

526
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:17,458
confirm with a button. So everything is basically one click away. We make some pretty good use

527
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:22,541
of the game pad controllers and it never becomes primary. You never have to wrestle with the

528
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:27,605
controller. It's always just kind of one tap. It doesn't care where it is spatially. Again,

529
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,506
we're only reading the player's head and position.

530
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:39,837
Wrap it up. I'm told to wrap it up here. But yeah, it feels very natural, very comfortable.

531
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,243
So thank you for coming and attending and hearing me talk. I'll be up here to answer any

532
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,124
other questions you have. Thank you.
